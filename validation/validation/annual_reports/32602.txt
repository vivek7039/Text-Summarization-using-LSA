2 Saga aims to deliver consistent long-term earnings 
growth with the right balance between investing  
for growth, paying down debt and returns  
to shareholders via dividends
How we are different
Saga focuses on the over 50s, the 
fastest growing demographic in the 
UK. This demographic tends to be 
wealthier and more resilient during 
times of economic uncertainty. Our 
customer insight allows us to gain 
unique insight into the traits of  
our target demographic, helping us  
to develop products and services  
that we know will be valuable to our 
customers. We operate across sectors 
which provide services that people  
need. This means that demand for  
our products and services remains 
consistent amongst a customer  
base that predominantly spends  
unearned income.
The model works
The Group has an excellent track 
record of delivering consistent earnings 
growth. The capital efficiency of the 
model means that we are highly cash 
generative. This enables us to invest for 
future growth, whilst continuing to pay 
down debt and enhance long-term 
returns to shareholders through our 
progressive dividend policy. 
Confidence in future delivery
Our existing strategy is robust. The 
in-depth work we have undertaken  
to deepen our understanding of our 
customers has provided the logical  
next step in the evolution of our model. 
We are now in a position to use our 
enhanced insight and data capability 
through a membership structure to 
become a more efficient organisation, 
ensuring that we:
• retain and deepen our customer 
relationships;
• increase new customer targeting; and
• generate increased profits at lower 
risk, with lower capital.
This strategic evolution increases our 
confidence in our ability to generate 
consistent long-term earnings growth 
on a sustainable basis.
Saga as an investment
Why invest in us?
...to deliver profit and dividend  
growth, strong cash generation  
and sustainable shareholder return.

Chairman’s statement
Our focus on customer needs  
has been the driving force behind  
the growth of the business. They 
remain at the heart of everything  
we do.
Evolution of the strategy and  
further financial delivery leading  
to enhanced shareholder returns
I am delighted to present another strong 
set of results.
We have continued to deliver on our 
progressive dividend policy this year, 
increasing our dividend by 18.1% to 8.5p. 
This equates to a payout ratio of 62%
1
 of 
net earnings, compared to 57%
2
 in the 
previous year. Last year, we increased 
our target payout range from 40%-60%, 
to 50%-70% as a sign of our confidence 
that we will continue to deliver strong 
financial performance. This year’s 
decision to increase the dividend  
again reflects the Board’s ongoing 
confidence in the sustainability of our 
dividend policy, which is supported by  
a strong track record of profit growth 
and cash generation through our  
capital efficient model.
Financially, we have again delivered 
growth in underlying profit before tax  
of 5.6% to £187.4m and basic earnings 
per share by 6.0% to 14.1p. Furthermore, 
we have continued to be highly cash 
generative, resulting in a further 
deleveraging such that our net debt to 
EBITDA ratio has reduced to 1.9 times.
Our focus on customer need has been 
the driving force behind the growth of  
the business. Our customers remain at 
the heart of everything we do and it is  
a great credit to the Company that so 
many continue to support us through 
sustained ownership of our shares.  
The management team has done a lot  
of work throughout the year to deepen 
our understanding of our customers. 
This is helping us to interact differently 
and more efficiently with both existing 
and prospective customers.

4 Our governance supports 
our strategic priorities
Our governance structure is now 
embedded within the Group to  
support growth.
• Our processes ensure good 
stewardship as we invest for future 
growth, whilst continuing to pay 
down debt and enhance long-term 
returns to shareholders through our 
progressive dividend policy.
• All resolutions proposed at our AGM 
were passed with a significant 
majority and all directors standing for 
re-election or election were 
appointed.
• We comply with the Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the ‘Code’) 
recommendation that half of 
the Board are independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
• We conducted our first externally 
facilitated Board and Committee 
evaluation exercise and agreed  
action plans to focus on areas  
of development.

Governance highlights
I would like to thank all of our 
shareholders, both institutional and  
retail, for their ongoing support and to 
welcome those who have joined us 
during the year, including the many new 
institutional investors on our register. 
I would also like to thank our employees. 
Their dedication to customer care and 
innovation enable us to deliver the 
exacting standards our customers  
value so highly.
The Saga Board is a strong group of 
individuals who have brought relevant 
and valuable experience and skills to 
bear in shaping Saga’s thinking and 
strategy. We continue to be confident  
in Saga’s ability to deliver long-term 
sustainable returns for our shareholders 
by delivering consistent profitable growth 
with a capital efficient model.
Our Group Chief Executive, Lance 
Batchelor, continues to effectively  
deliver on the execution of our strategy. 
Lance leads a strong Executive Team 
which comprises a mix of new hires  
and established staff. Their energy, 
commitment and focus on key strategic 
deliverables throughout the year have 
had a marked impact on our results.

Group Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review
Our performance has continued 
to prove the strength of the Saga 
business model, which builds  
multi-decade relationships with 
our target demographic through 
a range of excellent products 
and services.
I am very pleased that we have again 
delivered consistent profit growth in line 
with our stated targets. We have 
achieved this alongside some important 
strategic developments, particularly the 
work we have done to enhance our 
understanding of our customers and to 
develop our vision for building future 
value by improving our customers’ 
experience. 
Same clear strategy
We have continued to deliver on the  
clear strategy for sustainable earnings 
growth that we laid out in early 2015. 
This strategy has remained consistent 
and is focused on:
1. Becoming increasingly customer-
centric.
2. Growing profits in our insurance  
and travel businesses.
3. Investing for future growth.
4. Maintaining our efficient  
operating model.
5. Developing our people.
Customer work
Our growing understanding of our 
customers has provided us with a unique 
opportunity to use our rich proprietary 
data to interact with them more efficiently 
to better understand what they want, 
and to deliver it right across the 
business. We are also able to identify 
customers who are more likely to have 
an affinity with the brand over time, and 
to use our marketing resources more 
effectively by targeting and rewarding 
those customers who are, or have  
the propensity to be higher-affinity 
customers (‘HAC’). 
1 Profit before tax excluding derivatives 
and Ogden impact.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
6 Through this work, we have identified 
a core group of c.500k HACs that form 
around 20% of our customer base, 
and have contributed around 80% of 
customer value over the last three  
years. This group has the following  
key characteristics, all of which deliver 
greater lifetime value to Saga. They:
• buy premium versions of what we sell;
• have higher retention levels; and
• have a higher propensity to buy 
multiple products across the Group, 
holding an average of 2.1 core 
products each. 
We now fully understand the journeys  
by which these customers have 
developed a high affinity for Saga and 
the reasons why certain customers have 
not. This means that we are now in a 
position to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of our direct marketing 
model to better identify and target 
existing or potential HACs.
Historically, we have managed a highly 
effective product marketing approach, 
evidenced by industry leading customer 
acquisition costs in insurance. This 
marketing was based on average 
returns. By looking at it from the 
viewpoint of customer affinity, rather than 
by value of product, we can significantly 
refine this model to increase efficiency.  
Just as importantly, we have been able 
to identify customers who have an 
affinity with the brand but who currently 
have neither the long tenure nor multiple 
product holdings. By considering their 
purchasing propensities, we can ensure 
that we approach and market to them  
in a way that optimises the likelihood of 
them developing an affinity with Saga. 
So, 
what’s 
next?
Strategic priorities for the coming year 
In order to continue to deliver the  
consistent financial performance that  
we have demonstrated as a public  
company, and ensure future long-term  
value for shareholders, our strategic  
priorities for the coming year are:
1
  Becoming increasingly  
customer-centric

7 Strategic report
Group Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review continued
We have made a key improvement to  
our systems capability which will enable 
us to do this. In our core insurance  
and travel businesses, we have two 
excellent acquisition machines, whose 
demographic focus means we are 
constantly ‘touching’ current and new, 
potentially high-affinity, customers.  
The improved capability enables us to 
monitor in real time what customers are 
doing and, just as importantly, what they 
have done while journeying through any 
of our systems, both online and through 
our call centres. It will also enable us to 
automatically offer the customer the right 
product based on their history and their 
propensity to buy.
Membership
Saga’s brand is synonymous with life 
after 50 in the UK. Thanks to the 
consistent delivery of tailored products, 
underpinned by exceptional service over 
many decades, customers often refer  
to being ‘Saga members’ without ever 
having run an official membership scheme. 
Utilising the customer work we will create  
a membership scheme that rewards and 
incentivises our customers to both stay 
with Saga and deepen their relationship 
with us. The scheme, which will launch 
in the second half of the year, is open to 
all existing Saga customers and will be 
named “Saga Possibilities”. Its mission 
statement is to: “Help you, our members, 
get more out of Saga and do more of the 
things that matter most to you”.
Saga Possibilities will be structured 
around four key components:
• Experiences: provide members with a 
constant stream of inspiring products 
and experiences they can try.
• Expertise: the go-to place for the over 
50s for subject matter and expertise, 
providing information, inspiration and 
insight on topics that matter most.
• Everyday: to make the little things  
in life more enjoyable, easier and 
better value.
• Enhanced Saga products: every 
product and service that Saga sells 
will have extra enhancements for  
our members.
We believe that the combination of  
our increasing customer insight, data 
capability and membership will be 
extremely powerful, helping us to focus 
our efforts on rewarding, retaining and 
growing our target customer base and 
deepening our relationship with them. 
Our goal is therefore to grow the number 
of products held by HACs by 20% over 
the next 5 years.
Conclusion – the Saga  
investment case
With a clear strategy in place to continue 
to drive profit growth through the core 
businesses and enhance the value of our 
most loyal customers, we have made a 
positive start to the current year, and  
I would like to touch again on the key 
takeaways that make Saga a strong 
investment case:
How we are different:
• Our focus on an older and growing 
demographic
• Our strong customer relationships  
and brand loyalty leads to better 
customer acquisition and retention
• Multiple businesses with tailored, 
differentiated offerings means the 
business is less exposed and 
carries less risk
The model works
• We have consistently delivered steady 
earnings growth over time
• We have demonstrated another year of 
strong earnings growth and cashflow 
Confidence in future delivery
Our existing strategy is robust. The 
in-depth work we have undertaken to 
better understand our customers has 
provided the logical next step in the 
evolution of our model. We are now in  
a position to use our enhanced insight, 
data capability and membership  
scheme to become a more efficient 
organisation, ensuring:
• We retain and deepen our customer 
relationships with:
 – increased persistency
 – better cross-sell 
 – low acquisition costs
• We improve new customer targeting 
through more efficient acquisition spend
• We generate increased profits at lower 
risk, with lower capital through higher 
quality of earnings.
We are seeing the benefits of this work in 
our current business performance. These 
early signs of successful implementation 
have increased our confidence that we can 
continue to leverage Saga’s differentiated 
model to drive increased customer 
engagement and loyalty. This gives us 
further confidence to deliver consistent, 
sustainable earnings growth through 
increased efficiency and customer value 
across the business.

Our business model
How we do it
Delivered through the Saga Model
Underpinned by our flexible capital efficient model
We look to develop and enhance strong 
relationships with our customers over the 
course of many years. By doing this  
we gain a unique insight into the traits  
of our target demographic, helping us to 
develop products and services that we 
know will be valuable to our customers, 
and helping them do more after 50. 
We then either develop our offering 
in-house, or use a third party supplier. 
In order to choose the most effective 
method, we consider several factors, 
including: the route that would benefit  
the customer most; whether our internal 
expertise is required or if a third party  
is better positioned to deliver; and the 
optimal deployment of our capital.
We work across a large number of 
sectors, so if we do choose to use a third 
party, it is because we believe that their 
ability to operate in that particular area  
is best in class. When this is the case, 
we design and develop the product to 
our specifications, and the third party 
provides it.
This is the most common approach  
we take. Selecting and managing  
our supplier base is a core skill of  
the Group. We work with them to 
ensure that the customer gets what 
they want, underpinned by excellent 
customer service. 
When we produce products in-house, it 
is because we believe that we are best 
placed to offer the value and levels of 
service that our customers expect. 
This is especially apparent when 
considering our cruise business.
Whether produced in-house or by a third party, all of our products and services  
are delivered through the Saga Model, the defining aspects of which are:
1.  A great brand We have a truly unique brand that is highly trusted and recognised by over 97% of the UK’s over 50s. 
This allows us to provide products that offer exceptional levels of service, across multiple categories, 
at a fair price.
2 .  D i f f e r e n tia t e d 
products
Our ability to listen to our customers, analyse their behaviour and tailor our offering accordingly,  
means that we are able to offer products, services and added benefits that we know our customers  
want in order to help them enjoy life after 50.
3.  Unique route 
to market
As a data driven business, direct access to our existing and potential customers means we can analyse 
and access both current and new customers across multiple channels.
4 .  O u t s t a n d i n g 
service
We compete across multiple sectors, and after buying products for many decades, our customers 
know what good service looks like. They expect this from us, and recognise it when they get it.
The nature of our multi-
business model provides 
us with great flexibility, 
and has allowed us to 
build a strong track record 
of resilience and growth.
The strength of our brand and our ability 
to select the best providers, allow us to 
develop new products and enter new 
markets very quickly, often with very little 
capital at risk.
We operate two different core 
businesses, travel and insurance, that 
run eight different principal product lines, 
and this breadth of offering helps to 
shield us against product specific risks. 
This allows us to focus management 
time and capital on the areas of the 
business with the most potential  
for growth.
This approach means we are highly  
cash generative. The majority of our 
profit after tax turns into cash, allowing 
us the flexibility to continue to invest for 
growth, whilst also paying down debt 
and enhancing long-term returns to 
shareholders via a progressive  
dividend policy.

Strategic report
Our target market overview
Saga is the UK’s leading provider of 
products and services tailored to the 
needs of the over 50s. This segment  
of the population is the fastest growing, 
most affluent and influential demographic 
in the UK. It accounts for 75% of the 
UK’s household wealth and 50% of the 
UK’s household expenditure. Needs are 
increasingly changing as the demographic 
as a whole continues to work longer and 
lead more active lives. 
As part of our in-depth work on enhancing 
our customer knowledge and making 
our database work more efficiently for 
us, our knowledge of whom the Saga 
brand plays best with within our wider 
target market is improving significantly. 
The target customer for the Saga  
brand is predominantly within four very 
specific mosaic classifications whose 
characteristics are: over 60s; within 
ABC1 households; and having above 
average acquired assets. Our ability to 
map digitally their interactions with us 
and track what they do and don’t like, 
has led to a more efficient customer 
acquisition strategy, allowing us to tailor 
our approach in order to continue to 
delight our customer.
Macro conditions
While macro events out of our control 
always have the potential to create a 
headwind, our target customers tend to 
be more resilient during times of economic 
uncertainty. In many instances, they  
live off pensions, savings and pools of 
acquired assets. This reliable stream  
of unearned income is a notable 
characteristic of ABC1 households.
Additional factors which enhance the 
economic stability of this group include:
• low levels of debt;
• fewer fixed costs; and
• members at the bottom end of the 
demographic benefiting from 
inheritance from the top end.
While the macroeconomic cycle will 
impact the underlying performance of 
our wider business, each of our core 
businesses of insurance and travel  
have different sector specific cycles. 
There is potential for customer 
behavioural changes depending on  
the stage of each cycle but, given the 
strengths of our demographic, we tend 
to see this to a lesser extent compared 
with other market participants. Also,  
as Saga operates different businesses 
across different sectors, this helps 
provide against a downturn in a 
particular sector. If, for example, the 
motor insurance market became 
subdued, we would be able to focus on 
our cruise and travel businesses as well 
as other insurance lines, such as travel, 
home and PMI.
Our travel business also benefits from 
comparatively strong resilience. Indeed, 
following the EU referendum vote, fewer 
than 1% of our customers said they 
would reconsider their future holiday 
plans, and our new ship has generated 
nearly 10,000 pre-registrations for its 
initial cruises.
Regulatory and political change
The over 50s are the most politically 
engaged demographic in the UK, and 
are therefore highly politically influential. 
For example, polling amongst our 
customer base gave us advanced 
visibility of the likely success of the 
Brexit vote when the professional polling 
companies were still indicating a win for 
the Remain vote. Our insight into the 
most important issues for our customers 
is extremely valuable, and we aim to 
create products and services that either 
take advantage of, or protect against, 
regulatory change. We also engage on 
these issues on their behalf when 
appropriate to do so.
Saga as a regulated business
Saga operates across a number of 
regulated sectors, notably within our 
financial services and travel businesses. 
Regulation in these sectors continues  
to evolve constantly and we are experts 
in maintaining good communication with 
our regulatory bodies in order to ensure 
that we are always in a position to adapt 
quickly to any changes that could  
impact our operations. Given our  
target demographic, we often work with 
vulnerable customers. Our focus on our 
customers means that we are able to 
recognise that some may need more 
attention than others and we run 
dedicated teams throughout our 
business to ensure that vulnerable 
customers are identified and given  
a helping hand.
The competition for customers
As we operate across a number of 
sectors, we compete with many providers 
in those markets. While our brand as the 
over 50s specialist in the UK is particularly 
strong, we do not have a monopoly on 
our customers. We do, however, have 
the advantage of focusing on this 
demographic, which means everything 
we do can be tailored to the specific 
needs that are characteristic of our 
customer base. This gives us a 
competitive advantage against peers 
who offer their products to all age ranges.
We are well positioned to serve  
a growing demographic

The customer work we have 
completed has given us both 
enhanced insight into customer 
behaviours, and the ability to utilise 
that knowledge to offer our customers 
more of the products they want, in the 
right way and at the right time. 
Membership
Saga’s brand is synonymous with 
life after 50 in the UK. Thanks  
to consistently delivering tailored 
products underpinned by exceptional 
service over many decades, customers 
often refer to being ‘Saga members’ 
without us ever having run an official 
membership scheme. 
Utilising the customer work we will  
create a platform through which to 
reward and incentivise our customers 
to both stay with Saga and deepen their 
relationship with us, we will launch a 
Saga membership programme in the 
second half of this year. The scheme is 
open to all existing Saga customers and 
will be named “Saga Possibilities” and  
its mission statement is to “Help you,  
our members, get more out of Saga and 
do more of the things that matter most  
to you”.
Saga Possibilities will be structured 
around four key components:
• Experiences: provide members with a 
constant stream of inspiring products 
and experiences they can try.
• Expertise: the go-to place for the  
over 50s for subject matter expertise, 
providing information, inspiration, and 
expertise on topics that matter most.

Healthcare and Retirement Villages. 
We are continuing to invest in the 
development of our current employees, 
and to hire new talent where needed.  
We continue to instil the customer-centric 
culture that makes Saga different.
The ‘Leading the Saga Way’ Leadership 
Development Programme will be rolled out 
to the top 400 leaders across Saga.
We will continue to focus on running the 
business in the most efficient way possible 
by growing earnings organically and 
continuing to carefully assess capital 
allocation. This will lead to a higher quality 
of earnings over time.
Additional efficiency savings will be 
delivered through investment in the new 
retail insurance system and a claims 
handling system, together with Group  
wide procurement projects.
Our drive to improve the customer 
experience and efficiency of our 
insurance operations through the 
modernisation of our insurance sales 
and administration platform continues. 
The system will enable us to increase 
product differentiation within the 
insurance business, as well as provide 
our broking service more efficiently.  
We also expect to roll out our new 
claims platform this year.

Our resources and relationships
People, culture and community
Saga people are core to our brand.  
We recognise that their energy, passion, 
and customer advocacy drives Saga’s 
success, and we’re incredibly proud of 
their ability and creativity. This year we’ve 
continued to invest heavily in our people, 
and focused key activities to embed The 
Saga Way further. It encourages our 
people to be brave and challenge, strive 
to deliver exceptional service to our 
customers, whilst creating a purpose 
and belonging to what we call The 
Saga Family. 
We recognise the benefit of having highly 
energised and engaged employees who 
have shared values and believe in our 
products and services. We are delighted 
that 2016 was another solid year for 
employee engagement. Our annual 
engagement survey produced the 
highest level of employee participation: 
81% of our employees responded to our 
survey and we maintained a sustainable 
engagement score of 81%, which 
was very encouraging. We continue 
to consistently out-perform the UK 
national norm. 
We’ve continued to improve our 
employee value proposition providing 
our people with clear reward and career 
structures, with commitments from us 
that support them to grow with Saga, 
and enable us to attract high quality 
talent into our business. 
We support people who want to learn. 
That’s why in 2016 we developed our  
in-house learning and development 
calendar to maximise the learning 
opportunities at Saga. We’ve also  
spent 2016 investing in our leadership 
and management capabilities by 
introducing a development course, 
‘Leading the Saga Way’, that’s focused 
on embedding a high-performing and 
high-support culture in our organisation. 
Our top 100 leaders are working through 
this programme and we will soon be 
extending it to our 400 senior leaders. 
Building strength across our leadership 
team is essential for us to sustain our 
high levels of employee engagement  
and drive short and long-term business 
performance. 
We’re passionate about our people’s 
progression at Saga, so we’ve continued 
to review talent at all levels every six 
months. We have also extended our 
succession pipeline to five to seven 
years to identify our rising stars, as 
well as training our managers to have 
honest career conversations, and set 
stretch objectives that support our 
employees’ ambitions. We recognise  
that mobilising talent across Saga is 
essential in deepening our connection 
to our customers, innovating our 
products and services, and retaining 
talent within our business.
Celebrating success and rewarding 
exceptional performance is part of our 
culture, and our reward commitments 
underpin this. 
We are committed to:
• making our rewards simple and easy 
to understand;
• rewarding great performance;
• being competitive and fair;
• creating flexible reward structures  
for all of the Saga family;
• making our rewards work for the  
long-term; and
• sharing our success.
We balance the need to attract and 
retain high quality talent essential to  
the Company’s success with the need  
to manage costs, ensure we remain 
competitive and fair, and recognise 
exceptional performance. Close alignment 
of our people with our business is really 
important to us. That’s why we have 
again awarded £300 worth of shares  
to our people so they can share in 
our success and are aligned with our 
business strategy. Our plan is to do 
this every year.

16 Diversity and having an employee 
base that brings different perspectives, 
backgrounds and ways of thinking is very 
important to our business. Our policy is 
that full and fair consideration is given 
to applications for employment by all 
applicants, including those with disabilities, 
and for continuing the employment of 
employees who become disabled during 
employment. We are committed to treating 
all employees fairly and offering equal 
opportunities in all aspects of employment 
and advancement.
It’s really important to us that our people 
speak up, get heard and we take action 
when necessary. That’s why we’ve 
created channels that support two-way 
communication to understand what’s 
working in Saga, and how we can 
continue to improve our business for 
both our customers and people. We’ve 
made great strides in 2016 to develop 
our internal communication plans so that 
we encourage the development of a 
‘One Saga’ culture, whilst helping our 
people understand our strategic 
objectives and how they fit with them. 
Our goal is to be the best employer in  
the South East and everywhere that we 
operate and we continue to have strong 
leadership commitment with a clear plan 
to deliver this. 
Community and Social
We’re proud to give something back. 
Saga is a major employer in Thanet, 
Folkestone, Hastings and Redhill.  
We recognise our responsibilities to  
the communities from which we draw 
potential recruits and also aim to be  
a good neighbour to local residents. 
After seeking the opinion of many Saga 
customers and employees, we are proud 
that The Silver Line is Saga’s first ever 
national charity partner. This is a great  
fit with our ethos as, like The Silver Line, 
making the lives of people better is at  
the heart of what we are here to do. 
We make a real commitment to give 
back to the communities in which we 
live and work. In 2016 we supported a 
variety of local charities through allowing 
them to use our Pavilion at Saga’s HQ 
– groups supported include the Cub 
Scouts which were celebrating their 
100th anniversary. Titan Travel’s local 
charity near Redhill was the Golden  
Lion Children’s Trust; Destinology  
raised funds for The Bolton Hospice; 
and, Bennett’s local charity has been 
Myton Hospice in Coventry. We have  
set up charity representatives at each 
site to help us coordinate activities  
and we have also introduced company  
matched funding to encourage people  
to participate. 
During the year our contact centres were 
used for Children in Need and Sports 
Relief and the phones were manned by 
volunteers from across the business.
As a signatory to the Corporate 
Covenant we have polices that support 
employees who are members of the 
reserve forces or are spouses of those 
serving in our armed services. We also 
support local army, air and sea cadets 
and hold an annual Armed Forces day 
BBQ that raises money for: Royal British 
Legion; The Soldiers Sailors and 
Airmen’s Families Association; Help for 
Heroes; and, Royal Navy and Royal 
Marines Charity. 
The Saga Respite for Carers Trust has 
paid for respite care and provided 
holidays for 28 carers and their 
companions during the year.
This year the Saga Charitable Trust  
has provided 14 grants totalling over 
£200,000. Projects included courses 
for unschooled girls in India, the 
construction of a 12 bed children’s 
home in Malawi and a farmer training 
programme in Peru.
Saga also has an important social 
commentary and campaigning aspect to 
the brand and we have spoken up on a 
number of issues that affect the nation’s 
over 50s – GP waiting times, Stamp Duty 
exemptions for downsizing, employment 
of older people, pension changes, age 
discrimination and the social care crisis 
to name but a few.
We have also produced reports on 
topics including over 50s travel spend 
and the changing face of travel for those 
in retirement, and the future of pensions. 
Saga is strictly non-party political but  
we do survey over 50s opinions of 
political topics. Our polling prior to the 
EU Referendum correctly predicted the 
outcome (52% vs 48%). Our polls also 
show that over 50s remain confident in 
the future and the Referendum did not 
dent their passion for travel.
Our insight is aided by the Saga Populus 
Panel – the largest poll of over 50s 
opinion. Since its inception in 2007,  
1.3 million respondents have provided  
24 million answers to a range of  
topical questions. 
Human rights
Saga conducts business in an ethical 
and transparent way. Policies to support 
recognised human rights principles 
include those on non-discrimination, 
health and safety and environmental 
issues. Saga has a zero tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption.
“Working for a busy, customer focused 
company is a pleasure, and there 
seems to be a real effort to give 
something back to the employees 
these days, which is very refreshing 
and exciting.”
“There is a deep respect amongst 
employees for Saga’s customers – 
which has found a new voice in the 
Saga Way.”
“I think the open opportunities available 
for those individuals who want to 
develop and progress are outstanding.”
“What’s the best thing about working 
here? The people, my colleagues.”
Employee engagement
We focused on improving Talent 
Management, Culture and Reward  
& Benefits in our Group Employee 
Engagement Action Plan. We have 
worked very hard and are incredibly 
proud of everything that we have 
achieved so far.

Our resources and relationships continued
The Group is committed to transparency 
within our supply chain. We have carried 
out risk assessments and conducted 
due diligence on our material suppliers, 
full details of which will be included 
within our annual statement which will  
be published as stipulated under the UK 
Modern Slavery Act 2015. This statement 
will summarise our actions to address 
the risk of modern slavery and human 
trafficking within our own operations  
and those of our suppliers. 
Health and safety
Saga is committed to protecting the 
health, safety and welfare of employees, 
customers and anyone affected by  
our operations. We have a positive  
health and safety culture and seek  
to improve continuously health and 
safety performance.
We meet our obligations through 
the development and implementation 
of suitable policies and procedures. 
Beyond this, everyone in Saga has a 
personal responsibility for health and 
safety and for performing the activities 
they undertake in a safe manner  
and this is regularly communicated.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
This section of the annual report has 
been prepared in accordance with our 
regulatory obligation as a listed company 
to report greenhouse gas emissions 
(‘GHG’) pursuant to Section 7 of The 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. 
During the 2016/17 financial year, the 
Group emitted a total of 106,294 tCO
2
e 
from fuel combustion (Scope 1 direct) 
and electricity purchased for our own 
use (Scope 2 indirect). This is equivalent 
to 89.9 tCO
2
e per £m customer sales. 
We have also chosen to voluntarily report 
Scope 3 emissions arising from our 
business travel, which contribute 425 
tCO

Notes:
1 2015/16 Scope 1 emissions have been restated, following a review of fugitive gas emissions; 
emissions factors have been identified for all gases that have a global warming potential. 
2 Emissions from the consumption of electricity outside the UK and emissions from purchased 
electricity calculated using the market-based approach using supplier specific mission factors  
are reported in tCO
2
 rather than tCO
2
e due to the availability of emission factors.
Methodology
We quantify and report our 
organisational GHG emissions in 
alignment with the GHG Protocol, which 
includes alignment with the Scope 2 
Guidance (reporting Scope 2 purchased 
electricity using both the location-based 
and the market-based methodology). 
The UK Government 2016 Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting have 
been utilised in order to calculate Scope 
1, Scope 2 (location-based) and Scope 3 
emissions from corresponding activity 
data. IEA emissions factors have been 
used for the conversion of consumption 
from Bel Jou in St Lucia for the period 
that it was under control of Saga plc. 
Supplier-specific emissions factors  
have been applied for the calculation  
of Scope 2 market-based emissions, 
where available. 
Emissions factors have been sourced 
from the US Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) for refrigerant gases that 
do not have an emissions factor in the 
UK Government database to ensure that 
all gases that have a global warming 
potential are accounted for. 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
18 Reporting boundaries 
and limitations
We consolidate our organisational 
boundary according to the operational 
control approach and have adopted a 
materiality threshold of 5% for GHG 
reporting purposes. 
The GHG sources that constitute our 
operational boundary for the 2016/17 
reporting period are: 
• Scope 1: Natural gas combustion 
within boilers, marine fuel combustion 
within ships, road fuel combustion 
within vehicles, fuel combustion  
within non-road mobile machinery  
and fugitive refrigerants from  
air-conditioning equipment 
• Scope 2: Purchased electricity 
consumption for our own use 
• Scope 3: Business travel from  
grey fleet. 
Diesel used in non-road machinery was 
previously not reported due to lack of 
data availability, but is now recorded and 
will be reported from 2016/17 onwards. 
Scope 3 business travel emissions from 
rail and air have been identified, but not 
included in our disclosure due to a lack 
of accurate data. 
Assumptions and estimations
During this reporting year the Bel Jou 
hotel in St Lucia was sold on 20 July 
2016. No data was available for Bel Jou’s 
operations in 2016/17 due to the change 
in ownership. The emissions for the 
period of the year in which Bel Jou was 
part of the Group have been estimated 
using data from 2015. 
In some cases, where data is missing, 
values have been estimated using either 
an extrapolation of available data from 
the reporting period or data from 2015 
as a proxy. 
Energy procurement decisions 
The following graph shows the Group’s 
Scope 2 emissions from purchased 
electricity, which have been calculated 
using both the location-based and the 
market-based methodologies.
Saga purchases electricity for the 
majority of its buildings from a 100% 
renewable supply from Haven Power. 
The remainder of the UK electricity is 
supplied by SSE, which has a cleaner  
fuel mix than the UK average. The dual 
reporting of our emissions in this way 
demonstrates the impact that selecting 
these suppliers has on our GHG 
emissions, and that we are making 
efforts to reduce our climate impact 
through the purchase of electricity 
generated from cleaner sources. 
Improving performance 
Saga actively monitors and manages  
its carbon impact. Our shipping business 
has seen a reduction in marine fuel 
usage by 3% through careful route 
planning; there have however been 
unforeseen leakages in refrigerant  
which have mitigated these reductions. 
There are reductions in fleet fuel usage 
and business mileage, and the sale of 
Allied Healthcare and the Bel Jou hotel 
have reduced electricity use by 15%.  
In our main office sites, there are 
ongoing initiatives to reduce utility  
use. These include, but are not limited  
to, a programme replacing all office 
lighting with LED, ongoing use of 
voltage optimisation in large sites, active 
management of building management 
systems to control carefully main building 
infrastructure and a capital infrastructure 
programme to replace old inefficient 
equipment with modern energy efficient 
systems. There is a continued 
Scope 2 electricity emissions by 
reporting type
use of electric vehicles in our 
maintenance fleet, and, where practical, 
active initiatives to switch off unused 
equipment. The management of our 
carbon impact has seen an improvement 
in the score calculated by the Carbon 
Disclosure Project and Saga now has  
a ‘B’ score which benchmarks well with 
comparable UK based companies. There 
is a long-term plan to further improve 
that score targeting an ‘A’ score in 
2019. Overall our Scope 1 and Scope 
2 emissions have reduced by 0.6% 
compared with last year. 
Supplier partnerships
These relationships are fundamental 
to our business model. We work very 
closely with our suppliers to deliver the 
products and services to the standard 
our customers expect.
Once we have designed and tested 
products and services, we decide how 
best to source them for our customers 
– in-house or from a third party. 
We are not a commission-based 
business. We design bespoke products 
ourselves then look for the best possible 
partners to supply them, comparing 
them for service and value. Over time we 
can move if more appropriate, or better, 
partners become available. Our partners 
work with us in this way because it is a 
mutually advantageous relationship – 
they benefit from our brand, customer 
knowledge and access to an attractive 
target market. Saga, and its customers, 
benefit from our partners’ expertise and 
resources. This also means that we 
maintain responsibility for delivery and 
continue to own the relationship with our 
customers, ensuring we can manage the 
customer experience at all times.

19 Strategic report
Our principal risks and uncertainties
Risk governance
We have agreed with the Board systems 
and processes to govern our approach 
to risk management. These systems 
specifically encompass ensuring an 
effective risk assessment and 
management system is in place; agreeing 
the principal risks and uncertainties the 
business should accept in pursuit of  
its strategic objectives and regularly 
reviewing the status of these; ensuring  
a suitable risk culture is embedded 
throughout Saga; and frequently 
assessing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk management systems, including 
essential levels of internal and external 
risk communication. Our approach and 
these processes are set out in more 
detail in the Accountability section of our 
Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 54-57 of this annual report.
We believe that enhanced sustainability 
and shareholder value will come through 
achieving the optimum balance between 
risk and reward. Our divisions face a 
range of risks and uncertainties that 
could impact their strategic objectives, 
some common to the Group as a whole 
and others unique to the particular 
business or operation. It is therefore 
imperative to have a risk management 
policy and framework capable of 
assessing and monitoring these risks 
and uncertainties individually and in 
aggregate against an agreed risk 
appetite to ensure management  
within agreed tolerances.
Risk appetite
Our risk appetite, reviewed annually, 
defines the amount and sources of  
risk which we are willing to accept in 
aggregate in pursuit of our objectives. 
We express our overall attitude to risk 
using the following dimensions:
Financial strength
We aim to maintain an appropriate buffer 
of capital resources within the Group 
and, where relevant, within our legal 
entities, to ensure that we are able to 
absorb reasonable operational variation 
and meet regulatory thresholds.
Earnings volatility
We have a low appetite for volatile  
earnings and have established limits 
representing the maximum amount of 
acceptable variation in earnings during 
our planning cycle.
Liquidity
We aim to maintain a prudent level of 
free cash and committed borrowing 
facilities so that all entities in the Group 
have rapid access to funds when needed.
Conduct
We recognise that our continued 
success depends on maintenance of our 
brand, and reputation for quality service 
with our customers. We therefore strive 
to eliminate any systemic unfair customer 
outcomes as a result of failures in the 
product, marketing, sales or service 
delivery systems and processes, or 
cultural shortcomings.
Customer growth
Our goal is to know as many of our 
target customers as possible so we 
have a low appetite for actions or events 
which lead to a low growth or reduction 
in the number of our target customer 
contacts.
We further describe our attitude towards 
the following main categories of risk that 
we encounter through carrying out  
our business:
Market risk
We seek some market risk through  
our investment activity and seek to  
earn returns commensurate with our  
risk appetite. We have limited appetite for 
foreign exchange risk, commodity price 
movements and interest rate movements 
and actively manage these to reduce risk 
where possible.
Credit risk
Our practice of working with external 
counterparties, such as intermediaries, 
risk management activity (such as 
reinsurance and hedging) and deposit 
making introduce elements of credit risk. 
We have a low appetite for credit risk but 
are prepared to accept it to some extent 
where it is necessary to achieve our 
business objectives.
Liquidity risk
Through our daily operations we are 
exposed to needs for liquidity and we 
have a low appetite for this risk. We  
will therefore accept, but actively seek  
to manage, liquidity risk to ensure a 
minimum financial buffer is maintained  
in pursuit of our objectives.
Insurance risk
We actively seek measured amounts of 
insurance risk in business lines where we 
have appropriate expertise and expect to 
be appropriately rewarded for accepting 
the risk. We will accept limited insurance 
risk for personal injury risks that we feel 
we have the expertise to underwrite  
and manage and will accept non-life 
insurance risks that we have the relevant 
expertise in.
We enter into certain reinsurance 
arrangements, including the new 
funds-withheld quota share arrangement 
with NewRe, to reduce our exposure 
to large losses and any potential 
deterioration in claims development.
Strategic risk
We operate in a dynamic business 
environment and accept that we are 
exposed to a number of strategic  
risks. We will actively seek to grow  
our business in areas which present 
sustainable growth opportunities and 
where we have demonstrable expertise. 
Mergers and acquisitions risk
We aspire to levels of business growth 
which may require us to consider merger 
and acquisition opportunities from  
time to time. Where these arise in  
areas where we have expertise we will 
consider them and establish suitable risk 
tolerances in each case.
Operational risk
We actively seek some logistical risks 
where we believe that we have expertise 
and will be rewarded for taking them.  
We have a very low appetite for risks 
which threaten our reputation and will 
only engage in regulated activities where 
we have the expertise to manage them 
effectively. We define our risk appetite for 
certain specific areas of operational risk 
as follows:
Health and safety
We have zero appetite and a low 
tolerance for health and safety risks  
and we will do all that is reasonably 
practicable to prevent personal injury 
and danger to the health of our 
employees, customers, and others  
who may be affected by our activities.

Divisional review
Retail broking
Our retail broking business provides 
tailored products and services, ranging 
from motor to pet insurance, to millions 
of customers each year. Its role is to 
develop tailored products, price them  
to the customer and then source the 
cheapest cost of risk. This is achieved 
through our panels of third party 
insurers, which operate across both our 
motor and home businesses, or through 
solus arrangements, for example in travel 
or private medical insurance. Our 
in-house underwriter, AICL, sits on both 
motor and home panels and competes 
for the business on equal terms. If 
underwritten by a third party, the product 
is manufactured as a Saga product, and 
the customer interaction will always be 
managed by us. This approach to 
sourcing underwriting gives us the 
flexibility to operate a portfolio of 
products that takes advantage of, or 
protects against, prevailing market 
conditions at any given time. Overall the 
business performed strongly, with profit 
before tax increasing by 9.1% to £138.0m 
(2016: £126.5m).
Motor broking 
We have delivered a strong improvement 
in motor broking profitability, growing 
profit before tax by 58% to £45.2m 
(2016: £28.6m). This was driven by 
a combination of improved yield 
management, improved efficiencies 
in marketing and operations and 
the benefit of the motor panel.
The introduction of the motor panel  
in summer 2015 has driven £3m of 
additional profit in the year, with  
around 30% of net premium for renewal 
policies being placed with third party 
underwriters by the end of the year. 
These policies tend to be for younger, 
higher risk drivers, meaning we are able 
to achieve a higher margin in our broking 
business without the need for holding 
capital in our underwriter.
The enhancement of our customer 
understanding is assisting in focusing 
retention and acquisition efforts on 
customers who are expected to add the 
greatest value to the Group. We have 
focused a greater marketing effort during 
the year on these core customers.
Home broking 
The UK home insurance market 
continues to be highly competitive, 
with limited evidence of premium inflation 
in the market. Despite these difficult 
conditions, we chose to maintain policy 
volumes with a small reduction in profits. 
Profit before tax decreased to £61.2m 
(2016: £63.4m).

our underwriter, participating on a no

Other broking 
Within other insurance (primarily private 
medical insurance (‘PMI’) and travel 
insurance), customer numbers have 
been stable and profit before tax was 
£31.6m (2016: £34.5m). 
PMI performed strongly with high levels 
of persistency and robust demand. As 
part of our ongoing drive to enhance  
the customer proposition, we have 
continued to improve the GP fast track 
service and have extended the GP 
helpline facility. These popular initiatives 
are not widely available, and demonstrate 
our knowledge of our customer base, 
and our expertise in delivering bespoke 
products that particularly appeal to our 
demographic. 
In travel insurance, we saw some 
weakening of demand in the latter part  
of the year, and some pressure on net 
rates, as the effects of the currency 
move worked through. The differentiated 
aspects of our travel insurance product 
range have ensured that our offering  
has remained popular with customers. 
This includes a recent add-on that 
significantly reduces the cost of car 
insurance, and access to our travel hub. 
Both our travel insurance and PMI 
products play an important role in the 
Group’s customer acquisition strategy, 
allowing us to reach high affinity 
customers with the resources and time 
both to travel and invest in their health. 
We are applying our new customer 
insight in a way that is already enhancing 
cross-sell between our insurance and 
travel businesses.
Current trading in retail broking
Given our varied retail broking product 
lines, we always experience varying 
market conditions in different 
businesses. Overall, we have seen a 
very positive start to the year on motor 
premiums, with strong upwards 
movement on new business. This is 
currently running in excess of claims 
inflation, and sets us on a strong footing 
to improve motor broking profits during 
the year. We have recently started to see 
the effects of the Ogden rate change 
being reflected in premiums across the 
market and affecting the net rates on the 
panel. However, this will take time to 
work through.
Case study: Our insight leads  
to development of our private 
medical insurance product
Cancer treatment has significantly 
advanced in recent years, and insight 
from our customers and specialist 
nurses told us that our cancer cover 
could be improved, given the rapid 
advances in modern treatment 
methods. Our customers said they 
wanted the peace of mind that the 
right treatment for their circumstances 
would be covered if the worst were  
to happen. We have therefore made  
a number of changes to our cover to 
enable us to better support customers 
undergoing treatment; these include 
removing the limits from our outpatient 
cancer treatment cover and allowing 
customers to be treated at home if  
this better suits their needs.
What this means for our customers
With no limits on outpatient cancer  
care, our customers can be assured  
that we’re there to support them through 
the most challenging times, and that 
access to treatments that provide them 
with the best chance of recovery will be 
fully covered by their insurance. Having 
treatment at home, for example 
chemotherapy being administered by 
specialist nurses in the home rather than 
in a hospital, can be less traumatic and 
more convenient for some customers  
at what is clearly a difficult time.
How this helps us deliver  
our strategy 
By seeing the world through our 
customers’ eyes, we’ve created a  
new benefit that delivers on our goal  
to develop products that are focused  
on what our customers truly need, to 
ultimately exceed their expectations, 
particularly at the most important  
times of their life.
Home has continued to be difficult, with 
limited sign of premium inflation against a 
backdrop of claims inflation. Therefore, 
we expect another tough year for this 
market, particularly given the benign 
weather conditions over the winter period.
PMI is progressing well. Concerns over 
the NHS, and its ongoing funding, are 
leading to higher levels of interest and 
quotes. We expect this to continue, but 
with demand increasing on the private 
sector, we may see the emergence of 
increasing claims frequency and inflation. 
Travel insurance demand is stable. We 
are starting to see the impact of sterling 
depreciation, which is filtering through to 
higher prices and may suppress demand 
going forward.
Overall, we remain positive on trading 
for our retail broking business for 
the coming year.

Underwriting

Insurance underwriting
AICL, our underwriter, retains its 
competitive advantage and high panel 
share of older, lower risk drivers; as  
a result, it remains a vital part of the 
Group. Its rigorous focus on these 
drivers, along with ongoing efficient 
management of claims, has led to an 
excellent underwriting result. AICL 
targets a 3% return on net premiums and 
a strong return on equity, which it has 
consistently delivered over many years. 
The excellent management of claims 
costs has also delivered a high level  
of reserve releases.  Profit before tax 
was £73.1m (2016: £84.1m), with the 
reduction due to reducing reserve 
releases and the first year of cost 
associated with our new quota share 
arrangement. 
AICL ’s high quality book has a track 
record of generating consistent earnings 
for the Group. The implementation 
of the quota share arrangement with 
NewRe, covering 75% of the downside 
risk of all motor policies written from 
1 August 2015 for accidents occuring 
from 1 February 2016, has decreased 
our ongoing capital requirements for this 
business, lowering both risk and volatility. 
This has given us further confidence that 
AICL can continue to provide a solid 
contribution to our earnings in the future. 
Reserve releases 
With our clear targeted returns within 
AICL, the net pricing provided to the 
retail broking business provides flexibility 
in pricing to customers, and retains a 
large proportion of the Group’s earnings 
within broking activities. 
We have seen a decrease in reserve 
releases from £68.0m to £63.0m 
(excluding the Ogden effect) during the 
year, and we expect the importance of 
reserve releases in Group earnings to 
decline gradually over coming years. 
Ogden discount rate change
On 27 February 2017, the government 
announced the reduction in the Ogden 
discount rate, used to value long term 
liabilities, from 2.5% to minus 0.75%. 
Within the existing reserve surplus, AICL 
had already assumed a significant 
reduction in this rate. When combined 
with the relatively low and severity of 
claims for our underwritten drivers, the 
net additional impact on the Group was 
limited to £4m.

Tour operating
We have delivered excellent earnings 
growth within our tour operating 
business, with profit before tax 
increasing by 32% to £11.5m (2016: 
£8.7m). We continue to see a shift in the 
mix of sales to longer-haul, higher-value 
products, as customers look beyond 
some of the more traditional holiday 
destinations. This demonstrates that our 
customers continue to value the security 
that products such as our river cruising 
and guided holidays offer – highly 
differentiated and tailored for the 
needs of our demographic. 
The customer focused approach is key 
here, and, based on deep customer 
insight, we have developed four thematic 
product segments that we can apply and 
then tailor to the majority of our customer 
base. These are: Go For It, Discover, 
Unwind and Stay and Explore. By 
broadening our offering within these 
categories, we are also succeeding 
in attracting younger, first time buyers 
to the brand. 
The profile of these customers tends to 
be higher value, making them a natural 
fit for cross-selling and our membership 
scheme. Combined with the optimised 
digital approach the travel business is 
taking with its online offering, this 
is providing a quality customer 
acquisition route as part of the 
Group’s wider strategy.

far have proven hugely helpful and 
informative to both product and 
proposition design, and will ensure 
that the experience remains relevant 
for customers well into the future. 
The first itineraries for the new ship will  
be going on sale later this year. We have 
already had over 10,000 customers 
register their interest in our new ship with 
over 50% securing their place on the first 
set of itineraries with payment of a deposit. 
Indeed, these 10,000 registered customers 
would equate to filling our first 12 cruises. 
Current trading
Our travel business has excellent  
visibility due to our customers’ propensity 
to book holidays far in advance. In both 
tour operating and cruising, we have 
already secured the substantial majority  
of our FY 2018 sales targets. Reservations 
for departures in FY 2018 as at 18 March 
2017 are 8% ahead of the comparable 
reservation position one year ago. As 
previously noted in our post-Brexit poll, 
less than 1% of our customers said that 
they were reconsidering their future holiday 
plans as a result of the referendum result.
Cruise capacity is 5% higher year on 
year, with the 63 days of Sapphire wet 
dock in 2016/17 being followed by two 
dry docks in 2017/18, meaning that 41 
days of trading will be given to further 
ship investment in 2017/18.
Case study: New cruising capacity 
The new ship investment has given the Cruise business  
a “once in a lifetime” opportunity. Not only are we 
designing and building a modern cruise ship with the 
obvious benefits of latest technology and expertise but 
we also have the opportunity to take a close look at our 
current customer proposition to ensure it meets the 
needs of both existing customers and the needs and 
aspirations of future customers.
As a result, from the very outset, customers have  
been central to our design and review process and  
we continue to work with a panel of both current Saga 
cruisers and non Saga cruisers to ensure we are on the 
right track. This has made us fundamentally re-think 
certain design elements, for example bar concepts, 
onboard and offshore services and indeed the variety  
of food and entertainment options required. At a more 
detailed level our customers have identified numerous 
small design details... some practical, some visual and 
some just plain common sense. Internally we refer  
to these as our “100 small design details, whilst 
individually not significant, altogether make a huge 
design statement”. 
Our belief is that this process of continuous customer 
input will create not only one of the most elegant and 
sophisticated cruise ships afloat but also one of the  
most practical and well thought out.

Group Chief Financial Officer’s review
The strong set of results 
continues to demonstrate  
our ability to grow earnings 
and increase dividends 
whilst reducing our leverage.
I am pleased to report that the Group has delivered another strong financial performance, with profit before tax from continuing 
operations 9.7% higher at £193.3m. Excluding derivatives and the one-off impact of Ogden rate change, profit before tax 
increased by 5.6%. Strong cash flows have enabled us to further deleverage to 1.9x from 2.3x at the start of the year, with net 
debt reducing from £547.7m to £464.8m. Based on these results and our positive expectations for the business, we are proposing 
to increase our final dividend to 5.8p, leading to growth in the full year dividend of 18.1% to 8.5p per share.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
30 Revenue from continuing operations decreased by 9.5% to £871.3m (2016: £963.2m), due to the accounting for the new funds-
withheld quota share agreement in motor insurance. Our total customer spend with Saga increased by 4.7% to £1,182m 
(2016: £1,129m), which includes gross written premiums and insurance premium tax for all insurance policies sold.
Trading EBITDA grew by 3.1% to £246.1m (2016: £238.8m), with the current period incurring a profit impact of approximately £5m 
from the scheduled Saga Sapphire maintenance. Trading Profit increased by 0.9% to £213.0m (2016: £211.0m), with depreciation 
and amortisation increasing by £5.3m due to investment in the ongoing maintenance of both ships and in software. Now that the 
impact of IPO expenses seen in previous years has diminished, and the amortisation of intangibles acquired with the Destinology 
and Bennetts businesses has reached a steady state, profit before tax has replaced Trading Profit as the Group’s key 
performance measure.
Profit before tax, excluding derivatives and the Ogden rate change impact, increased by 5.6% to £187.4m (2016: £177.4m), 
benefiting from a decrease in finance costs of £6.8m as a result of high levels of cash generation enabling continued  
deleveraging and a reduction in LIBOR, coupled with a £1.4m reduction in non-trading costs.
Profit before tax from continuing operations for the year was £193.3m, an increase of 9.7%, which was further impacted by  
gains on derivative instruments that do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges for accounting purposes, and a £4.0m profit 
impact from the change in the Ogden discount rate from 2.5% to -0.75% that was announced by the UK Government on  
27 February 2017.
Net finance costs
Finance costs in the year were £17.2m (2016: £24.0m), with the reduction due to lower interest costs on lower average borrowings, 
a lower charge associated with the pension scheme and the ending of the charge associated with the unwinding of the discount 
on the deferred consideration associated with Destinology.
Tax expense
The Group’s tax expense for the year was £36.0m (2016: £28.1m) representing a tax effective rate of 18.6% (2016: 15.9%).  
The current year benefited from a £2.7m one-off positive impact from the utilisation under group relief rules of tax losses brought 
forward from the Allied business that was disposed of on 1 December 2015. The prior year benefited from a £7.6m one-off 
reduction in the tax expense due to the utilisation under group relief rules of tax losses from Acromas, which arose when Saga 
was a part of the Acromas Group. Going forward the tax charge is likely to be more in line with the underlying corporation tax rate.
Earnings per share
The Group’s basic earnings per share were 14.1p (2016: 12.7p), with basic earnings per share from continuing operations for the 
same period of 14.1p (2016: 13.3p).
Dividends
The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 5.8p per share, which, combined with the interim dividend of 2.7p per share, will 
deliver a total dividend for the financial year ending 31 January 2017 of 8.5p per share (2016: 7.2p). This equates to a payout ratio 
of 62%
2
 compared with the Group’s basic earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding derivatives and the Ogden 
rate impact (2016: 57% excluding the one-off benefit of Acromas tax losses).
Saga offers a share alternative in the form of a dividend re-investment plan (“DRIP”) for those shareholders who wish to elect to 
use their dividend payments to purchase additional Shares in the Group, rather than receive a cash payment. The last date for 
shareholders to elect to participate in the DRIP will be 5 June 2017.

Cash flow and liquidity
The Group delivered an excellent cash flow performance in the year to 31 January 2017, achieving an available operating cash 
flow of £217.6m, 88.4% of Trading EBITDA. This cash flow increased by £39.5m on the previous period, driven by a higher payout 
from AICL as a result of the historical, strong underlying solvency capital position and the initial impact of the quota share on 
solvency capital. The working capital outflow in the current year included the payment to Acromas for tax losses recognised 
in the prior year.

Financing
Continued strong cash flows have enabled the Group to reduce its ratio of net debt to Trading EBITDA to 1.9 from 2.3. As at  
31 January 2017, net debt was £464.8m, comprising £380.0m of gross debt and £100.0m of drawn revolving credit facility, offset 
by £15.2m of available cash. This compared with net debt as at 31 January 2016 of £547.7m, comprising £480.0m of gross debt 
and £75.0m of drawn revolving credit facility, offset by £7.3m of available cash.
It is the Group's intention to maintain a debt ratio of between 1.5 and 2.0 up to the delivery of the first ship expected in mid-2019. 
The Group is on track to reduce its debt to the lower end of this range before any debt associated with the ship is drawn down.
Pensions
Over the year, the valuation of the Group’s pension scheme has strengthened on an IAS19R basis by £5.1m to a deficit of £13.7m 
(January 2016: deficit £18.8m).

The strengthening has been driven by a £58.2m increase in the fair value of the scheme assets to £276.8m (January 2016: 
£218.6m). This was offset by an increase in the scheme liabilities of £53.1m to £290.5m (January 2016: £237.4m), driven  
by a fall in corporate bond yields over the period and an increase in the expectation of the future rate of inflation.

32 Net assets
Since 31 January 2016, total assets and liabilities have reduced by £53.3m and £160.3m respectively, increasing overall net 
assets by £107.0m.
Total assets have reduced primarily as a result of a decrease in financial assets of £44.4m, which coincides with the release  
of surplus solvency capital from the Group’s underwriting business.
The reduction in total liabilities reflects a £90.7m reduction in financial liabilities following the repayment of debt during the  
period, enabled through continued positive cash generation and the release of surplus solvency capital. This was coupled with  
an associated £61.0m reduction in gross insurance contract liabilities in line with further positive claims experience throughout  
the year, and a reduction in trade and other payables of £9.1m reflecting a reduction in accruals for costs relating to the build  
of the new ship and non-trading costs that were paid during the year.

Total revenue for the insurance businesses decreased by 19.6% to £410.0m (2016: £510.1m), due to the accounting for the quota 
share agreement in motor insurance, which required £110.5m of earned premiums ceded under the agreement to be accounted 
for as a deduction from revenue. The net impact on profit of the quota share was a £1.6m cost. Travel revenue increased by 2.1% 
to £432.0m, as the impact of the Saga Sapphire scheduled maintenance was more than offset by strong revenue growth in 
tour operations.
The retail broking insurance business increased profit before tax by 9.1%, with a particularly strong performance in motor broking. 
Underwriting profit reduced by £7.0m, as a result of reducing reserve releases and the cost of quota share. Travel increased 
profits by 10.4%, even after the effect of the Sapphire scheduled maintenance, which had a profit impact of around £5m. 
Emerging businesses and central costs saw an 8.8% decrease in losses before tax reflecting the reduction in finance costs.

Overall revenue from retail broking grew by 13.7% to £297.7m (2016: £261.9m), despite a competitive motor market and a home 
market with limited inflation. Overall profit before tax grew by 9.1% to £138.0m (2016: £126.5m). Across each of our products,  
we have balanced volume and profit to deliver this strong result.
The results for motor broking reflect the benefit of the number of initiatives that have been implemented during 2015 and 2016, 
with growth in both revenue and profit before tax, which increased by £38.0m and £16.6m respectively.
The introduction of the motor panel in summer 2015 contributed £3m of additional profit in the year, with around 30% of net 
premium for renewal policies now being placed with third party underwriters by the end of the year. Given the different risk profile 
of drivers underwritten by external underwriters, these policies had an average gross written premium significantly higher than 
those underwritten in-house, generating an additional net revenue and profit per policy. The written to earned benefit associated 
with the growth in the motor panel contributed an additional £4m of profit.
Improved yield management contributed additional profit of £4m, with modest growth in Saga core motor policies being achieved 
with a lower level of discounting. The full year impact of Bennetts, acquired on 1 July 2015, contributed an additional £2m profit, 
coupled with £4m of further written to earned benefit largely driven by the introduction of the arrangement fee in November 2015.
In a home market with stable average customer premiums and modest claims inflation increasing net rates, we chose to maintain 
volumes at a similar level, leading to consistent revenues of £89.8m (2016: £90.0m), with a small reduction in profit to £61.2m 
(2016: £63.4m).
Revenue and profit before tax from other insurance lines was £80.4m and £31.6m respectively (2016: £82.4m and £34.5m), 
with higher revenues from both private medical and travel insurance being offset by revenue in the prior year from the legal 
services product, which was discontinued at the end of 2015, and a decrease in credit hire and repair income. Core policies 
decreased slightly to 381k (2016: 383k), which was mainly due to a reduction in pet insurance policies sold. Profit was 
impacted by a more challenging travel market towards the end of the year, with net rate pressure becoming prevalent 
due to the depreciation of sterling.

Excluding the impact of the new funds-withheld quota share agreement that became effective from 1 February 2016 and the 
impact of the Ogden rate change, underwriting revenue decreased by 10.0% to £223.5m (2016: £248.2m). This was due to the 
introduction of the motor panel, which has resulted in the likelihood of higher-risk, higher-premium motor policies now being 
underwritten by third party underwriters, and which has led to a fall in both AICL ’s earned policy volumes and average earned 
premiums. This in turn has resulted in lower claims costs, which, coupled with favourable claims experience, decreased by 11.2% 
to £195.9m (2016: £220.6m). 
Favourable experience in small and large personal injury claims enabled the business to release £63.0m of reserves held  
in respect of previous accident years, £5.0m lower than the previous year.
When excluding the effect of the reserve releases and the impact of the quota share, the underwriting business delivered 
 a broadly stable pure combined operating ratio
1
 of 99.6%.
The reduced level of reserve releases, combined with the net cost of the new quota share agreement of £1.6m, for which there 
was no comparable cost in the prior year, has resulted in a decrease in the profit before tax from underwriting activity to £77.1m 
(2016: £84.1m). The Ogden rate change had an additional net profit impact of £4.0m, reducing the reported profit before tax from 
underwriting to £73.1m.

Favourable claims development experience during the twelve months to 31 January 2017 has resulted in a reduction in the 
reserves required in respect of prior year claims. This has been driven by the experience on large and small personal injury claims 
and has enabled reserve releases totalling £63.0m during the year, offset by a £3.1m increase in prior year reserves that was 
required as a result of the Ogden discount rate change. There has been no deterioration in the underlying reserve margin held

the previous year end, driven by a £27.6m reduction in reported claims reserves, £15.3m less in unearned premium reserve  
and a £8.3m reduction in IBNR claims reserves.

Under Solvency II the Group had an SCR of £102.9m at 31 January 2017 (2016: £128.8m), benefiting from the claims experience 
and the initial impact of the quota share agreement. Available capital was £146.7m (2016: £219.6m), giving a coverage ratio of 
143% (2016: 170%). The reduction of SCR has enabled the Group to release a significant amount of capital from the underwriter.

Travel
The travel business has had another strong year of trading. Despite having lower capacity days in Cruising due to scheduled 
maintenance of the Saga Sapphire in the first half of the year, the business has achieved growth in both revenue and profit before 
tax excluding derivatives, which are up 2.1% and 10.4% respectively.

The tour operations business generated a 3.9% increase in revenue to £350.1m (2016: £336.9m) from 190k passengers (2016: 
189k). This reflects a continued shift in product mix towards higher value, higher margin long-haul river cruise and third party 
cruise products.
Profit before tax from tour operations grew by 32.2% to £11.5m. This was due to three factors. Firstly, the increased revenue 
generated greater margin. Secondly, a programme of back office redesign and cost control initiatives enabled the business to 
mitigate any cost inflation and hold its operating expenses flat. Finally, the prior year included a trading loss associated with  
the Bel Jou hotel that was sold on 20 July 2016. Overall profit margin improved to 3.3% (2016: 2.6%).
Saga Cruising delivered revenue of £81.9m (2016: £86.2m). The Saga Sapphire was out of operation for scheduled maintenance 
for 63 days between April and June, which impacted revenue and profit by approximately £9m and £5m respectively. Offsetting 
this was an improvement in yields, enabled through various value enhancements to the cruise product offering, including free 
wine with lunch and dinner, a newly established cruise services team and other enhancements to the customer experience.  
Profit before tax from the cruising business was £3.4m (2016: £4.8m).

Gross profit £14.3m 5.1% £13.6m 
Loss before tax (£42.6m) 8.8% (£46.7m)
Revenue from emerging businesses (which includes personal finance, healthcare services, retirement villages and the media 
businesses) decreased by 2.3% to £29.3m (2016: £30.0m), although these businesses delivered a 5.1% increase in gross profit  
to £14.3m (2016: £13.6m).
The overall loss before tax from this segment reduced by 8.8% to £42.6m (2016: £46.7m). This was due to a reduction in finance 
costs due to lower levels of debt and a decrease in LIBOR, and a reduction in the non-trading items due to IPO expenses in the 
prior year, offset by an increase in operating expenses reflecting the increased level of investment in the healthcare, personal 
finance and retirement villages businesses.
Financial outlook and guidance 
During the year ending 31 January 2018, profits from insurance broking are expected to increase with improved yield 
management, operational and marketing efficiencies and the ongoing positive impact of the motor panel. 
With the strong growth in revenue on forward travel reservations combined with the additional positive effects of the efficiency 
initiatives, profitability for the travel business is expected to step forward strongly year on year, primarily within the tour operating 
businesses. The uplift in Cruise capacity and profit will be limited due to two dry docks taking place in the current year, leading  
to 41 days when the ships are out of service.
With average net debt expected to be significantly lower year on year, finance costs are expected to reduce again in the  
coming year.
Reserve releases are expected to reduce again this year and increased investments will be made in membership and our future 
insurance broking platform.
Subject to market conditions remaining materially consistent, the Group is aiming to deliver ongoing consistent profit growth 
this year.
While the Group’s leverage reduced significantly in the year to 31 January 2017, this benefited from the one-off move towards  
a sustainable, longer term solvency ratio level and therefore the rate of leverage reduction will be lower in the coming year.  
The Group is retaining the target debt range of 1.5 to 2.0 times Net Debt to Trading EBITDA, consistent with the dividend  
payout ratio of 50% to 70% of net earnings.

39 Governance
Chairman’s Statement
This year is about ensuring that our 
governance framework supports 
growth in our businesses and our 
focus on becoming even more 
customer-centric, allowing our 
customers to live the life they  
want to lead.
During our third year as a public 
company, our strategic priorities for  
the future have evolved (as outlined  
on pages 01-39). This year is about 
ensuring that our governance framework 
supports growth in our businesses  
and our focus on becoming even  
more customer-centric, allowing our 
customers to live the life they want  
to lead. 
The Board is structured to support the 
Group with its relentless desire to put the 
customer at the centre of everything it 
does. Every Board decision includes 
consideration of how it will affect our 
customers. Details of Board activities 
during the year and how the governance 
structure supported key decisions (such 
as the decision to build our new ship) 
can be found on page 47.
The Audit, Risk, Remuneration  
and Nomination Committees (the 
‘Committees’) have also played an 
important role in setting the strategic 
direction. The Group’s risk management 
processes were reviewed by the Risk 
Committee, which discussed our risk 
appetite and tolerance levels, and 
considered how these would affect our 
strategic direction. The principal risks 
and uncertainties analysis played an 
important part in the formulation of  
the viability statement (see page 57).  
The Audit Committee considered  
the approach taken and the viability 
statement itself (see page 42), and 
provided assurance that the relevant 
systems and processes were in place to 
ensure that the annual report as a whole 
is ‘fair, balanced and understandable’. 
Our internal governance 
procedures must support  
our strategic priorities

Committee Report on pages 58-61.
Our brand and reputation
The Board is committed to ensuring that 
our brand and reputation for outstanding 
levels of customer service are never 
compromised. We also remain focused 
on delivering the best service to our 
shareholders and it is vital that our 
corporate governance procedures 
support our strategic direction. 
Whilst there have been no changes  
to the Board during the year, the 
Nomination Committee did discuss  
how the Company would ensure that 
there is the right level of oversight of the 
regulated businesses and that those 
companies had senior leaders with the 
right experience in place. This Committee 
also considered how we manage our 
talent and succession planning – for 
more details see pages 52-53.
During the year, we announced that 
Philip Green will resign from the Board 
and his position as Senior Independent 
Director on 31 March 2017, to chair 
another business. He will be replaced 
as Senior Independent Director by 
Orna NiChionna, one of our current 
Non-Executive Directors. Orna will 
also become Chair of the Nomination 
Committee at this point.
I’d like to thank Philip very much for his 
contribution to the Board during the 
Company’s first three years as a listed 
business. Given the opportunity that he 
has been offered, I fully understand the 
rationale for his decision and wish him 
continued success in the future. Orna 
has extensive experience within listed 
companies, sits on our Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees and 
chairs the Risk Committee. I am 
delighted that Orna has agreed to take 
over from Philip as Senior Independent 
Director. She has a good feel for what we 
do as a business, our values, and what’s 
right for our customers, and she has 
made a strong contribution during her 
time on the Board.
On 22 April 2016, as a result of the share 
placing undertaken by Acromas Bid Co 
Limited, Non-Executive Director James 
Arnell resigned from the Board. This was 
in accordance with the Relationship 
Agreement dated 8 May 2014 which 
required his resignation once the indirect 
shareholding of the Private Equity 
Investor he represented ceased to exist. 
We comply with the recommendation  
in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2016 (the ‘Code’) that at least half of our 
Board members are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. For full details 
of Board composition see pages 48-50.
Our people
As well as setting the strategic direction 
of the Group, the Board has taken steps 
to support and develop leadership and 
management, recognising that our 
people are core to the success of 
delivery of our strategy. A key part of 
our Saga People Action Plan to address 
themes from Becoming the Best 
employee survey and to ensure we 
are embedding the Saga Way, was to 
develop a Leadership Development 
Programme – see page 16 for more 
details. We also awarded eligible 
employees with free shares for the 
second year running under the 2014 
Share Incentive Plan to reward their 
hard work.
Board evaluation
We conducted our first externally facilitated 
Board and Committee evaluation during 
the year. The exercise identified that our 
governance has developed well and is 
sound and that there is a healthy culture 
of transparency, greater strategic clarity 
and good coverage of the main risks, The 
experience of the Directors, combined with 
a stable and strong senior management 
team, means that the interests of all 
stakeholders, including shareholders, 
are considered, A full explanation of 
the evaluation exercise can be found 
on page 51.
The Remuneration Report was 
approved by our shareholders at our 
AGM: over 90% voted in favour. The full 
Remuneration Report can be found 
on pages 67-89.
UK Corporate Governance Code
Our governance framework is reviewed 
by the Board every year against best 
practice and regulatory requirements. 
A summary of how we have complied 
with the Code is set out overleaf. Our 
approach to leadership and effectiveness 
is detailed on pages 45-46 and 50-51 
respectively, accountability on pages 
54-57, and relations with shareholders 
on page 66. 
Governance continues to support our 
strategic priorities in a practical way. 
Having the right structure in place 
means that the decisions we make 
as a Board go through a rigorous 
procedure, allowing for discussion at the 
committees and at the Board, to enable 
us to grow, continue to pay down debt 
and enhance long-term returns to our 
shareholders through a progressive 
dividend policy.
Our shareholders and our AGM
We continue to offer a DRIP for those 
shareholders who wish to turn cash 
dividends into more shares. At our 
second AGM at our head office in 
Folkestone, Kent on 21 June 2016,  
all resolutions were passed with a 
significant majority and all Directors 
standing for re-election were re-
appointed. I look forward to this year’s 
AGM and meeting our shareholders.  
I also welcome comments from 
shareholders at any time.

41 Assessment of risk 
Through the risk cycle detailed on 
pages 54-57, the Board is able to 
confirm that it has carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company, including 
those which would threaten our 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity, in accordance 
with section C 2.1 of the Code. 
Statement of review 
The risk management process 
detailed on pages 54-57 was  
in place for the year under review  
and up to the date of approval  
of this report. 
The Board has conducted a review  
of the effectiveness of Saga’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems, including all material 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls, and concluded that these 
are acceptable.
The Group has access to sufficient 
cash and other financial resources 
together with a large renewing income 
stream from insurance policies and 
high-repeat purchase levels from 
customers of its other products, and 
long-term contracts with a number of 
suppliers across different industries. As 
a consequence, the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to 
successfully manage its business risks. 
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company has 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. It is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Governance
Compliance Statement
The Board is committed to high 
standards of corporate governance  
and manages Saga’s operations in 
accordance with the Code. A full version 
of the Code can be found on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s (‘FRC’) 
website www.frc.org.uk. The Company 
complied with all of the provisions of the 
Code throughout the year. 
Viability statement 
The Directors have considered the 
viability of the Group over the 
five-year period to January 2022  
and have concluded there to be  
a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities  
as they fall due over this period. 
The Directors have determined the 
five year period to January 2022 to 
be an appropriate period over which 
to assess the Group’s viability,  
as this period: 
•  is consistent with the planning 
horizon over which the Directors 
normally consider the strategic 
direction, future performance, 
capital and solvency requirements 
of the business; 
•  includes the delivery of the 
contracted new ship and the 
optional second ship in 2021; and 
•  includes the refinancing of the 
senior bank facilities that mature  
in April 2019. 
In making this statement the Directors 
have considered the resilience of the 
Group, taking account of its current 
position and long-term strategic plan, 
the principal risks facing the business 
in severe but plausible scenarios, and 
the effect of any mitigating actions. 
The Directors have considered each 
of the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties detailed on pages 
20-22 and the potential impact of 
these risks on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and 
liquidity over the period. The Directors 
have made a key assumption that 
it is reasonable to believe that debt 
funding to replace the existing senior 
bank facilities when they mature 
will be available in all plausible 
market conditions. 
Fair, balanced and 
understandable 
In accordance with the principles of  
the Code, the Board has established 
arrangements to evaluate whether  
the information presented in the  
annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. Having taken  
advice from the Audit Committee,  
the Board considers the annual report 
and accounts, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to  
assess the Company’s position  
and performance, business model 
and strategy. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development and 
performance, its exposure to risk 
and its management of these risks, 
details of its financial instruments  
and derivative activities, and details  
of other financial and non-financial 
liabilities are described throughout  
the annual report (principal risks and 
uncertainties pages 20-22; Group

42 A. Leadership 
A1 The role of the Board 
The Board met formally six times  
during the year. The schedule of 
matters reserved for the Board was 
reviewed on 20 September 2016. 
There is a clear governance structure 
throughout the Group, which sets out  
delegated authorities. 
A2 Division of responsibilities 
There is a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Group Chief Executive 
Officer. A document clarifying these 
and the role of the Senior Independent 
Director was reviewed and approved 
by the Board on 1 November 2016. 
This document is reviewed annually. 
A3 The Chairman 
The Chairman sets the agendas 
for meetings, manages the meeting 
timetable (in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary) and facilitates 
open and constructive dialogue 
during the meetings, with particular 
focus on strategic issues. The 
Chairman promotes constructive 
relations between Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. 
A4 Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors provide 
objective, rigorous and constructive 
challenge to management and meet 
regularly without the Executive 
Directors. The Senior Independent 
Director acts as a sounding board for 
the Chairman, led an evaluation on 
the Chairman’s performance and 
is available for meetings with 
major shareholders. 
B. Effectiveness

diversity. Further details of the activities 
of the Nomination Committee can be 
found on pages 52-53. 
B3 Commitment 
On appointment, Directors are 
notified of the time commitment 
expected from them. External 
directorships, which may impact on 
the existing time commitments of the 
Executive Directors, must be agreed 
beforehand with the Chairman. 
B4 Development 
A tailored programme is set up when 
a Director joins the Board and this is 
ongoing to ensure that Directors’ 
skills and knowledge are regularly 
updated and refreshed. 
B5 Information and support 
The Chairman, in conjunction with 
the Company Secretary, ensures that 
all Board members receive accurate 
and timely information and are kept 
informed on all governance matters.

performance of the Group, the 
business model, strategy and principal 
risks and uncertainties relating to the 
Group’s future prospects. 
C2 Risk management and  
internal control 
The Board sets out the Group’s  
risk appetite and risk policy. The 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control 
systems is reviewed annually. The 
activities of the Risk Committee, 
which assists the Board with its 
responsibilities in relation to the 
management of risk, are summarised 
on pages 62-65.

The Board has delegated a number  
of responsibilities to the Audit 
Committee, which is responsible  
for overseeing the Group’s financial 
reporting processes, internal controls

44 Governance
Leadership
A key part of our Saga People Action Plan 
to address themes from Becoming the 
Best employee survey and to ensure we 
are embedding the Saga Way, was to 
develop a Leadership Development 
Programme across a range of levels across 
the Group. This started with the Group 
Executive and was then cascaded to their 
direct reports, approximately 72 people. 
The programme is made up of three 
workshops, due to complete in November 
2017. This investment in people is core to 
the success of our strategy and our aim is 
to filter this to all senior managers so that 
the leadership team are aligned in how 
growth is delivered. For more details,  
see page 16.
All Directors, members of the Group 
Executive Committee and persons 
discharging managerial responsibilities 
receive training on an ongoing basis, to 
ensure they remain aware of regulatory  
and statutory responsibilities. In addition,  
all Non-Executive Directors visit business 
areas so that they remain close to what 
Saga does, see how strategy works in 
action and how the discussion in the 
boardroom translates to the front line  
of the business, including our call centres 
and cruise ships. 
The Board of Directors 
The Board is responsible for, and provides, 
the overall direction for management, 
debating what our strategic priorities are 
and setting Saga’s values and standards.  
A fundamental part of this role is 
considering the balance of interests 
between our shareholders, our customers, 
our employees and the communities in 
which we work. 
We also provide oversight and supervision 
of Saga’s operations ensuring: 
• successful implementation of  
agreed strategy;

amount set out in the relevant contract 
approval processes from time to time.

Effectiveness
The members of the Board 
The Board considers its overall size 
and composition to be appropriate, 
having regard in particular to the 
independence of character, integrity, 
differences of approach and experience 
of all the Directors. We give due regard 
to the benefits of diversity in its widest 
sense for the current and future Board 
composition, recognising that this is 
essential for effective engagement with 
our key stakeholders. 
We consider that the skills and 
experience of our individual members, 
particularly in the areas of insurance, 
financial services, consumer services, 
brand management, corporate finance, 
mergers and acquisitions, and risk 
management, are fundamental to the 
pursuit of our strategic objectives.  
In addition, the quoted company 
experience of members of the Board  
in a variety of sectors and markets  
is invaluable to Saga.

Independence of Non-Executive 
Directors 
The Board considers five of the Non-
Executive Directors to be independent of 
Saga’s executive management and free 
from any business or other relationships 
that could materially interfere with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. 
These Directors are Philip Green, 
Ray King, Bridget McIntyre, Orna 
NiChionna and Gareth Williams. Philip 
will be resigning from the Company  
on 31 March 2017, as detailed below. 
Changes to the Board 
Whilst we did not make any 
appointments to the Board during the 
year, the Nomination Committee did 
discuss how the Company would ensure 
that there is the right level of oversight  
of the regulated businesses within the 
Group and that those companies had 
senior leaders with the right experience 
in place. More details can be found in  
the Nomination Committee report on 
pages 52-53. 
During the year, we announced that 
Philip Green will resign from the Board 
and his position as Senior Independent 
Director on 31 March 2017, to chair 
another business. He will be replaced  
as Senior Independent Director by  
Orna NiChionna, one of our current 
Non-Executive Directors. Philip and  
Orna both joined the Board during the 
Company’s IPO in 2014. 
Orna was selected as the replacement 
Senior Independent Director due to her 
experience (as Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee of Royal Mail 
plc, Chair of client service at Eden 
McCallum, and Deputy Chair of the 
National Trust) and within the Group. 
She sits on our Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration committees and chairs 
the Risk Committee. The Board was of 
the opinion that Orna has a good feel for 
what we do as a business, our values, 
and what's right for our customers, and 
has made a strong contribution during 
her time on the Board. 
On 22 April 2016, as a result of the share 
placing undertaken by Acromas Bid Co 
Limited, Non-Executive Director James 
Arnell resigned from the Board. This  
was in accordance with the Relationship 
Agreement dated 8 May 2014 which 
required his resignation once the indirect 
shareholding of the Private Equity 
Investor he represented fell below 10%. 
We continue to comply with the Code’s 
recommendation that at least half of  
our Board members are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. For full details 
of Board composition see pages 48-50. 
Appointment of Directors 
Our Nomination Committee terms  
of reference explain how we recruit and 
appoint Directors to the Board. We will 
use open advertising or the services of 
external advisers to facilitate our search 
for the best possible candidates  
from a wide range of backgrounds,  
as appropriate. 
Ongoing training and induction  
of Non-Executive Directors 
All Non-Executive Directors attended 
meetings with senior management  
and subsidiary directors and strategy 
sessions for each of our businesses 
to understand the short and long-term 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
50 goals of the Group. They continue to  
visit all areas of the business to gain 
first-hand experience of how Saga 
works, including listening to calls  
during visits to our call centres. 
Our induction process was reviewed to 
ensure that it will serve to familiarise new 
Directors with our strategy, competitive 
and industry environment, Group 
structure, governance and risk profile/
appetite and provide for meetings with 
key members of senior management. 
Board effectiveness review 
The Board and its Committees 
undertook their first externally facilitated 
evaluation of their performance during 
the year. The evaluation was conducted 
by Independent Audit Limited. 
Independent Audit Limited does not have 
any other connection to the Company. 
Independent Audit Limited’s review 
consisted of a review of Board and 
Committee papers, observation of Board 
and Committee meetings, and interviews 
were held with Directors/Committee 
members and attendees to give them 
an opportunity to express their views 
about questions such as:
• whether the Board gets what it needs 
to facilitate a well-structured and 
focused discussion;
• how well the Board agenda and 
discussion is focused on strategy 
and the main market and  
competitive challenges;
• how the Board gets a picture of how 
our culture and risk are embedded;
• the line of sight Non-Executive 
Directors have into the way in which 
the Group is run and controlled;
• steps taken to develop a strong 
management team through 
succession planning and talent 
management;
• organisation of meetings, including 
agenda setting, time spent on each 
item and quality of papers; and
• corporate governance and regulatory 
compliance support.
A report prepared by Independent  
Audit Limited was presented to the 
Board. As a result of this in-depth 
discussion, a board development plan 
was agreed and discussed further with 
Independent Audit Limited. 
The review concluded that governance 
had developed well since the Company 
had listed. Strengths identified included 
a stable and strong senior management 
team, a healthy culture of transparency, 
and a consistent and concerted effort 
to communicate openly with the 
Non-Executive Directors. There was 
good coverage of the principal risks and 
subsidiary level governance worked 
well, with appropriate escalation when 
necessary. Interests of a wide group of 
stakeholders, including shareholders, 
was considered and a lot of weight and 
attention was given to the ‘people 
strategy’ of the Group. It was now time 
for the Board to focus on successful 
execution of Group strategy.
Board development plan for 2017/18
Looking ahead, the Board will continue 
to work on ensuring that the content  
of all Board meetings remains aligned  
to strategy and the key drivers of 
performance.  Risk management will 
continue to link directly to strategic 
drivers, principal risks and uncertainties.  
The pre-read papers and time allocated 
for discussion at each Board will support 
this approach and will include forward 
thinking analysis, where appropriate. 
The results of the evaluation of the 
Chairman’s performance were also 
considered by the Senior Independent 
Director and the Non-Executive Directors 
and were discussed with the Chairman. 
Annual re-election 
The Directors are standing for re-election 
at the AGM, with the exception of Philip 
Green, who is resigning on 31 March 
2017. Our view is that each of the 
Directors standing for re-election should 
be appointed, as we believe that they 
have the skills required for the Board to 
discharge its responsibilities, as outlined 
in each of their biographies set out on 
pages 48-49.

This year we have focused on 
ensuring that there was a structure  
in place that enabled appropriate 
challenge, checks and balances 
throughout the Group. 
It was important that we had 
confidence that we have the right 
people in senior roles, with the 
appropriate skill set and that the 
appropriate strategic and operational 
discussions were taking place. We 
have held a number of unscheduled

of the Committee at this time. 
Whilst we did not make any 
appointments to the Board during the 
year, we did discuss how the Company 
would ensure that there is the right level 
of oversight of the regulated businesses 
and that those companies had senior 
leaders with the right experience in 
place. We concluded that it was 
Important to have the right governance, 
leadership and independence for such 
roles. As a result of this discussion, 
Bridget McIntyre was appointed as 
Senior Independent Director for Saga 
Services Limited on 22 March 2017.
Appointment of Directors
Our terms of reference explain how  
we recruit and appoint Directors to the 
Board. We will use open advertising  
or the services of external advisers to 
facilitate our search for the best possible 
candidates from a wide range of 
backgrounds, as appropriate.
Russell Reynolds Associates were 
approved as our search consultants  
and will map candidates against skills 
sets identified. Russell Reynolds 
Associates has no other connection  
with the Company.
An overview of the Director induction 
process has been included in the 
Effectiveness section of the Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 50-51.
Diversity
We continue to believe that it is in the 
very nature of Saga to recognise the 
benefits that diversity brings. Our policy 
is to appoint the best possible candidate, 
considered on merit and against 
objective criteria (and in accordance with 
the Equality Act 2010), rather than to set 
quotas for a particular aspect that may 
deflect from achieving this fundamental 
target every time. At the date of this 
report, 25% of the Board is female. 
During the year, we agreed to refer  
to Chair rather than Chairman for all 
Committee Chairs.
Succession planning and talent 
management
The future directional structure of the 
executive team was a focal point in light 
of Andrew Strong’s retirement at the end 
of the financial year and to strengthen 
the customer facing areas of the 
business – important due to the focus  
on customer-centricity.
We reviewed succession planning, noted 
short and long-term caretakers for each 
senior role and focused on removing key 
areas of vulnerability, executive team 
development and overall leadership 
development.
A framework for reviewing talent within 
the Group was put in place following an 
extensive talent mapping exercise. Whilst 
home-grown talent and external hires 
provide a strong skill base, a need 
to focus on leadership training was 
identified, to support the changes 
required within the Group. A leadership 
programme was developed to tailor 
training needs to individuals. Senior 
individuals were also encouraged to 
take on additional roles (in line with 
the One Saga approach outlined on 
page 17) and were invited to present 
to Committee and Board meetings.
Effectiveness of the Nomination 
Committee
Evaluation
An external evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness took place 
during the year, as part of the Board 
effectiveness review (for details see page 
51). This was completed by Independent 
Audit Limited. The review indicated that 
the Committee is working well in 
addressing the main issues it is having to 
cover and is taking a thorough approach 
to Director performance evaluation and 
succession planning. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to 
respond to any issues that may arise 
during 2017 and will continue to identify 
our future talent pipeline, to ensure that 
the structure, size and composition. 
(including the skills, knowledge, 
independence and experience and 
diversity) of the Board is right, conducting 
skills gap analysis where necessary.

Board assessment of risk 
management and internal control 
The Board has ultimate responsibility  
for the Group’s risk management and 
internal control, including setting of 
risk appetite. In accordance with 
section C 2.3 of the Code the Board 
is responsible for reviewing the 
effectiveness of risk management 
and control systems, specifically that: 
• There is an ongoing systemised 
process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the principal risks faced by 
the Company. 
• This system has been in place for the 
year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the annual report and 
accounts. 
• The system is regularly reviewed by 
the Board. 
• The system accords with the FRC 
guidance on risk management, internal 
control and related financial and 
business reporting. 
During 2016 the Board has directly, or 
through delegated authority to the Risk 
and Audit Committees, overseen and 
reviewed the development and 
performance of risk management 
activities and practices and internal 
control systems in the Group. Specific 
details regarding the Risk and Audit 
Committees’ involvement in the 
development and review of risk 
management and internal control 
systems are provided in the Risk and 
Audit Committee reports on pages 
62-65 and 58-61 respectively. 
As a result of its consideration and 
contribution to risk management and 
internal control activities, the Board is 
satisfied that the risk management 
and internal control systems in place 
remain effective.

Risk Management and control is 
achieved through application of the 
‘three lines of defence’ model as follows: 
1st line of defence – Risk taking by 
management, in line with agreed risk 
appetite, risk policies and procedures. 
Various governance forums in each 
business review all risk exposures and 
risk mitigation activities on a regular 
basis, supported by the 2nd line  
of defence oversight functions. 
Consideration of business risks is a 
standing agenda item at each executive 
meeting within the Group. 
2nd line of defence – Independent 
oversight provided by the various control 
functions, including risk, compliance and 
health and safety. Specific duties include 
advice on Group and business risk 
appetites, independent review of both 
the rating of key risks, and approach and 
adequacy of business risk management 
strategies. The 2nd line of defence is  
also responsible for reporting on the 
management of principal risks and 
uncertainties to the Risk Committee 
and Board. 
3rd line of defence – Independent 
assurance on the operation and 
effectiveness of internal control 
throughout the Group, including 
consideration of the effectiveness of the 
risk management process. The 3rd line 
of defence reports to the Board by way 
of the Audit Committee. 
Saga’s spread and variety of business 
operations require risk and internal 
control issues to be considered at both 
specialist business level and aggregated 
Group level. Risk and internal control 
oversight is provided at all Committees 
and key concerns are raised to the Audit 
and Risk Committees and ultimately to 
the Board if required. 
The financial crime, data and information 
security committee provides an 
additional forum to consider specialist 
risks arising in these areas.

Accountability continued
Risk management cycle 
The Group risk management cycle is an 
iterative cycle of activities, comprising 
the following: 
Identification of risk appetite 
Saga defines risk appetite as the amount 
and sources of risk which we are willing 
to accept in aggregate in pursuit of our 
objectives. Group risk appetite is derived 
from our strategic objectives and is used 
as a measure against which all of our 
current and proposed activities are 
tested. Group risk appetites and 
tolerances are further defined within the 
Principal risks and uncertainties section 
(pages 20-22). 
Business risk appetites are separately 
crafted, complementary to Group 
appetites but customised to reflect the 
specific needs and characteristics of 
each business. Business risk appetites 
may be different to Group appetites but 
cannot exceed them. 
Group and business risk appetites are 
reviewed at least annually to ensure that 
they are aligned with any changes in 
strategy or specific strategic initiatives. 
Risk policies 
Saga has a Group risk policy,  
defining our risk management strategy, 
framework, governance structures, 
and detailed assessment and mitigation 
processes. Beneath this Group 
document, individual business policies 
are created, customised to reflect 
specific business characteristics but  
still consistent with the overall risk 
management framework. All risk policies 
are reviewed at least annually and 
approved at business or Group boards 
as appropriate. 
Risk assessment and risk registers 
All Saga businesses assess each risk  
for likelihood and impact. Most use  
a common risk assessment matrix, 
although several have a customised 
impact scale to reflect their size or the 
highly specialist nature of their risks 
Each business then creates appropriate 
controls to manage such risks. Risks  
are rated on both an inherent and a 
residual basis and are rated on a red, 
amber, yellow and green scale. Risk 
assessments are reviewed at business 
risk committees and the principal risks 
are subject to independent review by the 
Risk Committee. Explicit consideration  
is also given as to whether risks lie  
within or outside of risk appetite. Any  
risk close to appetite limits on a residual 
basis is further examined to ensure  
that our desired risk/reward balance  
is maintained. 
Risk registers have been created 
for each business to capture their key 
risks, associated controls and incidents. 
These registers are typically sub-divided 
by function or business area. The highest 
rated residual risks in terms of impact 
and probability for each business are 
aggregated at Group level to produce  
a list of principal risks and uncertainties, 
assessed at residual level against Group 
risk appetite. 
All business CEOs certified compliance 
with the risk management framework at 
the year end. 
Risk review 
Reports on key risks and controls, 
and incidents, are presented to each 
governance forum meeting specified in 
the Committee structure, flow of risk, 
compliance and internal control 
information chart on page 54. In 
addition, checks against control 
effectiveness, and any exceptions or 
overdue actions are also considered. 
Each of these governance meetings 
is attended by key 1st and 2nd line of 
defence managers and the actions are 
minuted and followed up at the next 
meeting. Significant control weaknesses 
or failures are escalated to the individual 
business board in question or, if of 
sufficient scale and seriousness, to 
the Risk Committee. Each Group risk 
committee also considers cross-Group 
risks and incidents to ensure the risk 
of contagion is minimised. 
Risk oversight 
Independent oversight of the risk 
management process, including key 
risks and their associated management, 
incidents and compliance, is provided by 
the Chief Risk Officer and the risk team, 
the compliance team, the Risk 
Committee and, ultimately, the Board. 
Risk monitoring 
All risk registers are independently 
reviewed by the risk team on an ongoing 
basis to test for completeness of risk and 
control capture, effective testing of key 
control measures, and recording and 
reporting of any exceptions and overdue 
actions. 
Risk information 
All risk data, including risks, controls, 
control tests and incidents, is captured 
in an internet-enabled risk portal. This 
portal produces risk reports for all 
governance meetings. 
Independent process assurance 
Saga’s internal audit function (‘Internal 
Audit’) provides independent assurance 
of the effectiveness of the risk 
management procedures at both Group 
and business levels. 
Process feedback 
Outputs from the risk management  
cycle are fed back to the Risk Committee 
to assist with necessary revision of the 
Group risk management policy and 
framework. They may also be used  
to inform future iterations of the  
Group’s strategy. 
A statement confirming that the Board  
is able to confirm that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of risks is 
contained on page 42. 
Internal control 
Internal Audit acts as the 3rd line of 
defence within Saga’s three lines of 
defence risk management framework. 
The objective of Internal Audit is to 
help protect the assets, reputation 
and sustainability of the organisation by 
providing independent, reliable, valued 
and timely assurance to the Board and 
executive management. To preserve  
the independence of Internal Audit,  
the Head of Internal Audit’s primary 
reporting line is to the Chair of the Audit 
Committee, and the Internal Audit team 
is prohibited from performing operational 
duties for the business. 
All activities of the Group fall within the 
scope of Internal Audit’s remit and there 
are no restrictions on the scope of 
Internal Audit’s work. Internal Audit fulfils 
its role and responsibilities by delivering 
the annual, risk-based audit plan. Each 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
56 audit within the plan provides an opinion 
on the control environment and details  
of issues found. Internal Audit works  
with the businesses to agree remedial 
actions necessary to improve the control 
environment, and these are tracked  
to completion. 
The Head of Internal Audit submits 
reports to, and/or attends, Board and 
Audit Committee meetings for the 
subsidiary Saga businesses, as well  
as the Audit Committee meetings. 
Financial reporting 
The Group maintains a control 
environment that is regularly reviewed  
by the Board. The principal elements 
of the control environment include 
comprehensive management and 
financial reporting systems and 
processes, defined operating controls 
and authorisation limits, regular Board 
meetings, clear subsidiary board and 
operating structures, and an Internal 
Audit function. 
Internal control and risk management 
systems relating to the financial reporting 
process and the process for preparing 
consolidated accounts ensure the 
accuracy and timeliness of internal  
and external financial reporting. 
The Group undertakes an annual 
strategy process which updates the plan 
for the next five years, and produces a 
detailed budget for the next financial 
year. Throughout each year, detailed 
reforecasts are performed by each area 
of the Group each month and are 
consolidated to provide an updated view 
of expected performance for the current 
year. Each reforecast covers the income 
statement, cash flow and balance sheet 
positions phased on a monthly basis 
through to the end of the financial year. 
Regular weekly and monthly reporting 
cycles allow management to assess 
performance, and identify risks and 
opportunities at the earliest opportunity. 
Trading performance is formally reviewed 
on a weekly basis by the management  
of the trading subsidiaries, and monthly 
by the management of the Group. 
Performance is reported to the Board  
at each Board meeting. Performance  
is assessed against budget and against 
the latest forecast expectations. 
The Group has an established and well-
understood management structure with 
documented levels for the authorisation 
of business transactions and clear bank 
mandates to control the approval of 
payments. Control of the Group’s cash 
resources is operated by a centralised 
Treasury function. 
Internal management reporting and 
external statutory reporting timetables 
and delivery requirements are well 
established and documented. Control 
of these is maintained centrally and 
communicated regularly. 
The Group maintains computer systems 
to record and consolidate all of its 
financial transactions. These ledger 
systems are used to produce the 
information for the monthly management 
accounts, and for the annual statutory 
financial statements. The trading 
subsidiaries within the Group prepare 
their accounts under Financial Reporting 
Standard (‘FRS’) 101. 
The accounts production process 
ensures that there is a clear audit trail 
from the output of the Group’s financial 
reporting systems, through the 
conversion and consolidation processes, 
to the Group’s financial statements. 
Viability statement 
An assessment period of five years 
was selected. This is consistent 
with our long-term financial planning 
horizon and importantly it embraces 
the construction of our new cruise  
ship which will become operational  
in 2019 and the option to purchase  
a second ship that would become 
operational in 2021. 
Our list of principal risks and 
uncertainties (‘PRUs’) derived from 
our robust review of risks was reviewed 
with risk owners, Group Finance and 
Group Risk to consider which risks might 
threaten the Group’s ongoing viability 
and the achievement of its strategic plan. 
These PRUs are given in the Strategic 
Report on pages 20-22. All of the PRUs 
have been considered and severe but 
plausible outcomes for each have been 
identified. The financial impact in terms 
of both profit and cash of each outcome 
has been quantified and a probability of 
occurrence assigned to it. Assessments 
of potential financial impact were derived 
from both internal calculation and 
examples of similar incidents in the 
public domain. 
The three largest sensitivities in terms 
of financial impact were identified as 
the following: 
1.  The cumulative impact of a repeated 
failure of management to deliver 
change, operational efficiencies, and 
supplier and pricing initiatives in the 
Group’s largest insurance broker, 
Saga Services Limited. 
2.  A severe one-off data breach. 
3.  Impact on AICL ’s investment  
portfolio due to default of the  
largest credit institution. 
Three scenarios were then modelled 
for the assessment period: the three 
largest sensitivities in terms of financial 
impact as if each were certain to occur 
independently; the expected financial 
impact for all sensitivities combined 
drawing on the assigned probability  
for each one; and a reverse stress test 
considering what PRU, or combination  
of PRUs might lead to breach of 
performance and cash flow 
solvency thresholds. 
The outcome of this modelling confirmed 
that none of the top three sensitivities 
would compromise the Group’s viability 
either in isolation or in combination.  
The reverse stress test demonstrated 
that the likelihood of one or any 
combination of PRUs causing us to 
breach performance and insolvency 
thresholds was extremely remote. 
As set out in the Audit Committee report 
on pages 58-61, the Directors have 
reviewed and discussed the rationale 
and conclusions of management’s 
viability testing. The Directors’ viability 
statement is contained on page 42. 
Statement of review

of the effectiveness of Saga’s risk

systems is contained on page 42.

What we have done during the year
Internal Audit
• Approved the Internal Audit Charter, 
received regular reports on the work  
of the Internal Audit function during the 
year, considered resourcing within the 
Internal Audit team and approved the 
work plans for 2017/18.
• Engaged KPMG to carry out a review 
of the effectiveness of the Internal 
Audit function (in line with the 
Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors 
(‘IIA’) Standards recommendation).
• Reviewed an assurance map showing 
the controls in place at the first line  
of defence (management controls), 
second line of defence (quality 
assurance, financial, risk, compliance, 
health and safety and security 
controls) and third line of 
defence (internal audit).  
This showed that there were 
no material gaps.
• Considered an Internal Audit review 
which analysed audit findings during 
the year to provide an initial qualitative 
indicator of the risk and control 
culture in each of the businesses 
subject to audit.
• Considered a report from Internal 
Audit on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management framework, 
with particular focus on Saga Services 
Limited. This concluded that a robust 
risk management framework was in 
place, with a good risk and control 
culture evident across the Group.
External audit
• Considered the external auditors’  
(EY) engagement terms (including the 
fee proposal) for 2016/17, and made 
recommendations to the Board.
• Considered the annual report planning 
timetable and process and EY’s 
intended approach to auditing areas 
where significant risks and other areas 
of audit emphasis were identified by 
them during their planning work.
• Discussed with EY their main 
observations following the interim and 
full year audit.
• Carried out an effectiveness review of 
the external audit process and external 
auditors’ performance.
Reporting
• Considered the Group’s key 
accounting policies and financial 
judgements.
• Agreed with management the 
arrangements for the introduction of 
IBM Cognos Controller, a new  
consolidation ledger tool to administer 
the statutory and management 
accounts.
• Reviewed the key areas of judgement, 
including insurance reserving 
methodology for the year, valuation  
of goodwill and the pension liability.
• Considered the viability statement  
and the underpinning tests performed 
by management.
• Reviewed the interim and full year 
results before their consideration by 
the Board and considered the annual 
report as a whole.
Other internal controls
• Continued to work in co-operation 
with the Risk Committee on key areas 
of business risk.
• Reviewed policies covering financial 
crime (including anti-bribery, anti-
corruption and anti-fraud), 
whistleblowing and non-audit fees.
• Received a report at each meeting  
in relation to whistleblowing and the 
proceedings of the Group financial 
crime, data and information  
security committee.
Our work, up to the date of this annual 
report, in accordance with the Code 
and FRC’s revised Turnbull Guidance 
on Internal Control, confirmed that 
no significant failings or weaknesses 
were identified. Where areas for 
improvement were identified, processes 
are established to ensure that the 
necessary action is taken and that 
progress is monitored.
During the year we received 
presentations (focusing mainly on 
internal control) from the following 
business areas:
Saga Services/Direct Choice 
(regulated businesses)
We received an update on activities 
from the independent Non-Executive 
Director who chairs the Saga 
Services audit committee. This 
covered the work undertaken by 
Internal Audit, the compliance 
monitoring programme, the conduct 
risk framework and steps taken to 
address the threat of cybercrime.
Saga Money
Areas of focus included the product 
portfolio (particularly the innovative 
products for equity release, share 
dealing and retirement income) and 
the governance structure to ensure 
the appropriate level of oversight 
and a sufficient level of transparency 
were in place for Saga Investment 
Services Limited, the joint venture 
with Tilney BestInvest. The chair of 
the audit committee for this business 
confirmed that no major issues were 
identified during that committee’s 
reviews of the first and second 
lines of defence or conflicts  
of interest process.
AICL
We received feedback from the chair 
of AICL ’s audit committee and the 
Chief Executive Officer of this business. 
We also reviewed the management 
process for examining reserving 
assumptions and considered the 
regulatory environment in Gibraltar, 
ongoing requirements of Solvency II 
capital requirements and possible 
impact of a change in the Ogden 
discount rate.
Governance Financial statements Strategic report

59 Governance
Audit Committee Report continued
Destinology – post-acquisition 
review
It is Saga’s normal practice to  
carry out post-acquisition reviews  
of acquired businesses, normally 
around 12 to 18 months post 
acquisition to ensure that we 
internalise any key learnings. We 
reviewed the acquisition rationale, our 
actions to integrate and manage the 
acquired business, its market and 
financial performance and future 
plans and prospects. This year we 
reviewed Destinology and supported 
management’s plans to grow the 
business as an important part of the 
Group’s overall travel offering.
Interim and full year results
The interim and full year results were 
reviewed, together with papers from 
management summarising the process 
of preparing the financial statements, the 
appropriateness and application of key 
accounting policies, and the areas of 
significant judgement, including how 
those judgements were made.
Key areas of significant judgement which 
we considered were as follows:
• Valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities £642.3m. We considered the 
actuarial processes for valuing these 
liabilities, the level of liabilities by 
accident year and by heads of 
damage, and the conclusions of the 
insurance Reserving Committee. We 
received the views of EY from their 
work on the assessment of reserves, 
and concluded that the valuation of 
insurance contract liabilities was 
appropriate. We also considered the 
accounting for the new quota share 
contract and the accounting policies, 
processes and procedures related to 
the new funds withheld reinsurance 
contract with NewRe. Since the year  
end, we have considered the impact  
of the government’s announcement 
regarding the Ogden discount rate  
for Saga’s insurance liabilities.
• Valuation of goodwill and intangibles  
£1,538.8m. We considered the 
methodology for performing 
impairment reviews on the carrying 
value of goodwill and considered the 
output of each review, and concluded 
that no impairments were necessary.
• Retirement benefit scheme. We 
considered and supported the actuarial 
advice regarding the valuation of the 
assets and liabilities of the scheme 
and the key assumptions used in 
deriving those values.
Reports were received from EY at the 
conclusion of their work on the interim 
and full year results and during the 
process of their audit. The reports on  
the full year results included specific 
focus on those areas identified as  
having significant audit risk or other  
audit emphasis.
Fair, balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the 
Committee has considered whether,  
in its opinion, this annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and 
whether it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess  
the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
When forming our opinion, we 
considered whether:
• the report was clear with an 
understandable layout, with key 
messages given suitable prominence;
• the report was fair and presented  
a balanced picture;
• the reporting on the business 
segments in the narrative was 
consistent with the reporting in  
the financial statements;
• the key performance indicators were 
disclosed at an appropriate level:
• statutory and adjusted measures  
were explained clearly; and
• the significant issues and key 
judgements referred to in the  
narrative reporting were consistent 
with the disclosures set out in the 
financial statements.
We advised the Board that we supported 
the statement made on page 42.
Viability statement
The Group’s methodology for production 
of its viability statement is shown on 
page 57 and the viability statement itself 
on page 42.
Jointly with the Risk Committee we 
considered and approved the list of 
principal risks and uncertainties (see 
pages 20-22) and the methodology used 
to provide for an assessment of ongoing 
viability. We specifically considered:
• the relevant assessment time period;
• the list of principal risks and 
uncertainties and associated severe 
but plausible potential outcomes; and
• the appropriateness of the scenarios 
modelled.
We confirmed to the Board that we 
considered that it was reasonable for the 
Directors to make the viability statement 
on page 42.
Internal control and Internal Audit
A key part of our work is the oversight of 
the Internal Audit function. This includes 
reviewing the results of the internal 
auditor’s work and the assurance from 
Internal Audit on its 3rd line of defence 
review of the functioning of the risk 
management framework. We also  
review and monitor management’s 
responsiveness to the internal auditor’s 
findings and recommendations.  
The function consists of 12 people  
with a broad range of skills; we also 
purchase audit skills externally for 
specialised audits.
We are satisfied that the Internal Audit 
function had appropriate resources 
throughout the year.
Where Internal Audit reviews identify 
significant areas of business risk these 
are considered by the Risk Committee. 
Details of these can be found in the Risk 
Committee Report on pages 62-65.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
60 In line with recommendations of the IIA 
Standards, it is our policy to carry out an 
external review of the effectiveness of the 
Internal Audit function at least every five 
years. Accordingly, we engaged KPMG 
to undertake this review during the year. 
The conclusion was that the function 
was competent, effective and well led, 
with strong alignment to principal risks. 
Areas of development were identified as 
the need to focus on emerging risks and 
more use of third party specialists where 
appropriate. As a result, the audit plan 
and audit process includes greater 
emphasis on emerging risks and further 
analysis has been completed to identify 
which audits will benefit from specialist 
technical input.
Auditor independence and  
non-audit services
The independence of EY is reviewed  
by the Committee and confirmed by  
the Auditor throughout the year.
A robust non-audit fee policy is in place 
and is adhered to. This is reviewed 
annually and was last approved  
on 6 December 2016 following 
consideration of the requirements of  
the EU Audit Directive and Regulation 
which came into force on 17 June 2016. 
This includes a list of non-audit services 
where we are satisfied the Auditor  
can carry out those services without 
affecting their role as Auditor. There  
are clear approval levels where the 
Committee Chair (or the whole 
Committee) is required to authorise 
assignments. Competitive tendering  
is used for substantial work. A policy  
on employment of former employees  
of the Auditor was also approved  
during the year.
The audit fees payable to EY in respect 
of the year ended 31 January 2017 were 
£1m (2016: £1.1m) and non-audit service 
fees incurred were £0.2m (2016: £0.2m). 
This equates to a non-audit to audit fee 
ratio of 0.2 (2016: 0.17). A summary of 
fees paid to the Auditor is set out in note 
4 to the consolidated financial 
statements on page 127.
Effectiveness of external auditors
We discussed our interaction with the 
audit team and the audit partner during 
the year and impressions gained.  
We considered:
• our perception of the Auditor’s 
understanding and insights into  
the Group’s business model;
• how EY approached key areas of 
judgement and the extent of challenge;
• the quality of the Auditor’s reporting  
to the Committee and their overall 
efficiency; and
• input from management via a 
questionnaire on the efficiency and 
conduct of the audit.
The Committee is satisfied that the audit 
continues to be effective and provides 
an appropriate independent and 
objective challenge to the Group’s 
senior management.
External audit re-appointment  
and tendering
Auditor appointment and external 
audit tendering
At the AGM last year EY were re-
appointed as our statutory auditors. 
During the year, in accordance with  
the Statutory Auditors and Third  
Country Auditors Regulations 2016 
which require FTSE 350 companies to 
tender the audit at least every 10 years,  
a formal tender process took place,  
led by the Committee. 
This was a structured process, where 
the Company initially considered the top 
10 firms in the UK in 2016 according to 
Accountancy Age. Given that the Group 
is a conglomerate with significant 
presence in regulated industries, the 
auditor had to have sufficient depth 
specialist knowledge, resource and 
relevant experience. Three of the ‘big 
four’ firms, including EY, tendered for the 
audit. The process involved meetings 
with individual Committee members and 
management, review of key documents 
via a secure data room and formal 
presentations. As a result, the 
Committee recommended and the 
Board approved the proposed 
appointment of KPMG LLP as the 
Company’s auditor for the year for the 
financial year ending 31 January 2018. 
This appointment is subject to approval 
by shareholders of the Company at the 
AGM to be held on 22 June 2017.
Effectiveness of the Committee
Evaluation
An external evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness took place 
during the year, as part of the Board 
effectiveness review (for details see page 
51). This was completed by Independent 
Audit Limited. The review indicated that 
the Committee is working well and did 
not identify any significant development 
points requiring action.

Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to present a summary  
of our work during the financial year  
to January 2017. 
Customers are at the heart of what 
we do, and during 2016 the Group 
launched many initiatives and projects 
as a direct result of work undertaken 
to align our business model more 
closely with customer needs and 
expectations. The Committee sought 
to ensure that these initiatives did not 
expose the Group to excessive risks 
– either operational, financial  
or reputational.
We received presentations from each  
of the various Group businesses, so 
that we could understand and 
challenge their identified major risks, 
review their key controls and 
mitigations and establish what this 
meant for the principal risks  
for the Group as a whole.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
62 Our terms of reference
Our terms of reference were reviewed  
by the Committee and subsequently 
approved by the Board on 20 September 
2016. These explain our role and the 
authority delegated to us by the Board 
and are available on the Saga website at 
http://corporate.saga.co.uk/corporate-
information/corporate-governance and 
from the Company Secretary at Saga’s 
registered office.
What we have done during the year
Risk strategy, policy and appetite
We reviewed our principal risks and 
uncertainties against strategy. This 
included those risks that would threaten 
our business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. The principal risks 
and uncertainties assessment was also 
reconciled with the viability statement.
We discussed the possible impact of 
terrorism on travel as well as the effect  
of Brexit on the Group and considered 
the risks associated with internal projects 
and activities, in particular the new  
ship and new insurance platform. 
Developments in relevant industries, 
such as the emergence of autonomous 
vehicles and possible impact on the 
motor insurance industry, were  
also considered.
We recognise the need to review risk 
appetites and tolerances on a continuous 
basis. We considered risks outside of 
agreed risk appetite and concluded that 
where this is the case, the probability of 
occurrence was very low and existing 
mitigating actions were appropriate to 
the scenarios. Risk appetite was 
considered on an aggregate basis each 
quarter. We were satisfied that controls 
were in place which meant that the risk 
of significant failing across the business 
model was remote.
Management of third party suppliers  
was considered in detail, recognising the 
importance of this in light of the imminent 
modern slavery legislation (see page 18 
for a summary of the steps being taken 
to ensure compliance). We considered 
the failure of Parabis Law LLP and the 
effect that this had had on our insurance 
business. Whilst we found that the risk to 
our business of relying on a single key 
supplier had not been fully appreciated, 
the response to the failure was managed 
well, with no disruption to customer 
service; and the lessons learned were 
used to design and implement a more 
rigorous approach to supplier selection 
and monitoring in future.
We considered investments made by 
asset/fund managers on our behalf and 
were reassured that these followed 
ethical guidelines.
The General Data Protection Regulation 
will affect how we do business. We 
considered the work undertaken by the 
Data Protection Strategy Group that was 
established to ensure that all necessary 
steps will be taken before the regulation 
comes into force in May 2018.
The Group risk policy was reviewed and 
we approved this before it was signed  
off by the Board. The revised policy was 
subsequently circulated to all directors 
and board attendees of all subsidiary 
companies and made available to all  
staff via the intranet.
An Internal Audit review on the 
effectiveness of the risk management 
framework took place during the year, 
with particular focus on Saga Services 
Limited, and was considered by the 
Audit Committee. This concluded that a 
robust risk management framework was 
in place, with a good risk and control 
culture evident across the Group. A 
continuous improvement approach will 
be taken to strengthen processes and 
drive consistent control standards within 
front line businesses and to build on 
second line of defence capabilities.
We have reviewed and approved the 
description of principal risks and the 
explanation as to how these are 
managed or mitigated is contained  
within this report. See:
• pages 20-22 for a summary of 
principal risks; and
• pages 54-57 for further information on 
our risk management processes.
These are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.

management monitoring. We worked 
with the Chief Risk Officer to consider 
each business area’s strategies in the 
context of their risk framework to ensure 
that all forward-looking risks had been 
identified and considered. 
All business CEOs certified compliance 
with the risk management framework at

Effectiveness of the Risk Committee
Evaluation
An external evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness took place 
during the year, as part of the Board 
effectiveness review (for details see page 
51). This was completed by Independent 
Audit Limited. The review indicated that 
the Committee is working well and  
is well-supported by management. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to 
ensure that risk processes are aligned 
with strategy, that risk tolerance levels 
are monitored and the impact of risk on 
our businesses and on an aggregate 
basis is considered. In particular, we  
will focus on developing our approach  
to assessing the effectiveness of risk 
management, looking at the impact our 
risk management approach has on the 
way the business is run and how 
decisions are taken. We will also ensure 
that we will bring in outside expertise 
should we feel that our oversight of any 
particular risk areas would benefit from 
independent specialist input.

Relations with shareholders
We plan a shareholder communication 
strategy for the year, to ensure that we 
maintain a relationship with our 
shareholders based on trust and to help 
them understand how we plan to grow 
the business and the effect of decisions 
made, for example, the introduction of 
the quota share arrangement and 
increasing our dividend target range.  
We understand the importance of 
maintaining open and regular dialogue 
with our shareholders – many of whom 
are our loyal customers. We welcome 
feedback at any time during the year and 
the AGM provides the opportunity for our 
shareholders to meet the Board and 
senior management of the Group. 
Lance Batchelor, Group Chief Executive 
Officer and Jonathan Hill, Group Chief 
Financial Officer lead communications 
with our shareholders assisted by the 
shareholder relations team led by our 
Director of Corporate Affairs. 
We set ourselves the target of providing 
information to our shareholders that is 
timely, clear and concise. 
Saga has a diverse shareholder register 
which is formed of both institutional and 
retail ownership, the latter numbering 
over 180,000. Saga also has a number 
of analysts following the Company so 
we arrange for a clear explanation of 
key strategic events and developments, 
including results and acquisitions 
announcements. 
We communicate in the following ways: 
Shareholder communication 
In addition to the AGM, we: 
• have regular meetings with key 
shareholders; 
• arrange face-to-face presentations of 
full year and half year results by the 
Group Chief Executive Officer and 
Group Chief Financial Officer; 
• hold telephone briefings in conjunction 
with key financial announcements; 
• publish live and post-event webcasts 
of key presentations;
• add presentations to our website to 
allow shareholders to gain an insight 
into how our trading performance links 
to strategy; 
• hold investor ‘road shows’, investor 
days, briefings and ad hoc meetings 
on request, where calendar and 
regulatory requirements allow; 
• conduct tours of Saga’s operations; 
• notify our shareholders of key financial 
calendar information;

mentioned above, we: 
• arrange face-to-face presentations 
of full year and half year results 
where the Group Chief Executive 
Officer and management team are 
available for discussions; 
• hold telephone briefings for 
analysts in conjunction with key 
financial announcements; 
• organise face-to-face and 
telephone meetings for analysts 
with the management team; 
• hold presentations with bank  
sales teams; and 
• conduct tours of Saga’s operations  
for analysts. 
The Director of Corporate Affairs reports 
on all shareholder and wider market 
matters and provides regular updates 
to the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors by way of face-to-face 
briefings, email updates and an Investor 
Relations Report, which is discussed 
at each Board meeting. This includes 
reference to the views of key 
shareholders, including their concerns, 
along with any new analyst research. 
We recognise that our brokers play an 
important part in communicating our 
message to our shareholders. During  
the year, we undertook a broker review 
and a result, the Board appointed  
J.P. Morgan Cazenove as joint  
Corporate Broker and joint Financial 
Adviser. Numis Securities Limited was 
appointed joint Corporate Broker and 
Goldman Sachs International was

analysts through: 
• broker attendance at Board 
meetings to provide honest 
feedback; 
• composition of the shareholder 
register; 
• share price performance monitoring; 
• feedback from investor meetings, 
including key questions and 
concerns;

Dear Shareholder,
This year, the business has made 
significant progress with our key 
strategic initiatives whilst delivering 
another robust financial performance. 
The strength of our core businesses 
and our operating model has again 
led to strong cash generation, enabling 
us to reduce further our debt ratio and 
giving us the confidence to increase 
our dividends offered to 8.5p.
Our strategy remains focused on 
becoming an even more customer 
driven business, growing our core 
insurance and travel businesses, 
investing in future growth, maintaining 
our operating model to generate 
strong cash flows and robust 
earnings and investing in our people.
The Remuneration Committee 
continues to review the Policy on an 
ongoing basis and is comfortable that 
it remains appropriate and effective 
heading into the 2017/18 financial year.
This report lays out the core principles 
of our Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
and our practice over the past year. I 
trust we have done this with the 
transparency and clarity that aid your 
understanding of both our intent and 
our activity.

Company highlights for the 2016/17 
financial year
The implementation of our strategy 
(as outlined on pages 12-13) has been 
substantiated through the key 
performance highlights of the year:
• Continued strong performance 
in the core business areas of 
insurance and travel, which has 
led to strong results across all 
the Group’s operations.
• Group profit before tax 
from continuing operations 
increased by 9.7% to £193.3m 
(2016: £176.2m), on revenue of 
£871.3m (2015: £963.2m).
• Underlying profit before tax (profit 
before tax excluding derivatives and 
the Odgen impact), the measure of 
profit performance in the annual 
bonus for management, grew by 
5.6% to £187.4m (2016: £177.4m).
• Strong profit delivery and continued 
high levels of cash conversion 
meant the Group continued its 
deleveraging with net debt to 
Trading EBITDA ratio now 1.9x 
(2016: 2.3x).
• Dividend payments to our 
shareholders of 5.0p per share 
in respect of 2016 and an interim 
dividend of 2.7p in respect of 2017, 
reflecting our confidence in meeting 
market expectations for the full 
year and continuing to deliver 
sustainable profit growth.
• Introduction of the new funds-
withheld quota share arrangement 
in motor insurance.
• Continued investment in our 
cruise ships, demonstrating 
our commitment to continued 
excellence and service to 
our customers.
Changes to our Remuneration  
Policy during the year
No changes to the Policy approved at 
our 2015 AGM are being proposed 
at the Group’s next AGM.
What we have done during the year
We reviewed the key components of 
remuneration.
Decisions made/actions taken
• Made grants in May 2016 under the 
Saga Long Term Incentive Plan ('LTIP') 
for the Executive Committee and 
senior management of the Company. 
Grant levels were consistent with our 
normal award policy.
• Approved the award of free shares to 
all eligible employees in July 2016.
• Approved base salary increases of 
2%, in line with the average rises to all 
employees, for the Group Chief 
Executive Officer and the Group Chief 
Financial Officer, bringing their salaries 
to £689,785 and £424,483 respectively 
to apply for the 2017/18 financial year.
• Approved the fees for the Chairman, 
which will increase by 2% from 1 June 
2017 to an annual fee of £286,110.
• Reviewed the performance targets for 
the 2017 LTIP award. The strategy 
calls for an acceleration in organic 
profit growth (profit excluding historic 
insurance claims performance) over 
the next five years. That growth since 
IPO has been in high single digits. 
We considered it appropriate to modify 
the target architecture to incentivise 
management to pursue a more 
ambitious outcome which recognises 
the strategic shift the business is 
making in how it is growing profit. 
Consequently, we have: 
 – introduced a second Organic EPS 
measure linked to organic profit 
growth. The performance range 
for the LTIP award will be 12-21%.
 – retained the existing Basic EPS 
measure with the existing range 
of 5-12%.
 – retained the existing TSR measure 
and target architecture.
 – rebalanced the proportions of the 
total award to 30% Basic EPS, 
30% Organic EPS, 40% TSR.
Further details of these changes 
can be found on pages 78-79.
• Reviewed and approved the 2016/17 
bonus outcomes, both financial 
metrics and personal objectives, 
for the Executive Directors. 
One of the most significant 
considerations was the impact of the 
Ogden rate adjustment announced on 
27 February 2017. The Remuneration 
Committee gave significant time to 
considering the impact of the post 
year end adjustment on the Group’s 
2016/17 financial results, which 
included a £4m adjustment to ensure 
that the full impact of the new rate 
is reflected in our 2016/17 claims 
liability provisions. 
 
We decided that the impact of this 
adjustment should not affect the 
bonus outcomes for Executive 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
68 Directors and the broader incentivised 
population for the following reasons:
 – The announced Ogden rate 
adjustment was well beyond 
expected parameters.
 – Management had been very prudent 
in its reserving for a potential 
adjustment as is evidenced by 
the relatively small additional 
provision that had to be made 
retrospectively to the 2016/17 
results.
 – There has been significant 
appreciation in the Saga share price 
post the Company’s announcement 
of the relatively small profit impact 
of the Ogden rate adjustment.
 – There is no negative impact on the 
Company’s ability to pursue its 
stated dividend policy and the final 
payment for this year represents an 
18.1% increase for our shareholders.
Further details on the impact of our 
decision can be found on page 83.
• Approved the bonus awards for 
personal objectives for Executive 
Directors and senior management 
following a detailed calibration of 
outcomes against stated targets. 
Full details of these can be found 
on page 84.
• Approved final annual bonus payments 
for the Executive Directors, which was 
67.5% of their maximum opportunity, 
equating to 101.2% of salary for the 
Group Chief Executive Officer and 
84.3% of salary for the Group Chief 
Financial Officer. The payouts reflect 
the strong performance of the Group 
over the year and reflect 100.1% 
achievement against the Group PBT 
target (measured as profit before tax 
excluding derivatives and the Odgen 
impact) and 137.3% achievement 
against the Group cash flow target. 
Full details of the payouts are provided 
on page 83.
Effectiveness of the Remuneration 
Committee
An external evaluation of the 
Committee’s effectiveness took place 
during the year, as part of the Board 
effectiveness review (for details see 
page 51). This was completed by 
Independent Audit Limited and 
concluded that the Committee is 
working well, in part reflecting the 
effective support it is receiving 
from HR management.
Looking ahead we will keep our work 
under review including assessing the 
scope of our involvement in remuneration 
deliberations and how we work with 
executives on such matters. We will: 
• focus on our core principles of 
remuneration in the context of our 
evolving and developing business, to 
ensure they remain fit for purpose and 
are deployed in all our considerations 
and decisions on remuneration 
practice; and
• review our Remuneration Policy as our 
current Policy comes to the end of its 
3-year approved term. We will 
be conducting a full remuneration 
review and will be putting forward 
the revised policy to a binding 
vote at the 2018 AGM.
I hope that you find the information 
contained in this report helpful, 
thoughtful and clear. I welcome 
any feedback from the Company’s 
shareholders and you can contact me 
at gareth.williams@saga.co.uk if you 
have any questions or comments on 
this report. I look forward to hearing your 
views and will be available to answer any 
questions at the Company’s AGM, where 
we will ask our shareholders to approve 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

More detail on the Remuneration Policy can be found on the website and further information on this year’s outcomes is given in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 82-89.
Directors’ Remuneration policy (applied in 2016/17)
The Remuneration Policy and strategy is designed to stimulate sustainable, value creating growth and performance for the 
business and rewards Executives’ performance accordingly. 
The Company’s core principles of remuneration are to support:
• sustainable long-term value creation;
• profitable growth and strong cash generation; and
• attraction, retention and motivation of a talented leadership cadre to deliver the business strategy.
The Committee will review annually the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and the Executive Team drawing 
on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking into consideration:
• our business strategy;
• overall corporate performance;
• market conditions affecting the Company;
• the recruitment market where Saga competes for talent;
• our broader remuneration practices within the Company; and
• changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Remuneration Policy table summary
A summary of the approved Remuneration Policy is outlined below. There are no changes from the approved Policy. The full 
Policy as approved by shareholders on 23 June 2015 is available on our website at http://corporate.saga.co.uk.
Element Operation of element
Salary
Benefits
Pension
The Remuneration Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with 
companies of a similar size to Saga in the FTSE 250.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Remuneration Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Group;
• the general performance of the Group;
• salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group used for remuneration 
benchmarking; and
• the economic environment.
In general, salary rises to Executive Directors will be in line with the rise to employees.
The Executive Directors receive family private health cover, death in service life assurance,  
a car allowance and subsistence expenses. They also receive employee discounts in line with  
other employees.
The maximum contribution to an Executive Director’s pension or salary supplement is 20% of 
gross basic salary.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
70 Element Operation of element
Annual bonus The Remuneration Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual 
Bonus Plan for each year, which will not exceed 150% of salary.
The maximum value of deferred shares is 50% of the bonus earned, which vest after a 
minimum deferral period of three years based on continued employment.
Long Term Incentive 
Plan (‘LTIP’)
LTIP maximum grant is 200% of salary p.a.
Awards will vest at the end of three years’ subject to the achievement of:
• EPS performance which ensures the achievement of the annual profit performance targeted by 
the Annual Bonus Plan flows through to long-term sustainable EPS growth; and
• TSR performance of the Company compared to the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and equity 
investment trusts) which measures the success of the implementation of the Company’s strategy 
in delivering an above market level of return.
The LTIP contains clawback and malus provisions.
Share Incentive 
Plan (‘SIP’)
The purpose of the SIP is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the Company and 
thereby align their interests with shareholders.
Minimum shareholding 
requirement
The Remuneration Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the 
Executive Directors to build up over a five-year period, and then subsequently hold, a shareholding 
equivalent to a percentage of base salary.
• Group Chief Executive Officer – 200% of salary;
• Group Chief Financial Officer – 150% of salary.
Chairman & 
Non-Executive 
Director fees
The fees for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are set at broadly the median of the 
comparator group used for Executive Director remuneration.
In general, the level of fee increase for the Non-Executive Directors will be set taking account of 
any change in responsibility and will take into account the general rise in salaries across the 
Saga workforce.
The Company will pay reasonable expenses incurred by the Chairman and Non-Executive 
Directors and may settle any tax incurred in relation to these.

2015 of 186.4p). In determining this amount the Committee applied the 'buyout' element contained in the recruitment policy. Half of the award vested on 
7 April 2016 with a value of £105,233; the remaining half vests on 7 April 2017. There are no further performance conditions.
3 The value of the 2014 LTIP is indicative as the award will vest on 30 June 2017. See page 85 for details of the indicative vesting for the 2014 LTIP which 
is 50% of the award. The share price used to derive the indicative value is the average share price over the last quarter of the financial year which was 
192.53p. The final vesting value of the 2014 LTIP will be restated in the 2017/18 annual report.

Under the Policy, the remuneration payable to each of the Executive Directors is based on salaries at the start of 2016/17, 
under three different performance scenarios: (i) Minimum; (ii) Target; and (iii) Maximum. The elements of remuneration have 
been categorised into three components: (i) Fixed; (ii) Annual Bonus (Deferred Bonus); and (iii) LTIP. In addition, for the purposes 
of comparison we have included the actual single figure remuneration paid in 2016/17. The following table outlines the elements 
included in the illustration above:

In accordance with the regulations share price growth has not been included for the Policy scenarios. In addition, dividend 
equivalents have not been added to deferred share bonus and LTIP share awards.
Pay at risk
The charts below set out the elements of the remuneration provided under the Policy which remain ‘at risk’. For example:
• Payment is subject to continuing employment for a period (deferred shares and LTIP awards);
• Performance conditions must still be satisfied (LTIP awards); or
• Elements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting.

– Value of/gain on interests over shares comprises unvested 2014, 2015 and 2016 LTIP awards. The one-off IPO share option award for the Group 
Chief Executive Officer has an exercise price of 185.00p hence there was no gain on these awards at 31 January 2017.

Director’ Remuneration Policy continued
2017 LTIP performance conditions and targets
As part of the strategic business review conducted in the year, the Remuneration Committee considered the performance 
conditions and targets for the 2017 LTIP award to ensure that they aligned with, and supported, the strategic business plan.
Following the findings of this review, the Remuneration Committee is proposing to make the changes set out below for the 2017 
LTIP award:
• To ensure EPS growth is aligned with the strategic plan by introducing an additional performance measure of growth excluding 
historic claims performance ('Organic EPS') which will govern half of the EPS element of the award. The existing 'Basic EPS' 
measure will remain unchanged. 
• Adjust the weighting of the performance conditions between EPS growth and comparative TSR, to increase the component 
subject to EPS from 50% to 60% to ensure sufficient focus is provided on the new EPS measure. 
The introduction of the Organic EPS measure allows the significant acceleration of growth which is called for over and above that 
which has been delivered since the IPO to be recognised and targeted. The Group has worked hard to build and develop the 
travel business since the IPO to provide a diversified profit stream from a range of products and services in addition to the 
insurance business. An assessment of Organic EPS allows the Company to reward and incentivise the Executive Directors and 
the Executive Team to deliver this step change in growth. Whilst this growth is also reflected in the Basic EPS, the Committee felt 
that the material impact of historic insurance claims performance on the outturn dilutes the focus on this key strategic objective of 
delivering a step change in growth; and therefore, that a separate measure purely focusing on this was required. 
The retention of the Basic EPS growth measure ensures that the Executive Directors and Executive Team continue to also be 
focused on delivering the total performance of the business. The targets for the two elements of EPS growth are as below:
EPS measure
Threshold
(25% vesting)
Maximum 
(100% vesting)
Basic EPS 5% p.a. 12% p.a.
Organic EPS 12% p.a. 21% p.a.
In setting the targets for the Organic EPS performance condition, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the target range 
against business forecasts and the historic Organic EPS growth of the Group since the IPO. 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
80 The chart below illustrates the proposed Organic EPS targets for the 2017 award and demonstrates a step change from the 
historic performance of the Company in line with the Company’s strategic ambitions. The Remuneration Committee is 
comfortable that the range for the 2017 LTIP award is appropriately stretching and reflects the strong forecasted growth in the 
business performance.

The Committee is retaining the mechanics of the relative TSR element which will remain the same as the 2016 award with 
comparative TSR performance of the Company compared to the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and equity investment trusts) – 
25% of this element of the award vesting for median TSR comparative performance with full vesting at upper quartile.

60% for target performance and 100% for achieving maximum performance. Achievements between these points are calculated on a straight-line basis.
Ogden rate change
The Committee considered very carefully whether the Group PBT should be adjusted for the additional £4m increase in insurance 
claims liabilities required as result of the change in the Ogden rate. In its discussions, the Committee considered the following:
• The Committee felt that the provisioning undertaken by the Executive Directors and Executive Team in anticipation of the 
change to the Ogden rate was to a very high standard; however, the totally unexpected rate announced resulted in a modest 
increase in the provision by £4m.
• Any adjustment would impact bonuses across the wider Executive Team, not just those involved in the insurance business, 
given Saga’s diverse business outside insurance. The Committee did not believe this was proportionate.
• The announcement on 27 February 2017 fell outside the Company’s 2016/17 financial year and therefore the Committee felt that 
this would be a retrospective change to performance targets at a point where the Executive Directors and Executive Team could 
feel justified in believing that the basis on which bonuses would be paid for the 2016/17 financial year had been determined. 
• The Committee also considered the shareholder experience following the announcement which has seen the Company’s share 
price rise. This gave the Committee comfort that shareholders felt that the Company had managed any impact well. Further, the 
Company has not changed its dividend payment plans because of the modest increase in the liabilities. 
After careful consideration of the above factors the Committee determined to use the Group PBT, excluding the £4m cost of the 
Ogden rate change, to determine the bonus outcomes. The following table shows the impact on the level of bonus earned on the 
Group PBT element with and without adjustment for the additional £4m provision:

84 Long-term incentives vesting during in 2016/17 (audited)
The LTIP awards granted on 30 June 2014 have not yet vested but as performance was substantially completed during the 
2016/17 financial year, an estimate of the vesting and the indicative value of the awards has been provided below. This figure 
will be updated in the 2017/18 Annual Report on Remuneration to reflect the final vesting outcome. 
The 2014 LTIP is equally weighted between EPS and relative TSR performance conditions. The EPS growth is measured to 
the 2016/17 year end and the three year TSR condition concluding on 30 June 2017. 
The EPS over the period has grown by 15.7% p.a. against the range of 7-12% p.a. equating to a vesting of 100% of the 
EPS element.
The Company has assessed relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and investment trusts) to 
31 January 2017. Saga ranked below the median equating to an indicative vesting of 0%.
The table presents the indicative vesting of the 2014 LTIP award for Lance Batchelor and Andrew Goodsell, who was awarded 
the LTIP as Executive Chairman in 2014 (prior to his change in role of Non-Executive Chairman).

The 2014 LTIP award and its treatment for Andrew Goodsell was set out on page 90 of our 2015 annual report under the heading 
of 'Remuneration arrangements for our outgoing Executive Chairman'. 
Andrew Goodsell was granted 630,374 share options under the 2014 LTIP in his capacity as Executive Chairman. As a good 
leaver in reference to his change in role from Executive to Non-Executive Chairman, his award was pro-rated to the amount of the 
vesting period completed on the date of cessation as Executive Chairman (one-third of the original award) but remained subject to 
the achievement of the performance conditions for the award.

Notes:
1 Pension salary supplement paid is the difference between the employer contribution into the Saga Pension Scheme and 15% of the Executive Director’s 
base salary.
2 Represents the amount paid to the Executive Director being the difference between 15% of the Executive Director’s base salary and the employer 
contribution into the Saga Pension Scheme from 1 February 2016 to 31 March 2016, and 15% of the Executive Director’s base salary from 1 April 2016 
to 31 January 2017.
3 Reflects the growth in the Executive Director’s pension accrued in the Saga Pension Scheme over the year multiplied by 20, less the contributions by the 
Executive Director in the year.
The maximum employer pension contribution or salary supplement in lieu of pension as per the Remuneration Policy is 20% 
of salary. The Executive Directors can choose to opt out of the pension scheme and receive a cash allowance on their full 
base salary. 
Having opted out of further accruals under the Saga Pension Scheme, Lance Batchelor and Jonathan Hill will receive a 15% 
salary supplement in lieu of pension for the 2017/18 financial year.

86 Comparison of overall performance and pay
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index. 
The graph shows the TSR generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of 
dividend income.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member 
of this since listing. This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations. It should be noted that the Company 
listed on 23 May 2014 and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 23 May 2014 to 31 January 2017.

Group Chief Executive Officer historical remuneration
The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Group Chief Executive Officer using the methodology applied to 
the single total figure of remuneration. The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration payable in its earlier years as 
a private company to the Executive Chairman does not bear comparative value to that which has been and will be paid to the 
Group Chief Executive Officer, and has therefore chosen only to disclose remuneration for the Group Chief Executive Officer:

Notes:
1 The Group Chief Executive Officer joined the Company on 24 March 2014 the remuneration shown is therefore not for the full financial year. Included 
within the single figure is a cash award of £4m with vesting based on continued employment. 25% immediately on the IPO, 25% on the first anniversary 
of the award and 50% on the second anniversary; this was part of the buyout on the recruitment of the Group Chief Executive Officer to compensate for 
awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer. 
2 Based on indicative vesting as at 31 January 2017. The award will vest on 30 June 2017. The final vesting outcome will be stated in the 2017/18 
annual report.
There was no long-term incentive plan or share option plan operated prior to listing.

compensation for awards lapsing on his ceasing employment with his former employer.
Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Company
Each year, prior to reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Team, the 
Remuneration Committee considers a report prepared by the Group HR Director detailing remuneration practice across the 
Company. The report provides an overview of how employee pay compares to the market and any material changes during 
the year, and includes detailed analysis of basic pay and variable pay changes within the UK.
While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating 
the Remuneration Policy, the Company does receive an update and feedback from the broader employee population on an 
annual basis using an engagement survey which includes a number of questions relating to remuneration. The Company 
does not use remuneration comparison measurements.
The Group aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core 
structure as for the Executive Directors. The Group operates employee share and variable pay plans, with pension provisions 
provided for all Executive Directors and employees. In addition, any salary increases for Executive Directors are expected to 
be generally in line with those for UK-based employees.

See the tables on pages 78-79.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping 
remuneration policy and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the 
Remuneration Committee welcomes an open dialogue with its shareholders on all aspects of remuneration.
Shareholder voting at general meeting
The Director Remuneration Policy was put to a binding vote at the AGM on 23 June 2015. The Chairman’s Annual Statement and 
the Annual Report on Remuneration were subject to an advisory vote. Below we outline the voting outcomes in respect of 
approving the Director Remuneration Report and approving the Director Remuneration Policy. Based on the positive level of 
support received from shareholders both on the Policy and its implementation the Committee is comfortable that no changes are 
required to the Policy or its implementation for 2017/18.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee
Following a selection process carried out by the Board prior to the IPO of the Company, the Committee has engaged the services 
of PwC as independent remuneration adviser.
During the financial year, PwC advised the Remuneration Committee on all aspects of the remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Team. PwC also provided the Company with tax and assurance work during the year. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the nature of the services provided and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or 
existed in the provision of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure 
objective and independent advice is given to remuneration committees. Fixed fees of £45,000 (2015/16: £65,000) were provided 
to PwC during the year in respect of remuneration advice received.

Relationship Agreement
The Company had entered into an 
agreement with ABCL as its controlling 
shareholder as required under Listing 
Rule (‘LR’) 9.2.2A R (2)(a), complied with 
the independence provisions set out in  
LR 6.1.4D R and had a constitution  
that allowed for the election and 
re-election of independent Directors to 
be conducted in accordance with the 
election provisions set out in LR 9.2.2E R 
and LR 9.2.2F R, whilst the agreement 
was in force.
As far as the Company is aware:
• the controlling shareholder and its 
associates also complied with the 
independence provisions referred  
to; and
• the controlling shareholder complied 
with its agreement to procure 
compliance with the independence 
provisions referred to above by 
another controlling shareholder  
and its associates.
The Relationship Agreement between 
the Company, ABCL (the ‘Principal 
Shareholder’) and certain funds 
managed or advised by Charterhouse 
Capital Partners, CVC Capital Partners 
and Permira (the ‘Private Equity 
Investors’) remained in force until the 
later of (i) each of the Private Equity 
Investors (together with its associates) 
ceased to be entitled to exercise or 
control the exercise, directly or indirectly, 
of 10% or more of the votes able to be 
cast on all or substantially all matters at 
general meetings of the Company; or 
(ii) the Principal Shareholder (together 
with its associates) ceased to be 
entitled to exercise or control the 
exercise, directly or indirectly, of 30% 
or more of the votes able to be cast 
on all or substantially all matters at 
general meetings of the Company.
As a result of the share placing 
undertaken by ABCL on 21 April 2016, 
ABCL held no shares in the Company, 
Charterhouse ceased to have an interest 
in the Company and the Private Equity 
Investment Director nominated by them 
resigned from the Board with effect from 
22 April 2016.
Change of control – significant 
agreements
A number of agreements take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company including 
following a takeover bid, for example 
insurance, commercial contracts and 
distribution agreements. The Group has 
a number of contracts and arrangements 
throughout the business where the legal 
risk arising out of a change of control is 
closely managed as part of the contractual 
governance process. Inevitably, there 
may be certain operational contracts that 
could provide for a period of disruption 
or higher operational charges if a change 
of control clause was invoked. However, 
at the current time, we are not aware of 
any critical or material contracts that 
pose such a threat.
The Senior Facilities Agreement and the 
financing agreements in relation to the 
new ship provide the Group with loan 
and revolving credit facilities for general 
financing purposes. In the event of a 
change of control the facilities would 
either require repayment or re-negotiation. 
Further details on banking facilities are 
shown in note 26 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The rules of the Company’s employee 
share plans generally provide for the 
accelerated vesting and/or release of 
share awards in the event of a change  
of control of the Company.
The Company does not have any 
agreements with Directors or employees 
which would pay compensation in the 
event of a change of control.
Conflict of interest
Each Director is obliged to disclose any 
potential or actual conflict of interest in 
accordance with the Company’s conflict 
of interest policy. The policy and 
declarations made are subject to annual 
review and Directors are required to 
update any changes to declarations  
as they occur. Internal controls are in 
place to ensure that any related party 
transactions are conducted on an  
arm’s length basis.
Authority to allot/purchase  
own shares
A shareholders’ resolution was passed 
at the AGM on 21 June 2016 which 
authorised the Company to make market 
purchases within the meaning of section 
693 (4) of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
‘Act’) (up to £1,118,005.41 representing 
10% of aggregate nominal share capital 
of the share capital of the Company 
following Admission). This is subject to  
a minimum price of 1p and a maximum 
price of the higher of 105% of the 
average mid-market quotations for  
five business days prior to purchase or 
price of last individual trade and highest 
current individual bid as derived from the 
London Stock Exchange trading system.
The Company did not exercise this 
authority during the year ended  
31 January 2017. The above authority  
will expire at the forthcoming AGM and  
a special resolution to authorise the 
Company to make market purchases 
representing 10% of current nominal 
share capital will be proposed. The 
authority to repurchase the Company’s 
ordinary shares in the market will be 
limited to £1,118,005.41 and will set 
out the minimum and maximum 
price which will be paid. 
The Directors of the Company were also 
granted authority at the 2016 AGM to 
allot relevant securities up to a nominal 
amount of £3,722,958. This authority will 
apply until the conclusion of the 2017 
AGM, where shareholders will be asked 
to grant the Directors authority (for the 
purposes of section 551 of the Act) to 
allot relevant securities (i) up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £3,722,958; 
and, (ii) comprising equity securities (as 
defined in the Act) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £7,445,916 (after 
deducting from such limit any relevant 
securities issued under (i) in connection 
with a rights issue). These amounts will 
apply until the conclusion of the AGM to 
be held in 2018 or, if earlier, 31 July 2018.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
92 Special resolutions will also be proposed 
to give the Directors authority to make 
non-preemptive issues wholly for cash  
in connection with rights issues and 
otherwise up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £559,002.70 and to make 
non-preemptive issues wholly for cash in 
connection with acquisitions or specified 
capital investments up to an aggregate 
amount of £559,002.70.
Rights attaching to shares
The rights attached to the shares are 
governed by applicable law and the 
Company’s articles of association  
(which are available at http://corporate.
saga.co.uk/assets/downloads/corporate-
governance/saga-plc-articles-of-
association.pdf).
Ordinary shareholders have the right  
to receive notice, attend and vote at 
general meetings; and receive a copy of 
the Company’s report and accounts and  
a dividend when approved and paid.  
On a show of hands, each shareholder 
present in person, or by proxy (or an 
authorised representative of a corporate 
shareholder), shall have one vote. In the 
event of a poll, one vote is attached to 
each share held.
The notice of the AGM (the ‘Notice’) 
states deadlines for exercising voting 
rights and for appointing a proxy/proxies.
No shareholder owns shares with special 
rights as to control.
Restrictions on the transfer  
of shares
Other than where imposed by law  
or regulation, or where the Listing  
Rules require certain persons to obtain 
clearance before dealing, there are no 
restrictions regarding the transfer of 
shares in the Company. The Company is 
not aware of any agreement which would 
result in a restriction on the transfer of 
shares or voting rights.
Articles of association
Any amendment to the Company’s 
articles of association may only be made 
by passing a special resolution of the 
shareholders of the Company.
Branches outside the UK
The Company does not have any 
branches outside of the UK.
Post-balance sheet events
On 27 February 2017, the UK 
Government announced its decision to 
move the Ogden rate to -0.75% from 
2.5%. The UK Government first 
announced the decision to launch a 
consultation process on a potential 
downgrade to the Ogden rate in 2012.  
In line with the prudent approach to 
reserving, the Group has therefore  
held a specific amount within its reserve 
margin in anticipation of a reduction  
in the Ogden rate.
This event has been treated as an 
adjusting post-balance sheet event,  
and as such a one-off, pre-tax impact  
on profit of £4m has been reflected in  
the Group’s results for the year ended  
31 January 2017. Our older demographic 
provides the Group with a defensive 
advantage, with lower claims frequency 
generating less exposure to large and 
small bodily injury claims, and to periodic 
payment orders (‘PPOs’). The Group  
does not expect the Ogden rate change 
to have a material impact on its  
financial outlook.

Directors’ Report continued
Directors’ responsibilities
As required under the Financial Conduct 
Authority (‘FCA’) Disclosure Rules and 
Transparency Rules (‘DTRs’), the 
following statements are made by the 
Board regarding the preparation of the 
financial statements.
The process for producing the 
Company’s annual report and accounts 
starts with clear direction for all those 
involved, so that the final document 
represents a balanced picture of our 
activities throughout the year and so that 
shareholders are given the information 
they need to assess the performance, 
business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and 
accounts in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare 
Company and Group financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law, 
the Directors are required to prepare 
Group financial statements under 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and applicable law 
and Company financial statements 
under United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 
101’). Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the Company and 
Group financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that, to the best of their 
knowledge, they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company 
and Group and of the profit or loss of 
the Company and Group for that period. 
In preparing the Company and Group 
financial statements the Directors 
are required to:
• present fairly the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows 
of the Company and Group;
• select suitable accounting policies  
in accordance with IAS 8 ‘Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors’ and then  
apply them consistently;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• make judgements that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific 
requirements in FRS 101 and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union 
are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and 
conditions on the Company and 
Group’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• state whether the Company and 
Group financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with FRS 
101 and IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate records that are sufficient to 
show and explain the Company’s and 
Group’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the Company and Group financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible  
for safeguarding the assets of the Group 
and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors are also responsible  
for preparing the Strategic Report,  
the Directors’ Report, the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and the corporate 
governance statement in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and 
applicable regulations, including the 
requirements of the Listing Rules and  
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules.
Neither the Company nor the Directors 
accept (and hereby exclude) any liability 
to any person in relation to the annual 
report except to the extent that such 
liability is imposed by law and may  
not be validly excluded. Accordingly,  
any liability to a person who has 
demonstrated reliance on any untrue or 
misleading statement or omission shall 
be determined in accordance with 
section 90A and schedule 10A of the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 
2000, as amended.
Each of the Directors, who were in office 
at the date of this report, whose names 
and responsibilities are listed on pages 
45 and 48-49, confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
• the Company and Group financial 
statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with FRS 101 and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and 
profit of the Company and Group; and
• the Strategic Report contained on 
pages 01-39 includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
Company and Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit 
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, which are 
the same risks as those included in our prior year opinion, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the 
context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.
Valuation of insurance contract liabilities (£423.2m, 2016: £460.0m)
Risk Our responses to the risks
Key observations 
communicated to 
the Audit Committee
Valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities (£423.2m, 2016: £460.0m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 58), accounting policy note 2.3(q) 
and disclosure note 24.
For insurance contracts, estimates have to 
be made both for the expected ultimate cost 
of claims notified by the reporting date and 
for the expected ultimate cost of claims 
incurred but not yet reported at the reporting 
date (IBNR). It can take a significant period of 
time before the ultimate claims cost can be 
established with certainty. Management 
makes judgements in respect of the trends 
in the frequency and severity of bodily injury 
claims, the propensity for large claims to 
settle as Periodical Payment Orders (PPOs), 
the Ogden discount rate, being the discount 
rate used by the Courts to determine the 
present value of personal injury claims; and 
other regulatory developments.
On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor 
announced a change in the Ogden discount 
rate to -0.75%; we would expect this to be 
reflected in the measurement of insurance 
contract liabilities.
Management sets insurance contract 
liabilities at a level that includes a margin 
over the actuarial best estimate to take 
account of uncertainty that may impact the 
value of the liabilities ultimately settled.
As a result of the inherent uncertainty in 
setting the insurance contract liabilities and 
the susceptibility to management bias, we 
consider the valuation of the insurance 
contract liabilities to be a significant risk. 
As a result of the timing of the Ogden 
announcement, this risk has increased 
compared to the prior year.
We understood, assessed and tested the design 
and operational effectiveness of key controls over 
the process applied by Management in establishing 
insurance contract liabilities, including controls over 
the completeness and accuracy of data used by 
the internal actuary to project the claims liabilities, 
and controls over changes in assumptions 
and methodology.
Supported by our actuarial specialists, we:
• reconciled the claims data supporting the actuarial 
projections to source systems and, on a sample 
basis, verified the accurate recording of data 
against the underlying policy and claims 
documentation; 
• obtained an understanding of the methodology and 
key assumptions applied by Management;
• challenged the methodology and key assumptions 
against our knowledge of the sector and the 
Group’s own claims experience;
• performed independent actuarial projections on the 
motor classes, which account for 95% of the net 
insurance contract liabilities, to determine our own 
best estimate for the projected liabilities and a 
reasonable range within which such an estimate 
may fall given the inherent uncertainty involved in 
the estimation;
• assessed the level of reserve margin compared to 
market practice and prior periods, in the context of 
areas of uncertainty for which the margin is held; 
• validated that the change in Ogden rate had been 
appropriately reflected in the insurance contract 
liabilities; and
• tested on a sample basis that the reinsurance 
recoveries were recorded in line with the 
underlying reinsurance contracts.
We reviewed the reinsurance agreement with 
NewRe to understand the terms of the contract and 
ensure the transaction is appropriately accounted 
for in accordance with the contractual agreement. 
In the prior period we 
reported that the Saga 
best estimate was based 
on assumptions which 
were individually 
reasonable but contained 
degrees of caution when 
compared to our own 
assumptions. Revisions to 
assumptions by 
management during the 
current period have 
resulted in the Saga best 
estimate now being more 
closely aligned to our own 
best estimate projections. 
However, we consider 
that the overall insurance 
contract liabilities 
including the margin are 
towards the more 
conservative end of the 
reasonable range.
We are satisfied that the 
NewRe quota share 
contract is appropriately 
accounted for and 
disclosed in the 
consolidated financial 
statements.
We consider that the 
recorded insurance 
contract liabilities as at 31 
January 2017, including 
the margin and net of 
reinsurance, are within a 
reasonable range.

96 Risk Our responses to the risks
Key observations 
communicated to 
the Audit Committee
Valuation of insurance contract 
liabilities (£423.2m, 2016: £460.0m) 
continued
Note 18(d) Insurance risk provides further 
detail of these uncertainties and the process 
for establishing insurance contract liabilities.
With effect from 1 February 2016, the Group 
entered into a quota share arrangement with 
New Reinsurance Company Limited (NewRe) 
ceding 75% of the risk of motor policies on 
a loss occurring basis. 
Key accounting considerations relate to 
whether the contract satisfies the 
requirements of IFRS 4 to be accounted for 
as an insurance contract, the presentation 
and related disclosures in respect of the 
contract in the financial statements, and 
assumptions relating to the timing of 
recognition of profit commission.
This included considering whether the contract 
included risk transfer to qualify as an insurance 
contract under IFRS 4, and validating, through 
re-performance, the application of the quota share 
contract to the applicable business and ensuring 
that the financial statements reflect the underlying 
contract terms.
Valuation of goodwill (£1,485m, 
2016: £1,485m)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 58), accounting policy 2.3(g) and 
disclosure note 13.
The goodwill recorded as at 31 January 
2017 is £1,485.0m and is tested for 
impairment by Management by considering 
the recoverable amount of the goodwill 
as described in note 15. 
In determining the recoverable amount, 
judgement is applied by Management 
in deriving:
• the forecast cash flows expected to arise 
from the approved five year plan and the 
underlying assumptions in setting the five 
year plan;
• the pre-tax discount rates that reflect the 
market assessment of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the cash 
flow estimates; and
• the growth rate used to extrapolate cash 
flow projections beyond the five year 
plan period.
The level of risk has remained consistent 
with the prior year.
Management’s impairment assessment of the 
recorded goodwill value was performed as at  
30 November 2016. We tested the design and 
operating effectiveness of the controls in operation 
over the goodwill impairment assessment. 
We have also evaluated and challenged this 
assessment, specifically we:
• validated that the goodwill is appropriately 
allocated to the operating segments;
• validated that the cash flows underpinning the 
calculation were consistent with the five year 
strategic plan approved by the Board;
• challenged the reasonableness of growth 
forecasts during the five year plan period, having 
regard to back testing performed by Management 
to support the robustness of the forecast process;
• compared the long-term growth rates to 
economic and industry forecasts;
• compared the discount rate to the Group’s pre-tax 
weighted average cost of capital and to discount 
rates used by similar UK companies that operate 
in the financial services and travel industries; and
• assessed the adequacy of sensitivity analysis 
performed by Management, stressing each of the 
above assumptions in isolation and in combination 
to best reflect what we considered to be reasonably 
foreseeable changes in the key assumptions.
We have concluded that 
the recoverable amount 
of goodwill exceeds its 
carrying amount, with 
significant headroom 
remaining when key 
assumptions are stressed 
for what we consider to 
be cautious assumptions.
We consider that:
• the allocation of 
goodwill to operating 
segments is appropriate 
and in line with the 
requirements of IAS 36;
• the forecasts used are a 
reasonable basis upon 
which to perform the 
impairment review; and
• the assumptions for 
the pre-tax discount 
rate and long-term 
growth applied by 
management are within 
an acceptable range, 
and are consistent with 
economic and industry 
forecasts, and those 
used by comparator 
insurance and travel 
companies.

Risk Our responses to the risks
Key observations 
communicated to 
the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition (£871.3m, 
2016: £963.2m)
Refer to accounting policy 2.3(a) and 
disclosure note 3.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there may be 
pressures or incentives on Management to 
commit fraudulent financial reporting through 
inappropriate revenue recognitions. There is 
a risk of management override on revenue 
recognition in response to performance 
targets.
The diverse nature of the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies and the materiality of 
the balances concerned are such that we 
consider revenue recognition to represent 
a significant risk.
We have assessed the revenue streams in 
the Insurance and Travel segments as being 
most susceptible to manipulation through 
the application of inappropriate revenue 
recognition policies:
• The Insurance segment revenue consists 
primarily of revenue earned by the 
insurance intermediary and the insurance 
underwriter. The intermediary revenue 
from both external underwriters and the 
Group underwriter is recognised upon 
commencement of the policy period of 
risk, whereas the Group underwriter 
recognises revenue on an earned basis 
over the term of the policy. For policies 
underwritten by the Group underwriter 
and placed via the Group intermediary, 
consolidation adjustments are processed 
to ensure that the overall revenue 
recorded in respect of risks underwritten 
by the Group is recognised in accordance 
with the Group policy.
• In the Travel segment, revenue from tour 
operations is recognised on the 
passenger’s date of departure and for 
cruise holidays, where the Group operates 
the cruise ship, revenue is recognised on a 
per diem basis over the duration of the 
cruise. There is a risk that revenue 
recognition is accelerated and recognised 
when holidays are booked or cash in 
respect of those bookings is received.
The level of risk has remained consistent 
with the prior year.
We considered the accounting policies for the 
revenue streams in the Insurance and Travel 
segments, having regard to the requirements of 
applicable revenue recognition standards, being IAS 
18 ‘Revenue’ and IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’.
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of 
the controls in operation over the Insurance and 
Travel revenue recognition and recording processes.
For the Insurance segment we:
• re-performed earnings calculations for insurance 
contracts underwritten by the Group, to validate 
that insurance revenues were being recognised 
over the policy term;
• inspected a sample of contracts not underwritten 
by the Group to validate whether any contractual 
obligations to provide post-placement services 
were in place;
• performed cut-off testing to confirm revenue had 
been recorded in the correct period;
• reviewed the consolidation adjustments posted to 
eliminate the revenue transactions between the 
Group intermediary and Group underwriter;
• challenged and corroborated reasons for 
variances from prior periods based on analytical 
procedures performed; and
• tested a sample of manual journals for any 
indication of inappropriate revenue recognition.
For the Travel segment we:
• performed detailed testing of a sample of 
transactions to confirm that the tour operator 
revenues and cruise holiday revenues were being 
recognised in line with the contract terms and 
applicable accounting policy;
• performed cut-off testing to confirm revenue had 
been recorded in the correct period;
• challenged and corroborated reasons for 
variances from prior periods based on analytical 
procedures performed; and
• tested a sample of manual journals for any 
indication of inappropriate revenue recognition.
There have been no 
material changes to 
the revenue recognition 
policies applied by 
management during the 
period, and the source 
and contribution of 
each revenue stream 
is consistent with 
the prior period. 
We are satisfied that 
the consolidation 
adjustments to align the 
revenue recognition 
policies across the group 
are appropriate.
We concluded that 
revenue has been 
recognised in the year 
in compliance with 
the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies and 
relevant accounting 
standards.

98 Overview of the scope of our audit
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope 
for each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We 
take into account size, risk profile and changes in the business environment in assessing the level of work to be performed at 
each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, we selected components covering entities within the United Kingdom 
and Gibraltar, which represent the principal trading entities within the Group.

Notes:
1 We audited the complete financial information.
2 We audited specific accounts within these components.
3 We performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential 
risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.
Changes from the prior year
The changes in the number of full scope and specific scope entities primarily reflect revisions to the internal reporting and 
consolidation structure within Saga. 
Involvement with component teams 
Other than the independent actuarial projections on the motor classes performed by our UK actuarial specialists, full scope audit 
procedures related to the underwriting component were performed by EY Gibraltar operating under our instruction. We determined 
the appropriate level of our involvement to enable us to be satisfied that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis 
for our opinion on the Group as a whole. We reviewed the component team working papers and participated in their planning 
and execution of the audit in respect of the risks identified above. Audit procedures relating to all remaining components were 
performed directly by the primary audit team.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing our audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on our audit and in forming our opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be 
material for the financial statements as a whole. We determined materiality for the Group to be £9.7m (2016: £9.0m), which is 
approximately 5% of the Group’s Profit before tax from continuing operations. 
Governance Financial statements Strategic report
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
99 Governance
Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Saga plc continued
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment and reflecting the 
fact that the Group is recently listed, our judgement is that overall performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in 
an individual account or balance) for the Group should be 50% of materiality, namely £4.9m (2016: £4.5m). 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts 
is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £0.9m to £2.5m.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.49m 
(2016: £0.45m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in  
the light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual report and accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in 
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statements set out on page 94, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and
• based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

1 Corporate information 
Saga plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 
2006 (registration number 8804263) The Company is registered in England and its registered office is located at Enbrook Park, 
Folkestone, Kent, CT20 3SE.  
The consolidated financial statements of Saga plc and the entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries, collectively 
‘Saga Group’ or the ‘Group’) for the year ended 31 January 2017 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on  
28 March 2017. 
Saga Group offers a wide range of products and services to its customer base which include general insurance products,  
package and cruise holidays, personal finance products, domiciliary care services, and a monthly subscription magazine. 
Accordingly, the Group segments its business into three trading segments – insurance, travel and emerging businesses  
and central costs (see note 3). 
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and adopted by the European Union, 
and with the Companies Act 2006. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and on a historical cost basis except as 
otherwise stated. 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is also the parent company’s functional 
currency, and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand (£’m), except when otherwise indicated. Each company in 
the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using 
that functional currency. 
IFRSs require the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. In determining 
and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are required to make judgements in respect of items where the choice 
of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the Group’s reported financial position, 
results or cash flows; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate.  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. A discussion on the Group’s significant 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty is detailed in note 2.5. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and 
future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently, unless otherwise stated, are set out in 
note 2.3 below. 
2.2 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 January each year. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with an investee entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee entity. The 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether 
the Group controls another entity.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC
107   
106 
2.2 Basis of consolidation (continued) 
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group 
has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in 
assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:  
• the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;  
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and  
• the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. 
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and 
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed 
of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the 
Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are identified and measured at their fair values at the 
date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised  
as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on 
acquisition) is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is stated at 
the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Profit or loss and each component 
of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to non-controlling interests, even 
if this results in non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and 
cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from  
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where a subsidiary which constituted  
a major line of business is disposed of or otherwise meets the requirements of IFRS 5 to be held for sale, it is disclosed as  
a discontinued operation.  
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.  
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest 
and other components of equity while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised 
at fair value. 
2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies 
a. Revenue recognition  
Revenue represents amounts receivable from the sale or supply of goods and services provided to customers in the ordinary course 
of business, and is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the 
revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when payment is received. The recognition policies for the Group’s various revenue 
streams by segment are as follows: 
i) Insurance 
Revenue is recognised in the income statement over the period matching the Group’s obligation to provide services. Where the 
Group has no remaining contractual obligations, revenue is recognised immediately. 
Insurance premiums received for risks underwritten by the Group are recognised on a straight-line time-apportioned basis over the 
period of the policy. Any changes to premium arising as a result of adjustments to the underlying risk notified by the policyholders 
are recognised over the remaining period of the policy from the effective date of notification.  
Revenue received in connection with insurance policies not underwritten by the Group is recognised at the commencement of the 
period of risk. 
Insurance premiums received for risks which are not underwritten by the Group are not recognised in the income statement,  
as these amounts are passed through directly to the relevant insurer.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
a. Revenue recognition (continued) 
i) Insurance (continued) 
Insurance premiums and sales revenues received in advance of the inception date of a policy are treated as advanced receipts  
and included as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
Premiums and sales revenue in respect of insurance policies underwritten by the Group which are live at the reporting date and 
which relate to the period after the reporting date are treated as unearned and included in insurance contract liabilities in the 
statement of financial position.  
Income from credit provided to customers to facilitate payment of their insurance costs over the life of their policy is treated as 
part of the revenue from insurance operations and recognised over the period of the policy in proportion to the outstanding 
premium balance. 
Profit commissions due under coinsurance or reinsurance arrangements are recognised and valued in accordance with the 
contractual terms to which they are subject to and on the same basis, where appropriate, as the related reinsured liabilities. 
ii) Travel 
Revenue from tour operations and cruise holidays where the Group does not operate the cruise ship is recognised in full on the 
passenger’s date of departure which represents the date upon which the revenue becomes fully non-refundable. Revenue in respect of 
cruise holidays where the Group operates the cruise ship is recognised on a per diem basis over the duration of the cruise reflecting the 
often longer durations of cruise holidays, and to facilitate more accurate matching of revenue with costs as they arise. 
Revenue from sales in resort, for example for optional excursions, or on board a cruise ship operated by the Group, for example  
bar sales or optional excursions, is recognised as and when earned. 
Revenue from tour operations received in advance of the date of departure, and the unearned element of cruise revenues not yet 
recognised on a per diem basis, are included as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. 
iii) Emerging Businesses and Central Costs 
Personal finance 
Revenue from personal finance products is recognised when the customer contracts with the provider of the relevant personal 
finance product where the revenue comprises a one-off payment by the provider of the product. 
Where the personal finance product is one that delivers a recurring income stream, for example ongoing investment, savings  
or lending products, revenues are recognised over the life of the product. 
Healthcare 
Revenue from healthcare operations is recognised when services are provided to customers. The point of supply is generally 
defined as the point at which a service user has received care services from the Group and which are usually provided on an 
hourly basis. 
For the discontinued healthcare business, revenue for social care operations was recognised as a service user received care 
services, usually on a daily basis. For primary care operations, revenue was recognised on delivery of the contracted services,  
or on a time-elapsed basis for capacity-related contracts as the principal contractual obligation was to provide an agreed level  
of capacity over a fixed term. On longer-term contracts, revenue was recognised over the life of each contract in line with the  
pattern of delivery of the associated services.  
Magazine subscriptions 
Magazine subscription revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription. Revenue generated from 
advertising within the magazine is recognised when the magazine is provided to the customer. The element of subscriptions and 
advertising revenue relating to the period after the reporting date is treated as unearned and included within other liabilities in the 
statement of financial position. 
Sale of goods 
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed  
to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
b. Cost recognition 
i) Direct costs 
Costs directly associated with the revenues generated by the Group’s principal activities (excluding insurance underwriting) are 
recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent with the relevant revenue recognition policy. 
ii) Acquisition costs  
Acquisition costs arising from the selling or renewing of insurance policies underwritten by the Group are recognised on a straight-
line time-apportioned basis over the period of the policy in which the related revenues are earned. The proportion of acquisition 
costs relating to premiums treated as unearned at the reporting date are deferred and included as other assets in the statement  
of financial position. 
iii) Claims costs 
Claims costs incurred in respect of insurance policies underwritten by the Group include claims made for losses reported as 
occurring during the period together with the related handling costs, any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous periods, 
and a provision for the estimated cost of claims incurred during the period but not reported at the reporting date. Further detail is 
provided in note 24. 
iv) Reinsurance costs 
The Group undertakes a programme of reinsurance in respect of the policies which it underwrites. Outward reinsurance premiums 
are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related inward insurance premiums and are included as a deduction from 
earned premium, and therefore as a reduction in revenue.  
v) Finance costs  
Finance costs comprise interest paid and payable which is calculated using the effective interest rate method and recognised in the 
income statement as it accrues. Accrued interest is included within the carrying value of the interest bearing financial liability in the 
statement of financial position. 
vi) Other expenses 
Other expenses are taken to the income statement as incurred and exclude intra-group transactions. 
c. Recognition of other income statement items 
i) Investment income 
Investment income in the form of interest is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated using the effective 
interest rate method. Fees and commissions which are an integral part of the effective yield of the financial asset or liability are 
recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the instrument. 
Investment income in the form of dividends is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. For listed securities,  
this is the date the security is listed as ex-dividend. 
ii) Gains and losses on financial investments 
Realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial investments are recorded as finance income or finance costs in the income 
statement. Realised gains and losses on the sale of investments are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds 
and the original or amortised cost and are recorded on the date of sale. Unrealised gains and losses, arising on financial assets 
measured at fair value through profit and loss which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, represent the 
difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or the purchase value for 
investments acquired during the year, net of the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of 
disposals made during the year.

d. Taxes 
i) Current income tax 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not  
in the income statement.  
ii) Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.  
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised  
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting  
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
e. Foreign currencies 
i) Transactions and balances 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group at their respective functional currency spot rate at the date  
the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated  
at the functional currency spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting date. Differences arising on settlement or translation  
of monetary items are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction. 
Non-monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined. 
The gains or losses arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value are treated in line with the recognition of 
gains or losses arising on a change in the fair value of the item (i.e. the translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss 
is recognised in other comprehensive income or the income statement are also recognised in other comprehensive income or the 
income statement respectively). 
ii) Group companies 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into pounds sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting 
date and their income statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange 
differences arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component 
of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recycled to the income statement.

f. Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired are measured on initial recognition at cost. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are 
measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition and, following initial recognition are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding internally developed software, are  
not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in the income statement in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic life on a basis appropriate to the consumption of the asset 
and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period 
and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. 
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are 
considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the income statement in the expense category that is 
consistent with the function of the intangible assets. 
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the 
cash generating unit (‘CGU’) level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
g. Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate  
of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date at fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at  
fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.  
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent 
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument within the scope of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’ is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. If the cost 
of acquisition is less than the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business, the difference is treated as 
negative goodwill and is recognised directly in the income statement in the year of acquisition.  
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs at the 
point of acquisition and is reviewed annually for impairment.

h. Impairment of non-financial assets 
The Group undertakes a full impairment review of the carrying value of goodwill at each reporting date. The Group also assesses at 
each reporting date whether there is any indication that any other non-financial assets may be impaired. If such an indication exists, 
the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying 
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.  
In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less 
costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate 
valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded 
companies or other available fair value indicators. The Group bases its impairment calculations on detailed budgets, plans and long-
term growth assumptions, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s CGUs to which individual assets are allocated.  
i. Joint arrangements 
The Group participates in joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with another party. A joint arrangement  
is classified as a joint operation or joint venture, depending on management’s assessment of the legal form and substance of 
the arrangement. 
The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated 
financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group’s investment and share of results of joint ventures are shown  
within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement respectively. 
j. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Where an item  
of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for separately. 
Likewise, when a major inspection or dry-docking of a cruise ship is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount  
of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repairs and maintenance costs are 
recognised in the income statement as incurred.  
Assets in the course of construction at the balance sheet date are classified separately. These assets are transferred to other 
asset categories when they become available for their intended use. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the depreciable amount of property,  
plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. The depreciable amount is the cost of an asset less its residual value.  
Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Costs relating to cruise ship mandatory dry-dockings are capitalised and depreciated over the period up to the next dry-docking 
where appropriate. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from  
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognised. 
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.

k. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. To be classified as held for sale, an asset must be available for immediate sale  
in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and the sale must be highly 
probable. Sale is considered to be highly probable when management is committed to a plan to sell an asset and an active 
programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair 
value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classification. Non-current assets 
classified as held for sale are carried on the Group’s statement of financial position at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised. 
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount of profit  
or loss after tax from discontinued operations in the income statement. 
l. Financial instruments 
i) Financial assets 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments 
or available for sale financial assets. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and they are 
accounted on a trade date basis. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. 
Subsequent measurement 
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below: 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’) 
Financial assets at FVTPL are assets: 
• which upon initial recognition are designated at fair value through the income statement to eliminate or significantly reduce  
a measurement recognition inconsistency, or  
• which are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or forming part of the portfolio of financial instruments 
that are managed together and for which there is evidence of short-term profit taking. 
Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments and hedge funds are classified as FVTPL. Financial assets at 
FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the income statement. The fair values are quoted 
market prices (where there is an active market) or are based on valuation techniques (where there is no active market or the 
securities are unlisted). Valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis  
and other commonly used valuation techniques.  
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate (‘EIR’) method, less impairment losses. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the income 
statement. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the income statement in finance costs. 
Available for sale financial investments 
Available for sale financial investments include debt securities and money market funds. After initial measurement, available for sale 
financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive 
income in the available for sale reserve until the investment is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognised 
in other operating income, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative loss is reclassified to the income statement  
in finance costs and removed from the available for sale reserve. Interest income on available for sale debt securities is calculated 
using the EIR and is recognised in the income statement.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
l. Financial instruments (continued) 
Derecognition 
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or when the Group has 
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party. 
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if there is objective evidence of 
impairment as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) 
and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can 
be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulty, or 
where observable data indicates that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears 
or other factors that correlate with defaults. 
Loans and receivables 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as loans and 
receivables has been incurred, the Group measures the amount of the loss as the difference between the carrying amount of 
the asset or group of assets and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets, discounted 
at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial recognition. 
Impairment losses are assessed individually where significant, or collectively for assets that are not individually significant.  
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement and the carrying amount of the financial asset or group of financial 
assets is reduced by establishing an allowance for the impairment losses. If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment 
loss reduces and the reduction can be ascribed to an event after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised loss 
is reversed by adjusting the allowance.  
Available for sale financial investments  
When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised directly in equity and there is 
objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement. 
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value. Impairment losses 
on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement, but those on available for sale debt 
instruments are reversed if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event. Subsequent increases 
in the fair value of available for sale debt instruments are all recognised in equity. 
ii) Financial liabilities 
Initial recognition and measurement 
Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives designated as 
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at 
initial recognition. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable 
transaction costs. 
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.

l. Financial instruments (continued) 
ii) Financial liabilities (continued) 
Subsequent measurement 
The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL 
Derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are 
stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the income statement.  
Loans and borrowings and other payables 
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings and other payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process. 
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral 
part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance costs in the income statement. 
Derecognition 
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and 
the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
iii) Derivatives 
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subsequent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are recognised in 
the income statement. Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are 
negative. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more 
than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.  
iv) Fair values 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives and financial instruments classified as available for sale and at 
FVTPL, at fair value at each reporting date.  
Fair value is the price that would be required to sell an asset or to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market accessible by the Group for the asset or liability or in the absence of 
a principal market, in the most advantageous market accessible by the Group for the asset or liability.  
The fair values are quoted market prices where there is an active market or are based on valuation techniques when there is no 
active market or the instruments are unlisted. Valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length market transactions, 
discounted cash flow analysis and other commonly used valuation techniques. An analysis of the fair values of financial instruments 
and further details as to how they are measured are provided below. 
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole. 
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
l. Financial instruments (continued) 
v) Hedge accounting 
The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges of certain forecast transactions. These 
transactions are highly probable to occur and present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect amounts 
determined in profit or loss. 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge, the effective part of any fair value gain or loss on the derivative 
financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the fair value gain or loss is recognised 
immediately within the income statement. 
When a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, any associated 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and reclassified into the income statement in the same period in which 
the asset or liability affects profit or loss. When a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-
financial asset or non-financial liability, any associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included 
in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.  
For foreign currency hedges, prospective hedge effectiveness testing is performed at the inception of the hedging relationship, and 
subsequently at each balance sheet date, through comparison of the projected fair values of the hedged forecast transaction and 
the hedging instrument using a combination of the hypothetical derivative approach and sensitivity analysis, as part of the dollar-
offset method. Retrospective hedge testing is also performed at each reporting date using the dollar-offset method, by comparing 
the cumulative changes in the fair values of the forecast hedged transaction and the hedging instrument. 
For fuel oil hedges, prospective hedge effectiveness testing is performed at the inception of the hedging relationship, and 
subsequently at each balance sheet date, using regression analysis. This method involves calculating the strength of the correlation 
between the price of the derivative and the price of the fuel oil being purchased. Retrospective hedge testing is also performed at 
each reporting date using the same technique. 
When a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, through maturity, sale, other termination, or 
the revoking of the designated hedging relationship, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedged forecast 
transaction is still expected to occur, the associated cumulative gain or loss remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised 
in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative unrealised gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately. 
m. Leases 
Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases. All other 
leases are operating leases.  
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the statement of financial position and depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term or their expected useful lives. The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the 
capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.  
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Income arising from operating leases where the Group acts as lessor is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
and included in operating income due to its operating nature. 
n. Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing 
costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
o. Cash and short-term deposits 
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits 
with a maturity of three months or less from their inception date. 
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, short-term deposits as 
defined above and short-term highly liquid investments (including money market funds) with original maturities of three months  
or less which are subject to insignificant risk of change in value, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.  
p. Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include all costs incurred in bringing each product to 
its present location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be 
incurred to completion and disposal. 
q. Insurance contract liabilities  
Insurance contract liabilities include an outstanding claims provision, a provision for unearned premiums and, if required, a provision 
for premium deficiency.  
Outstanding claims provision 
The provision for outstanding claims is set on an individual claim basis and is based on the ultimate cost of all claims notified but not 
settled less amounts already paid by the reporting date, together with a provision for related claims handling costs. The provision 
also includes the estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported at the statement of financial position date, which is set using 
statistical methods. The outstanding claims provision is not discounted for the time value of money with the exception of claims 
settled on a periodical payment orders (‘PPOs’) basis. 
The amount of any anticipated reinsurance, salvage or subrogation recoveries is separately identified and reported within trade and 
other receivables and insurance contract liabilities respectively. 
Differences between the provisions at the reporting date and settlements and provisions in the following year (known as ‘run off 
deviations’) are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Provision for unearned premiums 
The provision for unearned premiums represents that portion of premiums received or receivable that relates to risks that have not 
yet expired at the reporting date. The provision is recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged, and is 
brought to account as premium income over the term of the contract in accordance with the pattern of insurance service provided 
under the contract. 
Provision for premium deficiency 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews its unexpired risks and a liability adequacy test is performed to determine whether there 
is any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums. This calculation uses current 
estimates of future contractual cash flows after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the 
relevant insurance technical provisions. If these estimates show that the carrying amount of the unearned premiums (less related 
deferred acquisition costs) is inadequate, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up a provision for 
premium deficiency.

r. Reinsurance assets 
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on insurance contracts 
issued are classified as reinsurance contracts. A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant 
insurance risk transfer between the insurer and reinsurer. 
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Amounts recoverable 
from reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions in accordance with the relevant 
reinsurance contract. 
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment at each balance sheet date. For assets that are directly exposed to long-
tail PPO liabilities a general provision for impairment is provided, calculated on a wholesale basis by reference to published credit 
rating default curves. For all other reinsurance assets, the carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount only if there is 
objective evidence of impairment. 
The amount of any anticipated reinsurance recoveries is treated as a reduction in claims costs. Where this amount is material, it 
is reported separately in the statement of financial position, except where the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangement 
necessitates the set-off of its associated financial assets and liabilities. 
IFRS 4 prohibits the offsetting of reinsurance assets against the related insurance liabilities, unless the appropriate legal 
requirements are met. Financial assets and liabilities arising under quota share agreements must be offset and the net amount 
reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the associated amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise both the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The contractual terms of the 
new funds-withheld quota share agreement in motor insurance requires such a set-off of associated amounts. 
s. Share-based payments 
The Group provides benefits to employees (including Directors) in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby 
employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (‘equity-settled transactions’). The cost of equity-settled 
transactions is measured by reference to the fair value on the grant date and is recognised as an expense over the relevant 
vesting period, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award.  
Fair values of share-based payment transactions are calculated using Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo modelling techniques.  
In valuing equity-settled transactions, assessment is made of any vesting conditions to categorise these into market performance 
conditions, non-market performance conditions and service conditions. 
Where the equity-settled transactions have market performance conditions (that is, performance which is directly or indirectly linked 
to the share price), the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is not changed, regardless of the actual level of 
vesting achieved, except where the employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date. 
For service conditions and non-market performance conditions, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is 
reassessed at each reporting date to reflect updated expectations for the level of vesting. No expense is recognised for awards that 
ultimately do not vest. 
At each reporting date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and, in the case of non-market conditions, the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest 
or, in the case of instruments subject to market conditions, the fair value on grant adjusted only for leavers. The movement in the 
cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding increase in 
share-based payments reserve. 
Upon vesting of an equity instrument, the cumulative cost in the share-based payments reserve is reclassified to retained earnings 
in equity. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

t. Retirement benefit schemes 
During the year, the Group operated a number of defined benefit pension plans which require contributions to be made to 
separately administered funds. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined separately using 
the projected unit credit valuation method.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising in the year are credited/charged to other comprehensive income and comprise the effects of 
changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments due to differences between the previous actuarial assumptions 
and what has actually occurred. In particular, the difference between the interest income and the actual return on plan assets 
is recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit, which include the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any 
curtailment or settlements, are recognised in the income statement. Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on 
the earlier of the date of plan curtailment and the date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs. The interest cost less 
interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement.  
The defined benefit schemes are funded, with assets of the schemes held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee 
administered funds. Scheme assets are measured using market values and scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit 
actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency 
to the liability. Full actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each reporting date. The resulting defined 
benefit asset or liability is presented separately after other net assets and liabilities on the face of the statement of financial position. 
The value of a pension benefit asset is restricted to the amount that may be recovered either through reduced contributions or 
agreed refunds from the scheme. 
For defined contribution schemes, the amounts charged to the income statement are the contributions payable in the year. 
u. Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it  
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed,  
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating  
to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where 
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 
A provision is recognised for onerous contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs reflect the least net cost of exiting the 
contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. 
v. Equity 
The Group has ordinary shares that are classified as equity. Incremental external costs that are directly attributable to the issue 
of these shares are recognised in equity, net of tax.

2.4 Standards issued but not yet effective 
The following is a list of standards and amendments to standards that are in issue but are not effective or adopted as at 31 January 
2017. Comment on these new standards or amendments is as follows: 
a. IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
In July 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ that will essentially replace IAS 39. The classification and measurement 
of financial assets and liabilities will be directly linked to the nature of the instrument’s contractual cash flows and the business 
model employed by the holder of the instrument. The Group has begun work to determine the full impact of this standard on the 
Group’s financial statements. Our initial assessment is that the standard is likely to enable a greater proportion of derivatives to 
qualify for hedge accounting, and so reduce the volatility of derivative gains and losses in the Group’s income statement. Besides 
from this, the Group believes that the standard is unlikely to have a significant effect on the recognition, measurement and 
presentation of its other financial instruments. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018,  
and was endorsed by the EU on 22 November 2016. 
b. IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
The objective of IFRS 15 is to establish the principles that an entity should apply to report useful information to users of financial 
statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. 
The Group has begun work to determine the full impact of this standard on the Group’s financial statements.  
Our initial assessment is that the standard will be unlikely to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements. For 
insurance brokerage, the majority of the Group’s performance obligations are discharged when arranging cover for its customers, 
which is on or just before the cover start date of the policy and is when the Group currently recognises the associated revenue. 
Revenue from insurance underwriting is out of scope and so is unaffected by this standard. For tour operations, the majority of the 
Group’s performance obligations are discharged on the customer’s departure date, which is when the Group currently recognises 
the associated revenue. For Cruising, revenue is currently recognised on a straight-line basis over the duration of each cruise,  
and this is likely to remain appropriate under the new standard. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2018, and was endorsed by the EU on 22 September 2016. 
c. IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 specifies how to recognise, measure, present and disclose leases, and will essentially replace IAS 17. The impact of this 
standard on the Group’s financial statements is still being assessed. The standard was issued in January 2016 and is effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, although this is yet to be endorsed by the EU. 
d. Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’ 
The amendments to IAS 12 clarify the recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses related to debt instruments  
measured at fair value. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with earlier application 
being permitted, although this is yet to be endorsed by the EU and will have no effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
e. Amendments to IAS 7 ‘Disclosure Initiative’  
The amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities 
arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendments are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with earlier application being permitted, although this is yet  
to be endorsed by the EU and will have no effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
f. Clarifications to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
The amendments provide some illustrative factors that an entity might consider in making the assessment as to whether promised 
goods or services are distinct. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier 
application being permitted, although this is yet to be endorsed by the EU. 
g. Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions’ 
The amendments to IFRS 2 clarify the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on cash-settled share-based 
payments, the classification of share-based payment transactions with net settlement features for withholding tax obligations and the 
accounting for a modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the transaction from cash-settled  
to equity-settled. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application being 
permitted, although this is yet to be endorsed by the EU and will have no effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
h. Amendments to IAS 40 ‘Transfers of Investment Property’ 
The amendments to IFRS 40 clarify that an entity can only reclassify a property to/from investment property when, and only when, 
there is evidence that a change in the use of the property has occurred. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2018, with earlier application being permitted, although this is yet to be endorsed by the EU and will have no 
effect on the Group’s financial statements.

2.5 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
discussed below: 
a. Valuation of insurance contract liabilities 
For insurance contracts, estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and 
for the expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (‘IBNR’) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period of 
time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty. For some types of policies, IBNR claims form the majority of 
the liability in the statement of financial position. 
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as 
Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. 
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims 
development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, 
average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Historical 
claims development is mainly analysed by accident years, but can also be further analysed by geographical area, as well as by 
significant business lines and claim types. Large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value 
of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development. In most cases, no explicit assumptions 
are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios. Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historical 
claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to 
which past trends may not apply in future, (e.g. to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public 
attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such 
as portfolio mix, policy features and claims handling procedures) in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that 
present the likely outcome from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all of the uncertainties involved. 
The ultimate cost of claims is not discounted except for those in respect of PPOs. The valuation of these claims involves making 
assumptions about the rate of inflation and the expected rate of return on assets to determine the discount rate. Due to the size 
of PPO claims, the ultimate cost is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. The assumptions are reviewed at each 
reporting date. 
Similar judgements, estimates and assumptions are employed in the assessment of the adequacy of provisions for unearned 
premium. Judgement is also required in determining whether the pattern of insurance service provided by a contract requires 
amortisation of unearned premium on a basis other than time apportionment. 
b. Goodwill impairment testing 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs 
to which goodwill is allocated. The value-in-use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the CGUs at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
c. Valuation of pension benefit obligation 
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and the present value of the pension obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. 
The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary 
increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its 
long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at 
each reporting date.

3 Segmental information 
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services. The Group has three 
reportable operating segments as follows: 
• Insurance: the segment primarily comprises general insurance products. Revenue is derived primarily from insurance premiums 
and broking revenues. This segment is further analysed into four product sub-segments: 
− Motor broking 
− Home broking  
− Other insurance broking 
− Underwriting 
• Travel: the segment primarily comprises the operation and delivery of package tours and cruise holiday products. The Group 
owns and operates two cruise ships and throughout the year owned and operated one hotel. All other holiday products are 
packaged together with third party supplied accommodation, flights and other transport arrangements. 
• Emerging Businesses and Central Costs: the segment comprises the Group’s other businesses and its central cost base. 
The other businesses primarily include the financial services product offering including the wealth management joint venture, 
the domiciliary care services offering, a monthly subscription magazine product and the Group’s internal mailing house. 
Segment performance is primarily evaluated using the Group’s key performance measure of profit before tax. Items not allocated 
to a segment relate to transactions that do not form part of the on-going segment performance or which are managed on a 
Group basis. 
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 
Segment income, expenses and results includes transfers between business segments which are then eliminated on consolidation. 
Current taxes, deferred taxes and certain financial assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments as they are also managed 
on a Group basis.

Primecare Services Limited arose when it formed part of the Group in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the Nestor Primecare 
Services Limited and Saga Investment Services Limited tax losses, the underlying tax effective rate was 20.2%. 
The expense for the prior year included a £7.6m benefit from the utilisation under the group relief rules of tax losses from Acromas, 
which arose when Saga was a part of the Acromas Group. Excluding the impact of the Acromas tax losses, the underlying tax 
effective rate was 20.3%.

Reductions were enacted in the Finance Act 2015 to reduce the rate from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017, and to 18% from 1 April 
2020. A further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020 was announced on 16 March 2016 and has been enacted at the balance sheet 
date. As a result, the closing deferred tax balances have been reflected at 17%. 
The Group has tax losses which arose in the UK of £4.2m (2016: £4.2m) that are available indefinitely for offsetting against future 
taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. 
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere 
in the Group, they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time, and there are no other tax planning 
opportunities or other evidence of recoverability in the near future. If the Group were able to recognise all unrecognised deferred  
tax assets, the profit would increase by £0.7m (2016: £0.8m).

11 Earnings per share 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit after tax for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by also including the  
weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all potentially dilutive options. 
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the 
date of authorisation of these financial statements.

a.  Acquisitions during the year ended 31 January 2017 
There were no acquisitions in the year ended 31 January 2017. 
b. Acquisitions in prior periods 
i) Destinology Limited 
On 13 August 2014, the Group acquired a 75% shareholding in Destinology Limited (‘Destinology’) with an option to acquire the 
remaining 25% shareholding at a later date. Accordingly, the subsequent purchase was considered to be a linked transaction and 
Destinology was consolidated as a 100% subsidiary. 
ii) Bennetts Biking Services Limited 
On 1 July 2015, the Group acquired a 100% shareholding in Bennetts Biking Services Limited (‘Bennetts’), the UK’s premier 
motorbike insurance specialist.  
The acquisition cost of £26.3m was settled in cash. Transaction costs of £0.5m were expensed and included as part of the  
non-trading items within administrative and selling expenses. Cash of £0.4m was acquired with Bennetts, resulting in a net 
cash outflow of £25.9m.

The goodwill arising on acquisition of £13.6m represented the fair value arising from the acquired management structure, strategic 
knowledge, capability and other synergies arising on acquisition. 
From the date of acquisition, Bennetts contributed £10.5m of revenue and £0.4m to the Group profit before tax for the year ended 
31 January 2016. Had these acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the financial year, contribution to Group revenue and profit 
before tax for the full year would have been £19.3m and £1.5m respectively.

15 Impairment of intangible assets 
a. Goodwill 
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to CGUs on initial recognition. Additions to goodwill during 
the prior year relating to Bennetts have been allocated to a new CGU relating to the new subsidiary only. The carrying value of 
goodwill by CGU is as follows: 
 
2017 
£’m 
2016 
£’m 
Insurance, excluding Bennetts 1,398.6 1,398.6 
Insurance, Bennetts 13.6 13.6 
Travel, excluding Destinology 59.8 59.8 
Travel, Destinology 13.0 13.0 
 1,485.0 1,485.0 
The Group has tested all goodwill for impairment at 31 January 2017. The impairment test compares the recoverable amount  
of the goodwill of each CGU to its carrying value. The goodwill associated with the Bennetts and Destinology businesses have  
been considered separately, however as these businesses become more integrated into the overall insurance and travel businesses 
respectively, it is likely to be necessary to consider them as part of the insurance and travel CGUs. 
The recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash flow projections from 
the Group’s five year plan to 2021/22. Terminal values have been included using 3% as the expected long-term average growth 
rate of the UK economy, and calculated using the Gordon growth model. 
The pre-tax cash flows of each CGU have been discounted considering the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant 
capable of acquiring a similar business. For the insurance and Bennetts CGUs, the pre-tax discount rate has been assessed to be 
7.6%, and for the travel and Destinology CGUs, it has been assessed to be 10.0%.  
The value-in-use calculation is most sensitive to the assumptions used for growth and for the discount rate. Accordingly, stress 
testing has been performed on these key assumptions as part of the impairment test to determine whether any reasonably 
foreseeable change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be lower than its 
carrying amount. 
To undertake the stress testing, terminal values were separately recalculated using 1.5% growth and nil growth, nil market inflation 
and the relevant discount rate was separately increased by 3%. No evidence of any impairment was seen under any of these stress 
test scenarios. Consequently, no impairment of goodwill has been recognised.  
b. Other intangible assets 
Separately identifiable intangible assets are valued and their appropriate useful lives established at the time of acquisition. 
The carrying values of these assets and their remaining useful lives are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. 
The Group has assessed the recoverable amount of intangible assets as at 31 January 2017 and concluded that no impairment 
is required.

c. Fair values 
Financial instruments held at fair value are valued using quoted market prices or other valuation techniques.  
Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, and comparison to similar instruments for which 
market observable prices exist. Assumptions and market observable inputs used in valuation techniques include foreign currency 
exchange rates and future oil prices.  
The objective of using valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value determination that reflects the price of the financial instrument 
at the reporting date which would have been determined by market participants acting at arm’s length.  
Observable prices are those that have been seen either from counterparties or from market pricing sources including Bloomberg. 
The use of these depends upon the liquidity of the relevant market. 
The fair value and carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities are materially the same. Financial instruments held at fair 
value have been categorised into a fair value measurement hierarchy as follows: 
i) Level 1 
These are valuation techniques that are based entirely on quoted market prices in an actively traded market and are the most 
reliable. All money market funds and debt securities are categorised as Level 1 as the fair value is obtained directly from the 
quoted market price. 
ii) Level 2 
These are valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are taken from observable market data. These include valuation 
models used to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows and may be employed either when no active market  
exists or when there are quoted prices available for similar instruments in active markets. The models incorporate various inputs 
including the credit quality of counterparties, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying instrument.

c. Fair values (continued) 
ii) Level 2 (continued) 
All the derivative financial instruments are categorised as Level 2 as the fair values are obtained from the counterparty, brokers  
or valued using observable inputs. Where material, CVA/DVA risk adjustment is factored into the fair values of these instruments.  
As at 31 January 2017, the marked-to-market values of derivative assets are net of a credit valuation adjustment attributable  
to derivative counterparty default risk. 
The fair values are periodically reviewed by the Group’s treasury committees. 
iii) Level 3 
These are valuation techniques for which any one or more significant inputs are not based on observable market data.

There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and no non-recurring fair value measurements of assets and liabilities 
during the year (2016: none).  
The unlisted equity shares represent the Group's investment in ‘K’ ordinary shares of Lyons Davidson LLP and have been valued 
considering the cost of the initial investment and the post-investment trading profits. 
The loan notes represent two notes with a face value of £3.5m each which attract uncompounded interest at a rate of 5% 
and mature on 30 May 2018 and 30 May 2019. These notes are not actively traded in any market and have been valued by 
determining a market-participant discount rate including a credit valuation adjustment to allow for counterparty default risk, 
and discounting them to present value.

d. Cash flow hedges 
i) Forward currency risk 
During the year ended 31 January 2017, the Group designated 322 foreign exchange forward currency contracts as hedges 
of highly probable foreign currency cash expenses in future periods. These contracts are entered into to minimise the Group’s 
exposure to foreign exchange risk.

Hedging instruments for other currencies are in respect of Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen, 
New Zealand dollars, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Thai baht and South African rand. 
ii) Commodity price risk 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in the price of fuel. The Group enters into 
fixed price contracts (swaps) in the management of its fuel price exposures. These contracts are expected to reduce the volatility 
attributable to price fluctuations of fuel and are designated as cash flow hedges. Hedging the price volatility of forecast fuel 
purchases is in accordance with the risk management strategy outlined by the Board of Directors.

The foreign currency hedge which will be determined in July 2019 of £244.0m relates to the delivery of the ship (note 30). 
During the year, the Group recognised net gains of £11.1m (2016: £6.3m gains) on cash flow hedging instruments through other 
comprehensive income into the hedging reserve. Additionally, the Group recognised net gains of £34.2m (2016: £10.3m gains) 
through other comprehensive income into the hedging reserve, in relation to the specific hedging instrument for the acquisition  
of a new ship (note 30). The overall net gains of £45.3m are offset by a net £1.9m loss on forecast transactions recognised in  
the financial statements. The Group recognised a £0.8 loss (2016: £0.3m loss) though the income statement in respect of the 
ineffective portion of hedges measured during the year. 
There has been no de-designation of hedges during the year ended 31 January 2017 as a result of cash flows forecast that are  
no longer expected to occur, or as a result of failed ineffectiveness testing. During the year, the Group recognised a £11.4m gain 
through the income statement in respect of matured hedges, which has been recycled from other comprehensive income. No 
amounts have been removed from the hedging reserve to be included in the carrying value of non-financial assets and liabilities.

18 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these 
financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group’s principal 
financial assets include debt securities, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, loan funds and hedge funds. The 
Group also enters into derivative transactions such as foreign exchange forward contracts, fuel and gas oil swaps and interest rate 
swaps to manage its exposures to various risks. 
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and insurance risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the 
management of these risks, supported by the Group Treasury function and treasury committees within the key areas of the Group 
that advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. The treasury committees 
ensure that the Group’s financial risks are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, 
measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. All derivative activities are for risk management 
purposes and are carried out by the Group’s Treasury function. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative 
purposes may be undertaken. 
The Group manages concentration risk through a policy of diversification that is outlined in the Group Treasury Policy and  
approved by the Board. The policy defines the exposure limit to third party institutions based on the credit ratings of the individual 
counterparties, combined with the views of the Board. On a monthly basis, exposure to each counterparty is calculated and 
reported, and compliance with the policy is monitored. 
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. 
a. Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. The Group is exposed to the following market risk factors: 
• foreign currency risk;  
• commodity price risk; and 
• interest rate risk. 
The Group has policies and limits approved by the Board for managing the market risk exposure. These set out the principles 
that the business should adhere to for managing market risk and establishing the maximum limits the Group is willing to accept 
considering strategy, risk appetite and capital resources.  
The Group has the ability to monitor market risk exposure on a daily basis and has established limits for each component of 
market risk.  
The Group uses derivatives for hedging its exposure to foreign currency, fuel oil prices and interest rate risks. The market risk 
policy explicitly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. 
i) Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial asset or liability will fluctuate because of changes 
in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s 
operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a different currency from the Group’s presentation currency).  
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the majority of its transaction exposures. The foreign exchange 
forward contracts, some of which are formally designated as hedging instruments, are entered into for periods consistent with 
the foreign currency exposure of the underlying transactions, generally from one to 24 months. The foreign exchange forward 
contracts vary with the level of expected foreign currency sales and purchases.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the fair value of forward exchange contracts to a 5% change in US dollar  
and Euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other 
currencies is not material. The impact is shown net of tax at the current rate.

 USD +/- £3.2m 
   
2016 EUR – Trading  +/- £5.3m 
 EUR – New ship +/- £12.3m 
 USD +/- £3.6m 
ii) Commodity price risk 
The Group is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing purchase of fuel and 
gas oil to sail its cruise ships and therefore require a continuous supply of fuel and gas oil. The volatility in the price of fuel and gas 
oil has led to the decision to enter into commodity fuel and gas oil swap contracts. These contracts are expected to reduce the 
volatility attributable to price fluctuations of fuel and gas oil. Managing the price volatility of forecast oil purchases is in accordance 
with the risk management strategy outlined by the Board of Directors.  
The Group manages the purchase price using forward commodity purchase contracts based on a 24 month forecast of the 
required fuel oil supply.  
The following table shows the sensitivity of the fair value of fuel oil swaps to changes in the US dollar exchange rate with all other 
variables held constant. The impact is shown net of tax at the current rate.

Effect on profit 
after tax and equity 
2017 USD – Fuel oil price +/- £0.8m 
   
2016 USD – Fuel oil price +/- £0.8m 
iii) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk arises primarily from medium and long-term investments in fixed interest securities. The market value of these 
investments is affected by the movement in interest rates. This is managed by a policy of holding all investments to maturity  
by closely matching asset and liability duration. 
It is also ensured that the investment portfolio has a diversified range of investments such that there is a combination of fixed  
and floating rate securities, as well as other types of investments such as RPI linked securities and property. 
Interest rate risk also arises in respect of the Group’s borrowings where the interest rate attaching to those borrowings is not fixed. 
Where the Group perceives there to be a significant interest rate risk, it manages its exposure to such risks by purchasing interest 
rate caps to limit the risk.

b. Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading 
to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to its financial assets, outstanding derivatives and trade and 
other receivables. The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel oil and foreign 
currency contracts, and undrawn credit facilities. The Group primarily uses published credit ratings to assess counterparty strength 
and therefore to define the credit limit for each counterparty in accordance with approved treasury policies. 
The credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is limited as payment from customers is generally required before services 
are provided.  
Credit risk in relation to deposits and derivative counterparties is managed by the Group’s Treasury department in accordance with 
the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to 
each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and updated throughout the year subject to approval 
of the Group Board. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through any 
potential counterparty failure.  
The Group is exposed to the risk of default on the reinsurance arrangements in its insurance business when amounts recoverable 
under those arrangements become due. Credit risk in respect of reinsurance arrangements is assessed at the time of entering into 
a reinsurance contract. The Group’s reinsurance programme is only placed with reinsurers which meet the Group’s financial 
strength criteria. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statement of financial position at 31 January 2017 and  
31 January 2016 is the carrying amount except for derivative financial instruments. The Group’s maximum exposure for financial 
guarantees and financial derivative instruments is noted under liquidity risk. None of the financial assets were impaired at the 
reporting date. 
The Group’s financial assets are analysed by Moody’s rating as follows:

c. Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to enable it to 
meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk 
is to evaluate current and expected liquidity requirements to ensure that it maintains sufficient reserves of cash or availability on its 
revolving credit facility. The Group manages its obligations to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due by matching the maturity 
of investments to the expected maturity of claims payments. 
The table below analyses the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities on contractual undiscounted payments. The analysis of  
non-derivative financial liabilities is based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The analysis 
of claims outstanding is based on the expected dates on which the claims will be settled.

d. Insurance risk 
Insurance risk arises from the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence, cost and timing of insured events that could lead to 
significant individual or aggregated claims in terms of quantity or value. This could be for a number of reasons, including weather-
related events, large individual claims, changes in claimant behaviour patterns such as increased levels of fraudulent activities, the 
use of PPOs, prospective or retrospective legislative changes, unresponsive and inaccurate pricing or reserving methodologies and 
the deterioration in the Group’s ability to effectively and efficiently handle claims while delivering excellent customer service.  
The Group manages insurance risk within its risk management framework as set out by the Board. The key policies and processes 
of mitigating these risks have been implemented which include underwriting partnership arrangements, reinsurance and excess  
of loss contracts, pricing policies and claims management, and administration policies. 
i) Underwriting and pricing risk 
The Group primarily underwrites motor insurance for private cars in the UK. The book consists of a large number of individual risks 
which are widely spread geographically which helps to minimise concentration risk. The Group has controls in place to restrict 
access to its products to only those risks it wishes to underwrite. 
The Group has management information to allow it to monitor underwriting performance on a continuous basis and the ability to 
make pricing and underwriting changes quickly. The Group undertakes detailed statistical analyses of underwriting experience for 
each rating factor and combinations of rating factors to enable it to adjust pricing for emerging trends. 
ii) Reserving risk 
Reserving risk is the risk that insufficient funds have been set aside to settle claims as they fall due. The Group undertakes regular 
internal actuarial reviews and commissions external actuarial reviews at least once a year. These reviews estimate the future 
liabilities in order to consider the adequacy of the provisions. 
Claims which are subject to PPOs are a significant source of uncertainty in the claims reserves. Cash flow projections are 
undertaken for PPO claims to estimate the gross and net of reinsurance provisions required. PPO provisions are discounted  
to reflect future investment returns and cost inflation. 
iii) Reinsurance 
The Group purchases reinsurance to reduce the impact of individual large losses or accumulations from a single catastrophe event. 
During 2016, the Group entered into a funds-withheld quota share reinsurance contract that reinsures 75% of the Group’s motor 
claim risks, effective from 1 February 2016. Prior to this, the Group had quota share reinsurance in place for third party branded 
motor business for drivers aged under 50. The Group also purchases individual excess of loss protections for the motor portfolio to 
limit the impact of a single large claim. Similar protections are in place for all years for which the Group has written motor business.  
Reinsurance recoveries on individual excess of loss protections can take many years to collect, particularly if a claim is subject to a 
PPO. This means that the Group has exposure to reinsurance credit risk for many years. Reinsurers are therefore required to have 
strong credit ratings and their financial health is regularly monitored. 
iv) Sensitivities 
The following table demonstrates the impact on profit and loss and equity of a 1 percentage point variation in the recorded loss ratio 
at 31 January 2017 and 31 January 2016. The impact of a 1% change in claims outstanding is also shown at the same dates. The 
impact is shown net of reinsurance and tax at the current rate. 
 
2017 2016

e. Operational risk 
Effective operational risk management requires the Group to identify, assess, manage, monitor, report and mitigate all areas of 
exposure. The Group operates across a range of segments and operational risk is inherent in all of the Group’s products and 
services, arising from the operation of assets, from external events and dependencies, and from internal processes and systems. 
The Group manages its operational risk through the risk management framework agreed by the Board, and through the use of risk 
management tools which together ensure that operational risks are identified, managed and mitigated to the level accepted, and 
that contingency processes and disaster recovery plans are in place. Regular reporting is undertaken to segment boards and 
includes details of new and emerging risks, as well as monitoring of existing risks. Testing of contingency processes and disaster 
recovery plans is undertaken to ensure the effectiveness of these processes. 
All of the Group’s operations are dependent on the proper functioning of its IT and communication systems; on its properties and 
other infrastructure assets; on the need to adequately maintain and protect customer and employee data and other information;  
and on the ability of the Group to attract and retain staff. Specific areas of operational risk by segment include: 
i) Insurance 
The Insurance segment is required to comply with various operational regulatory requirements primarily in the UK but also within 
Gibraltar for its underwriting business. To the extent that significant external events could increase the incidence of claims, these 
would place additional strain on the claims handling function but any financial impact of such an event is considered to be an 
insurance risk. 
ii) Travel 
The travel segment operates two cruise ships which are the Group’s largest trading assets. Risk to the operation of these cruise 
ships arises from the impact of mechanical or other malfunction, non-compliance with regulatory requirements, and from global 
weather and socio-economic events. The tour holidays operated by the segment are also affected by global weather and socio-
economic events which impact either the Group directly or its suppliers. 
iii)  Emerging Businesses and Central Costs 
The financial services product business is required to comply with various operational regulatory requirements in the UK. 
The healthcare business provides a range of domiciliary services. Risk to the operation of this service arises mainly from the 
availability of appropriately skilled staff to deliver the level and standard of care required, and from the oversight of the delivery  
of these services. 
19 Interests in unconsolidated structured entities 
A structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor 
in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to the administrative tasks only and the relevant activities 
are directed by means of contractual agreements. The Group has interests in unconsolidated structured entities in the form of 
investment funds comprising: 
• hedge funds;  
• bank loan funds; and 
• money market funds. 
The nature and purpose of the hedge and bank loan funds is to diversify the investment portfolio and enhance the overall yield, 
whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk for the portfolio as a whole. 
The primary activity of the hedge funds is to invest in a wide range of securities and markets, and the funds may take a variety  
of positions in these markets. Bank loan funds invest in secured loans to companies rated below investment grade. 
The nature and purpose of the money market funds is to provide maximum security and liquidity for the funds invested whilst also 
providing an adequate return. The money market funds used by the Group are all members of the Institutional Money Market Funds 
Association. They are thus required to maintain specified liquidity and diversification characteristics of their underlying portfolios 
which comprise investment grade investments in financial institutions.

23 Retirement benefit schemes 
The Group operates retirement benefit schemes for the employees of the Group consisting of defined contribution plans and 
defined benefit plans. 
a. Defined contribution plans 
There are a number of defined contribution schemes in the Group. The total charge for the year in respect of the defined 
contribution schemes was £0.8m (2016: £1.3m). 
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of Trustees. 
b. Defined benefit plans 
The Group operates a funded defined benefit scheme, the Saga Pension Scheme (‘Saga scheme’), which is open to new members 
who accrue benefits on a career average salary basis. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in 
independently administered funds. 
The scheme is governed by the employment laws of the UK. The level of benefits provided depends on the member’s length of 
service and salary at retirement age. The scheme requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund which is 
governed by a Board of Trustees, and consists of an equal number of employer and employee representatives. The Board of 
Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for the definition of the investment strategy. 
The long-term investment objectives of the Trustees and the Group are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of 
the scheme over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term 
costs of the scheme. To meet those objectives, the scheme’s assets are invested in different categories of assets, with different 
maturities designed to match liabilities as they fall due. The investment strategy will continue to evolve over time and is expected 
to match to the liability profile increasingly closely. The pension liability is exposed to inflation rate risks and changes in the life 
expectancy for pensioners. As the plan assets include investments in quoted equities, the Group is exposed to equity market risk. 
The Group has provided a super security to the Trustees of the Saga scheme, which ranks before any liabilities under the Senior 
Facilities Agreement (as detailed in note 26). The value of the security is capped at £32.5m.  
During the prior year, the Group operated two other funded defined benefit schemes, the Nestor Healthcare Group Retirement  
Benefits Scheme and the Healthcall Group Limited Pension Scheme (‘Nestor schemes’), which provide benefits based on final  
salary and are closed to new members. Both of these schemes were part of the liabilities held for sale and were disposed of when  
the Group completed the sale of the local authority section of the healthcare business, Allied Healthcare, on 30 November 2015.

The principal assumptions used in determining pension benefit obligations for the Saga scheme are shown below: 
 2017 2016 
Real rate of increase in salaries 0% 0% 
Real rate of increase of pensions in payment 0% 0% 
Real rate of increase of pensions in deferment 0% 0% 
Discount rate – Pensioner 2.9% 3.6% 
Discount rate – Non Pensioner 3.0% 3.8% 
Inflation – Pensioner 3.4% 3.0% 
Inflation – Non Pensioner 3.4% 3.2% 
Mortality assumptions are set using standard tables based on specific experience where available and allow for future mortality 
improvements. The Saga scheme assumption is that a member currently aged 60 will live on average for a further 27 years if they 
are male and on average for a further 29 years if they are female. 
A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions as at 31 January 2017 and their impact on the net defined benefit 
obligation is as follows: 
Assumptions Discount rate Future inflation Life expectancy Future salary 
Sensitivity +/- 0.25% +/- 0.25% +/- 1 year +/- 0.5% 
 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease   
Impact £m (17.2) 18.6 12.6 (11.9) 7.5 (8.0) +/- 0.0 
Note: a positive impact represents an increase in the net defined benefit liability. 
The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. When calculating  
the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method has been applied as when 
calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. 
The expected contribution to the Saga scheme for the next year is £11.5m and average duration of the defined benefit plan 
obligation at the end of the reporting period is 23 years.  
Formal actuarial valuations take place every three years for the scheme. The assumptions adopted for actuarial valuations are determined 
by the Trustees and are agreed with the Group and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS 19 purposes, which 
are best estimate. Where a funding deficit is identified, the Group and the Trustees may agree a deficit recovery plan.  
The latest valuation of the Saga scheme was at 31 January 2014. Further to this valuation, a recovery plan is in place 
for the scheme.  
Under the agreed recovery plan, the Group made an additional payment of £2.0m during the year ended 31 January 2017,  
and will make further payments of £2.0m in each of the next eight years, with the last payment being made by 28 February 2024. 
The total expected contributions in the year ending 31 January 2018 are £11.5m, inclusive of the £2.0m additional payment.

The loss on purchasing reinsurance in 2017 was £16.5m (2016: £37.5m profit). 
On 27 February 2017, the UK Government announced its decision to reduce the Ogden discount rate from 2.5% to -0.75%.  
The insurance liabilities presented here and on the face of the Group’s balance sheet incorporate the effect of this change. 
Discounting 
Claims outstanding provisions are calculated on an undiscounted basis, with the exception of PPOs made by the courts as part 
of a bodily injury claim settlement. Claims outstanding provisions for PPOs are discounted at a rate of -1.5% (2016: -1.5%) 
representing the Group’s view on long-term carer wage inflation less the expected return on holding the invested financial assets 
associated with these claims. 
The value of claims outstanding before discounting was £624.9m (2016: £734.0m) gross of reinsurance and £410.0m  
(2016: £539.0m) net of reinsurance. 
The period between the balance sheet date and the estimated final payment date was calculated using Ogden life expectancy 
tables, with appropriate adjustments where necessary for impaired life. The average life expectancy from PPO settlement date to 
the final PPO payment was 39 years (2016: 42 years) and the rate of investment return used to determine the discounted value  
of claims provisions was 2.0% (2016: 2.0%).

Favourable claims development over the year has resulted in a £59.9m (2016: £68.0m) reduction in the net claims incurred in 
respect of prior years. Against this, the insolvency of a significant legal services supplier has required an increase in prior year  
net claims of £nil (2016: £0.5m) to be created; the cost of this has been included as part of total non-trading items (note 4b).

In April 2014, the Group entered into a Senior Facilities Agreement and drew £1,250.0m. At the end of May 2014, it used the 
receipt of £550.0m from the Group’s flotation to reduce the outstanding principal to £700.0m. 
The debt matures in April 2019, and interest is incurred at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 2.25%. The Group is required to comply 
with a leverage covenant on a quarterly basis and had significant headroom against this covenant at 31 January 2017.  
Under the facilities, the Group has access to a multi-currency revolving credit facility of £150.0m. During the year, the Group repaid 
£100.0m (2016: £220.0m) of its Senior Facilities Agreement, and at 31 January 2017 had drawn £100.0m (2016: £75.0m) of its 
£150.0m revolving credit facility. The Group incurs commitment fees on undrawn facilities and interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 
2.25% on drawn facilities. 
During the year, the Group charged £17.6m (2016: £21.8m) to the income statement in respect of fees and interest associated  
with the Senior Facilities Agreement. In addition, interest charged to the income statement includes £1.0m (2016: £3.4m) relating  
to interest on finance lease liabilities, net finance expense on pension schemes and other interest costs.

28 Capital management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the  
cost of capital.  
For the purposes of the Group’s capital management, capital comprises total equity as shown on the consolidated statement of 
financial position. The Group operates in a number of regulated markets and includes subsidiaries which are required to comply  
with specific requirements in respect of capital or other resources. 
The Group’s financial services businesses are regulated primarily by the Financial Services Commission (‘FSC’) in Gibraltar and by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) in the UK; and the capital requirements of its travel businesses are regulated by the Civil 
Aviation Authority (‘CAA’) in the UK. It is the Group’s policy to comply with the requirements of these regulators in respect of capital 
adequacy or other similar tests at all times. 
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 January 2017 or  
31 January 2016, other than those driven from changes to the requirements of the various regulators, notably the European Union’s 
Solvency II Directive for insurance companies. 
The Group’s regulated underwriting business is based in the Gibraltar and regulated by the FSC. The underwriting business is 
required to comply with various tests to ensure that it has a sufficient level of capitalisation. Under Solvency I, the FSC required the 
underwriting business to hold solvency capital of at least twice the required minimum margin (‘RMM’). The Group has historically 
monitored its compliance with this and other tests. 
Solvency II incorporated a fundamental change to the capital adequacy regime for the European insurance industry and established 
a revised set of capital requirements and risk management standards with the aim of increasing protection for policyholders.  
The new regime became effective on 1 January 2016.  
(The amounts set out in the following two paragraphs are unaudited) 
The Group monitored its ability to comply with the requirements of Solvency II throughout the year to 31 January 2016 and received 
approval from the FSC for the Undertaking of Specific Parameters route prior to the effective date. Under Solvency II AICL remained 
well capitalised, and at 31 January 2016, available capital was £219.6m against a Solvency Capital Requirement of £128.8m giving 
170% coverage. In the year to 31 January 2017, AICL continues to remain well capitalised, and at 31 January 2017, available 
capital was £146.7m against a Solvency Capital Requirement of £102.9m giving 142.6% coverage. 
The Group’s regulated insurance distribution businesses are based in the UK and regulated by the FCA. Due to the nature of  
these businesses, the capital requirements are significantly less than the underwriting business but the Group is required to comply 
with the Adequate Resources requirements of Threshold Condition 4 of the FCA Handbook. The Group undertakes a rigorous 
assessment against the requirements of this Condition on an annual basis and, as a consequence of this, calculates and holds an 
appropriate amount of capital in respect of these businesses. The Minimum Regulatory Capital requirement of these businesses at 
31 January 2017 was £6.1m (2016: £6.1m).  
The regulated travel businesses are required to comply with two main tests based on liquidity and leverage and are measured 
against agreed covenants on the last day of each quarter in respect of these tests. The Group monitors its compliance with these 
tests on a monthly basis including forward-looking compliance using budgets and forecasts. At 31 January 2017 and 31 January 
2016, the travel businesses had good coverage against both covenants.

29 Share-based payments 
The Group has granted a number of different equity-based awards to employees and customers which it has determined to be 
share-based payments: 
a. Share options and free shares offer granted at the time of the IPO 
• On 29 May 2014, share options over 13,132,410 shares were granted to certain Directors and employees with no exercise price 
and no service or performance vesting conditions. There are no cash settlement alternatives. 
• Eligible customers and employees who acquired their shares under the Customer or Employee Offers in the Prospectus received 
one bonus share for every twenty shares they acquired and held continuously for one year to 29 May 2015. As these are bonus 
shares, there was no exercise price and no cash settlement alternative. 
b. Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) and Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) 
• The LTIP is a discretionary executive share plan under which the Board may, within certain limits and subject to applicable 
performance conditions, grant options over shares in Saga plc. These options are 50% linked to a non-market vesting condition, 
EPS, and 50% linked to a market vesting condition, TSR.  
− On 30 June 2014 and 2 December 2014, options over 4,015,508 shares were issued which vest and become exercisable  
on the third anniversary of the grant date. 
− On 30 June 2015, options over 2,879,089 shares were issued which vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary  
of the grant date. 
− On 9 June 2015, options over 332,541 shares were issued under the Deferred Bonus Plan (‘DBP’) to the Executive Directors 
reflecting their deferred bonus in respect of 2014/15, which vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant 
date. Following cessation of employment of S M Howard on 30 June 2015, the options allocated to him became exercisable 
immediately. 
− On 16 May 2016, options over 3,749,786 shares were issued which vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary  
of the grant date. 
− On 27 May 2016, options over 334,522 shares were issued under the DBP to the Executive Directors reflecting their deferred 
bonus in respect of 2015/16, which vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date. 
− On 1 October 2016, options over 83,488 shares were issued which vest and become exercisable on the third anniversary  
of the grant date. 
c. Other share options 
• On 29 May 2014, share options over 2,162,162 shares were issued to the Chief Executive Officer. Vesting occurs 25% on the  
third anniversary of the IPO, 25% on the fourth anniversary of the IPO and 50% on the fifth anniversary of the IPO, subject to 
continuing employment. The award will be equity settled and has no cash alternative. The exercise price of the share options  
is £1.85. 
• On 29 April 2015, options over 101,932 shares were issued to the Chief Financial Officer which vest in two equal tranches  
on the first and second anniversary of his appointment, subject to continuing employment. 
• On 2 December 2015, options over 99,552 shares were issued to the Chief Marketing Officer which vest on the second 
anniversary of his appointment, subject to continuing employment.

average of the volatilities of its TSR comparator group over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the award 
immediately prior to the date of the grant. 
For future valuations, at a date when sufficient Saga share price data becomes available, the Group intends to estimate the 
Company volatility directly from this data. 
The total amount charged to the income statement in the year ended 31 January 2017 is £4.7m (2016: £2.8m). This has been 
charged to administrative and selling expenses £4.2m (2016: £2.5m) and non-trading items £0.5m (2016: £0.3m) (note 4b). 
The Group did not enter into any share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees during the current period.

c. Commitments 
On 21 December 2015, the Group contracted with Meyer Werft GmbH & Co. KG to purchase a new cruise ship for delivery in  
July 2019, with an option to purchase a second similar cruise ship for delivery in 2021. The new ship will replace one of the  
Group’s existing two ships. 
The first stage payment for the new ship was made in February 2016. Three similar stage payments will be made during the 
construction period (24 months, 18 months, and 12 months prior to delivery) funded via cash resources of the Group. The 
remaining element of the contract price is due on delivery of the ship, and the Group entered into appropriate financing for 
this on 21 December 2015. 
As at 31 January 2017, the capital amount contracted but not provided for in the financial statements in respect of the ship 
amounted to £280.1m (2016: £280.1m).  
The financing represents a 12 year fixed rate sterling loan, backed by an export credit guarantee. The loan value of approximately 
£245m will be repaid in 24 broadly equal instalments, with the first payment 6 months after delivery. The effective interest rate on 
the loan (including arrangement and commitment fees) is 4.29%. 
On the date the finance was entered into, the Group purchased Euro currency forwards totalling £273.2m to lock the cost of the 
ship. These have been designated as cash flow hedges and remain outstanding as at 31 January 2017 (note 17d). 
The Group has an option to purchase a second ship for the same price within the contract; the option must be exercised by 
21 December 2017. The Group may be released from this option at any time although should the option to purchase not be 
exercised, a fee would become payable. The likelihood of incurring such a fee is considered remote.

d. Contingent liabilities 
At 31 January 2017, the Group had secured £20.2m (2016: £31.8m) of financial bonds and other guarantees on a revolving credit 
facility provided to Saga Mid Co Limited. If these bonds were called, the facility would be treated as drawn and recognised as a 
liability on the Group’s balance sheet. The revolving credit facility is secured by a floating charge over the Group’s assets.  
The Association of British Travel Agents regulates the Group’s UK tour operating business and requires the Group to put in place 
bonds to provide customer protection. These bonds are included within the financial bonds described above. 
On 17 February 2017, certain entities in the Group were served with legal proceedings by the broker who acted on behalf of the 
ship yard for the committed purchase of the new cruise ship (see note 30c). The claimant has brought a claim alleging that these 
Saga companies are liable to pay commission on the first ship, plus interest and legal costs and separately, commission on the 
second ship should the option to purchase be exercised.  The amount of the claim is up to €7 million, depending on whether the 
option for the purchase of a second ship is exercised. 
It is too early in the litigation process to evaluate Saga's position on liability and quantum. As such, no amounts have been provided 
for this in the financial statements. Furthermore, in the event the claim is successful, the cost will be capitalised as part of assets in 
the course of construction within property, plant and equipment. 
31 Discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
On 30 November 2015, the Group completed the sale of the local authority section of the healthcare business, Allied Healthcare.

32 Related party transactions 
During the year ended 31 January 2016, the Saga Group agreed terms for the utilisation under the group relief rules of corporation 
tax losses from Acromas SPC Co Limited and Acromas Mid Co Limited, indirect investees in the Group, at a cost of 50% of the 
tax affected face value. Amounts payable by the Group in respect of the surrender of these tax losses of £7.6m were unpaid at 
31 January 2016 (see note 9) and settled in February 2016. 
G Williams, an independent Non-Executive Director of Saga plc, serves on the board of WNS (Holdings) Limited, the parent 
company of WNS Global Services (UK Limited) and WNS Assistance Limited, both of which Acromas Insurance Company Limited 
and PEC Services Limited, subsidiaries of Saga plc, traded with during the year. These subsidiaries of WNS (Holdings) Limited 
provided claim handling management services to Acromas Insurance Company Limited and PEC Services Limited, and during the 
year ended 31 January 2017 earned total fees of £3.6m (2016: £3.5m); further payments to these subsidiaries of WNS (Holdings) 
Limited in respect of repair costs on claims handled totalled £37.2m (2016: £40.2m). As at 31 January 2017, amounts owing to

1 Accounting policies  
a. Accounting convention 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ 
(‘FRS 101’) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The financial statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and  
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company’s financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million (£’m) except when 
otherwise indicated. 
The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the year ended  
31 January 2017. 
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101: 
a) the requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. 
b) the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. 
c) the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ to present comparative information  
in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1. 
d) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B-D, 40A-D, 111 and 134-136 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation 
of Financial Statements’. 
e) the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. 
f) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. 
g) the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’. 
h) the requirements in IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two  
or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such  
a member. 
b. Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at the lower of cost and net realisable value and reviewed for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
c. Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised.

1 Accounting policies (continued) 
c. Deferred tax (continued) 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised 
deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that  
future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised  
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in other comprehensive income. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
d. Share-based payments 
The Company provides benefits to employees (including Directors) of Saga plc and its subsidiary undertakings, in the form of  
share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled 
transactions). The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value on the grant date and is recognised 
as an expense over the relevant vesting period, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award.  
Fair values of share-based payment transactions are calculated using Black-Scholes modelling techniques. In valuing equity-settled 
transactions, assessment is made of any vesting conditions to categorise these into market performance conditions, non-market 
performance conditions and service conditions. 
Where the equity-settled transactions have market performance conditions (that is, performance which is directly or indirectly linked 
to the share price), the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is not changed, regardless of the actual level of 
vesting achieved, except where the employee ceases to be employed prior to the vesting date. 
For service conditions and non-market performance conditions, the fair value of the award is assessed at the time of grant and is 
reassessed at each reporting date to reflect updated expectations for the level of vesting. No expense is recognised for awards that 
ultimately do not vest. 
At each reporting date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and, in the case of non-market conditions, the best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest 
or, in the case of instruments subject to market conditions, the fair value on grant adjusted only for leavers. The movement in the 
cumulative expense since the previous reporting date is recognised in the income statement, with the corresponding increase in 
share-based payments reserve. 
Upon vesting of an equity instrument, the cumulative cost in the share-based payments reserve is reclassified to reserves.

Shareholder fraud 
Shareholders are advised to be wary 
of any unsolicited advice or offers, 
whether over the telephone, through 
the post or by email. If any such 
unsolicited communication is received 
please check the company or person 
contacting you is properly authorised by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) 
before getting involved. Fraudsters use 
persuasive and high-pressure tactics 
to lure investors into scams. They may 
offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy 
shares at an inflated price in return for an 
upfront payment. While high profits are 
promised, if you buy or sell shares in this 
way you may potentially lose your money. 
5,000 people contact the FCA about 
share fraud each year, with victims 
losing an average of £20,000. For more 
information, or if you are approached by 
fraudsters, please visit the FCA website 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams, 
where you can report and find out more 
about investment scams. You can also 
call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 
111 6768. If you have already paid money 
to share fraudsters you should contact 
Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
