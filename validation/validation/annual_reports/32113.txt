£14.4m (2016: £18.3m), in line with

2 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement
Bob Ivell
Chairman
Overview
In a challenging year characterised by 
both political and economic turbulence, 
I am pleased to report that the Group 
made good progress in implementing 
the programme of strategic initiatives to 
extend the appeal of the Carpetright brand 
and to address the significant legacy 
issues within its property estate. The 
acceleration of the refurbishment 
programme extended it to over 40% of 
UK stores by year end, well ahead of the 
original target, and is a great example of 
the pace and energy the executive team 
is bringing to these initiatives. Recent 
evidence shows that retailers must adapt 
to combat tougher trading conditions.  
With this in mind, we know we 
need to continue to innovate as we 
strive to differentiate ourselves from 
the competition.
While there is much left to do, we made 
tangible progress across the year in 
key areas such as product offering, 
promotional effectiveness, brand 
perception, store standards and customer 
service. The strategic update on pages 
6 to 16 provides more details on our 
progress against our plan.
Results and dividend
Total revenue for the year ended 
29 April 2017 increased by 0.2% to 
£457.6m (2016: £456.8m), reflecting 
further store closures as we continued 
to rationalise our estate. In challenging 
market conditions, UK like-for-like sales 
declined by 0.5% with an increase of 2.5% 
in the Rest of Europe. Underlying profit 
before tax decreased by 21.3% to £14.4m 
(2016: £18.3m). After the impact of 
separately reported items, statutory profit 
before tax was £0.9m (2016: £12.8m).  
Underlying earnings per share decreased 
to 16.4p (2016: 20.8p) and basic earnings 
per share were 1.0p (2016: 14.9p).
The Board continue to prioritise the use of 
cash for the acceleration of the strategy 
by investing further in the existing store 
estate, while also reducing the fixed 
occupancy costs as quickly as possible.  
As a result, it has taken the decision not 
to pay a final dividend (2016: nil).  Based 
on our current outlook we do not expect 
this position to change in the current 
financial year.
The Board
The composition of the Board was 
unchanged in the year. Much of our 
time has been spent overseeing the 
implementation of multiple strategic 
initiatives and providing an appropriate 
level of challenge to the executive on the 
Group’s response to the tougher trading 
conditions. Further details of the Board’s 
work can be found in the Directors’ report 
starting on page 30 of this Annual Report.
Our people
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank the more than 3,000 colleagues 
working in our stores, distribution centre 
and support offices for their hard work 
and dedication across the year. Their 
commitment to delivering outstanding 
service to our customers is endorsed by 
increased levels of customer satisfaction 
as measured by our Net Promoter Score.  
I am delighted that a significant number 
of our colleagues now participate in our 
SAYE share schemes, enabling them to 
share in our future success.
Summary and outlook
In common with other retailers in the home 
improvement sector in the UK, we have 
experienced more challenging trading 
conditions over recent months. We are 
expecting the consumer environment to 
remain equally testing in the year ahead 
as the uncertainties created by the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU persist. Delivering 
a turnaround in these conditions is not 
easy, but we continue to believe that the 
strategic plan we are implementing will 
ensure the business better capitalises 
on its market leading position and 
provides resilience against weaker 
trading conditions.
While we cannot control external market 
conditions, we have a wide-ranging 
programme of self-help measures on 
which to concentrate and we believe these 
have significant potential to improve the 
performance of the Group. I am confident 
that these will deliver long-term profitable 
growth for the benefit of our shareholders.

3 www.carpetright.plc.uk | Our market
Overview
Our market is highly fragmented, with 
approximately 4,000 floorcoverings 
businesses. Current estimates place the 
UK market at £2.0bn per annum for the 
calendar year to December 2017, placing 
ourselves as the market leader with a 
share of around 20%.
The nature of our product means that the 
vast majority of customers prefer to visit 
a store to make their purchase, to give 
them the opportunity to see and touch 
their choice of floorcovering. However, 
the internet is playing an ever-increasing 
role in pre-purchase behaviour, becoming 
a vital research tool for many customers, 
and the rapid growth of smart phone 
and tablet use underlines the importance 
of having an effective and integrated 
digital proposition.
Product ranges
Whilst carpet remains the dominant 
product category in floorcoverings, we 
have historically over-indexed on carpet 
product ranges relative to wider market 
preferences.  We are redressing this 
bias by substantially extending our offer 
in the hard flooring area to better reflect 
consumer tastes.
In our UK business, beds provides an 
important complementary revenue stream 
to our core floorcoverings offer and we 
believe this category has significant further 
growth potential.  The total beds and 
bedding market is estimated at £3.2bn 
and our market penetration, whilst low, 
is growing steadily as we establish our 
credentials in this competitive sector.
Macroeconomic indicators
The period of sustained economic 
uncertainty has been especially 
challenging for the floorcoverings 
sector in the UK, with fragile consumer 
confidence and shoppers deferring big 
ticket purchases.
Whilst macroeconomic indicators in 
Belgium remained fragile, the Netherlands 
and the Republic of Ireland experienced 
a recovery in market conditions with an 
increase in reported consumer confidence 
and encouraging economic benchmarks.
We see moving house as a key stimulant 
of demand and a potential lead indicator 
of activity in the home improvement sector.  
Having grown steadily from 2013 to early 
2015, UK housing transactions were then 
relatively flat through to February 2016.
During this financial year transactions 
have declined by around 10% to a monthly 
average of 98,000 as at April 2017 down 
from 109,000 in April 2016.
Consumer confidence
Consumer confidence, which has been 
fragile for some time, remains a key 
driver of our performance. During the 
course of the financial year the average 
level of consumer confidence was 
-5, which compares to +2 in the prior 
year comparative.

9 www.carpetright.plc.uk | As we move into the third year of our 
transformation of Carpetright, we are 
maintaining the consistency of our 
strategic direction which has been to 
focus exclusively on:
 – Who we are – our stores, the brand 
and our people
 – What we sell – an unrivalled choice 
of floorcoverings
 – How we sell – making the process 
easy with unbeatable value
 – Where we sell – multi-channel 
convenience and improving the quality 
of the store portfolio
This proven strategy is supported by 
clear, uncomplicated principles that 
are applied consistently throughout the 
business, specifically:
 – We are honest and straightforward
 – We care about customers and 
colleagues
 – We make it easy
We review the progress made across the 
year in each area of strategic focus in the 
following sections:
Who we are
Our principles are the essence of 
our Group-wide ‘We are Carpetright’ 
initiative, which is driving cultural change 
throughout the business with the aim 
of updating customers’ perceptions of 
the brand. This work is central to our 
success, as we modernise the store estate 
and the way we do things around here.
Refurbishment of the store estate and 
introduction of our new branding and 
store-fit was a major focus during the year.  
By the end of April 2017, we had 199 
stores in the UK trading under the new 
brand identity, some 47% of the estate, 
completing 160 refurbishments during 
the year, more than our original target 
having accelerated the programme twice 
in the course of the period. This work 
ranged from introducing new signage 
and a sample area for carpet in stores 
that make a smaller profit, through 
to full refurbishment of larger, highly 
profitable stores, or stores where we 
are tackling new competition. In these 
Chief Executive’s review
Wilf Walsh
Chief Executive
“The way we train, communicate  
and reward our frontline staff 
remains a key priority in making 
sure we are the first choice for  
the floorcoverings consumer, 
every time.”
latter two cases, the introduction of 
our new ‘Graphite’ store-fit is proving 
highly successful in regenerating sales 
growth. As a group, refurbished stores 
delivered like-for-like sales growth of 
6.8% in the final quarter of the year, 
markedly higher than the un-invested 
estate (Including stores refurbished 
expressly to meet new competition this 
figure would be 5.0% growth). This gives 
us confidence to press ahead with the 
investment programme. We are aiming 
to have completed the remainder of the 
UK estate with some form of additional 
investment (at a minimum, re-branding 
with the new identity) by December 2018.
We have a similar programme underway 
to address the un-invested estate in the 
Netherlands and Belgium. As at the 
end of April 2017, we had refurbished 
an initial nine stores and they have 
achieved excellent sales growth post-
refurbishment. We see this as a 
significant opportunity to increase share 
and profitability and are in the process 
of refurbishing a further twelve stores by 
the end of July 2017. If we can achieve 
similar levels of sales growth, we will look 
to accelerate the programme across the 
remaining stores in the Netherlands and 
Belgium during the coming months.
Further improving our reputation and 
being readily identified as a brand that 
customers can trust is vital to Carpetright’s 
future success. Our recruitment of 
Lucy Alexander, previously a presenter 
on BBC TV’s cult home improvement 
programme ‘Homes under the Hammer’, 
as Carpetright Brand Ambassador in the 
summer of 2016 has been a key initiative 
in this area. We have supported this 
move with extensive brand sponsorship 
on UKTV featuring Lucy, who is a credible 
home improvement personality. Customer 
research shows this activity is yielding 
positive results on brand metrics such 
as awareness, trust and consideration.
Equally, Carpetright achieving 
‘Which? Trusted Trader’ status for our 
recommended fitting service is another 
important element to improving brand 
perception and ‘Making it Easy’. This 
standard gives potential customers the 
comfort that the final and most important 
Strategic report continued
10 | Annual report and accounts 2017 part of the customer journey, the fitting, 
and that “ta da” moment, is going to 
be carried out by carefully selected and 
properly assessed trades people. ‘Who we 
are’ also incorporates our new colleague 
uniform which was successfully rolled out 
last year to give teams a comfortable, 
contemporary identity.
It also covers our culture and the way 
we train and talk with our colleagues.  
To this end we have introduced ‘Fuse’, 
which is a brand new internal training and 
communications tool, built around a single 
platform for mobile, social and programme 
learning and development as well as 
internal communications. The training 
element covers everything from “the 
basics”, through product knowledge, 
as well as customer service and selling 
skills. It is also a tool to encourage 
ongoing management development and 
Fuse will be at the heart of our launch of a 
Carpetright Managers’ Academy in 2017.
Video based communication offers a 
much more dynamic live update for store 
colleagues.  The ‘Staff Room’ element on 
Fuse allows for open feedback from staff 
that will help us improve, by being honest 
and straightforward with each other and 
accepting of constructive criticism.
What we sell
The floorcoverings market does not stand 
still. Through market research we know 
consumer tastes are changing and they 
tell us what they want to buy for their 
home. The UK market is currently split 
60/40 on carpets versus hard flooring, 
while Carpetright, because of its heritage, 
has a split of 90/10 in favour of carpet.
Our move over recent years to increase 
our share of the hard flooring market 
is already well documented. We have 
enjoyed particularly good growth in hard 
flooring as we have introduced ranges 
into all of our stores, with a clear product 
and price architecture, for customers from 
budget spend right through to £100 per 
square metre and over, with sufficient 
cross-over between categories to allow 
customers to trade up if they choose:
 – Vinyl – from roll stock, for the take 
away and DIY market, to premium 
quality sample vinyl which is specifically 
ordered for professional fitting;
 – Laminate – again in the budget, DIY 
take away form or in a new range of 
sampled product for third party fitting;
 – Luxury Vinyl Tile (LVT) has now been 
introduced across the estate, becoming 
our fastest growing category (albeit 
from a low base), offering customers 
the natural look of wood or stone but 
with the features and benefits of easy 
to maintain vinyl; and
 – Engineered Wood – a superior and 
more stable product than traditional 
solid wood, supplied to us by Kahrs, 
the leading Swedish supplier of 
environmentally friendly and sustainable 
flooring products.
In carpet, we continue to strengthen our 
range authority as market leader, with 
a focus on all budgets, from £2.99 per 
square metre roll stock in our ‘Essentials’ 
range through to outstanding quality wool 
carpets from British manufacturers such 
as Westex, Brintons and Ulster.
We have identified an opportunity to create 
exclusives that allow for differentiation 
of Carpetright versus the independent 
sector and our national competitors. In 
this space the ‘House Beautiful Collection’ 
has been an outstanding success with 
the recent addition of a new velvet-
style polyamide twist. Exclusive ranges 
accounted for 3.2% of sales in the final 
quarter of the year, up from 1.9% in the 
comparable prior year period.
Strategic report Shareholder information Financial statements Directors’ report
11 www.carpetright.plc.uk | Strategic report continued
Chief Executive’s review continued
We will be launching a new collection 
of products under the popular and well 
recognised ‘Country Living’ brand before 
the end of 2017 in collaboration with this 
leading lifestyle magazine.
Our buying team has also begun to take 
a more creative and proactive approach 
to anticipating interiors fashion trends, 
with the introduction of more design-
led products that customers currently 
favour, including more bright colour 
options alongside blue, blush tones 
and dusty pastels.
In the UK, we began selling beds in 2009 
and the business has grown to represent 
9.2% of total sales, with beds being 
merchandised in 253 of our stores. Whilst 
we have delivered sales growth in the year, 
we believe a significant opportunity exists 
to grow this category faster. Through a 
programme of significant re-ranging and 
merchandising, supported by additional 
training, we are confident of delivering a 
step change in the sales contribution from 
the bed category, starting in the current 
financial year.
In the Netherlands and Belgium, we have 
re-introduced a range of curtains and 
blinds. This range is now available in 88 
stores and represented 4.7% of the total 
sales mix by the end of the financial year.
How we sell
As part of our plan to keep it simple, 
the performance of our store colleagues 
is measured on a small number of 
straightforward KPIs designed to increase 
the quality of the sale, both in terms of 
customer service and value. The success 
of this programme is demonstrated by our 
average transaction values, which grew by 
11% in the year. 
As a simple guide, where a store team 
delivers 15% or more interest free 
credit participation, 50% plus underlay 
penetration and 75% or more “highly 
satisfied” responses under ‘Do We 
Measure Up?’ surveys, they can, on 
average, expect to deliver like-for-like sales 
growth 3% ahead of the total UK estate.
As always, our biggest challenge is 
achieving consistency and narrowing 
variance between the very best 
performing stores and under-performing 
units. Customer service is central to this 
effort, to ensure we deliver an enviable 
reputation for service in what is, potentially, 
a lengthy customer journey with lots of 
moving parts. Our Net Promoter Score 
has improved significantly to 75% from 
71% across the year. As it stands, 96% 
of our customers are at least “satisfied”, 
as are 91% who experience our Home 
Flooring Surveyors and 85% of those who 
deal with recommended fitters. We remain 
focused on driving these metrics higher, 
particularly those in the latter area where 
we should be getting higher scores.
In simple terms, “highly satisfied” 
customers spend 3.4 times more on 
average and are significantly more likely 
to recommend Carpetright.
Across the Group, customer needs and 
technology changes are continuing to 
drive the need to deliver a fully integrated 
omnichannel shopping experience.  
We plan to invest in technology that 
enables our customers to interact with 
us throughout their buying journey on 
any device or physical outlet; uses 
information to make decisions easy 
for the customer; delivers a simple 
environment for our colleagues with 
the right tools; and establishes robust 
data security and controls.  In 2016, we 
invested in upgrading our store hardware 
and networks in the UK and are now 
extending this to the Netherlands and 
Belgium. We will also be implementing 
an integrated customer relationship 
management system in the UK within 
the next twelve months.
Where we sell
In Carpetright we have too many stores 
on too many unsustainable long leases 
that severely impact our overall profitability.  
We continue to address this challenge 
with vigour.
In the UK, the last twelve months was 
another year of progress as we opened 
eight stores, closed 17, including three 
relocations, to leave a total of 426 stores 
(2016: 435 stores). The new stores, 
opened in areas where we have long been 
under-represented, including Bath, Leeds 
and Liverpool, and have all delivered 
encouraging initial performances. As a 
result, we now trade from 3,691,000 sq ft 
of retail space in the UK (2016: 3,763,000 
sq ft), a 1.9% reduction year-on-year.
Our progress in the last five years on 
improving the quality of our UK store 
estate and reducing overall store numbers 
has been significant and we aim to have 
reduced the total to below 400 stores by 
this time next year. Where we close or 
downsize stores, we are almost always 
able to redeploy existing staff locally.
We continue to take a robust view at lease 
renewal, which provides the opportunity 
to secure lower rents for future years.  
Within the next five years 48% of the UK 
estate has a lease renewal scheduled, 
providing further opportunity to reduce 
the fixed store operating costs or to exit 
underperforming stores. As at April 2017, 
the average length of lease had fallen to 
5.5 years (2016: 6.3 years).
In the Rest of Europe, we opened 
six stores and closed five, including 
four relocations during the year, to 
leave a total of 138 stores (2016: 137 
stores). Consequently, we now trade 
from 1,360,000 sq ft of retail space 
(2016: 1,387,000 sq ft), a 2.0% 
reduction year-on-year. In line with 
the UK activity, discussions are being 
held with landlords in respect of lease 
renewals and this process is delivering 
rental reductions. The potential to 
secure reductions is generally dictated 
by the average length of lease remaining; 
with this being 2.8 years (2016: 2.6 
years) in the Netherlands and 1.8 years 
(2016: 2.3 years) in Belgium. In the 
Republic of Ireland this period is 8.1 years 
(2016: 9.1 years), reflecting the agreement 
of long-term deals during the expansion 
into this market in the period from 2001 
to 2008.
Our progress in this area is delivering 
an improvement in profitability. Whilst 
this activity can incur a cash cost to exit 
leases, either by assigning to new tenants 
or returning the property to landlords, 
by taking this robust approach we are 
confident we are getting an acceptable 
financial return.
12 | Annual report and accounts 2017 We are also acutely aware of the growing 
impact of digital on our business, both 
now and in the medium term. Sales, 
where the customer journey originated 
online, increased by 13.4% during the 
year, along with sample and appointment 
requests up around 20%. Over the past 
twelve months we have seen visits to the 
website increase by 14%, a reduction in 
our bounce rate due to improvements in 
the design, and pure online sales increase 
by 74%. Website revenue is now the 
equivalent of a top turnover store.
Initiatives delivered during the year include:
 – introducing the Carpetright ‘Visualiser’, 
giving the customer the opportunity to 
upload photos of their rooms and see 
how their choice of new floorcovering 
will enhance them by trying different 
product across our extensive ranges;
 – blogs designed to enhance consumer 
knowledge including decorating tips 
and trends with Diana Civil, a leading 
interior stylist;
 – practical videos on how to choose 
products, measure a room, stain 
removal and other tips to enhance 
our authority as market leaders in 
the sector;
 – online guide with Lucy Alexander as to 
how we make it “easy with every step”;
 – ability to book a visit with our Home 
Flooring Surveyors online; and
 – ability to pay for products online using 
interest free credit
Competition
The floorcoverings market in the UK 
has long been a highly competitive 
environment, with the Group facing 
competition from a vibrant independent 
sector and from a number of national and 
regional floorcoverings retailers. However, 
competition intensified significantly during 
the year when a new national competitor 
rolled out an aggressive store opening 
programme and a number of smaller 
players also began competing more 
actively at a local level.
Our strategy in response to competitor 
activity is simple and it applies in a variety 
of locations, specifically:
 – we refurbish our store with our new 
‘Graphite’ shop fit, effectively minimising 
the potential of any negative store 
environment factor;
 – we ensure the team are appropriately 
resourced for taking on the challenge of 
a new competitor; and
 – we introduce enhanced 
local promotions.
While this impacted our profit 
performance, we firmly believe that the 
cost to the business of failing to meet 
the competitive challenge would be 
considerably greater.
Significantly, while a new competitor 
inevitably steals some sales in the first year 
of operation, once we anniversary their 
store opening we are seeing like-for-like 
sales growth well ahead of the main 
estate. We believe that this encouraging 
performance demonstrates that the action 
we are taking is working.
Summary
Our primary external challenges over the 
past year were two-fold. First, the UK’s 
decision to exit the European Union on 
23 June 2016, saw Sterling depreciate 
dramatically against the Euro. Along with 
our competitors, this eventually made it 
necessary to raise some prices and we 
were able to mitigate this unexpected 
development in the second half of the year.
Second, as discussed above, a new 
entrant came to the market with an 
aggressive store opening programme, 
to which we are responding robustly.
Against this backdrop, we will not be 
diverted from our plan to transform the 
Carpetright business. The four main 
planks of our strategy remain valid and 
cover all elements of the customer 
journey as well as tackling our legacy 
property issues. Responding to intensified 
competition has sharpened us up and 
we are relishing the challenge in what 
may well become a more difficult trading 
environment, with ongoing uncertainty 
over consumer spending and inflationary 
pressures. We are confident that whatever 
the external environment we can increase 
our market share.
After a testing twelve months not lacking 
in excitement, I am grateful to the Board 
for their support and counsel and my 
thanks of course go to everyone in the 
store support offices in both Purfleet 
and Utrecht as well as our Regional and 
Divisional Managers across Europe.
My admiration for our store managers 
and sales colleagues who serve the 
customer day in, day out knows no 
bounds. Everyone in the store support 
offices does an ‘in-store day’ once a 
year, normally during the relatively quiet 
December period when we can cause 
least havoc. Whether our sales colleagues 
are in Edinburgh, Salford, Exeter, 
Rotterdam, Bruges or Cork, they are all 
doing a demanding job and I am grateful 
for their hard work and dedication.
Our ongoing change of culture is still 
very much in the early stages but the 
way we train, communicate and reward 
our frontline staff remains a key priority 
in making sure we are the first choice for 
the floorcoverings consumer, every time.
We are Carpetright.

Strategic report Shareholder information Financial statements Directors’ report
13 www.carpetright.plc.uk | In conversation with the Chief Executive
What is your view of the 
Group’s performance in  
the year?
Whilst the dramatic depreciation of 
Sterling, and the intensified competitive 
pressures have made it a challenging 
period for the UK business, we have made 
continued progress in the turnaround in 
the Rest of Europe. The combined result 
has been a decline in overall profitability 
which indicates it has been a tough year.  
That said, we have a clear plan with a 
robust set of actions which I think will 
mitigate some very serious headwinds 
which most retailers are feeling right now.
It’s two years since you 
launched the new strategy 
– how much progress has  
been made?
We are absolutely in the thick of it but 
we are making real progress. We have 
re-engineered virtually every aspect of 
the business: from the look and feel of 
the brand; the concerted move into hard 
flooring where we under-index versus 
the market; and the drive to improve our 
reputation and customer service. If you 
add in the number of shops that we have 
refurbished, re-sited, re-sized, or closed 
in the period, along with re-shaping our 
digital offer, it is easy to underestimate 
the size of the task that the team 
has undertaken.
Is the business where you 
planned for it to be at this point?
Not quite in terms of profit delivery for 
the reasons I outline above – but yes, in 
terms of confirming a very clear strategic 
direction and our progress with the 
operational turnaround.
How much further is there 
to go with the plan?
We are barely half way through is my 
considered judgment. We need to 
rebrand the entire estate and become 
famous for hard flooring and floorcoverings 
in general, not just carpet. We need to 
ensure our improved customer service 
gets even better and we have to keep 
our focus on reducing store numbers and 
improving the quality of our estate. The 
good news is that a lot of these initiatives 
are within our gift and are best described 
as “self help”.
What’s worked best so far 
and which areas are proving 
more difficult?
I think we have made very good progress 
in the four main areas of who we are, 
what we sell, how we sell and where 
we sell. We have obviously had to 
prioritise individual activities as trying 
to land them all overnight is a practical 
impossibility. Culture change is also 
something that has had to evolve over 
time – when practice becomes ingrained 
over an extended period of time, people 
can become institutionalised and resistant 
to change and addressing that has been 
the biggest challenge.
Strategic report continued
Has Brexit de-railed your 
recovery plans?
No – although it slowed up the first half 
considerably as Sterling depreciated 
significantly. We mitigated this in the 
second half through price increases 
and renegotiating with suppliers. The 
future and how Brexit will look is still 
very uncertain indeed but that applies 
to the whole sector where we and our 
competitors operate.
What criteria should we use 
to judge the Group’s progress 
this year?
It’s all about momentum and assessing 
whether or not the business is focusing 
on the right things. For me, it’s about the 
quality of transaction and to that end it’s 
gratifying to see our Average Transaction 
Value increase by 11% in the year. This 
is driven by the instore KPI’s and should 
give investors confidence that we are 
concentrating on the important stuff 
whatever the market conditions.
What underpins your 
confidence that the Group 
is on the right track?
Not chopping and changing what 
is a solid strategic plan is key. And 
having supportive shareholders who 
understand the retail landscape, agree 
with our initiatives and are cognisant 
of the competitive threats gives us 
confidence that we are firmly on the 
right track.
Do you have any evidence 
that consumers are now 
beginning to re-appraise the 
Carpetright brand?
As I discuss in my statement, the 
measurements from our market research, 
in particular the Brand Tracker work, 
indicates a very positive reappraisal of 
the Carpetright brand – this isn’t a case 
of “hitting and hoping”. It remains vital 
work-in-progress.
“We have a clear plan with a robust set of actions  
which I think will mitigate some very serious headwinds  
which most retailers are feeling right now.”
14 | Annual report and accounts 2017 The outlook for the UK 
consumer looks more 
uncertain – do the self-help 
measures being taken have 
enough potential for you to 
drive improved performance 
even if times in retail get 
tougher?
Undoubtedly – we cannot do anything 
about the economy, what Government 
in its infinite wisdom throws at us or 
consumer confidence. By doing the things 
within our control better, day-in day-out 
we can take market share from our 
competitors and that, in essence, is the 
plan. I would not want to be a new entrant 
in a market such as this.
How are the rebranded/
refurbished stores performing 
– are they meeting your 
expectations?
Great – we’re very pleased with their 
performance. We discuss the numbers 
in detail in my review but in summary 
we are hitting our targets on sales and 
return on investment. Clearly where we 
are up against a new competitor that 
refurbishment work is primarily focused 
on mitigating the negative effect they can 
have on us.
Are you maintaining the sales 
uplift as you work your way 
through the estate?
Carpetright has been in a nonsensical 
situation where in too many locations 
we had two Carpetright stores trading 
within close proximity to each other – 
total madness. Where we close one 
store the model sees us lose the two 
main costs, namely establishment (rent 
and rates) and people (who we nearly 
always reintegrate somewhere else in the 
region). We also see a sales transfer of 
around 40% to the remaining store and 
hey presto – you are actually now making 
a profit. Old fashioned, I know.
You will soon be approaching 
the point where half the UK 
store estate has been 
refurbished – should we see 
that as the tipping point?
Not really – the “tipping point” is when we 
see at least 75% of the units hitting their 
in-store KPIs that drive like-for-like sales 
relentlessly. You can spend a load of 
money to dress a store up beautifully but 
unless the people inside are dedicated to 
great service then you will not see a return.
Should we expect more store 
closures this year? How 
many stores do you see the 
UK having ideally?
We are at 426 stores – we are aiming to 
be below 400 in the UK this time next 
year. I don’t have an ideal number, if 
the stores are making a contribution 
we want to keep them. The numbers 
in the Netherlands and Belgium are 
about right – it’s just improving their look 
and performance.
Reducing property costs is a 
critical part of the strategy – 
how much progress was 
made in the year?
We closed 22 shops, including 7 
relocations, thereby reducing our rent 
and rates bill.  But there’s more to do and 
we’re very focused on this.
Are you looking to accelerate 
the property disposal 
programme this year?
Yes, but we will have to overcome 
significant landlord inertia. We are 
offering significant premiums to get out 
of unprofitable sites but when they have 
a tenant with a strong covenant, paying 
the rent on time every month – on a lease 
that has ten years to run – they don’t 
appear to have the appetite to find another 
tenant. I find this a rather odd call.
The Rest of Europe 
businesses continue to 
recover – will we see you 
invest in a store refurbishment 
roll out in these markets as 
you have in the UK? 
Absolutely, as I mention in my review the 
team in Utrecht has done an excellent 
job in reformatting some units that hadn’t 
had any investment since the business 
was acquired in 2002. The Netherlands 
especially will see us increase capital 
spend in the coming twelve months.
What are your priorities for the 
year ahead?
“Sticking with the knitting” is the term, 
so doing the same things – only better.
Where do you see Carpetright 
at the end of 2018?
An improved performance, with a profit 
growth and increasing market share, 
especially in hard flooring, whatever 
the economic conditions.

Definition
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is 
a measure of a customer’s 
willingness to recommend 
our service to others in terms 
of Satisfaction and Loyalty 
calculated by subtracting the 
percentage of Detractors from 
the percentage of Promoters.
Definition
This measure is determined 
by taking underlying operating 
profit and adding back 
non-cash items and any 
movements in working capital. 
Rationale
Maximising like-for-like 
sales opportunities drives 
cash inflow. This KPI also 
measures the health of  
our core retail estate and 
reflects customer reaction 
to our products, proposition 
and price.
Rationale
Gross profit is an important 
indicator of the Group’s 
financial performance. It 
reflects our ability to source 
effectively, run an efficient 
supply chain, and promote 
and deliver the correct mix 
of products to maximise 
cash margin.
Rationale
Customer Satisfaction 
and Loyalty are important 
indicators of the success, or 
not, of the Customer Journey, 
our colleague interaction and 
our range of products  
and services.
Rationale
The Group’s ability to finance 
its future investment, pay 
corporation taxes, pay interest 
on its borrowings and make 
returns to shareholders is 
aided by strong cash flows 
from its operations.

16 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Overview
Total Group revenue for the year increased by 0.2% to £457.6m, consisting of a decline 
in the UK business of 2.6% offset by an increase of 16.4% in the Rest of Europe, with 
the latter impacted by foreign exchange rate movements. Our continued focus on 
rationalising and repositioning the store portfolio saw the Group open 14 stores and 
close 22 during the year, which gave a net decrease of eight stores, including seven 
relocations.  The total store base numbered 564 at year end (2016: 572), with total store 
space declining by 1.9% to 5.1 million square feet during the period.
Group underlying operating profit decreased by 19.2% to £16.4m (2016: £20.3m), 
reflecting the impact of the significant depreciation of sterling during the first half of 
the year and the costs of measures to address intensified competition. This impacted 
sales and margin rate in the UK, but was partially offset by the benefit from closing 
underperforming stores, and a strengthening performance in our Rest of Europe 
business. Net finance charges were level with the prior year at £2.0m. These factors 
combined to generate underlying profit before tax of £14.4m (2016: £18.3m), a 21.3% 
decrease on the prior year.
Separately reported items totalled £13.5m (2016: £5.5m), primarily costs associated with 
rationalising the store estate and a re-assessment of provisions held for onerous lease 
costs for loss-making stores following a strategic review of the portfolio.
When separately reported items are included, the statutory measure of profit before 
tax for the Group was £0.9m (2016: £12.8m) and basic earnings per share of 1.0p 
(2016: 14.9p).
The Group ended the year with net debt of £9.8m (2016: £1.1m), reflecting an 
acceleration of the store refurbishment programme and the cash costs of rationalising 
the store portfolio.

Total 435 8 (17) 426 3,763 3,691
In tough trading conditions, like-for-like sales in the second half of the year increased by 1.8% partially mitigating the decline of 2.9% 
experienced in the first half, to give a full year decline of 0.5%.
We opened eight stores and closed 17 stores during the period, including three relocations.  This translated into a net space decline 
of 72,000 sq ft, a decrease of 1.9%. At period end there were 253 stores trading with a bed department (2016: 246). Sales within the 
beds category now represent 9.2% of the sales mix (2016: 9.0%).
Gross profit decreased by £11.7m to £225.6m, representing 59.2% of sales, a decrease of 150 basis points. This decline in margin 
rate reflects a combination of:
 – adverse impact of 210 bps from the fall in Sterling to Euro exchange rate on imported goods for resale. The average EUR/GBP rate 
in 2017 was 12% lower at €1.20 (2016: €1.36);
 – measures to address intensified competition including a ‘free fitting’ offer in selected stores, an adverse impact of 60bps;
 – a dilutive impact of 30bps from product categories which attract lower average gross margins; and
 – a favourable impact of 150bps from the improvement in underlying floorcovering margin through improved sourcing, promotional 
planning and selected price increases.
The total UK cost base decreased by 2.1% compared with the prior year to £214.9m (2016: £219.5m). Costs as a percentage of sales 
were 56.4%, a marginal uplift from 56.1% in the prior year, reflecting the operational gearing of the business. The movement in costs 
was a combination of:
 – store payroll costs decreased by £1.7m to £59.7m (2016: £61.4m) owing to a reduction in headcount from store closures, combined 
with a decline in sales commission and bonus costs from the fall in sales;
 – store occupancy costs (rent, rates, other & depreciation) decreased by 1.0% to £115.2m (2016: £116.4m), primarily the impact of 
the store closures, offset in part by an increase in depreciation from the refurbishment programme; and
 – marketing and central support costs decreased by 4.1% to £40.0m (2016: £41.7m), primarily the result of lower performance related 
cost, partially offset by higher advertising costs.
The combination of the above factors resulted in underlying operating profit decreasing by 39.9% to £10.7m.

Total 137 6 (5) 138 1,387 1,360
Macroeconomic indicators for our markets in Belgium and the Republic of Ireland remained fragile throughout the year, however, 
the Netherlands experienced a recovery in market conditions with an increase in reported consumer confidence and encouraging 
economic indicators, such as the number of housing transactions, fuelling demand. 
In local currency terms, the three businesses combined to produce an increase in revenue of 2.0% on the prior year.  The combined 
like-for-like sales increased by 2.5%. A contributor to growth has been the re-introduction of a curtains & blinds offer into the 
Netherlands and Belgium. After exchange rate movements, total revenue increased by 16.4% in reported currency.
The number of stores increased by one during the year, having opened six and closed five during the period, including four relocations.  
The associated trading space reduced by 2.0%.
Gross profit percentage increased 110 basis points to 57.2%, resulting principally from improved supplier terms and non-recurring 
clearance activity in the prior year, offset in part by investment in promotions to drive top line sales volumes and the impact of growth 
in lower margin product categories. The combination of volume and rate improvements led to cash gross profit in local currency terms 
increasing by 3.9%. After taking into account exchange rate movements this resulted in an increase of 18.7% in reported currency.
Operating costs in local currency reduced by 2.8%, primarily the result of reduced occupancy costs related to the downsizing and 
relocating stores. This was reflected in the decline in the costs as a percentage of sales to 49.7%, a reduction on the prior year figure 
of 52.3%. In reported currency, costs increased by 10.8% to £38.1m.
The net result was a year-on-year improvement in underlying operating profit of 98.5% in local currency, which translated to an increase 
of 128.0% in reported currency of £3.2m to £5.7m (2016: £2.5m).

Net finance costs and taxation
Net finance charges for the period were unchanged at £2.0m (2016: £2.0m).
The effective tax rate for the year was 24.3% (2016: 21.3%), a variance of 4.3% compared to the UK corporation tax rate of 20.0% due 
to the effects of non-deductible items, overseas tax rates and other permanent differences.  The 3.0% increase from last year’s rate is 
predominantly due to lower profitability in the UK with non-deductible items remaining unchanged, along with improved profitability in 
Europe being taxed at higher rates. 
Separately reported items
The Group makes certain adjustments to statutory profit measures in order to help investors understand the underlying performance  
of the business. These adjustments are reported as separately reported items. The Group recorded a net charge of £13.5m 
(2016: £5.5m).

The charge reported in the 2016 Annual report and accounts was £4.5m. For consistency with the current period presentation we 
have reclassified £1.0m relating to share based payments. This has no impact on the Group’s statutory reported profit before tax and 
earnings per share. The reclassified separately reported charge for 2016 is therefore £5.5m.
A net loss of £1.9m was made on the disposal of 25 (22 trading and 3 onerous) properties during the year (2016: £3.6m loss), 
principally a combination of surrender premiums being paid to exit loss-making stores and asset write-offs.
A number of investment properties that have previously been impaired are in receipt of rental income from independent third party 
tenants. As a result, £2.2m of impairment against these locations is no longer required and has been reversed (2016: £0.4m charge).
Leasehold store impairment testing during the year has identified a number of stores where the anticipated future performance does 
not support the carrying value of the assets. As a result, a charge of £0.4m has been incurred in respect of the impairment of assets 
associated with these stores (2016: £0.1m credit).
At 30 April 2016 there were eleven vacant properties in the UK and two in the Republic of Ireland classed as onerous leases 
against which we carried a provision. During the year we disposed of three of these locations. This was offset by three trading 
stores being closed and added to this group. Following a strategic review of the store portfolio in February 2017, we have made 
a revised assessment of the onerous lease costs for loss-making stores. The net impact of these judgments is a charge of £11.0m 
(2016: £0.6m credit).
The value of assets written off during the store refurbishment programme amounts to £1.4m during the year. Given the quantum, and 
in keeping with historical treatment, such write-offs have been reported as separately reported items.
In light of the variable and non-cash nature of employee share based payments, these have been classified as separately reported 
items. This also allows for greater visibility of these charges in the accounts. A charge of £1.0m was incurred during the year 
(2016: £1.0m).
The cash flow impact of separately reported items was £4.0m outflow in the year.
20 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share were 16.4p (2016: 20.8p), reflecting the fall in underlying profitability of the Group.
Basic earnings per share were 1.0p (2016: 14.9p). The reduction in basic earnings per share is less in percentage terms than the 
reduction in underlying earnings per share, a result of a deferred tax credit of £0.6m associated with the fall in the UK corporation tax 
rate to 17% being taken as a separately reported tax credit.
Dividend
The Board continues to prioritise the use of cash for the acceleration of the strategy by investing further in the existing store estate, 
while also reducing the fixed occupancy costs as quickly as possible.  As a result, it has taken the decision not to pay a final dividend 
(2016: nil).  Based on our current outlook, we do not expect this position to change in the current financial year.
Balance sheet
The Group had net assets of £78.0m at the end of the period (2016: £74.0m), a year-on-year increase of £4.0m.

During the period, two freehold property disposals were completed. The Group owns a significant property portfolio, most of which is 
used for retail purposes. The carrying values are supported by a combination of value-in-use and independent valuations.
As a consequence of managing the estate to reduce square footage, eliminate store catchment overlap and improve the quality of our 
store base on realistic rental deals, the operating lease liabilities have reduced significantly to £531.9m (2016: £599.3m).
Strategic report Shareholder information Financial statements Directors’ report
21 www.carpetright.plc.uk | Cash flow
The Group’s net debt at 29 April 2017 was £9.8m, an adverse movement of £8.7m (2016: £1.1m debt).
This increase in debt was driven by a combination of the decline in the underlying operating profit performance; net expenditure of 
£2.2m on exiting operating leases; cash outflow of £5.2m related to previously made provisions; contributions of £0.9m to closed 
defined benefit pension schemes; and an increase of £13.6m in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in stock of £1.0m.
The increase in working capital was attributable to a combination of an increase in debtors (driven by the seasonal impact of a later 
Easter and the longer lead times on newly introduced product categories); a decrease in creditors associated with a combination of 
lower activity levels and a reduction in performance based costs (the result of lower level of profitability); increase in prepayments due 
to timing differences; and amortisation of deferred income relating to property incentives.
The resulting net inflow of cash generated by operations of £7.7m was offset by net capital expenditure, net interest paid, tax paid and 
other movements (primarily exchange differences) totalling £16.2m, resulting in free cash outflow of £8.5m (2016: £1.4m outflow).
The Group’s average net debt was £10.2m over the period (2016: £7.1m).

22 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Current liquidity
In April 2015, the Group completed a refinancing arrangement of its principal facilities, providing £58.0m of debt capacity split 
between a revolving credit facility (RCF) and multi-option facilities (principally overdrafts) in a mixture of Sterling and Euro currencies.  
In December 2015, the Group elected not to renew its €5.0m multi-option facility in Belgium thereby saving non-utilisation fees. This 
action reduced the Group’s total facilities in GBP terms to £54.7m, of which the main £45.0m RCF in the UK matures in July 2019.  
The facilities contain financial covenants which are believed to be appropriate in the current economic climate and tested on a quarterly 
basis, against which the Group monitors compliance.
Gross bank borrowings at the balance sheet date were £20.1m (FY16: £7.1m), being a combination drawn down from overdraft 
and revolving credit facilities.  The Group had further undrawn facilities of £34.4m at the balance sheet date.  In addition, the Group 
held gross cash balances of £12.5m.  The combination of these resulted in net debt, before finance leases, of £7.6m, providing total 
headroom against facilities of £46.9m.  With the addition of £2.2m of finance leases (2016: £2.3m), the Group closed the period on 
£9.8m of net debt, being £8.7m higher than year end 2016. 
Pensions
At 29 April 2017, the IAS 19 net retirement benefit deficit was £3.2m (2016: £2.2m).  The discount rate was 2.5% (2016: 3.5%), 
reflecting prevailing corporate bond rates.  This lower discount rate resulted in an increase in the schemes’ liabilities and more than 
offset the increase in market value of the plan’s assets and additional company contributions.
The scheme was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 May 2010.  The Company agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees in 
2015 and this will be reviewed following the completion of the triennial valuation, which will be performed as at 5 April 2017.

23 www.carpetright.plc.uk | Managing risk
General approach to risk 
management
Carpetright recognises that effective 
business management requires regular 
review of business risks. The Group 
has established a flexible and practical 
framework, sponsored by senior 
executives, which aims to identify and 
manage the principal risks that may 
prevent it from achieving the Group’s 
strategic objectives.
The Board and Audit 
Committee
The Board has overall responsibility 
for the Group’s risk appetite, more 
details of which can be found on page 
33. It also has overall responsibility for 
the system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. In order to 
fulfil this responsibility, the Directors have 
established an organisational framework 
with clear operational procedures, lines 
of responsibility and delegated authority 
which has operated throughout the 
year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and 
financial statements.
The system of internal control is designed 
to identify, evaluate and manage significant 
risks associated with the achievement 
of the Group’s objectives. Because of 
the limitations inherent in any system of 
internal control, this system is designed 
to meet the Group’s particular needs and 
the risks to which it is exposed rather than 
eliminate risk altogether. Consequently, 
it can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee assists the 
Board through its work covering the 
Group’s system of internal controls, 
the assessment of risks and related 
compliance activities. This includes the 
Committee’s oversight of the Group’s 
Internal Audit department, which:
 – undertakes its work, both on central 
functions and in the field, based on a 
risk assessment model;
 – provides the Audit Committee and the 
Board with objective assurance on the 
control environment across the Group; 
and
 – monitors adherence to the Group’s key 
policies and principles.
The Audit Committee reports to the 
Board on its activities and makes 
recommendations and escalates 
significant risks or issues to the Board as 
appropriate. Its role is described in more 
detail on pages 35 to 38.
The Board has reviewed the Group’s 
systems of internal control including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls as well as risk management, 
and is satisfied that these accord with 
the guidance on internal controls set out 
in the Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Control, issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014.
Identification of business risks
An Executive Risk Committee (‘ERC’) 
comprising the Executive Directors and 
senior managers exists to review key 
risk and control issues, and the Group’s 
principal risks are individually sponsored 
by a member of the ERC. The ERC met 
quarterly during the year reported.
The ERC identifies and assesses risks to 
the Group’s medium-term strategy and 
directs the risk management processes 
within both the UK and the Rest of Europe 
to address each of the identified risks, 
formulate a mitigation strategy and assess 
The Group faces a number of risks and uncertainties in both the development of,  
and day-to-day operations of, its business.
the likely impact of such risk occurring.  
The Chief Financial Officer provides regular 
reports to the Audit Committee in relation 
to its work.
The ERC also considers new and 
emerging risks as a standing agenda item, 
including those identified by the Board 
of Directors. The Committee has also 
reviewed the ranking of the business’s key 
strategic risks during the year, to ensure 
that this remains an appropriate reflection 
of their relative standing. The principal 
risks and uncertainties affecting the 
business are set out on pages 26 to 27.
Oversight and assurance
The Group Finance department is 
responsible for the financial policies 
and standards adopted within the 
Group. It also manages the financial 
reporting processes to ensure the timely 
and accurate provision of information 
which enables the Board to discharge 
its responsibilities.
The Company Secretary and Legal 
Director is responsible for maintaining 
and developing the Group’s framework 
of governance, including our anti-bribery 
policy and whistleblowing process, 
alongside ensuring that any changes to 
the Group’s legal obligations are brought 
to the attention of the relevant teams who 
are responsible for the implementation of 
any changes.
The Internal Audit department 
provides independent assessment 
on the robustness and effectiveness 
of the systems and processes of 
risk management and control across 
the Group. It achieves this through 
undertaking reviews which are approved 
by and reported to the Audit Committee.  
The Group also uses the services of 
independent third party advisers and 
consultants to review controls and 
processes where the nature of the review 
requires expertise not available in-house.
Strategic report continued
24 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Principal risks and 
uncertainties
The Group is subject to the same general 
risks as many other businesses; for 
example, changes in general economic 
conditions, currency and interest 
rate fluctuations, changes in taxation 
legislation, cyber-security breaches, failure 
of our IT infrastructure, the cost of our 
raw materials, the impact of competition, 
political instability and the impact of 
natural disasters.
The Group uses its risk management 
process as described on page 24 to 
identify, monitor, evaluate and escalate 
such issues as they emerge, enabling 
management to take appropriate action 
wherever possible in order to control them 
and also enabling the Board to keep risk 
management under review.
The risk factors addressed on pages 26 to 
27 are those which are believed to be the 
most material to its business model, which 
could adversely affect the operations, 
revenue, profit, cash flow or assets of the 
Group and which may prevent us from 
achieving the Group’s strategic objectives.  
Additional risks and uncertainties currently 
unknown, or which are currently believed 
immaterial, may also have an adverse 
effect on the Group.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Code, the Board has 
assessed the prospects of the Company 
over a longer period than the twelve 
months that has in practice been the focus 
of the ‘Going Concern’ provision. The 
Board conducted the review for a five-
year period, corresponding with the 
period covered by its current medium-
term financial plans. These plans are 
updated annually and reflect the Group’s 
established strategy, its existing investment 
commitments, available financial resources 
and long-term financing arrangements.
The plans consider profits, cash flows, 
funding requirements and other key 
financial ratios over the period, as well as 
the headroom in the financial covenants 
contained in our banking arrangements.  
Important assumptions underlying the 
plans include:
 – funding for capital expenditure in the 
form of capital markets debt or bank 
debt will be available in all plausible 
market conditions; and
 – following the UK’s vote to leave the 
European Union, the terms of exit are 
such that Carpetright will be able to 
continue to operate competitively in  
the same European markets as it 
presently does.
The principal risks are set out on pages 
26 to 27 and the most relevant potential 
impact of these risks on viability was 
considered to be:
 – customer proposition and changing 
customer preferences whereby a failure 
to anticipate and plan for changes in 
consumer tastes could have a material 
effect on future operations and financial 
performance; and
 – changing economic conditions which  
in the event of a significant reduction 
in house prices, housing transactions 
or consumer confidence, the Group 
would expect to have an adverse 
impact on its performance
The Board overlaid the potential impact  
of the principal risks which could affect 
solvency or liquidity in “severe but 
plausible” scenarios onto the five-year 
plans and concluded that the business 
would remain viable. As part of this, it 
performed sensitivity analyses that flexed 
inputs to the forecasts including reduced 
income, profitability and liquidity, both 
individually and in unison, to reflect these 
severe but plausible scenarios. Based 
on the results of the procedures outlined 
above, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the five-year period of 
their assessment.
Going concern
The Directors also considered it 
appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements on the going concern basis,  
as explained in the basis of preparation 
paragraph in note 1 to the accounts on 
page 69.
The Group is principally funded through 
shareholders’ funds and bank debt.  
The principal banking facility, which 
includes a revolving credit facility for 
£45 million, is committed to the end of  
July 2019. The Directors have considered 
the future cash requirements of the Group 
and are satisfied that the facilities are 
sufficient to meet its liquidity needs.  
The facilities are subject to a number  
of financial covenants, including a leverage 
covenant, a fixed charge cover covenant, 
and a capital expenditure covenant.  
The fixed charge cover covenant is  
the most sensitive to changes in  
the Group’s profitability.
The Directors have considered the 
expected performance of the business 
over at least the next twelve months and 
modelled this performance against the 
covenants that have been set. In addition, 
the Directors have considered the trading 
performance necessary to breach the 
banking covenants as well as mitigating 
factors that would be available and 
actionable in the event that the adverse 
trading performance became reality.
The Directors have also considered the net 
current liability position of the Group and, 
given the supplier payment terms and the 
expected cash generation, the Directors 
confirm that the Group is forecast to be 
able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Directors confirm that, after 
considering the matters set out above, 
they have a reasonable expectation  
that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for a minimum of 
twelve months following the signing of 
these accounts. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.  
Further details of the Group’s liquidity are 
given in the financial review on page 23.

on the three stages of their experience – 
in-store ordering, estimating and fitting.  
The ratings and feedback are immediately 
available to our store and support office 
colleagues, where they are used to 
monitor and improve our levels of service 
to our customers.
We recognise that matters such as how 
we treat our people, the environment 
and ethical trading are important to our 
customers and colleagues, and details can 
be found below.
Our people
The Group employs over 3,000 people.
Equal opportunities
The Board believes in creating, throughout 
the Group, a culture that is free from 
discrimination and harassment, and will 
not tolerate discrimination in any form.  
We are an equal opportunities employer 
and our people and applicants are treated 
fairly and equally regardless of their age, 
colour, creed, disability, full or part-time 
status, gender, marital status, nationality 
or ethnic origin, race, or sexual orientation.  
Applications from people with disabilities 
are always fully considered. Should an 
individual become disabled while working 
for the Company, efforts are made to 
continue their employment and retraining 
is provided, if necessary.
We believe the attributes of individuals 
and their different perspectives and 
experiences add value to our business.  
During the year we committed to the ‘Ban 
the Box’ initiative, ensuring ex-offenders 
are not excluded from appropriate job 
opportunities within our business.
We recognise that a diverse workforce 
will provide us with an insight into different 
markets and help us anticipate and 
provide what our customers want from us.
A breakdown by gender of the number of 
persons who were Directors of the Group, 
senior managers and other employees as 
at 29 April 2017 is set out below.
Male Female
Directors 5 1
Senior managers 8 2
Other employees 2,462 728
Total 2,475 731
Training and development
Our training and development 
programmes are focused on giving our 
people the skills they need to carry out 
their jobs and in due course to move 
up to new roles, enabling them to 
develop their careers. This has included 
training in relation to health and safety, 
interest free credit, product knowledge, 
customer service, management skills and 
personal development.
In October 2016 we introduced a new 
social learning platform, “Fuse”, which 
enables all colleagues to take control of 
their own development with access to 
bite-sized learning anywhere, any time 
and on any device, including the use of an 
app.  Since the launch, over 6,000 training 
plans have been completed with another 
1,000 + learning plans in progress.
Engagement
There are a number of communication 
channels in place to help people develop 
their knowledge of, and enhance their 
involvement with, the Group. These 
channels include surveys, management 
briefings, briefings to stores and offices, 
and other less formal communications.  
In 2016 we started using Fuse as an 
additional communication tool, enabling 
us to reach all UK and RoI colleagues 
instantly for the first time. So far 80% 
of colleagues have engaged with the 
platform, and, on average Fuse receives 
72,000 page views per day.
Additionally, all annual results and interim 
management statements are made 
available through both the intranet and 
Fuse. Directors and senior management 
regularly visit stores and discuss matters 
of current interest and concern with 
their colleagues.
Share ownership
All colleagues have an opportunity to 
invest in the Company’s shares through 
a Savings Related Share Option Scheme.  
Over 30% of colleagues participate in 
this scheme.
Bribery and whistleblowing
As a responsible employer we maintain a 
firm stance against any type of corruption 
within the business.
There is a Group-wide Anti-bribery and 
Corruption Policy in place which requires 
compulsory Anti-Bribery compliance and 
a copy of the Policy is circulated to all 
new starters when they join the business.
The Group operates whistleblowing 
hotlines through third-party providers 
enabling matters of concern to be 
raised with the Company on a named or 
anonymous basis. Further details can be 
found in the Audit Committee report on 
page 37.
Health and safety
We operate an established process for risk 
assessment and employees are expected 
and encouraged to be proactive on health 
and safety issues.
Corporate responsibility is about doing business the right way.
Strategic report continued
28 | Annual report and accounts 2017 Health and Safety Committees meet 
to review any issues to identify, prevent 
and militate against potential risks. We 
investigate all accidents and recommend 
changes to working practices, additional 
colleague training and disciplinary action 
as and when appropriate. There have not 
been any fatalities this year (2016: nil).
We have received notification of 144 
accidents across the Group during the 
year, compared to 179 in the prior year.  
Of these, 133 were in the UK, with the 
remaining 11 being in Europe and the 
Republic of Ireland.
Human rights and modern slavery
We do not have a specific human rights 
policy at present, but we do have policies 
that adhere to international human rights 
principles. We will review from time-to-
time whether a specific human rights 
policy is needed in the future, over and 
above our existing policies.
Our statement on modern slavery is on our 
website www.carpetright.plc.uk.
Our communities
We are committed to giving something 
back to the communities in which we 
operate. From March 2017, following  
a colleague vote, we have been  
supporting the British Heart Foundation.  
The partnership, which is largely 
centred on colleague fundraising, raised 
£10,000 during the first weekend, which 
saw Carpetright staff selling BHF pin 
badges, running raffles, bake sales and 
sponsored cycles.
Our environment
In line with our strategy of building a 
sustainable business, we are committed 
to taking steps to control and minimise 
any damage our operations may cause to 
the environment through manufacturing 
processes, transport, energy usage and 
packaging. In particular, we are aware of 
the issue of climate change and we are 
taking steps to understand and minimise 
our carbon emissions.

Notes:
1. Our methodology has been based on the principles of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
2. Consumption is based on utility bills.
3. We have reported on all the measured emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations. This includes Scopes 1 and 2 but excludes any 
emissions from Scope 3. The period used is 1 May 2016 to 30 April 2017.
4. Conversion factors for electricity, gas and other emissions are those published by the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2014 – GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting.
5. Refrigerant fugitive emissions have been excluded as the impact was immaterial.
Products and suppliers
We have an Ethical and Environmental 
Code of Conduct (the Code) to ensure 
that we have an ethical supply chain and 
require our suppliers to sign up to the 
Code. The Code prohibits, for example, 
animal testing, the use of timber from 
non-sustainable sources and the use of 
certain chemicals which may be harmful to 
customers. This code has been updated 
in order to make it clearer that modern 
slavery is unacceptable.
Energy usage and greenhouse  
gas emissions
We recognise that the Company benefits 
through reduced cost and the environment 
benefits by reducing our consumption 
of energy and water. The release of 
greenhouse gases (ghg), notably CO
2
 
generated by burning fossil fuels, has 
an impact on climate change, which 
presents a risk to both our business and 
the wider environment. We accept our 
responsibility to continually improve our 
environmental performance.
We continue to benefit from the 
introduction of Automatic Meter Readers 
for electricity and gas, which enable 
us to identify high-use locations and 
take corrective action where necessary, 
together with proactive management 
preventing us heating stores overnight.  
During the year ended 2017, we were 
able to reduce our electricity consumption 
by a combination of reducing store 
numbers, introducing LED lighting into our 
refurbished stores and installing motion-
sensor technology to ensure lights are 
only being used when necessary. So far 
we have introduced these energy-saving 
practices into 39 stores in the UK.
Emissions data in respect of the financial 
year ended 2017 is as follows:

Bob Ivell  
Non-Executive Chairman 
“The Group is committed to 
operating within an effective 
corporate governance framework.” 
Introduction 
One of the Board’s key responsibilities is  
to ensure that the Company is run in the 
long-term interests of its shareholders and 
broader stakeholder base.  The Group 
recognises the importance of high 
standards of corporate governance and is 
committed to operating within an effective 
corporate governance framework. 
Application of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
The version of the Corporate Governance 
Code applicable to the current reporting 
period is the September 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code).  The Code is 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
and is available for review on its website. 
During the financial year ended 29 April 
2017, the Company complied with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Governance structure 
The structure of the Board and its 
Committees is set out below. 
The Board 
There have not been any changes to the 
composition of the Board this year. 
Details of the number of meetings and 
Board attendance are set out below:

The Board views that it is appropriately 
balanced and currently consists of the 
Chairman, two Executive and three Non-
Executive Directors, brief biographies of 
whom can be found on pages 30 and 31.  
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors to the Board and this is described 
in the section concerning the Nomination 
Committee on page 34. 
The Board believes that its current  
size and structure are appropriate for 
managing the Group in an effective and 
successful manner. 
Whilst not required by the Code, as the 
Company is outside the FTSE 350, all 
Directors will offer themselves for re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
Highlights 
During the year the Board: 
− assessed and decided upon the 
corporate strategy 
− reviewed and approved all trading 
announcements and the interim and  
final results 
− reviewed the competitive market in which 
the Company operates, the effect of a 
new competitor entering the market  
and the Company’s response 
− agreed the property strategy 
− reviewed the financial effect of the store 
refurbishment programme 
− approved the investment in replacement IT 
− reviewed its risk appetite and the  
current assessment of the principal risks 
compared to the desired level of risk 
− met with senior managers and  
received presentations in relation to  
Fuse (see the CR report on page 28), the 
beds business, property strategy and IT 
− reviewed the terms of reference of  
its Committees 
− approved option grants 
− received an update on the Market  
Abuse Regulations 
− approved the Statement of  
Modern Slavery 
 
32 | Annual report and accounts 2017 www.carpetright.plc.uk 33 
The Non-Executive Directors of the 
Company play a key governance role and 
bring an extra dimension to the Board’s 
deliberations.  The Board considered the 
independence of each Non-Executive 
Director against the criteria specified in  
the Code and has determined that  
each remains fully independent. 
An annual process of evaluation of the 
Board and its Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees has been 
undertaken.  This was led by Bob Ivell with 
the assistance of the Company Secretary.  
The Board and each of its Committees 
considered its mix of skills, its leadership 
and governance role, whether the meetings 
are of the right length, whether the strategic 
and operational focus is appropriate,  
the effectiveness of the Chair and the 
Secretariat and whether all directors  
have the opportunity to air their views.   
The results have been considered by  
the Board and confirmed the strength of 
leadership within the business and a sound 
governance framework, identifying only 
minor changes necessary to improve  
the Board’s effectiveness.  The one  
area highlighted for additional focus is 
succession planning, which is being 
considered by the Nomination Committee. 
The Non-Executive Directors meet, with  
no Executive Directors present, at least 
once each year.  Andrew Page, the Senior 
Independent Director, led the review of the 
Chairman’s performance by meeting with 
each Director and the Company Secretary 
separately and met with the Chairman to 
provide feedback. 
The Board is responsible for setting the 
Group’s objectives and policies, providing 
effective leadership and for approving the 
Group strategy, budgets, business plans 
and major capital expenditure.  It has 
responsibility for the management,  
direction and performance of the Group  
and is accountable to the Company’s 
shareholders for the proper conduct of its 
business.  The Board has a formal schedule 
which sets out those matters requiring 
Board approval and specifically reserved  
to it for decision. 
The Board is responsible for determining its 
risk appetite and did so in the year.  It has 
regularly reviewed the current assessment 
of the principal risks compared to the 
desired level of risk.  Further details of the 
principal risks affecting the Group can be 
found on pages 26 and 27. 
Directors receive weekly sales updates, 
monthly trading results, commentary, 
briefing notes and reports for their 
consideration in advance of each Board 
meeting, including reports on the Group’s 
operations, to ensure that they remain 
briefed on the latest developments and  
are able to make fully informed decisions. 
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary and the 
Board has established a procedure whereby 
Directors may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense.  In 
addition, such advice may include training  
in order to enable them to discharge their 
roles and responsibilities as a Director.   
All new Directors receive an induction 
tailored to their particular requirements.

the Company’s corporate website  
(www.carpetright.plc.uk).
The Board periodically reviews the 
membership of its Committees to ensure 
that it is refreshed annually.  All Non-
Executive Directors (other than the 
Chairman) are members of each  
of the Committees.  The Company 
provides the Committees with sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties.   
The Company Secretary, or his nominee, 
acts as Secretary to each Committee.

Continuing professional 
development 
All Board members are updated on matters 
relevant to the Group, including legal and 
regulatory developments, and members of 
Board Committees are updated on matters 
relevant to their Committee membership.   
In the year, the Remuneration Committee 
received updates on current best practice 
from New Bridge Street. 
The performance of individual Directors  
is considered as part of the annual  
Board appraisal process.  The individual 
development needs of Executive Directors 
are overseen by the Nomination Committee.  
Non-Executive Directors have access  
to professional development provided  
by external bodies.  Their continuing 
competence is considered by the 
Nomination Committee as part of the 
annual process of recommending the 
reappointment of Directors at the AGM. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s share capital and 
significant shareholders can be found on 
pages 61 and 62.

The Committee considers the diversity  
of the Board (including gender) and the  
skills and competencies of the existing 
Directors when drawing up specifications 
for new appointments.  It ensures that  
the development needs of Executive 
Directors and other senior managers  
are addressed appropriately. 
An external search consultancy is ordinarily 
used in relation to the appointment of both 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee also considers whether 
Directors due to retire at an Annual General 
Meeting should be recommended for re-
appointment, and whether the appointment 
of Non-Executive Directors reaching the 
end of their three-year term should be 
renewed.  Committee members do not  
vote on their own re-appointment. 
Following the review of the Board and  
its effectiveness the Committee will be 
providing additional focus in relation to 
succession planning in the coming year. 
The responsibilities of the 
Nomination Committee 
include: 
− identifying and nominating 
candidates for appointment  
to the Board for the approval  
of the Board; 
− reviewing development needs 
of the Executives; and 
− making recommendations  
to the Board on Board 
composition and balance.

Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to introduce the report of the 
Audit Committee for 2017. 
The Committee plays an important part  
in the governance of the Group, with its 
principal activities focused on the integrity of 
financial reporting, quality and effectiveness 
of internal and external audit, risk 
management and the system of  
internal control. 
During the year the Audit Committee 
has undertaken the following tasks: 
– considered our financial results 
announcements and financial statements 
and monitored compliance with relevant 
statutory and listing requirements; 
– reported to the Board on the 
appropriateness of our accounting 
policies and practices; 
– overseen the relationship with the 
external auditors including reviewing  
their independence, objectivity  
and effectiveness; 
– reviewed the external auditors’ plan  
for the audit of the Group’s accounts, 
approved the terms of engagement for 
the audit and reviewed their findings; 
– reviewed the process for ensuring that 
senior management confirm that they 
have supplied the auditors with  
relevant audit information; 
– approved the audit fees paid to the 
external auditors and reviewed the 
application of the policy on non-audit 
work performed by them together with 
the non-audit fees payable to them; 
– reviewed the scope, resources, results 
and effectiveness of the activity of the 
Group internal audit department; 
– reviewed the work of the Executive  
Risk Committee, which oversees the 
identification and management of the 
risks to the business, together with 
reports on the Group’s systems of 
internal control; 
– performed in-depth reviews of specific 
areas of financial reporting, risk and 
internal controls and discussed these 
with the executives responsible for the 
relevant area; 
– considered all matters reported via the 
whistleblowing line and reports relating  
to fraud; 
– reviewed the viability statement; and 
– reviewed its terms of reference  
and effectiveness. 
We meet formally at key times within our 
reporting calendar and the agendas are 
designed to cover significant areas of risk 
over the course of the year and to provide 
oversight and challenge to the key financial 
judgments, controls and processes that 
operate within the Company. 
The Committee will continue to keep  
its activities under review in the light  
of regulatory developments and the 
emergence of best practice. 
Overall, I am satisfied that the activities of 
the Committee during the year enable it  
to gain a good understanding of the key 
risks impacting the Group along with  
the oversight of its key controls. 
I will be available to answer any questions at 
the AGM in September.

Composition 
The Committee meets at least four times 
during the year.  Meetings are attended  
by the members who are independent  
Non-Executive Directors and, by invitation, 
the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Chief 
Financial Officer, and the Director of Group 
Internal Audit.  The external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC),  
were invited to three meetings this year. 
This year, Deloitte LLP, who provide services 
to the internal audit team, also attended one 
meeting with the Audit Committee. 
Other relevant people from the business  
are also invited to attend certain meetings  
in order to provide a deeper level of insight 
into certain key issues and developments.  
There are also private meetings with the 
external and internal auditors without 
management present. 
The Audit Committee is appointed by the 
Board from the Non-Executive Directors of 
the Company.  The terms of reference are 
reviewed annually by the Audit Committee 
and are then referred to the Board for 
approval.  These are available on the 
Company’s corporate website at 
www.carpetright.plc.uk. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by David 
Clifford.  The Board has determined that 
David Clifford has recent and relevant 
financial experience.  There have not been 
any changes to the composition of the 
Committee in the period.  The biographies 
of the members of the Committee can be

Main activities of the 
Committee during the year 
The Committee assisted the Board in 
carrying out its responsibilities in relation  
to financial reporting requirements, risk 
management and the assessment of 
internal controls and has an agenda  
linked to events in the Group’s financial 
calendar.  It also reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function and 
managed the Group’s relationship with  
the external auditors.  The Committee 
Chairman reported to the Board, as part of 
a separate agenda item, on the activity of 
the Committee and matters of particular 
relevance to the Board in the conduct  
of its work. 
The Committee reviewed the viability 
statement, which is designed to be a 
longer-term view of the sustainability of  
the Company’s strategy and business 
model and related resourcing, in the light  
of projected wider economic and market 
developments.  The Committee reviewed 
the processes designed to enable the 
Board to make this statement.  The 
statement appears on page 25 together 
with details of the processes, assumptions, 
and testing which underpin it. 
The internal audit reports this year  
received and reviewed by the Committee 
showed an increasing stock-loss in stores.  
As a result there is a renewed focus on 
reducing this loss through improved 
operational discipline.  There will be a 
measure relative to operational discipline as 
part of the annual bonus in respect of the 
financial year ending 2018, details of which 
are contained in the remuneration report  
on page 58. 
Financial reporting 
The Committee reviewed, with 
management and the external auditors, the 
half-year and annual financial statements, 
concentrating on, amongst other matters: 
– the appropriateness and application  
of accounting policies and compliance 
with the relevant financial reporting 
requirements; 
– material areas in which significant 
judgments have been applied or there 
has been discussion with the external 
auditors; and 
– whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
contains the necessary disclosures  
to fairly reflect the Group’s financial 
condition and results of its operations. 
To aid its review, the Committee considered 
reports from the Chief Financial Officer and 
also reports from the external auditors on 
the outcomes of their half-year review and 
annual audit. 
The primary areas of judgment considered 
by the Committee in relation to the 2017 
accounts, and how these were addressed, 
are set out below.  In all cases the 
Committee discussed with PwC  
its work in respect of these areas. 
36 | Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.carpetright.plc.uk| 37 
Goodwill impairment testing 
The judgments in relation to goodwill 
impairment largely relate to the assumptions 
underlying the calculation of the value-in-
use of the business being tested for 
impairment, primarily the achievement  
of the long-term business plan and 
macroeconomic assumptions underlying 
the valuation process.  The Committee 
addressed these matters through receiving 
reports from management and discussing 
the assumptions used.  The Committee 
agreed that no impairment was necessary. 
Impairment of the valuation of freehold 
and long-leasehold property 
The Committee has carried out a further 
review of the property valuations.  Following 
discussions with both management  
and PwC, the Committee agreed with 
management that a release of £2.2m of  
the impairment of the property charge 
previously carried is appropriate. 
Onerous lease provision 
The practice is to treat a lease as being 
onerous if the store relative to the lease  
is closed or if the expected benefits of  
using the leased property are less than the 
unavoidable property costs.  Management 
makes an assessment as to the cost  
of exiting the lease based on available 
information and knowledge of the property 
market.  The Committee has discussed  
with management the judgments and 
assumptions made in determining the 
provision and agreed with management  
that as a result of the disposal of leases of 
three properties previously considered to be 
onerous, the leases of three further trading 
stores being identified as onerous and the 
reassessment of the provision, there would 
be a net charge of £11.0m to the provision.  
Further details can be found in note 5 to  
the financial statements on page 78. 
Risk management and  
internal control 
Internal audit 
The Committee considered and approved 
the Annual Internal Audit plan and at each 
meeting reviewed reports from the Director 
of Group Internal Audit, including those 
showing performance against the plan,  
and approved changes as appropriate.   
The reports include updates on audit 
activities, progress of the Group audit plan, 
the results of any unsatisfactory audits and 
the action plans to address these areas, 
and resource requirements of the Internal 
Audit department.  The internal audit team 
utilises the services of Deloitte LLP to assist 
in the discharge of its functions.  Private 
discussions are held with the Director  
of Group Internal Audit as necessary 
throughout the year.  Deloitte also met  
with the Committee during the year. 
Internal control 
The Committee reviewed the process  
by which the Group evaluated its control 
environment.  Its work here is driven 
primarily by the work undertaken by the 
Group’s Internal Audit department, which 
includes any reported fraud.  The Director  
of Group Internal Audit monitored the timely 
implementation of any recommendations 
and reported to the Committee accordingly.  
The Committee also reviewed the 
documentation prepared to support  
the Board’s annual statement on internal 
controls before its consideration by the  
full Board. 
Whistleblowing 
The Company operates a whistleblowing 
telephone line in the UK and an email 
whistleblowing facility in Europe.  Both  
are operated by independent companies 
and reports are received by the Director  
of Group Internal Audit, the Company 
Secretary or the HR Director.  Matters 
reported related to individual treatment by 
line managers or colleagues, dishonesty, 
right to work in the UK and breach of 
Company policy.  In each case the issues 
were investigated, a judgment was made 
and action taken where appropriate.   
The outcome of all matters was  
reported to the Audit Committee. 
Risk management 
The Group’s risk assessment process and 
the way in which significant business risks 
are managed is a key area of focus for the 
Committee.  The Committee received and 
considered reports from the Chief Financial 
Officer on the Group’s risk evaluation 
process and reviewed changes to significant 
risks identified.  It also discussed emerging 
and potential risks. 
The Committee reviewed, in detail, the 
assessment and controls for the principal 
risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 
26 and 27.  The work included a review of 
the controls in place to mitigate the risk,  
the assessment by the Director of Group 
Internal Audit and a discussion with the  
risk owner, being a senior executive.   
The Committee considered in-depth 
reviews into fitters, people, information 
technology and cyber risks, risks in Europe, 
changing customer preferences and the  
property portfolio. 
The Committee considers these reviews  
to be an important part of its role, as they 
allow it to meet executive management 
responsible for these areas and undertake 
independent challenge of their activities.

External audit 
Assessing the effectiveness of the external 
audit process is dependent on appropriate 
audit risk identification at the start of the 
audit cycle.  The Committee received a 
detailed audit plan from PwC, identifying 
their assessment of these key risks.  For  
the 2017 financial year the primary risks 
identified and how the scope of the audit 
addressed the area of focus are set out in 
the auditors’ report on pages 103 to 108. 
The Committee discusses the work done 
by the auditors to test management’s 
assumptions and estimates around  
these areas.  The Committee assesses  
the effectiveness of the audit process  
in addressing these matters through the 
reporting it receives from, and discussions 
with, PwC at both the half-year and year-
end.  In addition, the Committee also  
seeks feedback from management on  
the effectiveness of the audit process. 
For the 2017 financial year, management 
was satisfied that there had been 
appropriate focus and challenge on the 
primary areas of audit risk and assessed  
the quality of the audit process to be good.  
The Audit Committee concurred with the 
view of management. 
The Committee holds private meetings with 
the external auditors twice a year to provide 
additional opportunity for open dialogue  
and feedback from the auditors without 
management being present.  Matters 
discussed include the transparency and 
openness of interactions with management 
and confirmation that there has been no 
restriction in scope placed on them by 
management.  The Audit Committee 
chairman also meets with the audit  
partner from time to time outside  
the formal committee process. 
Appointment and independence 
The Committee and Board place great 
emphasis on the independence and 
objectivity of the Group’s auditors, PwC, 
when performing their role in the Group’s 
reporting to shareholders and considering 
their re-appointment each year. 
The Committee reviews the independence, 
objectivity and performance of the auditors 
annually, including the annual report on  
the auditors produced by the Audit Quality 
Review Team of the Financial Reporting 
Council and the auditors’ own annual report 
on its independence. 
PwC have been auditors to the Company 
since 2005 when they were appointed 
following a competitive tender.  They were, 
again, re-appointed following a competitive 
tender which concluded in May 2016 and 
was reported in the 2016 Annual Report. 
The auditors’ tenure runs from one AGM  
to the next and there are no contractual 
obligations that restrict the Committee’s 
choice of external auditors. 
The external auditors are required to  
rotate the audit partner responsible for the 
Group audit every five years.  The audit of 
this Report and Accounts is the third to be 
carried out of the Group by the current  
audit partner. 
Non-audit services 
To further safeguard the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors  
from becoming compromised, the 
Committee has a formal policy governing 
the engagement of the external auditors to 
provide non-audit services.  No changes 
have been made to this policy during the 
year.  This precludes the auditors from 
providing certain services such as valuation 
work or the provision of accounting services 
and also sets a presumption that the 
auditors should only be engaged for non-
audit services where the appointment  
of an alternative supplier would be either 
impractical or inefficient, bearing in mind  
the particular circumstances. 
The auditors may only provide such 
services provided that such advice does not 
conflict with their statutory responsibilities 
and ethical guidance.  There are financial 
limits in respect of which the engagement of 
PwC for non-audit services is pre-approved, 
being no more than 10% of the audit fee.  
For those permitted services that exceed 
the specified fee limits, the Audit Committee 
Chairman’s or the Committee’s approval, 
depending upon the financial expenditure, is 
required before PwC can provide non-audit 
services.  The Audit Committee Chairman’s 
approval is required for any engagement of 
PwC where the fee would exceed 10% of 
the audit fee, but is less than 25% of the 
audit fee, with the Committee’s approval 
being required for expenditure in excess  
of 25% of the audit fee. 
The Committee monitors the volume of 
work provided by the auditors and the fees 
incurred in order to consider whether to use 
other firms.  The Company continues to use 
other firms for general tax advice and to 
support the internal audit function. 
During the year the only non-audit services 
work undertaken by PwC related to online 
technical resources at a total cost of £1k 
(2016: £53k). 
Audit and non-audit fees 
Details of the auditors’ remuneration for 
audit work and non-audit fees for the period 
ended 29 April 2017 are disclosed in note 3 
to the financial statements on page 77 and 
disclosed above.  The Committee approved 
the fees for audit services for 2017 after a 
review of the level and nature of work to be 
performed and after being satisfied that the 
fees were appropriate for the scope of the 
work required. 
Committee evaluation 
The Committee’s activities formed part of 
the review of Board effectiveness performed 
in the year.  Details of this process can  
be found on page 33.  No significant 
matters were identified which needed  
to be addressed.

Directors’ remuneration report

Sandra Turner 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
“The New Policy is designed to 
ensure that executive remuneration 
will continue to be directly related to 
the achievement of the Company’s 
strategic aims.” 
 
 
Dear Shareholder, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report on behalf of the Board. 
The report comprises three key sections: 
– This annual letter; 
– Our remuneration policy report, which 
sets out a summary of the Directors’ 
remuneration policy for all directors of 
Carpetright.  This is a new policy for the 
three years from the Annual General 
Meeting to be held in September 2017 
and will be put to a binding shareholder 
vote at that meeting; and 
– Our annual remuneration report, which 
sets out how our current remuneration 
policy has been implemented. 
The annual remuneration report is subject  
to an advisory shareholder vote at the  
2017 AGM. 
Remuneration policy 
Our current remuneration policy was 
approved by shareholders at our AGM on  
4 September 2014 and became effective 
for three years (the ‘Current Policy’).  I am 
pleased to summarise the Current Policy 
and the way it has been implemented 
during the financial year ended 2017. 
Looking ahead, I also explain in this report 
the Committee’s thinking with regard to  
the design and structure of the Revised 
Remuneration Policy (the ‘New Policy’) 
which is being placed before shareholders 
for approval on a binding basis at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held in 
September 2017.  If approved, the New 
Policy is expected to operate from the 
conclusion of the 2017 AGM until our  
AGM in 2020. 
The Committee continues to remain mindful 
of the interest in executive remuneration.  
The Committee has therefore carefully 
reviewed and taken into consideration the 
developments in corporate governance  
and best practice during the year.  In line 
with this the Committee has again sought  
to ensure that the remuneration policies  
and practices, and the New Policy being 
proposed at this year’s AGM, are clearly 
explained and justified such that they will 
drive behaviour that is both appropriate  
and in the long-term interests of the 
Company and shareholders. 
Remuneration policy review 
The Committee has engaged and consulted 
with its key shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies with regard to director 
remuneration focusing, in particular, on 
obtaining feedback on the proposals for  
the New Policy.  The Committee has 
considered and taken into account all  
of the feedback which it has received  
and is grateful for the engagement that  
has taken place. 
Shareholders approved the Current Policy 
at the 2014 AGM, with a vote in favour of 
87%.  Subsequent years’ remuneration 
reports detailing the application year on  
year of the Current Policy were approved by 
shareholders with votes in favour of 85%.  
The majority of the vote against the reports 
related to the absence of a two-year post-
vesting period in relation to the Company’s 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).  The 
Committee, accordingly, took that into 
account in producing the revised policy and 
the New Policy includes such a provision. 
The Committee remains firmly committed  
to ensuring that the remuneration of the 
Executive Directors supports and drives the 
Carpetright strategy based on a framework 
which both challenges and motivates 
management to deliver the strategy  
and value for our shareholders. 
A summary of the changes proposed 
between the Current Policy and the New 
Policy is set out in the policy table on pages 
42 to 45 and, as can be seen, only limited 
changes are being proposed. 
Long term incentive plan 
As explained above, one change that we 
are proposing is the introduction of a two-
year post-vesting period in relation to the 
Company’s LTIP.  A resolution to amend 
the LTIP rules will be presented to the AGM 
as a consequential amendment is required 
to enable dividend equivalents to be paid in 
respect of the two-year post-vesting period.  
This will apply to all awards which have 
been made subject to a post-vesting 
holding period, including those to be  
made in July 2017. 
  
Directors’ report Strategic report Shareholder information Financial statements
39 www.carpetright.plc.uk | Directors’ report continued 
Directors’ remuneration report continued 
40 | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
The Committee also recognises that it  
is increasingly common for companies  
to include more than one performance 
measure in respect of the LTIP.  Historically 
the Company has only included one 
measure in respect of LTIP awards and  
has debated, at length, an appropriate 
second measure.  Amendments have  
been proposed in the New Policy to make 
this desire more explicit.  However, the 
Committee decided that, for grants made 
this year, only one measure will be used. 
Share retention guidelines 
The current shareholding guideline is  
for Executive Directors to hold the same 
percentage of base salary as awards are 
made under the LTIP. 
Changes have been made to the 
shareholding guidelines such that  
there is an additional holding period  
in respect of shares vesting under the  
Long-Term Incentive Plan of one year  
post-employment. 
Conclusion 
The Committee is confident that the  
New Policy will ensure that the level of 
remuneration in place and its linkage to  
the achievement of increasing shareholder 
value continues to remain appropriate.  In 
particular, the New Policy is designed to: 
ensure that executive remuneration will 
continue to be directly related to the 
achievement of the Company’s strategic 
aims; link a significant proportion of pay to 
performance, with appropriate and robust 
performance criteria and targets; directly 
relate increases in pay and pension to the 
workforce in general; have no retrospective 
adjustment or re-testing of performance  
or related metrics; be compatible with the 
Company’s risk policies and systems  
and remain sufficiently flexible to address 
changing circumstances as they arise but 
within carefully agreed parameters.  The 
Committee therefore commends the New 
Policy to shareholders at the 2017 AGM  
as set out in the Notice of Meeting. 
Voting on both the New Policy and the 
annual report on remuneration will take 
place at the forthcoming AGM to be held  
on 7 September 2017. 
Salaries 
For the 2017 pay review, the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer 
indicated to the Committee that, in light of 
the performance of the business, their base 
salaries should remain unchanged.  The 
Committee therefore decided not to 
conduct a review of their pay and,  
as a result, their base salaries  
remain unchanged. 
Annual bonus scheme 
As described in the financial review  
section of the Annual report the Group has 
delivered an underlying profit before tax of 
£14.4m.  The strategic objectives relating  
to property and customer service for the 
Executive Directors were both achieved in 
part.  However, this level of profit is below 
the level at which an annual bonus would 
be earned.  Consequently, no bonus will be 
paid in respect of the financial year ended 
April 2017.  Further details can be found  
in the annual report on remuneration  
on page 53. 
Annual incentive arrangements for the 
financial year ending 2018 for Executive 
Directors will be again based upon the 
achievement of underlying profit targets and 
strategic objectives.  Subject to commercial 
confidentiality, performance against these 
targets will be disclosed in next year’s report. 
Long term incentives 
The level of vesting under the LTIP  
awards made in July 2014 reflects  
the challenging targets that were set for 
participants.  The performance measure  
set related to cumulative underlying profit 
over a three-year measurement period.   
I am pleased to report that, for the first  
time since 2009, the performance over  
the three-year period has been such that 
75% of the LTIP awards made will vest  
on 31 July 2017. 
The Committee has reviewed the current 
performance of the LTIP awards made in 
2015 and 2016, which were also based 
upon cumulative underlying earnings per 
share measures, and has concluded that 
they are currently unlikely to vest.  Further 
details can be found on page 55. 
It is anticipated that awards under the  
LTIP will normally be made following the 
announcement of the annual results.   
The awards to be made in 2017 will  
have a performance measure based on 
underlying earnings per share and will  
be subject to a two-year post-vesting 
holding period.  The Committee will 
continue to keep the introduction of a 
second performance measure relative for 
LTIP awards under review for future awards.  
The level of awards will be consistent with 
the level made in previous years. 
Gender pay gap reporting 
In addition to the consideration of executive 
remuneration, the Committee has taken a 
keen interest in the gender pay gap and the 
Company will be publishing its data when 
required by law. 
Closing comments 
I will be available to answer any questions  
at the AGM in September and recommend 
that you support the adoption of the New 
Policy, the Directors’ remuneration report 
and annual report on remuneration at our 
forthcoming meeting.

Part 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report 
Introduction 
This report has been prepared to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and other applicable legislation, including the 
Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (‘Regulations’), and has also 
been prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the Listing Rules of the  
UK Listing Authority. 
As part of its responsibilities the Remuneration Committee prepares the Policy Report, below, describing the framework within w hich the 
Company remunerates its Executive Directors an d other senior executives (subject to shareholder approval).  If approved by shar eholders  
at the 2017 AGM, it will replace the Current Policy (approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM) and will apply for a period of t hree years 
from the date of the 2017 AGM or until a revised Policy is approved by shareholders, if sooner.  Any existing remuneration comm itments  
or contractual arrangements agreed prior to the approval and impl ementation of this Policy in acco rdance with any policy in pla ce at the 
time, namely before 7 September 2017, will be honoured in accordance with their original terms. 
Adoption of New Policy 
The Company’s existing remuneration policy was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 Annual General Meeting of  
the Company. 
The Company is proposing to shareholders the New Policy at the forthcoming 2017 AGM, in order to meet the requirement for such 
policies to be submitted to shareholders at least once every three years.  The New Policy is again designed to ensure that the remuneration 
framework will support and drive the strategy forward by both ch allenging and motivating the Executive Directors and senior man agement 
to deliver it and drive value for our shareholders.  Details of the New Policy are set out on pages 42 to 49. 
The Remuneration Policy Report as approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2014 AGM is set out in the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 
2016 Annual Reports which can be found on the Company’s website at www.carpetright.plc.uk. 
Policy overview 
A key part of the Committee’s role is to ensure that the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management is aligned t o the 
Company’s strategic objectives.  It is key that the Company is able to attract and retain leaders who are focused and also appr opriately 
incentivised to deliver the Company’s strategic objectives within a framework which is aligned with the interests of the Compan y’s 
shareholders.  This alignment is (or will be, if the New Policy is adopted by shareholders) achieved through a combination of s etting 
appropriate performance targets, a retention period for vested LT IP awards and share ownership gu idelines which require executives to 
build up holdings of Carpetright shares.  These guidelines, whic h are reviewed at least annually, require Executive Directors t o build up and 
maintain a target holding having a value equal to the same multip le of base salary as awards are made under the LTIP (150% for Wilf Walsh, 
125% for Neil Page).  Until such a holdin g is achieved, each Executive Director is ob liged to retain shares with a minimum valu e equal to 
50% of the post-tax vested shares under the LTIP. 
The Committee ensures that a significant proportion of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors remains at risk.  With  
all packages for Executive Directors substantially geared toward s meeting targets set under the annual bonus and long-term ince ntive 
schemes, the Committee believes that the pay and benefits of it s Executive Directors and senior management adequately take account  
of reward versus risk. 
The Committee considers that no element of the remuneration arrangements, which are all very carefully considered, will encoura ge 
inappropriate risk taking or behaviour by any executive. 
The policy for the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive Directors is set out in the tables below.

market rate for the individual and their role. 
When reviewing the salaries of the Executive 
Directors, the Committee also has regard to 
the impact on the cost of pension provision 
and pay and conditions elsewhere in the 
Group.  In particular, the Committee takes 
account of the level of salary increases 
awarded to other employees of the  
Group when deciding on increases for 
Executive Directors. 
Annual increases generally in line 
with the level of standard increase 
awarded to other employees. 
More significant increases may be 
awarded at the discretion of the 
Committee in connection with: 
– an increase in the scope and 
responsibility of the individual’s 
role; or 
– the individual’s development and 
performance in the role following 
appointment.

Pension    
The Company  
aims to provide 
competitive 
retirement benefits. 
This helps recruit 
and retain Executive 
Directors. 
The Company operates a defined contribution 
Group Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’).  Executive 
Directors are offered a specific percentage of their 
base salary to fund their own pension provision.  
The Executive Directors are able to choose whether 
the allowance is paid to the GPPP or to receive  
the allowance by way of a salary supplement. 
Up to 20% of base salary. Not applicable 
No substantive change to policy from 2014 vote. 
Annual bonus   
To incentivise 
achievement of 
annual targets and 
objectives consistent 
with the short to 
medium-term 
strategic needs  
of the business,  
so as to encourage 
sustainable growth  
in the Company’s 
operating profits. 
Bonuses are awarded by reference to performance 
against specific targets measured over a single 
financial year. 
Any amounts awarded to an Executive Director 
under this arrangement are paid out in full shortly 
after the assessment of the performance targets 
has been completed. 
Bonuses do not form part of the Executive 
Directors’ pensionable earnings. 
Bonuses are subject to clawback at the discretion 
of the Committee in the event of a material 
misstatement of the financial results, an error  
in assessing the size of the bonus or where  
the individual had committed an act of gross 
misconduct during the relevant financial year. 
Capped at 100% of  
base salary. 
The percentage payable 
for on-target performance 
is determined by the 
Committee each year in 
light of the degree of 
stretch in the targets and 
affordability of the resulting 
bonus pay-outs relative to 
budgeted levels of profit. 
The measures and targets 
are set annually by the 
Committee in order to 
ensure that they are 
relevant to participants 
and take account of the 
most up-to-date business 
plan and strategy. 
All or a significant majority 
of the bonus opportunity 
will normally be 
determined by reference  
to performance against  
a demanding Group 
underlying profit target. 
Additional targets  
applied may relate to  
the achievement of 
specific strategic or 
personal objectives.  
These measures will be 
disclosed in the annual 
report on remuneration, 
where not deemed 
commercially sensitive.

Share retention guidelines   
To further align the 
interests of Executive 
Directors to those of 
shareholders. 
Executive Directors are expected to build up and retain 
a shareholding of the same percentage of salary as 
awards are made under the LTIP by the retention of 
shares with a minimum value equal to 50% of the net  
of tax gain arising from any vesting or exercise under 
the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
The Executive Directors are required to continue to hold 
the lower of 50% of their guideline level and 50% of the 
value of shares they own at cessation of employment 
(excluding shares purchased in the market) for a period 
of one year following cessation of employment. 
Not applicable. Not applicable. 
Proposed substantive change for 2017 policy vote. 
This matter did not previously appear in the policy table, although the guidelines existed and was reported upon in previous Ann ual 
Reports.  In 2014 the guideline was to build up and retain a shar eholding having a value equal to 100% of base salary using the 
mechanism set out above.  This was increased in 2015 to shareholdings having a value equal to the same percentage of salary  
as awards are made under the LTIP (150% for the Chief Executive and 125% for the Chief Financial Officer). 
The guideline now applies, to a reduced extent, for a period of one year following cessation of employment.

The Chairman is paid a fee, and no additional fee will be paid 
for chairing any of the Board’s Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors are paid an annual basic fee plus 
additional fees are payable to the Senior Independent Director 
(SID) and the Chair of each of its Committees.  Where the SID 
role is combined with that of chairing a Committee then only 
one fee is paid. 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme 
membership, bonus or incentive arrangements.  They are 
entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses 
and tax thereon. 
Limited benefits relating to travel, accommodation and 
hospitality may be provided in relation to the performance  
of any Directors’ duties. 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are set by the Executive 
Directors with reference to external data on fee levels in  
similar businesses, having taken account of the 
responsibilities of individual Directors and their  
expected annual time commitment. 
The aggregate  
amount of Directors’ 
fees is limited by the 
Company’s Articles  
of Association. 
Not applicable. 
Proposed substantive change for 2017 policy vote. 
The references to deputy chairman have been removed as the Company no long er has a deputy chairman (who was also the SID) and 
clarity has been provided that an additional fee can be paid to the SID.

Differences in remuneration policy across the Group 
The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is designed with regard to the policy for emplo yees across 
the Group as a whole.  However, the differences set out above arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market 
competitive for the various categories of individuals.  They also reflect the fact that, in the case of the Executive Directors and senior 
executives, a greater emphasis is typically placed on performanc e-related pay and in share-based form, which provides a good li nk  
to long-term Company performance. 
The following differences exist between the above policy for the remuneration of Directors and its approach to the payment of  
employees generally: 
– a lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain  
senior managers; 
– store-based colleagues receive commission based upon sales achi eved, and field-based colleagues receive bonuses based upon the 
performance of their sphere of responsibility; 
– participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.  Other employees are elig ible to 
participate in the Company’s all employee share schemes; 
– under the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme, the Company contribution for less senior employees is lower than that 
provided to Executive Directors; and 
– benefits offered to other employees generally comprise colleague discount and, depending upon the colleague’s seniority, health care. 
Incentive plan determinations and discretions 
The Committee fully recognises that the exercise of discretion must be undertaken in a very careful and considered way and that it is  
an area that will quite rightly come under scrutiny from shareholders and other stakeholders.  It is, however, important for th e Committee  
to retain some discretion to make payments outside its remuneration policy in exceptional circumstances.  The Committee confirm s that 
any exercise of discretion in such circumstances would be within the available discretions set out in this report, the rules of the relevant 
schemes, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant and that the maximum levels available under any relevant plans would n ot  
be exceeded. 
The Committee may grant awards under the LTIP as conditional share awards or nil (or nominal) cost options.  The Committee may also 
decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to sh are-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, althou gh it 
does not currently intend to do so, other than in respect of the tax element of any vesting of awards made under the LTIP.  The Committee 
may decide that participants will receive a divide nd equivalent payment (in cash and/or shares). 
The choice of the performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus reflect the Committee’s aim that annual incentives should promote 
growth in underlying earnings, while also promoting the achievement of key non-financial objectives.  The LTIP performance meas ure 
captures long-term growth in earnings performance, which we believe is most closely aligned with the financial performance expe cted  
by our shareholders.  In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Co mmittee will 
ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and se nior management will not raise environmental, social or governance risks 
by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.  More generally, the Committee w ill ensure that the overall remuneration p olicy does not 
encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking. 
  
46 | Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.carpetright.plc.uk| 47 
With regard to the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP, the Committee, consistent with market practice, is required to make certai n 
determinations under and retains discretion over a number of area s relating to the operation and administration of these plans.  These 
include (but are not limited to) the following (with the maximum level of awards restricted as set out in the policy table on p ages 42 to 45): 
– who participates in the plans; 
– the timing of grant of award and/or payment; 
– the size of an award and/or a payment (within the limits set out in the policy table above); 
– the choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and target s for each incentive plan in ac cordance with the policy set ou t above 
and the rules of each plan;  
– discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event of a change of control or reconstruction; 
– determination of good leaver status for incentive plan purposes based on the rules of each plan and the appropriate treatment c hosen; 
– making adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, on a change of control and s pecial 
dividends), provided that the revised conditions or targets are not materially less difficult to satisfy; and 
– discretion to allow participants to sell, transfer, assign or dispose of some or all of their shares in exceptional circumstanc es before the 
end of the holding period, subject to such additional terms and conditions as the Committee may specify. 
Any exercise of discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the annual report on remuneration and may, as appropriate, b e the 
subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders. 
Legacy arrangements 
In approving the Policy Report, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former Directors 
that is consistent with the approved remune ration policy in force at the time the commitment was made (or, if made before the C urrent 
Policy was approved, as have been disclosed previously to shareholders), or was made at a time when the relevant individual was not  
a Director of the Company. 
Consideration of employee views 
Although the Committee does not formally consult employees on executive remuneration, the Committee considers the general basic  
salary increase as well as pay and conditions for the broader employee population when determining the annual salary increases for  
the Executive Directors.

Service agreements and policy on termination 
It is the Company’s policy to employ UK Ex ecutive Directors under contracts with an in definite term subject to termination by n otice given 
by either party, normally of 12 months or less.  Non-UK Executive Directors would be employed under contracts with similar term s to those 
of UK Executive Directors, subject to market practice and la ws of any other jurisdiction where an employee is based. 
The Company seeks to avoid any payment for failure.  The circumstances of the termination (taking into account the individual’s 
performance) and an individual’s duty and opportunity to mitigate losses are taken into account in every case. 
If the Company terminates employment without giving full notice to the Executive Director, under the Service Contracts the Comp any has 
the option to either: 
– pay damages calculated by reference to common law principles, including an obligation on the Executive Director to mitigate los s; or  
– make a payment in lieu of notice calculated by reference to basic salary and benefits only.  Such payments may be phased and wo uld be 
reduced or terminated if alternative employment was secured during the notice period.  There is also a requirement to mitigate loss. 
The Company also retains flexibility to pay reasonable legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual that are associate d with the 
termination (including the settlement of claims brought ag ainst the Company) and to provide outplacement services. 
In circumstances in which a departing director may be entitled to pursue a legal claim, the Company may negotiate settlement te rms and, 
with the approval of the Committee on the remuneration elements therein, enter into a settlement agreement accordingly. 
In addition, the Company would honour any legal entitlements, such as statutory redundancy payments or awards made by any tribu nal or 
court, which executives may have on, or in respect of, termination. 
No bonuses are payable to individuals who are no longer employed or are under notice at the end of the financial year. 
Long-term incentive awards lapse on cessation of employment othe r than in certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances (including death, 
retirement with the agreement of the Committee, ill health, or b ecause the individual’s employing company or part of the busine ss in which 
employment is transferred out of the Group or as otherwise determ ined by the Committee).  Where an individual is a ‘good leaver’, awards 
would not lapse but would normally continue to vest at the end of the original performance period but only if, and to the exten t that, the 
applicable performance conditions are satisfied.  Awards would also normally be subject to a pro-rata reduction to take account of the 
proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed, although the Committee has discretion to disapply pro-rating in certain circ umstances.  
On a change of control awards would vest early, subject to performance conditions being achieved, and would normally be subject to a 
pro-rata reduction, although the Committee has discretion to disapply pro-rating. 
Neil Page and Wilf Walsh have contracts of an indefinite term, subject to a 12 month notice pe riod.  Non-Executive Directors are entitled to 
one month’s notice. 
Recruitment remuneration 
Salaries for new hires (including internal promotions) will be set to reflect their skills and experience, the Company’s intend ed pay positioning 
and the market rate for the role.  If it is considered appropriate to appoint a new Director on a below market salary (for exam ple, to allow 
them to gain experience in the role), their salary may be increased to a market level over a number of years by way of a series of increases 
above the general rate of wage growth in the Group and inflation. 
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s approved 
remuneration policy in force at the time of appointment.  The Committee has discretion to set different targets and/or vary the weightings  
of the targets used in the annual bonus and LTIP for the first year following appointment.  In addition, the Committee may offe r additional 
cash and/or share-based elements if it considers these to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders).  Any such 
additional cash and/or share-based payments would be: (i) based so lely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer an d would 
reflect (as far as practicable) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirement attaching to that remuneratio n; and  
(ii) delivered under the Group’s existing incentive arrangements to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted ou tside  
these schemes, if necessary, and as permitted under the Listing Rules. 
In the case of an internal appointment, an y outstanding variable pay awarded in relati on to the previous role will be allowed t o pay out 
according to its terms of grant (adjusted as relevant to take into account the Board appointment). 
The Committee may also agree that the Comp any will compensate executives, both intern al and external, for certain relocation ex penses 
as appropriate.  Tax equalisation may also be considered if an executive is adversely affected by taxation due to their employm ent with the 
Company.  Legal fees and other costs incurred by the individual may also be paid by the Company. 
Fees for new Non-Executive Directors would be set in line with the policy set out above.

Outside appointments of the Executive Directors 
Executive Directors retain remuneration from outside non-executive directorships.  Wilf Walsh was a non-executive director of G ala Coral 
until 1 November 2016 and retained his fees from this directorship which accrued at a rate of £80,000 p.a. 
Policy for Non-Executive Directors 
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts.  They are appointed for an initial three-year period, subject to bei ng re-elected 
by members annually.  
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received on the Directors’ remuneration report each year and guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more generally.  Shareholders’ views are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy.  T he 
Company consulted with major shareholders and other shareholder re presentative bodies in relation to changes to its remuneratio n policy. 
Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration policy and annual report on remunerati on, and any 
matters discussed with shareholders during the year, are set out in the annual report on remuneration.

Part 3 – Annual report on remuneration 
Introduction 
This annual report on remuneration provides details of the way in which the Committee implemented its policy during the financi al year to  
29 April 2017.  It also summarises how the policy contained within the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report on pages 41 to 49 will be 
applied in the financial year ending 28 April 2018. 
It has been prepared in accordance with the Regulations 2008.  In accordance with the Regulations, this part of the report will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM on 7 September 2017. 
The Company’s auditors are required to report to Carpetright’s shar eholders on the “auditable parts” of this annual report on r emuneration 
(which have been highlighted as such below) and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts ha ve been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006. 
Structure and Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sandra Turner.  Details of its membership, the date they joined the Committee and atte ndance

Summary of Committee activity during the year ended 2017 
During the year ended 2017 the Committee has: 
– conducted an extensive review of the current remuneration policy; 
– considered both internal and external reference points in the completion of this review; 
– undertaken a formal investor consultation; 
– discussed and reviewed the salaries of Directors and other senior executives; 
– discussed and reviewed the level of awards under the LTIP; 
– considered the appropriate metrics and targets for both the annual bonus and LTIP awards for the year ahead; 
– considered performance against the targets for the 2016 annual bonus (and following the year end, the 2017 annual bonus); 
– considered, since the year end, the performance against targets for the 2014 LTIP and approved payments under that award; 
– considered and approved the content of the Directors’ remuneration report; 
– reviewed and proposed new share retention guidelines for Directors; 
– approved the launch of an annual invitation under the SAYE scheme; and 
– reviewed its own performance. 
Remuneration advice 
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if it considers this beneficial.  Over the course of the year, the 
Committee was advised by New Bridge Street (a trading name of Ao n Hewitt Limited, part of Aon plc).  New Bridge Street was appo inted 
as advisers in 2010 following a competitive tender.  The Committee’s advisers attended all five Committee meetings.  New Bridge Street, 
which is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct for Executive Remuneration Consultants, did not pro vide 
other services to the Company.  Fees paid (excluding VAT) by the Company to New Bridge Street during the year amounted to £39k net  
of VAT (2016: £25k).  Although other members of the Aon plc grou p of companies provided insurance broking and advisory services to the 
Company, the Committee is satisfied that the provision of such services did not create any conflict of interest.  The Committee reviews the 
effectiveness and independence of its advisers at a Committee meeting on an annual basis.

Notes: 
1. The main benefits available to the Executive Directors during the year ended 2017 were a car allowance, life assurance and priv ate medical cover. 
2. The pension provision is by way of a salary supplement to the Executive’s base salary. 
3. This column shows the amount of bonus paid or payable in respect of the year in question. 
4. This column shows the value of shares that vested in respect of LTIP awards with performance conditions that ended during the r elevant period and includes dividends 
accrued during the relevant performance period and are payable on vesting.  The share price used for the purpose of calculation of the figure for the financial year 
ended 2017 is the average mid-market closing share price (rounded to the nearest penny) in the dealing days in the three months to 29 April 2017, being 225p.   
This will be restated in next year’s report to reflect the actual share price on the date of vesting.  Details of the vesting o f the January 2014 awards (included in  
the 2016 single figure) are provided on page 54.  Further details of the LTIP’s operation during the year ended 2017 are provid ed on page 55.

Payments to past directors (audited) 
No payments were made to past directors in the financial year ended 2017. 
Pensions (audited) 
Executive Directors are offered an allowance of 20% of their base salary to fund their own pension provision.  The individual i s able to 
choose whether this allowance is paid to the Company’s defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’) or paid by way of  
a salary supplement. 
Wilf Walsh and Neil Page both received their allowance as a salary supplement. 
Annual incentives – 2017 structure and outcome (audited) 
In respect of the financial year ended 2017, Executive Directors were eligible to receive an annual performance bonus based on the 
achievement of performance targets relating to Group underlying profit (80% of the total opportunity) and strategic metrics lin ked to 
property and customer service in store (20% of the total opportunity).  Payment in respect of the achievement of strategic obje ctives  
was subject to an underpin based upon the Group’s financial performance. 
The strategic objectives were as follows: 
– A property-related objective.  As disclosed in the Strategic Repo rt on page 12, we are managing the portfolio to reduce square footage, 
eliminate store catchment overlap and relocating to better locations on realistic rent deals.  During the year we opened 14 new stores 
and closed 22, giving a net reduction of 8 stores.  We continue to eliminate stores from towns where we have more than one unit .   
Due to the ongoing activity in relation to the property portfolio the precise targets are commercially sensitive.  The precise targets will  
be disclosed once they are no longer commercially sensitive.  As a result, the property targets in respect of the financial year ended  
2016 as well as in respect of the financial year ended 2017 are yet to be disclosed. 
– Improvement in customer service relating to the Net Promoter Score.  This was a move away from the previous measure and towards  
a more recognisable metric.  The proportion of highly sati sfied customers and overall satisfaction is also measured. 
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors for the 2017 financial year was 100% (2016: 100%) of basic salary earned in the

The Committee considered the extent to which the Executive Directors had achieved the financial and strategic objectives.  The strategic 
objectives relating to the property objective and the Net Promoter Score were met to the extent as set out in the table below.  However,  
as the financial metric was not achieved, no bonus will be payable.

Share ownership and shareholding guidelines for Directors (audited) 
The Company had a share ownership policy that requires the Executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding having a value 
equal to the same multiple of base salary as awards are made under the LTIP (150% for Wilf Walsh, 125% for Neil Page).  Until s uch a 
holding is achieved, an Executive Director is obliged to retain shares with a minimum value equal to 50% of the post-tax vested shares 
under the LTIP.  The Executive Directors are required to hold the lower of 50% of their guideline level and 50% of the value of shares  
they own at cessation of employment (excluding any shares purcha sed in the market) for a period of one year following cessation of 
employment.  As no LTIP awards have vested, all Directors have complied with the guidelines, although the holdings of Wilf Wals h  
and Neil Page were below the target holding of base salary. 
The beneficial interests of those individuals who were Director s as at 29 April 2017 and their immediate families in the ordina ry shares of the 
Company are set out in the table below.  Additionally, the Executive Directors have an indirect interest in 365,248 shares held in trust to 
satisfy awards made under the LTIP.

Application of the remuneration policy for the financial year ending 2018 
Basic salary 
For the 2017 pay review, the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer indicated to the Committee that, in light of the p erformance of 
the business, their base salaries should remain unchanged.  The Committee therefore decided not to conduct a review of their pa y and,  
as a result, their base salaries remain unchanged.  The current salaries of the Executive Directors are as follows:

Benefits and pension 
Benefits and pension will operate in the financial year ending 20 18 as per their respective policies set out in the Policy Repo rt  
on pages 41 to 49. 
Annual bonus plan performance targets 
The annual bonus plan for the financial year ending 2018 will oper ate consistently with the policy detailed in the Policy Repor t on page 43. 
Performance targets for the Executive Direct ors for the financial year ending 2018 will be based on a combination of Group unde rlying  
profit (80% of the total opportunity) and strategic metrics linked to property (10% of the total opportunity), customer service (5% of the total 
opportunity) and improved store disciplines (5% of the total opportunity).  Payment in respect of the achievement of strategic objectives will 
also be subject to an underpin based on the Group’s financial performance. 
Consistent with our policy and the Group’s practice over a number of years, the Committee has set the percentage of bonus payab le for 
on-target performance in light of the degree of stretch in the targets and the affordability of the pay-outs to the Group.  The range will be  
to pay 0% unless a threshold level of performance has been achieved, 20% of maximum at threshold and 50% of maximum for achievi ng 
target and maximum for achieving a stretch level of performance.  Further details of the targets are currently commercially sen sitive and the 
Company will not be disclosing them at the start of the year.  Ho wever, they will, unless they remain commercially sensitive, be disclosed 
retrospectively in the 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Long-term incentive awards in the financial year ended 2018 
The Committee intends to make the next awards under the LTIP during the summer of 2017.  The awards for the Executive Directors will 
be at 150% of base salary for Wilf Walsh and 125% for Neil Page and will vest three years from the date of grant, based on perf ormance 
over the three financial years beginning 30 April 2017.  Awards will be made subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period and will  
carry a dividend equivalent.  The awards will vest according to performance against the cumulative underlying earnings per shar e,  
as set out below:

on which the Directors are required to report 
each year, which do not appear elsewhere 
in this Directors’ Report.  Certain other 
matters required to be reported on appear 
elsewhere in the Report and Accounts as 
detailed below, and each forms part of this 
Directors’ Report: 
– the Strategic Report, including an 
indication of likely future developments  
in the business, appears from the inside 
front cover to page 29; 
– the Directors’ remuneration report 
appears on pages 39 to 60; 
– the going concern statement appears

– a list of the subsidiary and associated 
undertakings, including branches outside 
the UK, appears on page 86; 
– changes in asset values are set out in the 
consolidated balance sheet on page 67 
and in the notes to the financial 
statements on pages 69 to 101;

Governance Code (‘the Code’) is set  
out on page 32; and 
− in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4, 
details of dividend waivers appear on 
page 62. 
Directors’ interests 
Directors’ share interests are disclosed in 
the Directors’ report on remuneration on 
page 57.  Except as disclosed in this report, 
no Director had a material interest in any 
contract or arrangement with the Company 
during the year, other than through their 
respective service contracts.  Some 
Directors made purchases of the 
Company’s products in the period,  
on normal commercial terms available  
to all employees. 
Directors’ indemnity 
arrangements 
The Company has provided qualifying third-
party indemnities for the benefit of each 
Director who held office during the financial 
year ended 2017.  The Company has also 
purchased and maintained Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance throughout the 
financial year ended 2017. 
Significant agreements – 
change of control 
There are a number of agreements that take 
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover 
bid, such as bank loan agreements and 
employee share plans.  None of these are 
deemed to be significant in terms of their 
potential impact on the business of the 
Group as a whole, except for: 
– a term loan and revolving facilities 
agreement dated 19 March 2008, as 
amended and restated most recently  
on 29 April 2015.  There is a revolving 
credit facility of £45m, which provides 
that on a change of control all lenders’ 
commitments are cancelled and all 
outstanding loans, together with accrued 
interest, will become immediately due 
and payable and an uncommitted 
overdraft of £7.5m.  Details of balances  
at the financial year end can be found  
in note 23 to the consolidated financial 
statements; and 
− under the Company’s all-employee and 
discretionary share schemes, a change of 
control of the Company would normally 
be a vesting event, facilitating the exercise 
or transfer of awards, subject to any 
relevant performance conditions  
being satisfied. 
The Company does not have agreements 
with any Director or officer that would 
provide compensation for loss of office  
or employment resulting from a takeover, 
except that provisions in the Company’s 
share plans may cause options and  
awards granted under such plans to  
vest on a takeover. 
There is no information that the Company 
would be required to disclose about 
persons with whom it has contractual or 
other arrangements which are essential  
to the business of the Company. 
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s issued share 
capital can be found in note 24 to the 
financial statements.  All of the Company’s 
issued ordinary shares are fully paid up  
and rank equally in all respects. 
The rights and obligations attaching to  
the Company’s ordinary shares, in addition 
to those conferred on their holders by law, 
are contained in the Company’s Articles  
of Association, copies of which can be 
obtained from Companies House in the  
UK or by writing to the Company Secretary.  
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled 
to receive the Company’s report and 
accounts, to attend and speak at general 
meetings of the Company, to appoint 
proxies and to exercise voting rights. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares or on the exercise of voting 
rights attached to them, except (i) where the 
Company has exercised its right to suspend 
their voting rights or to prohibit their transfer 
following the omission of their holder or any 
person interested in them to provide the 
Company with information requested  
by it in accordance with Part 22 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or (ii) where their 
holder is precluded from exercising voting

The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
might result in the restriction of transfer or 
voting rights in relation to the shares held by 
such shareholders. 
Shares acquired through Carpetright’s 
employee share schemes rank equally  
with all other ordinary shares in issue and 
have no special rights.  The Trustee of the 
Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) 
has waived its rights to dividends on shares 
held by the EBT and does not exercise its 
right to vote in respect of such shares.  
Shares held in trust on behalf of participants 
in the All Employee Share Ownership Plan 
are voted by the Trustee as directed by  
the participants.  Details of share-based 
payments, including information regarding 
the shares held by the EBT, can be found in 
notes 24 and 25 to the financial statements  
on pages 96 to 98. 
Substantial shareholdings  
As at 26 June 2017, the Company has 
been notified of the following substantial 
shareholdings in accordance with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, other 
than those of the Directors, in the issued 
share capital of the Company: 
 Shares

Franklin Templeton 
Institutional, LLC 
19% 
The Olayan Group 13% 
FIL Limited 9% 
Meditor 6% 
Aberforth 5% 
Wellcome Trust 5% 
Majedie 5% 
Donations 
No political donations were made during the 
year (2016: £nil). 
Shareholders’ views 
There is a formal investor relations 
programme based around the results 
presentations and interim management 
statements.  All of the Non-Executive 
Directors are available to attend meetings 
should shareholders so request.  The 
Chairman and Executive Directors feed 
back any investor comments to the Board.  
All Directors normally attend the Annual 
General Meeting and are available to 
answer any questions that shareholders 
may raise. 
All shareholders will have at least 20 
working days’ notice of the Annual General 
Meeting.  As required by the Code, the 
Board will, at the 2017 Annual General 
Meeting, announce the proxy votes in 
favour of and against each resolution 
following a vote by a show of hands,  
and the votes cast will be posted on  
the corporate website. 
Authority to purchase  
own shares 
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders gave the Company renewed 
authority to purchase a maximum of 
6,792,447 shares of one penny each.   
This resolution remains valid until the date of 
this year’s Annual General Meeting.  As at 
29 April 2017, the Directors had not used 
this authority.  The Company’s present 
intention is to cancel any shares acquired 
under such authority, unless purchased to 
satisfy outstanding awards under employee 
share incentive plans.  A resolution seeking 
renewal of the authority will be proposed at 
this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Directors’ 
remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations. 
UK company law requires the Directors  
to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year.  Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Parent 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  
by the European Union.  The financial 
statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the Company and the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Company and Group  
for that period. 
In preparing those financial statements,  
the Directors are required to: 
– select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
– make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
– state that the financial statements  
comply with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; and 
− prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business, in which case 
there should be supporting assumptions 
or qualifications as necessary. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information on the Company’s 
websites.  Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
  
62 | Annual report and accounts 2017  
 
www.carpetright.plc.ukl | 63 
Each of the Directors whose names and 
details are set out on pages 30 and 31 of 
this report confirms that to the best of 
their knowledge: 
– the financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
− the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of  
the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face. 
Statement of the directors in 
respect of the annual report 
and financial statements 
As required by the Code, the Directors 
confirm that they consider that the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.  When 
arriving at this position the Board was 
assisted by a number of processes, 
including the following: 
– the Annual Report is drafted by 
appropriate senior management  
with overall co-ordination by the Chief 
Financial Officer to ensure consistency 
across sections; 
– an extensive verification exercise is 
undertaken to ensure factual accuracy; 
– comprehensive reviews of drafts  
of the Report are undertaken by the 
Executive Directors and other senior 
management; and 
− a draft is considered by the Audit 
Committee prior to consideration by  
the Board. 
Disclosure of information  
to auditors 
Each of the Directors of the Company has 
confirmed that, as far as they are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information of 
which the auditors are unaware and that 
each Director has taken all steps to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of  
that information. 
Annual General Meeting 
The 2017 Annual General Meeting of the 
Company will be held on 7 September 
2017 at Carpetright plc, Purfleet Bypass, 
Purfleet, Essex RM19 1TT at 12:00 p.m.   
A full description of the business to be 
conducted at the meeting is set out in the 
separate Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
 
The Directors’ Report was approved and 
signed by order of the Board

1.  Principal accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated fina ncial statements are set out below.  The se policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated. 
General information 
Carpetright plc (‘the Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) are retailers of floorcoverings and beds.  The Com pany is  
listed on the London Stock Exchange and inco rporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom.  The address  
of its registered office is Carpetright plc, Purfleet Bypass, Purfleet, Essex, RM19 1TT. 
The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on pages 4 to 5 of the Annual Report. 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the Company are drawn up to within seven days of the accounting record d ate, 
being 30 April of each year.  The financial period for 2017 represents the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2017.  The comparative finan cial period 
for 2016 was 52 weeks ended 30 April 2016. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in acc ordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union, togethe r with 
those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on th e historical cost basis except fo r pension assets and liabilities and  
share based payments which are measured at fair value.   
The Company has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its income statement  
and statement of comprehensive income.  The loss for the Company for the period was £6.3m (2016: profit of £7.2m). 
Going concern 
The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements thro ugh its bank facilities.  The principal banking facility, which includes a 
revolving credit facility for £45 million, is committed to the end of July 2019.  The Directors have considered the future cash requirements 
of the Group and are satisfied that the fac ilities are sufficient to meet its liquidity needs.  The facilities are subject to a number of financial 
covenants, which remain unchanged, being a leverage covenant, a fixed charge cover covenant, a clear down covenant and a capita l 
expenditure covenant.  The fixed charge cove r covenant is the most sensitive to changes in the Group’s profitability.  The Grou p was 
compliant with all covenants as at the year end. 
The Directors have considered the expected performance of the business over at least the next twelve months and modelled this 
performance against the covenants that have been set.  In addition, the Directors have considered the trading performance neces sary  
to result in a breach of the banking covenants as well as mitigating factors that would be available and actionable in the even t that the 
adverse performance became reality. 
The Directors have also considered the net current liability position of the Group and given the supplier payment terms and the expected 
cash generation, the Directors confirm that the Group is foreca st to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due.  
The Directors confirm that, after considerin g the matters set out above, they have a reasonable expectation that the Company an d the 
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a minimum of twelve months following the signing of thes e 
accounts.  For this reason they cont inue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Further information on the Group’s borrowings is given in note 19.

Alternative Performance Measures 
The Company uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM s) in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.  Th e 
Directors believe that these APMs, listed below, are important wh en assessing the underlying financial and operating performanc e of the 
Group and its segments.  The following APMs do not have standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be direct ly 
comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. 
Underlying performance 
Underlying performance, reported separately on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement, is from continuing operations and before 
separately reported items on the face of the income statement. 
Sales 
Sales represents amounts payable by customers for goods and services before deducting VAT and other charges. 
Like-for-like sales (calculated in local currency) 
Calculated as this year’s sales compared to last year’s sales fo r all stores that are at least 12 months old at the beginning o f our financial 
year.  Stores closed during the year are excluded from both year s.  No account is taken of changes to store size or introductio n of third 
party concessions. 
Gross profit ratio  
Calculated as Gross profit as a percentage of revenue.  It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to asse ss the 
underlying performance of the Group’s segments. 
Separately reported items 
Defined below. 
Underlying operating profit 
Underlying operating profit is defined as operating profit before separately reported items.  It is one of the Group’s key perf ormance 
indicators and is used to assess the trading performance of Group businesses.  
Underlying profit before tax 
Underlying profit before tax is calculated as the net total of underlying operating profit less total net finance costs associa ted with underlying 
performance.  It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess the financial performance of the Group as a whole.  
It is also used as one of the targets against which the annual bonuses of certain employees are measured. 
Underlying earnings per share 
Underlying earnings per share is calculated by dividing underlying profit before tax less associ ated income tax costs by the we ighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.  It is one of the Group’s key performance indicators and is used to assess 
the underlying earnings performance of the Group as a whole.  
Net debt 
Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.  Net debt is 
a measure of the Group’s net indebtedness to banks and other external financial institutions. 
Operating cash flow 
This measure is determined by taking underlying operating profit and adding back non-cash item s and any movements in working ca pital.  
Disclosure of ‘separately reported items’ 
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement but state s key lines 
which should be disclosed.  It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of 
the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance.  In accordance with IAS 1, the 
Company has adopted a columnar presentation for its Consolidated income statement, to separately identify underlying performanc e 
results, as the Directors consider that this gives a better view of the underlying results of the ongoing business.  As part of this presentation 
format, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Consolidated income statement, within the column 
entitled ‘Separately reported items’, the effect of any componen ts of financial performance for which the Directors consider separate 
disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the fi nancial performance achieved.  In its adoption of this policy, the Company 
applies an balanced approach to both gains and losses and aims to be both consistent and clear in its accounting and disclosure of 
such items. 
Both size and the nature and function of the components of inco me and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation . 
Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of separately reported items which occur infrequently, such as major r eorganisation 
costs, onerous leases and impairments and the taxation impact of the aforementioned separately reported items.

New and amended accounting standards adopted by the Group 
None of the new standards and amendments to standards that are mandatory for the first time for the financial period commencing 
1 May 2016 had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group in the current period or any prior perio d, and 
are not likely to affect future periods. 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted 
A number of new standards and interpretations and amendments to existing standards were issued but not yet effective nor adopted by 
the EU, and have not been applied in prepar ing these consolidated financial statements: 
− IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and othe r users of financial informati on to understand 
the accounting for financial assets and reduces complexity.  The st andard uses a single approach to determine whether a financi al asset is 
measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the various rules in IAS 39, and also introduces a new expected loss impair ment model.  
This standard is effective for accounting pe riods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. 
− IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is a new standard based on a five-step model framework, which replaces all exis ting 
revenue recognition standards.  The standard requires revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an 
amount that reflects the consideration to wh ich the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Thi s standard 
is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. 
− IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is a new standard which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for 
both parties to a contract.  The standard e liminates the classification of leases as either operatin g leases or finance leases as required by IAS 
17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model.  A lessee will be required to recognise assets and liabilities fo r all leases with a 
term of more than 12 months and depreciate lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement.  This standard 
is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 are not expected to have a material impact, whereas IFRS 16 wi ll 
materially impact on the financial statements of the Group.  Management is currently undertaking an exercise to quantify the im pact. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries).  Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of a su bsidiary  
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.  
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from th e  
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.  Where necessary, adjustments are made t o the  
financial statements of subsidiaries to br ing the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.  All intra-g roup 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
Exchange differences 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation curr ency.  
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the openin g rate for 
the month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonable approximation to the rate at the transaction date.  Mon etary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are transl ated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.  Resulting exchange  
gains or losses are recognised in the inco me statement for the period, except where they are part of a net foreign investment h edge,  
when they are recognised in equity. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date.  Income and expenses of foreign operations are transl ated at the average rate during the period.  Differences on tr anslation  
are recognised as a separate component in other comprehensive income.  On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative excha nge 
differences for that operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation  
and are translated at the rate ruling at the balance shee t date and are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Segment reporting 
Segmental information is presented using a ‘management approach’ on the same basis as that used for internal reporting to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker.  The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors. 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services to cu stomers 
outside the Group, net of returns, sales allowances, charges for the provision of interest free credit and value added and othe r sales  
based taxes.  Revenue from goods and services is recognised at the point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the cu stomer,  
the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.

1.  Principal accounting policies continued  
Share based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees, the terms of these payments do not contain any marke t 
conditions.  The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense.  The value 
of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.  The total amount to be expensed over the v esting period 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any service and performance condit ions that are 
included in the assumptions about the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.  At each balance sheet date, the 
Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.  It recognises the impact of the revision 
of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (T reasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.  No gain or loss is 
recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments.  Any differenc e between  
the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissu ed, is recognised in the share premium reserve. 
Other operating income 
Rental income earned on investment property is recognised in other operating income, in accordance with the substance of the re levant 
rental agreements. 
Tax 
Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substan tively 
enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. 
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and  
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting pu rposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability meth od.  Deferred  
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the e xtent that it  
is probable that taxable profits will be available agains t which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporar y difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than  
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the acc ounting profit.  
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that  
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a le gally enforceable right to offset the current tax assets again st the current  
tax liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis. 
Tax is charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity ; otherwise,  
it is recognised in the income statement. 
Dividends 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in w hich the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable a ssets of the 
acquired entity.  For the purposes of impairment, goodwill is al located to each cash-generating unit (or groups of cash-generat ing units)  
that is expected to benefit from the business combination.  Good will is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or 
when there is an indication of impairment.  Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently 
reversed.  On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or lo ss on disposal. 
Impairment 
Assets that have an indefinite useful lif e, for example goodwill, are no t subject to amortisation an d are tested at least annua lly for impairment 
or when there is an indication of impairment.  Assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for indica tions of 
impairment at each balance sheet date.  If there is an indication of impairment, the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-
generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.  Cash-generating units are used where an individual asset does not generate c ash flows 
which are independent of other assets.  The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less co sts to sell and 
its value in use.  Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-gen erating unit. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit excee ds its 
recoverable amount.  Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impa irment at 
each reporting date.

Other intangible assets 
Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.  Acquired software licences and software development  
costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. 
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight line basis, over its expected useful life.   
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: 
Brands    20 years 
Computer software  5 to 10 years 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and an y provisions for impairment in value. 
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight line basis, to their estimated residual  
values over their estimated useful lives.  Freehold land is not depreciated.  The estimated useful lives and residual values of assets  
are reviewed annually. 
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: 
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years 
Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life 
Fixtures and fittings 3 to 15 years, except for fixed racking which is depreciated over 25 years 
Computers 5 to 7 years 
Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years 
Borrowing costs 
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use .  Unless a specific 
borrowing is taken out to finance the asset, interest is capitalised using the weighted average interest rate of all non-specif ic borrowings.  
Where a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset, inte rest is capitalised at the rate applicable to that borrowing. 
Investment property 
Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is sepa rately disclosed as investment property.  Inves tment property 
is carried at depreciated historical cost.  Depreciation rates and useful lives of investment property are the same as those fo r property, plant 
and equipment. 
Leasing commitments 
Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of owners hip to the 
Group.  All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finan ce leases are capitalised in prop erty, plant and equipment and the 
resulting lease obligations are included in payables.  The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and th e period  
of the lease.  The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease a nd 
represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.  Premiums p ayable, rent 
free periods and contributions receivable on entering an operatin g lease are charged or credited to income on a straight line b asis over the 
lease term. 
Investment in subsidiaries 
The Company’s investment in subsidiary unde rtakings is recognised at cost and is accounted for net of impairment losses.  Incom e from 
investments is recognised in the income statement to the extent that post acquisition profits are received.  Distributions of p re-acquisition 
profits reduce the cost of the investment.

Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.  Net realisable value is based on estima ted selling 
prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.  Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on a ctual 
losses, ageing of inventories and sales trends. 
Rebates receivable from suppliers 
Rebates earned by the Group take the form of volume based rebate s, for attaining specific purchase targets, with individual suppliers.  
These agreements normally cover the financial period.  Agreements that cover more than one financial period are recognised in t he  
period in which the rebate is earned and are credited to the carrying value of inventory to which they relate. 
The Group also receives discounts/rebates from certain suppliers for one off, targeted marketing and promotional events.  These rebates 
are recognised in the period in which the promotional activity is held. 
Trade receivables and payables 
Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair va lue and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or pay able.   
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.  For 
the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts, which are shown within borrow ings  
and overdrafts in current liabilities on the balance sheet. 
Bank loans and overdrafts 
Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequen tly measured 
at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an  
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.  Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis when a ppropriate.  
A provision for vacant properties and onerous leases is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  The provision is measured at the present va lue of the 
lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.  Before a pro vision is 
established, the Group recognises any impairment losses on the assets associated with that contract.  
Retirement benefit obligation 
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in 
respect of its employees in the Netherlands.  The assets and liab ilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.  
The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts f or this 
scheme as a defined contribution scheme. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined using the projected unit credit method, with act uarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  The ne t retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents 
the present value of the defined benefit ob ligation less the fair value of the sc heme assets at the balance sheet date. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in eq uity in the period in which th ey occur and are presented in other 
comprehensive income.  Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit scheme are recognised in the income 
statement.  The pension cost of defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred.

Critical estimates and judgments 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affec t the 
application of policies and reported amounts.  Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical ex perience 
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.  The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to t he carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below: 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have  
been determined based on value in use calculations.  The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expect ed to  
arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculat e the present 
value.  Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates. 
Impairment of assets 
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if even ts or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amoun t may  
not be recoverable.  When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is d etermined 
based on the higher of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assu mptions 
and estimates.  The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing opera tion of the  
cash-generating unit and the choice of a suit able discount rate in order to calculate the present value.  Actual outcomes could vary 
significantly from these estimates. 
Onerous leases 
The Group carries an onerous lease provision which recognises the liabilities associated with lease contracts of closed stores and  
those that are projected to close.  The provision is based on a review of the lease contracts and management’s estimate of the timings  
to exit the lease.  The Group has also reviewed any trading loss-making stores and provided for those leases considered to be o nerous.  
These estimates are based upon available information and knowledge of the property market.  The ultimate costs to be incurred i n this 
regard may vary from the estimates. 
Retirement benefits 
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high quality  
corporate bonds.  The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assu med 
investment returns on scheme assets.  Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on 
current market conditions. 
Income tax 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available a gainst which  
the temporary differences can be utilised.  Th e Group is subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions.  Judgment is req uired in 
determining the provision for income taxes.  The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimat es of whether 
additional taxes will be due.  Where the final tax outcome of th ese matters is different from the amounts that were initially r ecorded, such 
differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

2.  Segmental analysis 
The Group’s operating segments are determined on the basis of information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker – the Board of 
Directors – to review performance and make decisions.  The reporting segments are: 
− UK; and 
− Rest of Europe (comprising Belgium, th e Netherlands and Republic of Ireland). 
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from the retailing of floorcoverings and beds.  Central costs of the 
Group are incurred principally in the UK.  As such, these costs are included within the UK segment.  Sales between segments are  
carried out at arm’s length. 
The segment information provided to the Board of Directors for the reportable segments for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2017 is  
as follows:

5.  Separately reported items 
In order to provide shareholders with additional insight into th e underlying performance of the business, items recognised in r eported profit 
or loss before tax which, by virtue of their size and, or nature, do not reflect the Group’s underlying performance, have been excluded from 
the Group’s underlying results.

* In 2016 the charge reported in the annual report and accounts was £4.5m.  For consistency with the current period presentatio n we have reclassified £1.0m relating to 
share based payments.  This has no impact on the Group’s statutory reported profit before tax and earnings per share.  The recl assified separately reported items for 
2016 is therefore £5.5m. 
A net loss of £1.9m was made on the disposal of 25 (22 trading and three onerous) properties during the year (2016: £3.6m loss) , 
principally a combination of surrender premiums being pa id to exit loss-making stores and asset write-offs. 
A number of investment properties that have previously been impaired are in receipt of rental income from independent third par ty tenants.  
As a result £2.2m of impairment against these locations is no longer required and has been reversed (2016: £0.4m charge). 
Leasehold store impairment testing during the year has identified a number of stores where the anticipated future performance d oes not 
support the carrying value of the assets.  As a result, a charge of £0.4m has been incurred in respect of the impairment of ass ets 
associated with these stores (2016: £0.1m credit). 
At 30 April 2016 there were eleven vacant properties in the UK and two in the Republic of Ireland classed as onerous leases aga inst which 
we carried a provision.  During the year we disposed of three of these locations.  This was offset with three trading stores be ing closed and 
added to this group.  Following a strategic review of the store portfolio in February 2017, we have made a revised assessment o f the 
onerous lease costs for loss-making stores.  The net impact of these judgments is a net charge of £11.0m (2016: £0.6m) – (see n ote 20). 
The value of assets written off incurred during the strategic store refurbishment programme amounts to £1.4m during the year.  In light of 
the quantum, and in keeping with historical treatment, such wr ite-offs have been reported as separately reported items.

5.  Separately reported items continued 
In light of the variable and non-cash nature of employee share based payments, these have been classified as separately reporte d items.  
This also allows for greater visibility of these charges in the accounts.  A charge of £1.0m was incurred during the year (2016 : £1.0m). 
The cash flow impact of separately reported items was £4.0m outflow in the year.  
The tax impact of separately reported items is a credit of £2.5 m.  The Group also recognised a £0.6m tax credit for the fall in the UK main 
rate of tax to 17%, which has also been included in separately reported items.

8.  Dividends 
The Directors decided that no final dividend will be paid (2016: No final dividend paid).  This results in no dividend in the p eriod to  
29 April 2017 (2016: No dividend paid). 
9.  Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average numbe r  
of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by Equity Trust (Jersey) Limited (see note 25) which are tr eated  
as cancelled. 
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume c onversion 
of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.  Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors where the exerci se price is less 
than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period represent potentially dilutive ordinary shares .

Goodwill is not amortised.  Instead it is subject to an impairme nt review at each reporting date or more frequently if there is an indication 
that it may be impaired.  Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the a sset may be 
impaired.  Impairments and amortisation charges are recognised in full in administration expenses in the income statement durin g the 
period in which they are identified. 
Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less  
costs to sell and the value in use.  In the absence of a recent market transaction, the recoverable amount of the goodwill held by  
the Group is determined from value in use calculations.   
Management has identified two cash-generating units (CGUs) supporting goodwill which are the UK and Europe, being the  
Netherlands and Belgium.  The goodwill allocated to each CGU is £29. 8m (2016: £29.8m) to UK and £2 3.8m (2016: £22.1m) to Europe. 
Value in use calculations are based on five year profit projection models and plans approved by the Board, adjusted for non-cas h items  
and capital expenditure. 
The key assumptions used in the cash flow model when assessing the UK and European goodwill balances are: 
− Modest like-for-like sales growth in the UK and Europe, stable gross margin percentage and anticipated cost inflation; 
− the pre-tax discount rate of 7.8% (2016: 7. 8%) as applied to the cash flows is based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted to reflect the risks of the businesses acquired; and 
− the long-term growth rate of 2% is used in the calculation of the perpetuity model wh ich is based on the lo ng-term forecast growth rates 
of the countries within which the Group operates. 
In the UK, the recoverable amount calculated based on value in use exceeded carrying value by £516.8m.   
In Europe, the recoverable amount calculated based on value in use exceeded carrying value by £97.7m.  A fall in long-term grow th rate 
to -26.2% from 2.0% or a rise in the discount rate to 18.6% from 7.8% would remove the remaining headroom.

12.  Investment property 
Investment property is carried at depreciated historical cost and is reviewed for impairment when there is an indication of imp airment.   
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use calculations.  The value in use calc ulations are 
based on five year profit projection models and plans approved by the Board.   
Operating expenses attributable to investment properties are incurred directly by tenants under tenant-repairing leases. 
Properties now sublet have been reclassified as investments.

22.  Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium.  They comprise defined ben efit 
schemes where benefits are based on employees’ length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes whe re  
the employer company pays a set contribution to the scheme.  The UK defined benefit schemes referred to in note 22 (i) (a) and the 
first two defined contribution schemes referred to in note 22 (ii) are accounted for by the Company. 
(i) Defined benefit schemes 
(a) UK defined benefit schemes 
The Company operated a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for its employee s  
and has assumed the liability for the scheme pr eviously operated by Storey Carpets Ltd (Storeys).  The Company scheme was close d  
to defined benefit service accrual on 30 April 2010 and has been closed to new members since 31 March 2006.  The scheme previou sly 
operated by Storeys is also closed to new members and has no act ive members.  The assets of the schemes are held separately fro m  
those of the Company.   
The assets of the Company scheme are inve sted in a Managed Fund operated by a fund management company.  Contributions are 
determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2014 when the 
actuarial value of the assets represented 89% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases i n earnings.   
A deficit reduction plan has been agreed with the Trustees under which £0.6m wa s paid in the period (2016: £0.6m). 
The assets of the Storeys scheme are held in independently managed funds.  The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys sche me  
was at 1 March 2014 when the actuarial value of the assets repr esented 88% of the benefits accrued to members.  A deficit reduc tion  
plan has been agreed with the Trustees under which £0.3m was paid in the period (2016: £0.3m). 
Risks 
The Group schemes are exposed to actuarial risks and investment ri sks.  Some of the risks can be reduced by adjusting the fundi ng 
strategy with the help of the Trustees, for example investment matching risk.  Other risks cannot so easily be removed, for exa mple 
longevity risk.  The Trustees of the plan regularly review such risks and mitigating controls and a risk register is approved a nnually to  
mitigate such risks. 
Employer contributions of £0.9m are expected to be paid in to these pension schemes during the financial period 2018. 
The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 29 April 2017 by a qualified actuary.  The numbers set  
out below are the aggregate of the two schemes.

RPI inflation 3.5 3.1
Discount rate 2.5 3.5
CPI inflation 2.7 2.3
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the 
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.  The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the 
scheme are derived from industry dates and standard tables.  Specifically, the S2NXA and S2 table on a year of birth usage with CMI_2013 
future improvements factors and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% (2016: S2NXA table on a year of birth usage with futur e 
improvements factors and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% pa).  This results in the following life expectancies: 
− male aged 65 now has life expectancy of 23 years 
− female aged 65 now has life expectancy of 25 years 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 20 years and 18 years for the 
Carpetright and Storey’s schemes respectively (2016: 20 years and 18 years respectively). 
The most significant assumptions are the discount rate, retail and consumer price index and mortality rates, of which the most sensitive 
assumption is the life expectancy.  The table below shows the impact on the present value placed on the plan’s liabilities of t he stated 
changes to the actuarial assumptions and has been derived by appl ying sensitivities determined at the most recent actuarial valuation 
to the projected liability value.  The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in one assumption while holding all others con stant.  Therefore 
interdependencies between the assumptions have not been taken into account within the analysis

 (b) Multi-employer scheme 
The Group’s Dutch subsidiary participates in a multi-employer run industry pension scheme which has arrangements similar to tho se  
of a defined benefit scheme.  It is not possible to identify the Group’s share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and 
therefore, in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pens ion 
scheme assets and liabilities.  Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contri bution  
scheme, recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.  Under the terms of the scheme the scheme  
deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.  At the period end, the Group was unable to ob tain  
a valuation of the industry scheme’s full surplus or deficit.  The Group was also unable to obtain details concerning the future funding 
requirements, and its participation level relative to the other participants.  Contributions charged to the income statement am ounted  
to £1.0m (2016: £0.9m) and expected contribution to this scheme for the financial period 2018 is £1.0m. 
(ii) Defined contribution schemes 
The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan in April 2006.  Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company 
to an upper limit.  The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by Royal London.  
Contributions for the period amounted to £1.1m (2016: £1.2m). 
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and the Netherlands.  
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are investe d 
by local insurance companies.  The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of 
£0.1m (2016: £0.1m) and there were no contributions to industry collective schemes (2016: nil).

23.  Financial instruments 
(i) Financial risk management objectives and policies 
Risk management 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise borrowings and overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents.  These financial ins truments 
are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.  Other fi nancial instruments which arise directly from the Group’s opera tions include 
trade receivables and payables. 
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Group’s busi ness operations 
and each of these risks is managed in accor dance with the Group’s treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the 
Financial Review in the section Current liquidity. 
(a) Credit risk 
The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and cus tomers. 
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the ma jority of which 
relates to retail customer products held r eady for collection (see note 15).  Retail customers are required to settle outstandi ng balances in 
cash or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from/delivered by the store. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are reputable banks.  The maximum amount of credit risk i s represented 
by the carrying amounts of financial assets. 
(b) Liquidity risk 
The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profit s and bank borrowings achieved through revolving credit agreements  
and overdraft facilities.  Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasu ry deposit with the Group’s bankers. 
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments,

23.  Financial instruments continued 
The Group has committed facilities to July 2019 comprising a £45.0m revolving credit facility.  The Group also has uncommitted overdraft 
facilities of £7.5m in the UK which are renewable annually in October and €2.4m in the Rest of Europe.  The undrawn amounts on the 
committed facilities were £32.0m (2016: £45.0m).  The undrawn amounts on the uncommitted facilities were £0.4m and €2.4m (2016: 
£0.4m and €2.4m). 
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of leverage and fixed charge cover.  The Gr oup  
has and is expected to remain in compliance with these covenants; further details on th is can be found on pages 23 and 25 of th e  
Strategic Report.   
(c) Foreign exchange risk 
Outside the UK, the Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium an d the Republic of Ireland and had cash balances in Poland.  Revenues 
and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros or Zlotys.  The Group mitigates currency risk in respect of the net i nvestment 
in European operations by designating Euro denominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Euro denominated investments in for eign 
operations. 
If the closing Sterling Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period, the exchange difference reported in the statement o f 
comprehensive income would have been £0.3m lower (2016: £0.3m lo wer).  At 29 April 2017, if Sterling had weakened/strengthened  
by 10% against the Euro, profit after tax for the period would have been £0.3m higher/lower as a result of the translation of t he Euro 
denominated businesses. 
Financial assets and liabilities and fo reign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: 
 
Euro
2017

Average rate 1.20 1.36 5.21 5.77
Closing rate 1.19 1.28 5.01 5.62
(d) Interest rate risk 
The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.   
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity an alysis on its financial instruments which are affected by cha nges  
in interest rates.  This analysis has been prepared on the basi s of a constant amount of net debt and a constant ratio of fixed to floating 
interest rates as at 29 April 2017 and 30 April 2016 respectively.  Consequently, analysis relates to the situation at those da tes and is  
not representative of the periods then ended.   
Based on the Group’s net debt position at the period end, a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Group’s profit before tax  
by approximately £0.1m (2016: £0.1m).

order to continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefi ts for other stakeholders.  The Group considers capital to be equity and net 
debt.  Net debt is disclosed in note 29. 
The Group manages its capital by: continued focus on free cash flow generation; setting the level of capital expenditure and di vidend in  
the context of the current period and forecast free cash flow; and monitoring the level of the Group’s financial and leasehold debt in the 
context of Group performance.

the parent.  During the period, the Trust purchased 156,358 ordina ry shares (2016: 157,450 shares purchased).  At the period en d, the 
Trust held 365,248 (2016: 208,890) ordinary shares of 1p each with a market value of £0.8m (2016: £0.7m).

Report on the financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion: 
− Carpetright plc’s group financial statements and company financial 
statements (the “financial statements ”) give a true and fair view of 
the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 29 April 
2017 and of the group’s profit an d the group’s and the company’s 
cash flows for the 52 week period (the “period”) then ended; 
− the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; 
− the company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adop ted by the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with th e provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
− the financial statements have be en prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Compan ies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and 
Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise: 
− the Group and Company Balance sheets as at 29 April 2017; 
− the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income for the period then ended; 
− the Group and Company Statements of cash flow for the period 
then ended; 
− the Group and Company Statements of changes in equity for the 
period then ended; and 
− the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary 
of significant accounting policies an d other explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report, rather than in the no tes to the financial statements.  
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, and applicable law and, as regards the company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit approach 
Overview 
– Overall Group materiality: £2.3m, which represents 0.5% of Group revenues. 
– We performed a full scope audit of the UK and Republic of Ireland segments which accounted for 
85% of the Group revenues and 57% of the Group’s profit. 
– Valuation of goodwill in Europe (The Netherlands and Belgium). 
– Impairment of freehold and long-leasehold properties (Europe and UK). 
– Impairment of store assets and onerous leases. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.  In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subj ective judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that inv olved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.  As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represe nted a risk of 
material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and eff ort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below.  We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in orde r to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this 
context.  This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Area of focus  How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Valuation of goodwill in Europe (the Netherlands and 
Belgium) 
Refer to Note 1 (Accounting policies and Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments), Note 10 (Intangible assets) and to the 
Audit Committee Report on page 37. 
Goodwill is valued at £53.6m at the period end.  No goodwill 
impairment charge has been recorded against this balance in the 
current period. 
We focused on the risk that the goodwill balance may be overstated 
and that an impairment charge may be required. 
The lowest level at which the directors monitor goodwill is the “UK”, 
defined as the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and “Europe”, defined 
as the Netherlands and Belgium.  Therefore these have been 
identified as the cash-generating units (“CGU’s”).  The Group’s 
goodwill in the UK is £29.8m and in Europe it is £23.8m at the 
period end. 
We focused on valuation of goodwill in Europe in particular because 
of the historical trading performance in this CGU and because of the 
judgment required in the impairment assessment.  
The assumptions made by the directors in the annual impairment 
review included: 
− the growth and operating margin with in the five year plan as applied 
to each CGU; 
− the Group discount rate (pre-tax 7.8%); and 
− the long-term sales and operating profit growth in line with the 
floorings markets in the UK and in Europe. 
 
We tested the value-in-use models, including comparing the 
forecasts used in them to the latest five year plan approved by the 
Board, and testing the underlying calculations.  No material 
exceptions were noted. 
We challenged the directors’ key assumptions, in particular: 
− the sales growth and margin im provement plans by comparing 
these assumptions to recent results for Netherlands and Belgium 
and to third party analysts’ report s, market data, the general state 
of the economy and anticipated growth, to assess their 
reasonableness.  
− the long-term growth rate by co mparing the assumptions to the 
retail sector as a whole and fore casts for the wider economy; and
− the discount rate used by assessing the cost of capital for the 
business.  The discount rate used in the directors’ impairment 
models of 7.8% (pre-tax discount rate) is within the range that we 
independently estimated based on market data and analysis of 
comparable companies.  
We performed sensitivity analyses, for the assumptions specified 
above to identify the extent to which these needed to change to 
result in a material impairment charge. 
Based on our knowledge of the business and of the retail industry 
amongst other factors, we considered the likelihood for changes of 
the required magnitude in the key assumptions to result in a 
material impairment to be relatively low.  We also considered that 
the disclosure made in the financial statements regarding the 
assumptions and the sensitivities drew appropriate attention to the 
more significant areas of judgment. 
 
 
Impairment of freehold and long-leasehold properties 
(Europe and UK) 
Refer to Note 1 (Accounting policies and Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments), Note 11 (Property, plant and equipment) 
and to the Audit Committee Report on page 35. 
The Group owns freehold and long-leasehold stores in the UK and in 
Europe.  We focused on the risk that the carrying value of the 
properties, including the fixed assets attributable to these stores, 
may be overstated and that an impairment charge may be required.
In determining whether impairment triggers existed at the period 
end, the directors treat each store as a separate cash-generating 
unit (“CGU”) and valued it at the higher of the value in use 
calculations or the market value of the properties and their assets. 
The value-in-use calculations are based on a five year perpetuity 
model using the growth assumptions within the five year plan as 
applied to each store, with the re sulting cash flows discounted at 
the Group discount rate (pre-tax 7.8%). 
When properties are subdivided and sublet to third parties, the 
sublet income is taken into account in the model. 
The fair values are taken from third party valuations carried out 
by an independent valuer in November 2014; these valuations 
are based on market value assuming a ten year sale and 
leaseback arrangement. 
 
 
 
We tested the directors’ assessment of impairment triggers 
and were satisfied that it appr opriately took into account both 
internal and external impairment indicators, including the trading 
performance of each cash generating unit (“CGU”) and 
market conditions. 
We assessed the third party valuations based on our 
understanding of the UK and European commercial property 
market and an independent analysis performed by our property 
valuation experts to confirm that the main assumptions used in 
the estimation of the market value were still valid and updated. 
Our analysis found that there had been a slight deterioration in the 
commercial property market from December 2014 to April 2017.  
We sensitised the Impairment model based on this deterioration 
and no material impairments were noted. 
We found the methodology to be appropriate for fair value and 
the valuation to be reasonable at the period end. 
We tested the value-in-use models, including comparing the 
forecasts used in them to the latest five year plan approved by 
the Board, and tested the underlying calculations.  No material 
exceptions were noted.

www.carpetright.plc.uk | 105 
Area of focus  How our audit addressed the area of focus 
This review resulted in an impairment reversal of £2.2m in the 
current period. 
We focused on this area because of the size of the underlying assets 
and because of the significant judgment required in determining the 
value in use of each store, part icularly regarding the sales and 
operating margins growth rates, and discount rates. 
 We challenged the directors’ key assumptions, in particular:
− the sales growth and margin im provement plans by comparing 
these assumptions to recent results for the Group and to third 
party analysts’ reports, market data, the general state of the 
economy and anticipated growth, to assess their reasonableness; 
− the long-term growth rate by co mparing the assumptions to the 
retail sector as a whole and fore casts of the wider economy; and 
− the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Group.  
The discount rate used in the directors’ impairment models of 
7.8% (pre-tax discount rate) is within the range that we 
independently estimated based on market data and analysis 
of comparable companies.  
We performed sensitivity analysis and noted that in order for 
a material impairment charge to arise, the key assumptions 
specified above would need to change significantly.  Based on 
our knowledge of the business and of the retail industry amongst 
other factors, we considered that the likelihood for such changes 
in the key assumptions to be relatively low. 
 
Impairment of store assets and onerous leases 
Refer to Note 1 (Accounting policies and Critical accounting 
estimates and judgments), Note 11 (Property, plant and equipment), 
Note 20 (Provisions for liabilities and charges) and to the Audit 
Committee Report on page 35. 
The Group operates a number of short leasehold stores.  The assets 
relating to these stores mainly comprise leasehold improvements 
and fixtures and fittings.  These are considered for impairment 
annually by reviewing loss making stores.  For all stores where the 
loss in the year exceeded a specified threshold, the store assets 
were fully impaired (£0.4m impairment). 
Furthermore, consideration was given to leases where the stores 
have been closed or are loss-making to the extent that they cannot 
cover their unavoidable property costs and are therefore classified as 
onerous leases. 
An analysis is performed on a store-by-store basis of the excess of 
the Net Present Value (“NPV”) of forecast unavoidable property costs 
(rents, rates and service charges) over the forecast earnings before 
interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation, rents, rates and service 
charges (“EBITDAR”). 
The NPV is calculated using the growth assumptions within the five 
year plan as applied to each store, with the resulting cash flows 
discounted at the risk free rate. 
This analysis is then assessed for other factors such as performance 
improvement plans potential property deals or closure of nearby 
stores which should positively impact the poorer performing store. 
This amount is then extrapolated over an appropriate period which 
ranges from three years to the end of the lease depending on the 
individual circumstances of the store.   
A provision of £17.5m was held at the period end for the 
onerous leases. 
 
We tested the directors’ assessment of impairment triggers for the 
store assets.  We challenged the key assumptions – namely that 
stores making a loss below a certain threshold are excluded from 
the model as directors’ view is that, as an improvement plan is in 
place and given the level of loss at these stores they are not 
permanently impaired. 
The potential impairment if all stores were included is not material 
and, therefore, there is minimal judgment in the impairment 
calculation resulting from this assumption. 
With respect to the provision for onerous leases, we checked 
that stores assessed for onerous leases are those that were 
identified, and whose assets were impaired, following the store 
impairment review. 
We tested the NPV models, including comparing the forecasts 
included to the latest five year plan approved by the Board, 
and testing the underlying calculations.  No material exceptions 
were noted. 
The provision also takes into acco unt management’s best estimate 
as to the timeframe required to exit each loss-making store which 
is clearly judgmental.  The provision takes into account other 
factors, such as potential property transactions.  We assessed 
these judgments, including agreeing to the underlying third party 
draft contracts where appropriate.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial state ments as a 
whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in wh ich the 
Group operates.  
The Group is structured across two segments, being the UK and Rest of Europe, with the majority of trading occurring in the UK segment.  
The Rest of Europe segment comprises three reporting units, being the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we identified that the UK segment and the Republic of Ireland reportin g units 
required an audit of their complete financial information as they form part of Carpetright plc Company.  This was performed by the Group 
audit team.  
The Group team assessed the appropriateness, completeness and accuracy of group journals and other adjustments performed on the 
consolidation and obtained an understanding of internal control environment related to the financial reporting process.  For th e Netherlands 
and Belgium reporting units, which were not individually significant to the Group, the Group audit team have performed audit pr ocedures on 
a number of judgmental areas.  These include testing the onerous lease provision and impairment testing of goodwill, freehold a nd long 
leasehold properties and store assets. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.  We set certain quantitative thresholds for materialit y.  These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of ou r audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually 
and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £2.3m (2016: £2.3m). 
How we determined it 0.5% of Group revenues. 
Rationale for benchmark applied Consistent with the prior period, we have used revenues as a benchmark given the high level of fixed 
costs in the business and because a small fluctuation in revenue can result in a significant fluctuation of 
profit before tax.  Revenue is also the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the Group and reporting to the stakeholders. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1m (2016: £0 .1m) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 25, in relation to going concern.  We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.  
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relat ion to the 
directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriat e to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial s tatements.  
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.  
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have conclude d that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in p reparing the 
financial statements.  The going concern basi s presumes that the Group and company have adequate resources to remain in operati on, 
and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed.  As part of our audit 
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.  However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Other required reporting 
Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements 
Companies Act 2006 opinions 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
− The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the financial statem ents are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
− The Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been pr epared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Re port.  We have 
nothing to report in this respect. 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
– Information in the Annual Report is: 
– materially inconsistent with the informatio n in the audited financial statements; or

company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or 
– otherwise misleading. 
 We have no 
exceptions  
to report. 
– The statement given by the directors on page 32, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess the Group’s and 
company’s position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge of the Group and company acquired in the course of performing our audit 
 We have no 
exceptions  
to report. 
– The section of the Annual Report on page 35 ot 38, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee

exceptions  
to report. 
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency  
or liquidity of the Group 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relat ion to: 
– The directors’ confirmation on pages 24 and 32 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 of 
the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.. 
 We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
– The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated. 
 We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
– The directors’ explanation on page 25 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code,

consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of 
their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or 
assumptions. 
 We have nothing 
material to add or  
to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group.  Our review was subs tantially less in 
scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisio ns of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consi stent with 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit.  We have nothing to report having performed our review.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the financial statements set out on pages 62 to 63, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fai r view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (U K & Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and on ly for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chap ter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibili ty for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is show n or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed b y our 
prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonabl e assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessme nt of:  
− whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently appli ed and 
adequately disclosed;  
− the reasonableness of significant accountin g estimates made by the directors; and 
− the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgments against available evidence, forming our own ju dgments, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions.  We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substanti ve 
procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsiste nt with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.  With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we co nsider 
whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
