IDH 
at a Glance
Integrated Diagnostics Holdings (“IDH,” the “Group,” or 
the “Company”) is a leading consumer healthcare com-
pany with operations in Egypt, Jordan, Sudan and Nigeria.  
A long track record for quality and safety has earned the 
Group a trusted reputation, as well as internationally 
recognised accreditations for its portfolio of over 1,400 
diagnostics tests. From its base of 383 branches as of 31 
December 2017, the Company will continue to add labo-
ratories through a Hub, Spoke and Spike business model 
that provides a scalable platform for efficient expansion. 
Beyond organic growth, IDH’s expansion plans include 
acquisitions in new Middle Eastern and African markets 
where its model is well-suited to capitalise on similar 
healthcare and consumer trends and capture a significant 
share of underpenetrated and highly-fragmented markets. 
Notably in early 2018, the Group expanded its geographic 
footprint with an investment in Nigeria, Africa’s largest and 
most populous country. IDH has been a Jersey-registered 
entity with a Standard Listing on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange since May 2015.

A Note  
from Our Chairman
In 2017, your Company delivered very encouraging op-
erational and financial performance despite the ongo-
ing macroeconomic challenges in our primary market. 
We also expanded our footprint in Africa in early 2018 
with a key strategic investment in Nigeria that will 
broaden our diagnostic services suite beyond pathology 
to include radiology. 
We have seen more sustainable macroeconomic stability 
in Egypt. Whilst inflationary pressures persist, the Gov-
ernment has been implementing a robust programme of 
reforms that has resulted in stronger economic growth 
and led to increased foreign direct investment with the 
improvement in general confidence. The Central Bank of 
Egypt (CBE)’s floatation of the Egyptian pound in Novem-
ber 2016, with the ensuing lifting of capital controls, has 
freed up the foreign exchange market, thus improving the 
ease of doing business in the country.     
Despite the ongoing inflationary headwinds, IDH main-
tained both our profit margins and market share. The 
well-entrenched strength of our brands and supplier 
relationships enabled our management to successfully 
execute our business model. We are naturally delighted 
by the recovery in our stock price. Your management are 
constantly seeking to consolidate and maintain the prof-
itability of the business with the provision of additional 
value-added services. With our long-established presence 
in Egypt, together with our loyal patient base, we have 
built a considerable base of patient data whilst at all times 
maintaining strict confidentiality and privacy.
We remain committed to fulfilling our business strategy 
through expanding our geographical footprint in other 
countries, both in Africa and in the Middle East. We are 
delighted by the growth and strength of our subsidiaries in 
Jordan and Sudan, which have successfully implemented 
our business model. With the lifting of longstanding US 
sanctions on Sudan, the outlook for that country has im-
proved markedly.  
We remain committed to 
fulfilling our business strategy 
through expanding our 
geographical footprint — both 
in Africa and in the Middle East
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 10 With Nigeria having by far the largest population in Africa, 
we are keen to expand our presence in that country. We 
shall be building on our recent investment in Echo-Scan, 
a network of radiology and diagnostic laboratories that 
has provided us with an attractive entry point into the 
country. With its fragmented and largely unestablished 
healthcare services market, we see huge potential for fu-
ture growth to match our successful track record in Egypt. 
We are proud to be investing in Nigeria alongside Man 
Capital LLC and the IFC.
We are very cognisant that as we expand the geographical 
reach of our emerging market platform, we must maintain 
our high standards of operational excellence and ensure 
that our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. In 
2017, we also focused on strengthening our senior finan-
cial management team, and this year we will undertake 
a comprehensive review of all aspects of our human 
resources management so as to entrench and ensure 
sustainable performance at all levels of the organisation.
We are at an advanced stage in building and completing 
our new corporate headquarters in Cairo, where consoli-
dating our offices will greatly facility the daily interaction 
of our staff.  
In conclusion, your Board and management are com-
mitted to maintaining strong corporate governance and 
promoting corporate social responsibility whilst under-
pinning our business model with the highest standards 
of accountability and transparency, thus fulfilling the 
expectations of our shareholders.

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  11 Strategic Report
A Note  
from Our CEO
Fellow shareholders,
In 2017, IDH again delivered superior operational and 
financial performance despite ongoing macroeconomic 
challenges in Egypt, our largest market. We have also ex-
panded our geographic reach with an investment in Nigeria 
in early 2018, adding a fourth country to our platform.
We close the year as a leading consumer healthcare com-
pany in the Middle East and Africa. Our proven business 
model allowed us to deliver revenue growth of 29% in 
2017, reflecting our ability to deliver high-quality medical 
diagnostic services to more than six million patients as 
measured by 26 million tests. We now look to sustain that 
performance thanks to our presence in Egypt and Nigeria 
— two of Africa’s largest and most populous countries — 
as well as our operations in Jordan and Sudan.
Strong operational and Financial performance
Our revenues were very strong throughout the 2017 year, 
increasing 29% year-on-year to EGP 1,514 million. Whilst 
patient and test volumes gained 9% and 7%, respectively, 
the power of the Group’s brands and the favourable impact 
of our tactical marketing campaigns can be seen most 
clearly in the recovery in volumes that is under way in our 
higher-margin walk-in patient category. Walk-in patient 
revenues grew 29% period-on-period as patient volumes 
rose 2% compared with a year-earlier decrease of 4%;  and 
test volumes rose 7% versus a 2% year-ago decline. 
Understanding that protracted high inflation in Egypt has 
had the most significant impact on our patients who pay 
for their own healthcare, we have developed our market-
ing programs to target them with a strong health aware-
ness message in combination with a compelling value 
component. This includes offering bundled diagnostic test 
packages for lifestyle-related diseases and chronic health 
conditions; an in-house point redemption system; and bank 
partnerships for more affordable payment plans. Moreover, 
in recognition of the pressures being felt by all our patients, 
We enter 2018 in a strong financial 
position with an under-leveraged 
and highly cash-generative balance 
sheet that provides us with 
strategic flexibility
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 12 our price increases have been significantly below the high 
rates of inflation caused by the November 2016 devaluation 
of the Egyptian pound. The brand equity we have built over 
many years has translated into strong loyalty among the 
millions of patients who came to know and trust us long 
before facing the current inflationary pressures.
We continued to expand our geographic footprint in 2017, 
bringing our total network of laboratories to 383 with 
8% annual unit growth. We opened 23 new branches in 
Egypt, four in Jordan and two in Sudan. It is noteworthy 
that our subsidiaries in both Jordan and Sudan continued 
their steady growth last year, together contributing 17% 
of consolidated sales and 9% of consolidated EBITDA last 
year. In Sudan, the recent lifting of longstanding US sanc-
tions marked an important milestone, signalling an end to 
the country’s economic isolation and paving the way for a 
brighter economic future.    
IDH delivered EBITDA growth of 18% year-on-year to EGP 
602 million — despite shouldering additional corporate 
expense burdens that accompanied the implementation 
of Egypt’s much-needed macroeconomic reforms. Beyond 
the lingering inflationary impact of the devaluation of the 
Egyptian pound, the higher costs of rent, transportation 
and utilities were all pressure points, as was the value-
added tax imposed in July 2016 and increased to 14% from 
13% in July 2017. The effect of higher interest rates has 
been double-edged, as higher interest income on the large 
cash balances we carry on our balance sheet was partially 
offset by rising interest expenses on our medium-term 
debt. Our bottom line did benefit from a substantially 
lower foreign exchange loss this year than last, helping net 
profit to rise 44% period-on-period to EGP 384 million.
As IDH maintains international-quality accreditations 
to ensure best-in-class service, we are honoured to have 
been awarded the certification for our Cairo Mega Lab 
from the College of American Pathologists (CAP), widely 
considered the leader in laboratory quality assurance 
globally. The international accreditation of our Mega 
Lab constructs a competitive barrier to entry to our 
markets and, as importantly, imparts an assurance of 
quality and safety that engenders strong loyalty among 
our valued corporate as well as individual customers. 
IDH operates the only laboratory in Egypt with the dis-
tinguished CAP accreditation. 
In sum, our Company stayed the course last year, relying 
on the fundamental strength of our brands and sharply 
focused on deploying our asset-light model. We have suc-
cessfully managed to contain our costs whilst at the same 
time upholding our high-quality standards Company-wide 
and maintaining our high patient and physician satisfac-
tion levels. By doing so, we were able to both protect our 
margins and increase our market share in 2017. 
In marked contrast to many consumer names in Egypt, 
IDH has been able to successfully drive volumes and pass 
on selected price increases post-devaluation. Beyond the 
insulation provided by the inherently defensive nature 
of the healthcare industry, I believe it is also very much 
a testament of our trusted brands. We enter 2018 in a 
strong financial position with an under-leveraged and 
highly cash-generative balance sheet that provides us 
with strategic flexibility. 
Macroeconomic progress in our Largest Market
There is welcome evidence that Egypt, representing 83% 
of our 2017 revenues, is turning the economic corner. Last 
year, demonstrable progress was seen regarding the imple-
mentation of reforms to stabilise the country’s finances as 
well as promote growth and employment. 
With the floatation of the Egyptian pound in November 
2016, the foreign exchange market has normalised and 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  13 Strategic Report 
the parallel market has been eliminated. After losing more 
than 50% of its value in 2016, the Egyptian pound closed 
the 2017 year at 17.67 per US$ 1.00, down only slightly from 
18.00 at 2016 year end. Among other reforms, the govern-
ment also began a gradual reduction of energy subsidies 
with some of the resources reallocated to strengthening 
the social safety net. 
As a consequence of the sharp devaluation of the cur-
rency as well as the new energy policy, however, inflation 
has remained high. In December 2017, headline inflation 
stood at 21.9% after peaking at 33% in July. To address this 
extreme inflationary pressure, the Central Bank of Egypt 
(CBE) has adopted tight monetary policy, with aggressive 
interest rate hikes in May and July of 2017. The Govern-
ment of Egypt expects headline inflation to fall to 10-13% 
by the end of 2018, whilst the consensus forecast among 
analysts appears to be 13-14% at mid-year.  
Expanding 0ur Geographic Footprint in Africa 
I am also pleased to report that in early 2018 we added 
Nigeria to our geographic footprint as a “one-stop shop” 
diagnostics services provider. We have accomplished 
this by forming a joint venture with Man Capital LLC, the 
London-based investment arm of the Mansour Group, 
called Dynasty Holding Group. Dynasty is 51% owned 
and controlled by IDH, and together with Man Capital we 
are very pleased to have partnered with the International 
Finance Corporation to invest in Eagle Eye Echo-Scan 
Limited. Echo-Scan is a leading medical diagnostics 
business in Nigeria with all of the licenses it requires to 
operate and expand on a national scale in Africa’s most 
populous country. 
The strategic rationale for making Nigeria the fourth 
country on our regional platform is compelling. Nigeria’s 
diagnostic services market is very large, highly fragmented 
and underpenetrated, offering significant opportunities 
for growth and economies of scale. As importantly, it 
shares many similarities with Egypt’s market in the 1980s 
and 1990s in terms of structure, pace of development, and 
the emerging disease profile of patients. 
Dynasty and the IFC have committed to invest significant 
capital in Echo-Scan over the next four years. Dynasty 
has acquired a majority stake in Echo-Scan and assumed 
management control of the company, whilst both Dynasty 
and the IFC will invest US$ 25 million to expand Echo-
Scan’s diagnostics network, service offerings, and quality 
standards. I am especially pleased that we will be joining 
forces with Man Capital, an organisation that matches 
our more than four decades of operating experience in the 
industry with similarly long experience working on the 
ground in West Africa.
We will continue to look beyond Egypt to accelerate our 
long-term growth through strategic acquisitions. Consist-
ent with our aim to make modern medical diagnostics 
more accessible to the most resource-poor populations, 
we are eager to begin our work in Nigeria. Diagnostic test-
ing is becoming even more essential to quality healthcare, 
and we want to play a central role in improving health 
outcomes in all of our emerging markets. In particular, 
I believe we have a unique long-term opportunity to 
replicate our historical growth in Egypt by applying our 
extensive knowledge and experience to unlock the same 
potential in Nigeria. 
proposed Dividend and Dividend policy
IDH is pleased to propose paying a final dividend of US$ 
0.16 (sixteen US$ cents) per share, or US$ 24 million in 
aggregate, to shareholders in respect of the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. This represents an increase of 
14% compared to a final dividend of US$ 0.14 (fourteen 
US$ cents), or US$ 21 million in aggregate the previous 
financial year. 
In view of the strong cash-generative nature of our busi-
ness and its asset-light strategy, our dividend policy is to 
return to shareholders the maximum amount of excess 
cash after taking careful account of the cash needed to 
support operations, capital expenditure plans, organic 
expansion opportunities, and potential acquisitions. 
2018 outlook
The fundamentals of our inherently counter-cyclical 
healthcare industry remain sound. We are well posi-
tioned with our strong brands and geographic position-
ing to capitalise on the structural drivers that support 
future growth in medical diagnostic services including 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 14 large, rapidly-growing populations; a high prevalence 
of lifestyle-related medical conditions; and a growing 
health consciousness in our emerging markets.  
We are looking forward to moving to our new corporate 
headquarters in 2018, which is located in Smart Village, a 
corporate office park in the city of Sixth of October, slightly 
west of Cairo. Our new headquarters will consolidate all of 
the offices we have been occupying in the city core into 
one building with sufficient space for the entire organisa-
tion, making day-to-day interaction much more efficient.    
We are keen to begin the process of integrating our new 
Nigerian operations, having determined our first priori-
ties. We will implement the policies and procedures that 
underpin the strong IDH corporate organisation starting 
with the establishment of an IT infrastructure that fully 
connects and controls all Echo-Scan branches, as well as 
a Human Resource structure that taps into the Group’s 
highly-qualified and experienced staff to apply the Group’s 
standards of efficiency to the Nigerian operations.  
We look to the coming year with optimism that in our 
largest market of Egypt, the economy will continue to 
gather strength characterised by an easing in inflation 
and some appreciation in the currency. The fundamental 
strength of our brands and our solid relationships with 
our suppliers make it possible for us to successfully 
execute our scalable asset-light business model — even 
under difficult operating conditions such as those we 
faced in 2016 and 2017. Accordingly, we guide our val-
ued shareholders to once again expect annual revenue 
growth of 20% and an EBITDA margin of c. 40%. 
I would like to thank our Board, management team and 
employees for their dedication and commitment, and our 
shareholders for their continued support. I am honoured 
to have you with us on this journey as a rapidly-growing 
consumer healthcare company across the Middle East 
and Africa.

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  15 Strategic Report
Our   
Markets
Egypt – our Largest Market
The Egyptian diagnostics industry can be broadly divided 
into public and private sector infrastructure, with the latter 
including both labs attached to private hospitals and inde-
pendent standalone labs (chains and single labs). According 
to the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), IDH is the largest 
fully-integrated private sector diagnostics service provider, 
with more than 50% share by revenue of the private chain 
market in Egypt.
Whilst the counter-cyclical nature of the healthcare system 
in Egypt has been challenged by ongoing difficult macro-
economic conditions, powerful structural growth drivers 
continue to support future growth in diagnostic services:   
•	 With the country’s population crossing the 100 mil-
lion mark in 2017, Egypt is the most populous country 
in the Middle East North Africa (“MENA”) region; in 
terms of demographics, it hosts a significant propor-
tion of elderly people. 
•	 The population is marked by a high disease burden, 
with high prevalence of both communicable and 
non-communicable diseases, tropical diseases, and 
lifestyle diseases such as diabetes.
•	 There is a rising prevalence of diseases commanding 
high test volumes, indicating an expanding need gap 
compared with more developed markets.
•	 There is ample opportunity to increase the usage of 
laboratory diagnostics as a tool in clinical practice, 
the awareness of which will be raised with higher 
penetration of health insurance and improved cogni-
sance of preventive healthcare.
•	 Most labs in Egypt are concentrated in big cities; there 
is still substantial room to increase accessibility to lab 
services by adding branches in all of the country’s 29 
governorates for greater coverage of the population.
•	 The corporate market is emerging as a driver for di-
agnostic services, as more companies offer healthcare 
coverage to their employees.
IDH is in a strong competitive position in the Egyptian 
diagnostic industry, having created formidable barriers to 
entry with its 39-year track record, trusted brands, scalable 
business model and network of 340 branch labs at 2017 year 
end. This has been achieved by:
•	 IDH’s accreditations, which underscore the high-
quality and safety of its testing capabilities, are key 
to attracting patients. In February 2018, the Group’s 
central Mega Lab in Cairo earned the distinguished 
certification of The College of American Pathologists 
(CAP). The Mega Lab, inaugurated in 2015, replaced 
two smaller, independent “ A labs” that were also CAP 
certified. 
•	 IDH’s long-established brands have trusted reputa-
tions that have engendered strong patient loyalty. 
•	 With a wide geographic presence, IDH is well po-
sitioned to cater to the fragmented nature of the 
regional market. 
•	 IDH has a strong relationship with key stakeholders 
such as physicians, patients and hospitals.
In 2017, revenues in Egypt increased 22% year-on-year 
to EGP 1,251 million, driven by higher volumes as well as 
selected price increases. Contract revenues gained 24%, 
whilst revenues in the walk-in category rose 19%. EBITDA 
grew 14% year-on-year to EGP 547 million, with an associ-
ated EBITDA margin of 44% versus 47%. Egypt is the Com-
pany’s largest market, contributing 83% of total revenues 
and 91% of total EBITDA in 2017. Last year, IDH treated 
9% more patients and performed 5% more tests in Egypt. 
At 2017 year end, there were 340 branch labs in Egypt, 7% 
more than a year earlier.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 16 On our way to realising our full po-
tential as a leading consumer health-
care company in the Middle East and 
Africa, we are pleased to have added 
Nigeria, Africa’s largest and most 
populous country, to our geographic 
footprint in early 2018 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  17 Jordan   
Strategic Report 
Jordan has one of the most modern 
health care infrastructures in the Mid-
dle East. Whilst medical services re-
main highly concentrated in Amman, 
c. 70% of Jordanians have medical 
insurance. Notably, medical laborato-
ries must abide by the price list that 
was issued by the Jordanian Ministry 
of Health in 2008, which has not since 
changed. Consequently, Biolab’s strat-
egy is to expand its range of check-up 
packages offered, thereby increasing 
the number of tests per patient. In 
2017, Biolab performed c. 1.5 million 
tests for c. 242,000 patients, generat-
ing 6.2 average tests-per-patient com-
pared with 6.1 in 2016.
Unlike Al Borg and Al Mokhtabar in 
Egypt, Biolab does not operate a Hub, 
Spoke and Spike business model. 
Whilst Biolab’s 18 central labs perform 
many of the +1,000 pathology tests 
offered, four that are considered spe-
cialty labs perform particular types 
of tests including, but not limited to, 
haematology, endocrinology, immu-
nochemistry, parasitology, oncology, 
transfusion medicine, molecular genet-
ics and antenatal diagnostics and gene 
sequencing. Furthermore, Biolab does 
not share purchasing, supply and lo-
gistics, IT, marketing or sales functions 
with its Egyptian parent company. 
In 2017, Biolab signed a joint venture 
agreement with Georgia-based EVEX 
Medical Corporation to establish the 
largest medical laboratory among 
West Asian countries, which will be 
located in Tbilsi. This 4,000-square-
metre facility will connect more than 
40 hospitals and diagnostic centres 
that are part of the EVEX network. 
EVEX Medical Corporation is the 
largest chain of hospitals in Georgia, 
currently operating 78 clinics in six 
regions of the country. The agreement 
between Biolab and EVEX has two 
components: i) the implementation 
of Biolab’s technological platforms 
and laboratory information manage-
ment systems (LIMS) at EVEX; and 
ii) taking the Mega Lab through the 
Joint Commission International (JCI) 
accreditation within two years of the 
laboratory’s expected launch date. 
The new laboratory is expected to 
open in the second half of 2018, with 
initial installations and connectiv-
ity, as well as the training of quality 
control officers in both Jordan and 
Georgia, completed.  All tests that 
are not performed in Georgia will be 
referred to Biolab in Jordan.     
In 2017, revenues from operations in 
Jordan increased 94% to EGP 218 mil-
lion, in large part due to the favorable 
impact of translating Jordanian di-
nars ( JOD) into Egyptian pounds. The 
subsidiary did perform well, however, 
notably achieving a 14% revenue gain 
in local currency. Patient and test 
volumes were both strong, rising 12% 
and 13%, respectively. Whilst EBITDA 
grew 71% year-on-year to EGP 41 mil-
lion, higher salary and rental costs 
associated with the opening of four 
new branches in 2017 pressured the 
EBITDA margin by c. 200 basis points 
to 19%. Jordan contributed 14% of 
2017 revenues (2016: 10%) and 7% of 
EBITDA (2016: 5%). At 2017 year end, 
there were 18 branch labs in Jordan, 
4% more than a year earlier.

Sudan
IDH operates under two brand names 
in Sudan, Ultralab and Al Mokhtabar 
Sudan. Al Borg acquired a majority 
interest in Ultralabs in 2011, whilst 
Al Mokhtabar Sudan had been es-
tablished in 2010 prior to the Group’s 
acquisition of Al Mokhtabar in Egypt. 
While Al Mokhtabar Sudan operates 
independently, Ultralab shares pur-
chasing, supply and logistics, and IT 
functions with the Company’s Egyp-
tian operations. 
Sudan has endured social conflict, 
civil war, and with the 2011 seces-
sion of South Sudan, the loss of c. 
75% of the oil production that had 
underpinned the country’s economic 
growth since 1999 and had been its 
main source of foreign currency. The 
government had been struggling to 
re-stabilise the economy, pressured 
further by international sanctions 
imposed by the US and others.
In October 2017, the US decided to lift 
a host of sanctions imposed 20 years 
ago that included a comprehensive 
trade embargo, a freeze on govern-
ment assets and tight restrictions on 
financial institutions dealing with 
the country. The subsequent weak-
ening of the Sudanese pound (SDG) 
resulted in the government’s January 
2018 devaluation of the currency, a 
necessary step toward growth and 
investment. Meanwhile, the lifting 
of longstanding sanctions is an 
important milestone for the people 
and businesses of Sudan, signaling 
an end to the country’s economic 
isolation and a renewal of interest 
among Western investors eager to 
enter the region. 
In 2017, revenues from operations in 
Sudan increased 34% year-on-year to 
EGP 46 million on a reported basis. 
The impact of translating Sudanese 
dollars (SDG) into Egyptian pounds 
was negative, however, as revenues de-
nominated in the local currency gained 
55%. Importantly, the top line was 
driven by the signing of a new and very 
substantial contract with the Sudanese 
government that contributed to 43% 
more patients and 84% more tests last 
year. Whilst reported EBITDA declined 
13% year-on-year to EGP 14 million, in 
Sudanese dollars EBITDA would have 
gained 75%. The associated EBITDA 
margin was 31% compared with 22% 
in 2016. Sudan contributed 3% of total 
revenues (2016: 3%) and 2% of total 
EBITDA (2016: 1%). At 2017 year end, 
there were 25 branch labs in Sudan, 2% 
more than a year earlier.

Nigeria
t he opportunity
In Nigeria, the medical diagnostics industry is large, val-
ued at c. US$ 140 million in 2017 and projected to reach 
US$ 1 billion by 2025
1
, driven primarily by increased access 
to and spending on healthcare overall. This forecast could 
prove conservative should the government spend more 
than currently planned under difficult macroeconomic 
conditions; and should health insurance be mandated for 
all companies sooner than expected. 
Whilst also highly fragmented, the industry can be broadly 
divided into three groups. The largest is independent stan-
dalone labs (chains and single labs), representing c. 45% 
of the market. This should be considered in the context of 
the fact that there are only five key multi-unit players with 
different brand positioning and varied service offerings 
that on a combined basis account for just c. 7% of total 
test volumes and c. 20% of the diagnostic market’s value 
due to their ability to perform advanced tests.  The other 
two groups include public hospitals with 35% of the mar-
ket and private hospitals that make up the remaining 20%. 
t he Investment
IDH has expanded its geographic platform to four coun-
tries with an investment in Nigeria’s promising healthcare 
industry. The Group closed on a transaction in February 
2018 in which it formed a joint venture with Man Capital 
LLC (“Man Capital”), the London-based investment arm 
of the Mansour Group, called Dynasty Holding Group 
(“Dynasty”), which is 51% owned and controlled by IDH. 
In turn, Dynasty partnered with the International Finance 
Corporation (“IFC”) to invest in Eagle Eye Echo-Scan Lim-
ited (“Echo-Scan”), a leading medical diagnostics business 
based in Nigeria. 
Dynasty and the IFC have committed to invest significant 
capital in Echo-Scan over the next four years.  Dynasty 
has acquired a majority stake in Echo-Scan and assumed 
management control of the company, whilst both Dy-
nasty and the IFC will invest US$ 25 million to expand 
Echo-Scan’s laboratory network, service offerings, and 
quality standards. 
Dynasty combines IDH’s c. four decades of experience in 
Africa’s medical diagnostics industry with Man Capital’s 
similarly long experience on the ground in West Africa to 
drive Echo-Scan’s expansion and the institutionalization of 
all aspects of its operations. Echo-Scan enjoys a strong repu-
tation among physicians and patients alike and will greatly 
benefit from Dynasty’s extensive expertise.
The process of integrating Echo-Scan will begin with the 
realignment of its existing labs into IDH’s “Hub, Spoke and 
Spike” business model to form three B-labs (“Spokes” capable 
of processing routine tests) in Nigeria’s three major cities of 
Abuja, Lagos and Benin; and 12 C-labs (“Spikes” functioning 
as collection and basic test centres) in less populated areas. 
Dynasty’s four-year plan calls for an Echo-Scan network of 
50-plus branches including conventional B-labs, enhanced 
B-labs (offering the most sophisticated radiology tests), and 
C-labs that will reach patients nationwide.   
In building the Echo-Scan brand, Dynasty aims to equate 
the name with quality and safety, embodying the same 
core values that have earned the Al Borg and Al Mokhtabar 
brands strong loyalty in Egypt over the years. The Group 
will also reach out as it does in Egypt to physicians with 
joint programs and medical conferences and newsletters; 
and to patients through public relations campaigns and 
digital media customer relationship management (CRM) 
programs, among others.

IDH’s Competitive Strengths    
& Business Model
IDH’s markets are characterised as 
having strong structural growth driv-
ers and an underserved diagnostic 
services demand. The Group has been 
able to demonstrate growth based on 
strong underlying industry fundamen-
tals despite political and economic 
turmoil in recent years in the regions 
in which it operates. Barriers to entry 
are high, which the Company has been 
able to surmount with established 
strong brands, internationally accred-
ited laboratories, a scalable business 
model and a wide geographic reach. 
Notably, consensus expectations are 
for further economic improvement in 
Egypt, IDH’s largest market, in 2018.  
IDH’s Hub, Spoke and Spike business 
model provides the Group with an ef-
ficient low-capital intensive platform 
for organic expansion over a wide geo-
graphic area. It enhances the consist-
ency of safety and testing procedures 
as more tests are conducted through 
its centralised Mega Lab with modern, 
high-capacity equipment and signifi-
cant throughput.
The Group has a highly experienced 
management team with decades of 
experience in the healthcare sector. 
Furthermore, IDH’s world-class Board 
of Directors brings years of healthcare, 
MENA region and investment experi-
ence to the table.

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 24 Barriers to Entry
Accreditation of Facilities
Attracting contract clients 
requires accredited, high-quality 
testing capabilities. 
Brand Equity and Reputation
Patients are loyal to leading 
brands with a strong track record.
Market Reach
Fragmented market necessitates a 
wide geographic presence to allow 
for broad customer reach. 
Relationship with Key 
Stakeholders
Building a scalable platform 
requires strong relationship with 
stakeholders such as physicians, 
patients and hospitals.
IDH has enjoyed a strong track record 
of profitable growth, even under 
adverse macro-economic conditions. 
This was demonstrated again in 2017, 
when against the backdrop of persis-
tent inflationary pressures associated 
with 2016’s currency devaluation, the 
Group delivered an EBITDA margin of 
40% versus 44% a year earlier. In paral-
lel, the Company’s asset-light business 
model notably translates into minimal 
borrowings while allowing for signifi-
cant strategic flexibility.
The Group continues to explore op-
portunities to expand into new high-
growth markets in the Middle East 
and Africa as well as adjacent verti-
cals, where complementary diagnos-
tic services would help to raise IDH’s 
profile to that of a “one-stop shop” 
diagnostics provider. The Company 
executed on this strategy in January 
2018, expanding into Nigeria with an 
investment in a chain of diagnostic 
laboratories offering both pathology 
and radiology services.

Our Healthcare     
Systems 
The mechanics of the healthcare markets in which IDH 
operates are markedly different from those in many Western 
healthcare sectors. Publicly funded and private healthcare 
systems exist in parallel, and in the private market served 
by the Group, patients have substantially more freedom to 
make healthcare decisions than their counterparts do in 
more institutionalised markets.
General practitioners (also referred to as family medicine prac-
titioners or primary care specialists) are rare in these emerging 
markets and are, accordingly, not the gatekeepers through 
which patients access primary or specialist care. Patients 
seeking treatment may elect to obtain initial care by attending 
a hospital outpatient clinic or emergency room; attending a 
polyclinic or directly seeking the services of a specialist physi-
cian. The patient’s choice may be influenced by whether or 
not the patient has employer-provided health insurance or a 
corporate arrangement with a specific provider.
Physicians ordering diagnostic procedures to be completed 
outside a hospital setting may recommend that the patient 
complete these tests at a specific service provider, but pa-
tients enjoy a high degree of freedom in choosing the service 
provider they attend based on perceived quality and pricing 
or on insurance or corporate arrangements. Walk-in patients 
(also referred to as “self-payers”) pay out of pocket in advance 
of the tests being completed.
Patients then typically obtain test results in person (often 
with an accompanying report from a pathologist, ge-
neticist, radiologist or other specialist) and return with the 
results to the physician who requested the tests in the first 
instance. It is noteworthy that IDH has the ability to deliver 
test results to patients on the same day electronically as 
well as via a mobile app.
IDH accordingly engages in sales and marketing activities that separately target:
Physicians, through direct sales 
visits to individual practitioners, 
periodic gatherings for physi-
cians within a speciality, promo-
tional giveaways as well as dis-
count cards for physicians and 
their families, incentive-based 
physician loyalty programs and 
the organisation or sponsorship 
of conferences;
Walk-in patients, through 
social media channels, mass-
market and targeted health 
awareness campaigns, outdoor 
advertising, television, radio 
and online advertising; and
Corporate patients, through 
direct outreach to insurers and 
employers. 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 26 our Suppliers
IDH has an asset-light business model that is also illustrated 
by its supplier relationships. The Group’s contracts with its 
key suppliers of medical testing kits include the provision of 
the equipment to analyse the laboratory test results. These 
agreements have minimum annual commitment payments 
to cover the supply of the medical diagnostic equipment, 
kits and chemicals to be used for testing and ongoing main-
tenance and support services. The agreement periods are 
typically for five to eight years. The supply of the medical 
diagnostics equipment through these arrangements has 
been judged to be finance lease in nature. 
The Company’s main suppliers of kits are Roche, Siemens 
and BM (Sysmex), who collectively represent 47% of total 
raw materials in 2017 compared with 49% in 2016, exclud-
ing the cost of tests conducted abroad. On the whole, raw 
materials as a percentage of sales increased to 20% in 2017 
from 16% in 2016. IDH does not rely on any single supplier 
of test kits or any other medical supply purchases in the 
Mega Lab so as to avoid backorders and any ensuing inter-
ruptions to operations. 
The number of kits purchased is determined by a combina-
tion of historical consumption patterns and future growth 
plans, with our high volume of kit consumption supporting 
our pricing power with suppliers going forward. Increasing 
test volumes puts IDH in a stronger position to negotiate 
favourable kit prices, thereby reducing the cost per test 
while at the same time incurring no initial capital outlay for 
the purchase of medical diagnostic equipment.
IDH is exposed to foreign exchange risk in purchasing 
supplies, as a significant portion of its purchases are 
either payable or effectively priced in foreign currency 
(see “Specific Risk/Mitigation” table on page 36). Siemens 
accounted for 15% of total raw materials and is the main 
supplier that the Group pays in US dollars. While other 
suppliers provide the Company with imported products, 
they are paid in Egyptian pounds. 
IDH is one of the largest providers of diagnostic services 
in the MENA region, and as such, one of the largest volume 
purchasers of test kits. Over the years, IDH has developed 
strong and long-standing relationships with its supplier 
base. Accordingly, the Group has been able to successfully 
negotiate favourable contract terms against the backdrop 
of the currency devaluation, so that the prices of its kits 
have been increasing at a slower rate than that at which 
the Egyptian pound has lost value against the US dollar. It 
is noteworthy that management has been able to negoti-
ate an agreement with its main suppliers not to increase 
prices during 2018.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  27 Strategic Report
Our Business      
Model 
IDH operates an easily scalable busi-
ness model, allowing for expansion 
in a capital-efficient manner and 
geared toward operational efficiency. 
The Group deploys a Hub, Spoke and 
Spike model in which the Mega Lab 
functions as the Hub that is equipped 
for all tests and services, notably with 
advanced diagnostic tools, for sam-
ples collected by the B- and C-labs. The 
•	 The Mega Lab, the largest automated lab in Egypt, serves as IDH’s diagnos-
tic hub, equipped with the latest technology and providing a full suite of 
diagnostic tests.
•	 A majority of equipment is provided at no upfront cash cost in return for IDH 
agreeing to purchase minimum volumes of kits from equipment suppliers.
•	 Specialty tests from IDH subsidiaries are shipped to the Mega Lab in Egypt, 
and results are retrieved electronically.
•	 Significant cost synergies are realised on kits, logistics and quality control; 
after the introduction of Mega Lab in 2015, the Group’s contribution margin 
witnessed improvement on higher volumes.
•	 B-labs serve as IDH’s spokes that work to reduce traffic to Mega Lab by 
processing routine tests on-site including chemistry, parasitology and 
haematology.
•	 They are higher in capacity and larger in size than the C-labs.
•	 At 2017 year end, there were 7 B-labs in Egypt and 4 in Jordan.
•	 C-labs are collection centres that allow for expansion of reach.
•	 They conduct basic tests including urine, stool, semen, ESR and preg-
nancy tests.
•	 At 2017 year end, there were 348 operational C-lab branches.
B-labs (Spokes) are capable of process-
ing routine tests, and they effectively 
reduce traffic to the Mega Lab where 
warranted. The C-labs (Spikes) func-
tion as collection centres that most 
importantly increase the Group’s 
reach to clients nationwide. 
Supported by the strong operational 
backbone of the Mega Lab, IDH is able 
to offer a broad range of tests and can 
“plug and play” new C-labs to extend 
its geographic reach. The addition of 
new and esoteric test facilities at the 
Mega Lab provides a “one-stop” solu-
tion for patients that, in combination 
with value-package offerings, drives 
the Company’s key test-per-patient 
financial metric.

histopathology and microbiology. Across its brand 
portfolio, IDH maintains international-quality accredi-
tations with a stringent internal audit process to ensure 
best-in-class service.
ISo
ISO accreditation requires an initial inspection of labo-
ratory practices, calibration and medical analysis by an 
accreditation body. For Al Mokhtabar and for Al Borg, 
it was URS Certification (accredited internationally 
by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service); and for 
Biolab, it was the Jordanian Accreditation System ( JAS). 
The inspection involves the clinical chemistry area, the 
virology unit, the haematology unit and the general 
laboratory management practice. The accreditation’s 
standards include both management and technical 
requirements. The Company’s ISO 9001:2008 accredita-
tions for both Al Mokhtabar and Al Borg passed year end 
accreditation reviews in 2017 and will next be renewed 
in 2018.
College of American pathologists (CAp)
Unlike ISO accreditation, CAP certification is awarded 
to individual labs, rather than the Group’s operations as 
a whole.  In February 2018, IDH’s central Mega Lab in 
Cairo earned certification from the College of American 
Pathologists (CAP). The Group’s Mega Lab, inaugurated 
in 2015, replaced two smaller, independent “A-labs” one 
of which was also CAP certified. 
IDH operates the only laboratory in Egypt to receive this 
distinguished certification. The College of American Pa-
thologists, widely considered the leader in laboratory qual-
ity assurance globally, upholds standards that track four 
aspects of laboratory operations:
•	 Directors and personnel: The laboratory must be 
staffed with a sufficient number of personnel and the 
lines of authority should be well defined so that the 
directors can properly fulfil their responsibilities.
•	 Physical resources: There must be sufficient resourc-
es, including physical space, testing instruments, 
reagents, information processing and communica-
tion systems, ventilation, storage and waste disposal 
facilities and public utilities. Furthermore, there must 
be sufficient safeguards against hazardous conditions 
to ensure patient safety.
•	 Quality management: The laboratory must have poli-
cies and procedures in place to ensure quality testing 
and patient safety. These should include the valida-
tion of test systems, analytic quality control, and qual-
ity management of pre- and post-analytic processes, 
proficiency testing, human resource management, 
information management, ongoing quality improve-
ment and appropriate communication procedures.
•	 Administrative requirements: The laboratory must 
maintain appropriate records and adhere to CAP 
certification requirements and certain other policies, 
and will be subject to on-site inspections, interim 
inspections and interim self-assessments.
The CAP certification remains subject to renewal every 
two years.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 30 Quality Assurance
IDH’s quality assurance programme ensures that all inter-
nal diagnostic processes, lab testing procedures and results 
analyses are accurate. The quality assurance program 
ensures that all the standards of the CAP and ISO accredi-
tations are met by inspecting hardware and equipment, 
ensuring compliance with procedure manuals, inspecting 
the accuracy of results and administering competency 
assessments for employees. The internal audit team also 
maintains a specific audit checklist for the basic and rou-
tine tests conducted in the Group’s C-labs, including con-
formity of process; testing the competency of employees 
through oral, observational, practical and written tests; and 
conducting managerial audits to assess the labs’ manage-
ment and administrative efficiency.
Employee training
The Group views education as an essential means of ensur-
ing quality across its laboratories. To help develop the skills 
of employees, IDH has a dedicated training facility in Cairo 
with four training laboratories. In 2017, the training centre 
employed one director, eight full-time specialists, three ad-
ministrators, two consultants and seven part-time instruc-
tors. The centre provides training to around 350 employees 
per month, including doctors, chemists, receptionists, 
branch and area managers, sales personnel and adminis-
trators. The training curriculum is determined based on 
performance KPIs, internal audit reports, management re-
views, competency assessment reports and analysis of cus-
tomer feedback and complaints. IDH’s employee training 
is structured along four modules: new employee training, 
competency-based, need-based and practical re-training.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  31 Strategic Report
Growth 
Strategy 
IDH’s growth strategy rests on leveraging its established 
business model to achieve four key strategic goals, namely: 
(1) continue to expand customer reach; (2) increase tests 
per patient by expanding the Group’s services portfolio; 
(3) expand into new geographic markets through selec-
tive, value-accretive acquisitions; and (4) introduce new 
medical services by leveraging the Group’s network and 
reputable brand position.
Expand Customer Reach
IDH intends to use its scalable, low capital-intensive business 
model to quickly and efficiently open new labs and expand 
geographically in the Middle East and Africa. A wider geo-
graphic reach will increase accessibility for patients, thereby 
expanding the customer base. Furthermore, the Group’s 
add-on services, such as house calls, e-services and results 
delivery, make its regular service offerings easier to use for 
both existing and prospective patients. IDH is also actively 
engaged in advertising campaigns to raise awareness of par-
ticular diseases and the importance of being tested, as well 
as to educate people with lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes 
and high cholesterol, to undergo frequent testing.
Increase tests per patient
IDH intends to expand its branch network and diversify its 
portfolio of test services offered in order to take full advan-
tage of the strong demand for private healthcare services 
across its geographic platform. The Group is expanding its 
ability to perform more complex tests not offered in other 
labs by broadening its portfolio of specialised and advanced 
tests, which will help to drive testing volumes. IDH is also 
focused on bundling testing services into health packages 
to offer to its existing customers at discounted rates as a 
way to increase tests, thus revenues, per patient. 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 32 Expand Geographically 
IDH is looking to expand through value-accreting acquisi-
tions in highly-fragmented and underpenetrated markets 
in the Middle East and Africa, where our business model 
is well-suited to capitalise on similar healthcare and con-
sumer trends. Beyond acquisitions in new geographies, the 
Group is also interested in acquiring complementary diag-
nostic services that in combination would enhance IDH’s 
profile as that of a “one-stop shop” diagnostics provider. In 
sync with these strategies, the Group was pleased to have 
closed on an investment in Nigeria in January 2018. 
Diversify into n ew Medical Services
As the medical testing market in Egypt is evolving from a 
single doctor-oriented model to a branded chain model, 
IDH recognises the opportunity to offer services that are 
not currently being provided by any private healthcare 
provider on a large scale. The Group believes that its 
scale and experience make it better positioned than its 
competitors to take advantage of developing diagnostic 
services opportunities in Egypt, ranging from specialised 
physician services to radiology to in-vitro fertilisation, 
among other possibilities.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  33 Strategic Report
Principal Risks,  
Uncertainties & Their Mitigation 
As in any corporation, IDH has exposure to risks and 
uncertainties that may adversely affect its performance. 
IDH Chairman Lord St John of Bletso has emphasised that 
ownership of the risk matrix is sufficiently important to the 
Group’s long-term success that it must be equally shared by 
the Board and senior management. 
While no system can mitigate every risk — and some risks, 
as at the country level, are largely without potential miti-
gants — the Group has in place processes, procedures and 
baseline assumptions that provide mitigation. The Board 
and senior management agree that the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group include:
Specific Risk Mitigation
Country risk — political & Security
Egypt and the wider MENA region, where the Group oper-
ates, have experienced political volatility since 2011 and 
continue to experience occasional terrorist incidents. 
There remains a risk of occasional civil disorder.
Nigeria is facing security challenges on several fronts, in-
cluding re-emerging ethnic tensions and resurgent attacks 
by Islamist militants in the northeast. Against the backdrop 
of a sluggish economy and the slow implementation of 
reforms, mounting discontent could translate into further 
social unrest. 
See mitigants for “Country/regional risk — Economic,” 
below.
Echo-Scan’s laboratories are located primarily in Lagos, 
Abuja and Benin, far from the current unrest occurring in 
the northeast part of Nigeria. 
 
Regarding other operating risks, including but not limited 
to legal and compliance risks, IDH will apply the same rig-
orous standards to evaluating all aspects of its business 
processes in Nigeria as it has implemented in all of the 
emerging markets in which it operates. 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 34 Principal Risks,  
Uncertainties & Their Mitigation 
Specific Risk Mitigation
Country/regional risk — Economic
The Group is subject to the economic conditions of Egypt 
specifically and, to a lesser extent, those of the wider 
MENA region. Egypt accounted for c. 83% of our revenues 
in 2017 (2016: 87%).
High inflation: According to Reuters, Egypt’s annual infla-
tion rates fell in January 2018 to their lowest levels since the 
November 2016 devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Annual 
Urban Consumer Price Inflation eased to 17.1% in January 
2018 from 21.9% in December 2017, whilst core inflation 
that strips out volatile items dropped to 14.4% from 19.9% 
for the same periods. Inflation had reached a record high in 
July 2017 at c. 35% on the back of energy subsidy cuts, but 
then subsequently declined gradually as inflationary pres-
sures caused by floating the currency eased.
nigeria: Capital controls could make profit repatriation dif-
ficult in the short term. 
nigeria: Depreciation of the naira would make imported 
products and raw materials more expensive and would 
reduce Nigeria’s contribution to consolidated Company 
revenues. Whilst capital controls have helped the official 
exchange converge with the black-market rate, the central 
bank has yet to allow the naira to float freely.
As with country risk, this is largely not subject to mitigation. 
In both political/security and economic risk, management 
notes that IDH operates in a defensive industry and that 
the business continued to grow year-on-year through two 
revolutions, as well as under extremely difficult operating 
conditions in 2016.
High inflation is one consequence of Egypt’s policy-
restructuring cycle. The structural change underway in 
government spending and general repricing of goods and 
services represents a reversal of 50 years of comprehensive 
government support. Whilst it will take time, the reform 
program is designed to put the country on a more sustain-
able path to growth and fiscal consolidation.  
The Group’s contemplated acquisitions outside of Egypt 
would also mitigate the Egypt-specific country risk over time.
In Nigeria, until currency exchange policy is clarified and 
there is greater visibility regarding profit repatriation, IDH 
expects to reinvest early profits into its Nigerian business. 
Dividend payments are not expected to be repatriated in 
the first four years of operation. 
IDH will capitalise on its regional agreements with suppli-
ers to procure kits at competitive prices. 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  35 Strategic Report
Specific Risk Mitigation
Foreign currency and banking regulation risk
Foreign currency risk: The Group is exposed to foreign cur-
rency risk on the cost side of the business. The majority 
of supplies it acquires are paid in Egyptian pounds (EGP), 
but given they are imported, their price will vary with the 
rate of exchange between the EGP and foreign currencies. 
In addition, a portion of supplies are priced and paid in 
foreign currencies.
The CBE moved to a fully floating foreign exchange regime 
on 3 November 2016, since which time the value of the 
Egyptian pound against the US dollar has been set by the 
interbank market. After losing more than 50% of its value 
in 2016, the Egyptian pound closed 2017 at 17.76 per US$1 
against an opening rate of EGP 18.00.
The Egyptian pound was valued at 17.60 to US$ 1.00 as of 
15 March 2018. 
Banking regulation risk: A priority list and allocation 
mechanism imposed by the CBE was in effect through-
out 2016 to prioritise essential imports. This mechanism 
was in place in response to an active parallel market for 
foreign exchange.
Whilst foreign exchange is increasingly available following 
the November 2016 float of the Egyptian pound and prices 
set by the interbank mechanism, IDH faces the risk of 
variability in the exchange rate as a result of economic and 
other factors. 
IDH’s exposure to foreign currency risk takes two primary 
forms: price and availability. Price risk impacts the cost 
of supplies (almost all imported, either directly by IDH or 
by third parties), on which spending was equivalent to c. 
20% of revenues in 2017 (2016: 16%). Management believes 
that it can mitigate the effects of devaluation through a 
combination of improved pricing and cost efficiencies (see 
Supplier Risk below for more).
Only 15% of IDH’s cost of supplies (c.3% of revenues) are 
payable in US dollars, minimising the Group’s exposure to 
foreign exchange (FX) scarcity and in part, the volatility of 
the Egyptian pound.
In 2017, IDH recorded a net foreign exchange loss of EGP 20 
million compared with a net foreign exchange loss of EGP 
89 million in 2016. 
With bank liquidity improving, helped by Egypt’s three-
year US$ 12 billion IMF loan agreement and the November 
2016 floatation of the Egyptian pound, 2017 saw the CBE 
remove the strict capital controls that had been imposed 
following the country’s 2011 political uprising. Foreign 
exchange is now freely available in the market, from banks 
and exchange companies alike; and the parallel market 
has been eliminated.
The priority list and allocation mechanism have been 
relaxed following the Egyptian pound devaluation. Compa-
nies now report increasing availability of foreign exchange 
for imports. The parallel market for foreign exchange is 
presently dormant.
Caps on deposits of foreign exchange into the banking 
system, which were in place during 2015 and throughout 
much of 2016, have been removed.
There are currently no restrictions in Egypt on repatriation 
of dividends by foreign companies. 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 36 Specific Risk Mitigation
Supplier risk
In the year to December 2016, the EGP lost 56% of its value 
against the US$, creating significant risk of suppliers re-
opening negotiations in the face of cost pressure.
In the year to 31 December 2017 the value of the Egyp-
tian pound has remained consistent against the US$ at 
17.67:1.00 (closing rate). 
IDH’s supplier risk is concentrated  amongst three key sup-
pliers — Siemens, Roche and BM (Sysmex)— who provide 
it with kits representing 47% of the total value of total raw 
materials in 2017 (2016: 49%).
IDH has strong, longstanding relationships with its suppli-
ers, to whom it is a significant regional client. Due to the 
volumes of kits the Company purchases, IDH is able to ne-
gotiate favourable pricing that in 2016 saw the price it pays 
for kits rise slower than inflation, which rose to new highs 
as a result of the devaluation of the EGP . IDH management 
has agreed with its main suppliers that no price increases 
will be imposed during 2018.
Total raw materials costs as a percentage of sales were 20% 
in 2017 compared with 16% in 2016. 
Remittance of dividend regulations and repatriation 
of profit risk
The Group’s ability to remit dividends abroad may be 
adversely affected by the imposition of remittance restric-
tions where, under Egyptian law, companies must obtain 
government clearance to transfer dividends overseas and 
are subject to higher taxation on payment of dividends.
As a foreign investor in Egypt, IDH does not have issues with 
the repatriation of dividends, but is exposed to risk in the form 
of cost of foreign exchange in the markets in which the Group 
operates, particularly Egypt.
As a provider of medical diagnostic services, IDH’ s operations in 
Sudan are not subject to sanctions. Notably , in October 2017 the 
US lifted a host of sanctions imposed 20 years ago that included 
a comprehensive trade embargo, a freeze on government assets 
and tight restrictions on financial institutions dealing with the 
country. Management views this as an important milestone 
signaling the end to the country’ s economic isolation.
Legal and regulatory risk to the business
The Group’s business is subject to, and affected by, exten-
sive, stringent and frequently changing laws and regula-
tions, as well as frequently changing enforcement regimes, 
in each of the countries in which it operates. Moreover, as a 
significant player in the Egyptian private clinical laboratory 
market, the Group is subject to antitrust and competition-
related restrictions, as well as the possibility of investiga-
tion by the Egyptian Competition Authority.
The Group’s general counsel and the quality assurance team 
work together to keep IDH abreast of, and in compliance 
with, both legislative and regulatory changes. 
On the antitrust front, the private laboratory segment 
(of which IDH is a part) accounts for a small proportion 
of the total market, which consists of small private labs, 
private chain labs and large governmental and quasi-
governmental institutions.
Quality control risks
Failure to establish and comply with appropriate quality 
standards when performing testing and diagnostics ser-
vices could result in litigation and liability for the Group 
and could materially and adversely affect its reputation and 
results of operations. This is particularly key as the Group 
depends heavily on maintaining good relationships with 
healthcare professionals who prescribe and recommend 
the Group’s services.
The Group’s quality assurance (QA) function ensures com-
pliance with best practices across all medical diagnostic 
functions. All laboratory staff participate in ongoing pro-
fessional education with quality assurance emphasised at 
each juncture. 
The head of quality assurance for the Group is a member of 
the senior management team at the IDH level, which meets 
weekly to review recent developments, plan strategy and 
discuss issues of concern to the Group as a whole.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  37 Strategic Report
Specific Risk Mitigation
Risk from contract clients
Contract clients including private insurers, unions and 
corporations, account for c. 61% of the Group’s revenue. 
Should IDH’s relationship with these clients deteriorate, for 
example if the Group was unable to negotiate and retain 
similar fee arrangements or should these clients be unable 
to make payments to the Group, IDH’s business could be 
materially and adversely affected.
IDH diligently works to maintain sound relationships with 
contract clients. All changes to pricing and contracts are ar-
rived at through discussion rather than blanket imposition 
by IDH. Relations are further enhanced by regular visits to 
contract clients by the Group’s sales staff.
IDH’s attractiveness to contract clients is enhanced by the 
extent of its national network. 
No single client contract currently accounts for more than 
0.8% of total revenues or 1.4% of Corporate revenues.
Prudent management of contract clients translated into 
the Group taking provisions of EGP 5.6 million in 2017 for 
doubtful accounts (2016: EGP 4.3 million). (See note 16 to the 
accompanying Financial Statements for more information.)
pricing pressure in a competitive, regulated environment
The Group faces pricing pressure from various third-
party payers that could materially and adversely affect 
its revenue. Pricing may be restrained in cases by recom-
mended or mandatory fees set by government ministries 
and other authorities.
This risk may be more pronounced in the context of 
headline monthly inflation, which as of December 2017 
stood at 21.9%.
This is an external risk for which there exist few mitigants.
In the event there is escalation of price competition be-
tween market players, the Group sees its wide national 
footprint as a mitigant; c. 61% of our revenue is generated 
by servicing contract clients (private insurer, unions and 
corporations) who prefer IDH’s national network to patch-
works of local players. 
IDH has a limited ability to influence changes to manda-
tory pricing policies imposed by government agencies, as 
is the case in Jordan, where basic tests that account for 
the majority of IDH’s business in that nation are subject 
to price controls. 
Carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets
A decline in financial performance could lead to an impair-
ment risk over the carrying value of IDH’s goodwill and 
other intangible assets. Goodwill and intangible assets 
have arisen from historic acquisitions made by the Group 
and include the brand names used in the business.
IDH carries out an annual impairment test on goodwill and 
other intangible assets in line with IAS 36. 
The results of the annual impairment test show headroom 
between the recoverable amount (based on value in use) 
and the carrying value of each of the identified Cash Gen-
erating Units and no impairment is deemed to be required.
For more detail see note 13 of the Financial Statements.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 38 Specific Risk Mitigation
Business continuity risks
Management concentration risk: IDH is dependent on the 
unique skills and experience of a talented management 
team. The loss of the services of key members of that 
team could materially and adversely affect the Company’s 
operations and business. 
Business interruption: IT systems are used extensively in 
virtually all aspects of the Group’s business and across 
each of its lines of business, including test and exam results 
reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and manage-
ment of medical data. Similarly, business interruption at 
one of the Group’s larger laboratory facilities could result in 
significant losses and reputational damage to the Group’s 
business as a result of external factors such as natural 
disasters, fire, riots or extended power failures. The Group’s 
operations therefore depend on the continued and uninter-
rupted performance of its systems.
IDH understands the need to support its future growth 
plans by strengthening its human capital and engaging in 
appropriate succession planning. The Company is com-
mitted to expanding the senior management team, led by 
its CEO Dr. Hend El Sherbini, to include the talent needed 
for a larger footprint. The Group has constituted an Ex -
ecutive Committee led by Dr. El Sherbini and composed 
of heads of departments. The Executive Committee meets 
every second week.
The Group has in place a full disaster recovery plan, with 
procedures and provisions for spares, redundant power 
systems and the use of mobile data systems as alternatives 
to landlines, among multiple other factors. IDH tests its 
disaster recovery plans on a regular basis.
Loss of talent
IDH depends on the skills, knowledge, experience and 
expertise of its senior managers to run its business and 
implement its strategies. The Group’s senior management 
has an average of 15 years of industry experience and the 
majority are medical doctors. Furthermore, IDH is reliant 
on its ability to recruit and retain laboratory professionals. 
Loss of senior managers could materially and adversely af-
fect the Group’s results of operations and business.
In Nigeria, IDH will face a more limited talent pool of 
healthcare workers due to a weak education system and the 
tendency for trained professionals to move abroad.   
In addition to competitive compensation packages, the 
Group also ensures it has access to a broad pool of trained 
laboratory professionals through its own in-house recruit-
ment and training program. We furthermore have in place 
a program to monitor the performance of graduates of the 
training program.
Egypt is a net exporter of trained healthcare professionals 
as there is surplus staff in the market. IDH’s efforts are ac-
cordingly focused on retention of qualified staff as opposed 
to recruitment of new personnel.
In Nigeria, IDH intends to offer a strong value proposition 
for staff that includes opportunity for both compensation 
and training. The Group will seek to bring in expatriates 
to fill key leadership roles whilst local teams are being 
trained and developed. 
Loss of certifications and accreditations
Many of IDH’s facilities have received internationally ac-
creditations for high-quality standards. The failure to renew 
these certifications, including the College of American 
Pathologists (CAP) accreditation for the Mega Lab or the 
International Organization for Standards (IOS) for other fa-
cilities, would call into question the Group’s quality stand-
ards and competitive differentiators.
In February 2018, IDH’s central Mega Lab in Cairo received 
CAP certification. The CAP certification will thereafter be 
subject to renewal every two years. The Company also re-
newed its ISO certifications in 2017, with the next renewal 
due in 2018. IDH’s ability to keep current its certifications 
and accreditation are supported by ongoing QA, training 
and internal audit procedures.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  39 Strategic Report
Financial   
Review 
2017 performance overview
IDH delivered strong operational and financial results in 
the year ended 31 December 2017, despite macroeconomic 
challenges, in particular high inflation, that continued in 
the aftermath of the November 2016 floatation of the Egyp-
tian pound. This is noteworthy as it stands in sharp contrast 
to many consumer names in Egypt. Whilst the healthcare 
industry is inherently defensive, this performance also 
reflects the customer loyalty that has been earned by the 
Company’s trusted brands over many years. On a 29% 
year-on-year revenue increase in 2017, EBITDA gained 18%, 
constrained somewhat by ongoing pressure from higher 
raw material costs. Net profits, however, surged by 44% 
year-on-year, helped by higher interest income and a sharp 
year-on-year decline in foreign exchange losses given what 
has been relative stability in exchange rates.
The Group continued to invest in expanding its geo-
graphic footprint in 2017, and notably through a trans-
action that closed in February 2018 entered the Nigerian 
market (see discussion on page 22). Supported by its 
state-of-the-art Mega Lab with additional capacity, the 
Company is able to deploy its Hub, Spoke and Spike 
business model to open capital efficient “C” labs more 
rapidly. During 2017, the Group added 29 new labs in 
total, including 19 new branches for Al Mokhtabar in 
Egypt; four for Al Borg in Egypt; four for Biolab in Jor-
dan; and two for MK Sudan. Total IDH branches reached 
383 as of 31 December 2017 versus 354 at 2016 year end, 
for 8% total unit expansion. 
The results for the year are summarised below:

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 40 IDH Revenue by t ype and Key performance Indicators
our Customers
IDH serves two principal types of clients: contract (cor-
porate) and walk-in (individuals). Within each of these 
categories, the Group also offers a house-call service, 
and within the contract segment, a lab-to-lab service.
Contract Clients
IDH’s contract clients, who in 2017 represented 61% 
of the Group’s revenues, include institutions such as 
unions, syndicates, private and public insurance com-
panies, banks and corporations who enter into one-year 
renewable contracts at agreed rates per-test and on a 
per-client basis. During 2017, IDH served 4.7 million 
patients under these contracts and performed a total 
of 19.7 million tests, with no single contract client ac-
counting for more than 0.8% of total revenues. Within 
the contract segment, IDH also provides lab-to-lab 
services for hospitals and other laboratories not able to 
process certain tests in house.
Walk-in Clients
IDH derived 39% of its revenues in 2017 from walk-in 
clients. Walk-in clients numbered 1.7 million in 2017, 
representing 26% of total patients served. As IDH’s mar-
kets develop and become more institutionally oriented, 
more patients will be performing pathology tests under 
corporate agreements, a trend that plays to the Group’s 
strength with the best economies of scale in the Egyp-
tian diagnostics industry.

Revenue Analysis
Consolidated revenues increased 29% year-on-year to 
EGP 1,514 million, attributable to price and mix of tests, 
followed by currency translation and test volumes. The fa-
vourable impact of translating the revenues of IDH’s Jorda-
nian operations into Egyptian pounds more than offset the 
negative effect of translating the revenues of its Sudanese 
operations. In 2017, the Jordanian dinar (JOD) was trans-
lated at an average rate of 24.92 (2016: 14.573), the Sudanese 
pound (SDG) at an average rate of 1.04 (2016: 1.204). Whilst 
patient and test volumes gained 9% and 7%, respectively, 
selected price increases and a better mix of test types were 
also key drivers of top-line growth. This can be seen in the 
key metrics of average revenue-per-patient, up 18%, and 
average revenue-per-test, 21% higher. 
Revenues from contract clients grew 29% year-on-year 
in 2017, supported by an overall trend toward corporate 
health insurance coverage, in particular in Egypt, IDH’s 
largest market. Whilst the number of contract patients was 
12% higher and the number of contract tests was up 7%, 
average revenue-per-patient increased 15% and average 
revenue-per-test gained 22% on better pricing and mix. IDH 
signed 311 new corporate contracts with insurers last year 
versus 456 in 2016.
Revenues from walk-in clients also rose 29% year-on-year, 
helped by improving patient volumes. The Group served 
2% more walk-in patients in 2017 compared with a 4% 
decline in 2016. Consequently, the Company was able to 
achieve a 26% increase in revenue-per-patient; and on 4% 
more tests-per-patient, a 21% gain in revenue-per-test in 
the walk-in category. 
In particular, it is the improvement seen in the walk-in pa-
tient category that highlights the loyalty consumers have to 
the Al Borg and Al Mokhtabar brands in Egypt, IDH’s largest 
market. They have come to know and trust these names over 
the years, and they return to the laboratories they equate 
with quality and safety. Cognisant of the burden faced by 
its customers, IDH’s price increases have been significantly 
below the high inflation rates caused by the November 
2016 currency devaluation. The Group has also designed 
its tactical marketing programs with attractive features for 
them, such as discounts on chronic disease tests as well as 
partnerships with banks for affordable payment programs. 
On a geographic basis, Egypt contributed 83% of total rev-
enues in 2017 followed by Jordan at 14% and Sudan at 3%, 
in the same proportions as 2016.  
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased 45% year-on-year to EGP 785 mil-
lion in 2017 compared with EGP 543 million in 2016 pri-
marily due to raw material cost pressures. Raw materials 
represented the largest component of cost of sales at 39% 
of total (2016: 34%) and rose 67%. Whilst IDH was able to 
negotiate favourable contract terms with its three main 
suppliers – Roche, Siemens and BM (Sysmex) — the prices 
of imported medical test kits continued to climb post-
devaluation. 
Wages and salaries, the second largest component of cost 
of sales in 2017, accounting for 30% of total (2016: 36%), 
were favourably leveraged on the strong revenues. The 
22% year-on-year increase in these expenses is mainly 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 42 attributable to the translation into Egyptian pounds of 
higher salaries for the Group’s Jordanian subsidiary and 
Board of Directors caused by the exchange rate difference 
between the two reporting period.      
The depreciation expense accounted for in COGS increased 
40% to EGP 57 million in 2017 (2016: EGP 41 million). This 
increase in direct depreciation is primarily attributable to 
increased kit consumption related to leased equipment. 
 
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased 16% year-on-year to EGP 729 mil-
lion compared with EGP 628 million in 2016, constrained 
by higher raw material costs. The associated gross margin 
decreased c. 600 basis points to 48% from 54% a year 
earlier. This pressure could also be seen in the decline in 
gross profit contribution percentage from Egypt, whose 
gross margin is higher than those of Jordan and Sudan. 
Egypt’s contribution to total gross profit was 89% in 2017 
compared with 92% in 2016. 
operating Expenses
Operating expenses gained 17% year-on-year to EGP 189 
million in 2017 versus EGP 162 million in 2016. As a per-
centage of sales, however, operating expenses decreased 
to 12% from 14% a year ago. The favourable leverage of 
these largely fixed costs partially mitigated the negative 
impact of the higher raw material costs.  
Operating Profit
Operating profit for 2017 was accordingly EGP 540 million 
compared with EGP 466 million in 2016.
EBIt DA 
EBITDA
*
 rose 18% year-on-year to EGP 602 million versus 
EGP 511 in 2016. The associated EBITDA margin came 
under pressure from higher raw material costs, which was 
only partially offset by the favourable leverage of fixed 
costs. The ratio stood at 40% in 2017 compared with 44% 
in 2016. We consider EBITDA to be an appropriate alter-
native performance measure, as it is a metric commonly 
followed by the institutional investment community. 
By region, Egypt contributed 91% of total EBITDA down 
from 94% in 2016, whilst Jordan and Sudan contributed 7% 
and 2%, respectively, compared with 5% and 1% a year earlier.
Foreign Exchange
In 2017, the Group’s net foreign exchange loss amounted 
to EGP 19.9 million, as an FX loss of EGP 24.5 million was 
partially offset by an EGP 4.5 million FX gain. This was 
substantially below the net foreign exchange loss of EGP 
89 million in 2016.
*
EBITDA is calculated as operating profit (EGP 540 million) plus depreciation (EGP 62 million) and amortisation (nil).
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  43 Strategic Report
The EGP 24.5 million foreign exchange loss was attrib-
utable to revalued foreign denominated contracts with 
major suppliers as well as the revaluation of intercom-
pany balances between IDH and its subsidiaries and with 
the different functional currencies within the group, 
including the Egyptian pound, the Sudanese pound, the 
Jordanian dinar and the US dollar. The EGP 4.5 million 
FX gain related to finance lease obligations resulting 
from appreciation of the Egyptian pound.
taxation
In 2017, IDH recorded tax expense of EGP 174 million, 
with an effective tax rate of 31% (2016: 31%). There is no 
tax payable in the two IDH holding companies ( Jersey and 
Cayman); thus, costs incurred at the holding company 
level are not tax deductible. These would include, but are 
not limited to, KPMG UK fees and IDH administrative fees 
in London.
 
All tax is paid within the Group’s operating companies. 
The corporate income tax rates in countries in which IDH 
operates are as follows: Egypt 22.5%, Jordan 20.0% and 
Sudan 15.0%. 
The Group’s dividend policy is to distribute any excess 
cash after taking into consideration all business cash re-
quirements and potential acquisition considerations. As 
a result, a deferred tax liability is recognised for the 5% 
tax on dividends for the future expected distribution pay-
able by Egyptian entities under Egyptian tax legislation. 
Deferred tax in 2017 amounted to EGP 56.9 million (loss) 
compared with EGP 14.1 million (gain) in 2016.
Net Profit
Net profit for the year increased 44% to EGP 384 million 
versus EGP 267 million recorded in 2016. This growth was 
spurred by effective cash management generating interest 
income that offset higher interest expense incurred due 
to the Central Bank of Egypt’s rate hike policy and the 
adoption of International Accounting Standard (23) that 
capitalised interest on the Group’s Medium-Term Loan for 
its new corporate headquarters building. The bottom line 
also benefited from a sharp year-on-year decline in foreign 
exchange losses, given what has been relative stability in 
exchange rates.
Balance Sheet
On the assets side of the balance sheet, property, plant and 
equipment (PPE) rose to EGP 486 million at 31 December 
2017 from EGP 391 million a year earlier primarily due to 
new investment in the Group’s new corporate headquar-
ters, slated for completion in 2018, as well as the opening 
of 29 new branches region-wide. 
In 2015, IDH entered into equipment lease agreements 
with its major suppliers that became effective in May 
2015. The agreement periods range from five to eight 
years, which is deemed to reflect the useful life of the 
equipment. The agreements include annual commit-
ment payments to cover the supply of medical diagnos-
tic equipment, test kits and chemicals to be used for 
testing and ongoing maintenance and support services 
over the term of the agreement. If the minimum annual 
commitment payments are met over the agreement pe-
riod, ownership of the equipment supplied will legally 
transfer to IDH. On one side, the leased equipment is 
recorded in PPE, and the finance lease is recorded as a 
liability on the other side. 
Trade and other receivables rose 36% to EGP 202 million 
compared with EGP 148 million in 2016. The difference 
was primarily related to an increase in the accounts 
receivable balance associated with the gain in contract 
revenues, together with higher accrued revenues related 
to time deposit interest. 
The total bad debt provision balance amounted to EGP 
21.7 million, out of which EGP 5.6 million was estab-
lished in 2017: EGP 4.7 million for Egypt; EGP 0.4 million 
for Sudan; and the remaining balance for Jordan.  
On the Liabilities side, trade and other payables de-
creased to EGP 333 million in 2017 from EGP 346 million 
in 2016 mainly due to the decline in put option liability 
related to the Jordanian operation given the spot rate 
as at 31 December 2016 stood at EGP:JOD 25.41 versus 
EGP:JOD 24.89 as at 31 December 2017. 
Inventories at 2017 year end were EGP 70 million, up 
36% versus a year earlier largely due to higher raw mate-
rial prices in 2017 compared with 2016.
IDH managed to deliver strong operational cash flow, 
with an ending cash balance at 2017 year end of EGP 694 
million (excluding restricted cash).
Dividend
Proposed dividends for ordinary shares are subject to 
the approval of the Annual General Meeting and are 
not recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2017. 
The Board of Directors has recommended that a final 
dividend of US$ 24 million, or US$ 0.16 per share, should 
be paid to shareholders who appear on the register as at 
18 May 2018, with an ex-dividend date of 17 May 2018. 
The payment date for the dividend will be 8 June 2018.

Corporate    
Responsibility 
Founded on the principle of providing quality medical 
assistance and services to better the lives of individu-
als and the community at large, IDH views corporate 
responsibility initiatives as an extension of its core 
purpose, with the aim of improving the communities in 
which it does business. 
The Moamena Kamel Foundation for Training and Skill De-
velopment was established in 2006 by Dr. Moamena Kamel, 
a Professor of Pathology at Cairo University, founder of IDH 
subsidiary Al-Mokhtabar Labs, and mother of the CEO, Dr. 
Hend El Sherbini. IDH commits up to 1% of the net after-tax 
profit of the subsidiaries Al Borg and Al Mokhtabar to the 
Foundation, which in 2017 amounted to EGP 3.9 million 
compared with EGP 2.8 million in 2016.
The Foundation allocates this sum to organisations and 
groups in need of assistance, with a particular focus on 
making a difference in the lives of residents of Cairo’s Al 
Duweiqa community along with several other villages 
across Egypt. The Foundation deploys an integrated pro-
gram and vision for the communities it helps that include 
economic, social and healthcare development initiatives.
The Foundation’s primary services include:
•	 Free healthcare clinics
•	 Loans for entrepreneurial women
•	 Educational services for the children of Al Duweiqa 
community
•	 Providing food for families in need of such assistance
•	 Coverage of running costs for the ICU at Cairo’s 
public-sector Kasr El Aini Hospital
IDH has also been expanding the reach of its Corporate 
Responsibility initiatives in recent years to include:
•	 Additional services to Kasr El Aini Hospital that in-
clude providing medical supplies to the ICU and other 
units; monthly incentives for nurses in the ICU; and 
12-20 hospital beds
•	 Financial and in-kind support to El Manial Hospital
•	 Financial and in-kind support to the Egyptian people 
during natural disasters
•	 Ramadan Iftar ( feast) meals to underprivileged Egyp-
tians during the holy month of Ramadan
•	 Free medical tests to underprivileged Egyptian 
children
•	 Sponsorship of medical convoys to the city of Fayoum

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  51 Corporate Governance      
Report  
Your Board of Directors (“the Board”) is responsible for 
providing strong leadership and effective decision making, 
safeguarding in the process the interests of all shareholders 
of Integrated Diagnostics Holdings. Under my chairman-
ship, the Board has been resolute in providing oversight and 
guidance to senior management as the Group continues to 
execute its regional growth strategy.  
IDH has a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange 
and is thus not required to comply with the requirements 
of the 2014 U.K. Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) 
as issued by the Financial Reporting Council, nor does IDH 
voluntarily comply with the Code. That said, it is the view 
of your Board that we continue our path of improving our 
corporate governance structure to adhere to best practices. 
We strongly believe that the gradual adoption of best in-
dustry practices in governance will assist us in building a 
profitable and sustainable business as well as safeguarding 
shareholder interests.
We are compliant with Financial Conduct Authority Disclo-
sure and Transparency Rule (DTR) subchapters 7.1 and 7.2, 
which set out certain mandatory disclosures: 7.1 concerns 
audit committees and bodies carrying out equivalent func-
tions; 7.2 concerns corporate governance standards that 
are included in the Directors Report or, in this case, as part 
of the Strategic Review (DTR 7.2.1). 
To that end, we have an Audit Committee as well as Re-
muneration and Nomination Committees. The Board may 
establish additional committees as appropriate going for-
ward. This Annual Report includes reports from both the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Your Board aims to work towards implementing best prac-
tices in corporate governance, calling on both the expertise 
of individual Directors as well as that of outside parties, in-
cluding legal counsel and global professional services firms.  
 
Functioning of the Board
We met five times as a Board during the course of 2017, 
including once in Cairo, Egypt in November 2017. I was 
delighted to have had the opportunity to visit IDH’s main 
base of operations in Cairo, during which time I engaged di-
rectly with senior management to discuss both the Group’s 
strategic plans and how management (including our Chief 
Executive) is evolving the policies and procedures neces-
sary to continue the full institutionalisation of the business. 
The Board has invested significant time discussing and 
evaluating the Group’s strategy and prospects for future 
growth, the outcome of which is presented in our state-
ment of strategy on page 32. We are confident that we have 
in place the right strategy and the right management team 
to deliver shareholder returns going forward. 
Composition of the Board
Under its Articles of Association, the Group must have a 
minimum of two Directors. While there is no maximum 
number of Directors, the Board presently includes six 
Board members and has no intention at present of appoint-
ing additional members. Notably, Directors have no share 
qualification, meaning they do not need to be shareholders 
of the Group in order to serve. 
I am pleased to report that we have four Independent Non-
Executive Directors. Together, the Directors offer IDH a 
world standard mix of expertise in areas including strategy, 
finance and medical diagnostics — as well as diverse expe-
rience in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We have rel-
evant commercial and technical experience to help direct 
the Group as it delivers on its strategy in a very technical 
field and across rapidly changing geographies.
Your Board in 2017 and their biographies are set out on 
pages 50 and 51 of this Annual Report and are summarised 
in the following table.

Leadership 
We continue to operate on the basis of a clear division of 
responsibilities between the role of the Chairman and that 
of the Group Chief Executive. This segregation of roles was 
agreed at the Board meeting held 12 January 2015. The 
Board continues to believe that this segregation of roles 
remains appropriate, taking into account the size and 
structure of the Group. 
As Chairman, I ensure the Board is effective in the execution 
of all aspects of its role. The Group Chief Executive Officer, 
meanwhile, is responsible for managing the day-to-day run-
ning of the business. In this, she is supported by a senior 
management team. The Group Chief Executive and I have 
a good working relationship and discuss matters of Group 
strategy and performance on a regular basis. 
We also work together to ensure that Board meetings cover 
relevant matters, including a quarterly review of financial 
and operational performance (including key performance 
indicators), and in partnership with the Group secretary 
ensure that all Directors:  
•	 are kept advised of key developments;
•	 receive accurate, timely and clear information upon 
which to call in the execution of their duties; and
•	 actively participate in the decision-making process. 
Agendas for meetings of the Board are reviewed and agreed 
in advance to ensure each Board meeting is efficiently run, 
allowing all Directors to openly and constructively chal-
lenge the proposals made by the Group’s senior manage-
ment. I am pleased to report that throughout the year, each 
Director has properly exercised those powers with which 
they have been vested by the Group’s Articles of Association 
and relevant laws.
The Board operates under a Schedule of Matters Reserved, 
the details of which are unchanged since our last Annual 
Report. Matters reserved to the Board means any decision 
that may affect the overall direction, supervision and man-
agement of the Group, including, but not limited to:
a. approving annually a strategic plan and objectives for 
the following year for the Group;
b. approving any decision to cease to operate all or any 
material part of the Group’s business or to enter into 
any new business or geographic areas;
c. monitoring the delivery of the Group’s strategy, objec-
tives, business plan and budget;
d. adopting or amending the Group’s business plan or 
annual budget;
e. incurring any capital expenditure in respect of any 
item or project of more than EGP 5 million that is 
not within the annual budget already approved by 
the Board;
f. entering into any contract, liability or commitment 
that: (i) could involve a liability for expenditure in 
excess of EGP 25 million that is not within the annual 
budget already approved by the Board or (ii) is outside 
the ordinary course of business of the Group, unless 
a contract involves costs within the annual budget 
and business plan already approved by the Board and 
satisfies such authorisation criteria as the Group may 
approve from time to time as part of the procedures 
for the Group;
g. making any material acquisition or disposal (includ-
ing any grant of any material licence) of or relating to 
any intellectual property rights;
h. decisions relating to the conduct (including the set-
tlement) of any legal proceedings to which any mem-
ber of the Group’s group is a party where there is a 
potential liability or claim of more than EGP 100,000;
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  53 i. approving the Group’s annual report and accounts 
and half-yearly financial statements and/or any 
change in the accounting principles or tax policies of 
any member of the Group’s group and/or any change 
in the end of the financial year of any member of the 
Group’s group except as contemplated by the busi-
ness plan or annual budget, as required by law or to 
comply with a new accounting standard;
j. adopting (or varying) the Group’s group material poli-
cies in respect of employees’ remuneration, employ-
ment terms and/or pension schemes;
k. any member of the Group’s group declaring or paying 
any dividend or distribution; 
l. delegating any of the Group’s powers to a committee 
of the Board, including setting the quorum for a meet-
ing of any such committee or approving its, or any 
changes to its, terms of reference;
m. approving the issue of all circulars, prospectuses, 
listing particulars and general meeting notices to 
shareholders of the Group;
n. ensuring the Group has effective systems of internal 
control and risk management in place by (i) approving 
the Group’s risk appetite statements and (ii) approv-
ing policies and procedures for the detection of fraud, 
the prevention of bribery and other areas considered 
by the Board to be material;
o. undertaking an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control 
and reporting on that review in the Group’s annual 
report. The review should cover all controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and 
risk management; 
p. carrying out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that threaten 
its business, future performance, solvency or liquid-
ity and to report on such assessment in the Group’s 
annual report; and
q. reviewing the Group’s overall corporate governance 
arrangements and approving any changes thereto.
Apart from these Reserved matters, the Board delegates 
specific items to its principal committees, namely the 
committees on Audit, Remuneration and Nomination. 
Each Committee is authorised to seek any information it 
requires from senior management.
I provide brief recaps below on each of these committees. 
Reports from the Chairmen of the Audit and Remunera-
tion Committees appear starting pages 58 and 62 of this 
Annual Report, respectively.
Board activities during 2017
Your Board of Directors held five meetings in 2017: three in 
London, one in Cairo and one via conference call. 
The following standing items are considered at each meeting:
•	 Determines that notice was given and that a quorum 
for the meeting has been obtained;
•	 Hears declarations of interest and considers any con-
flicts of interest that may arise; 
•	 Establishes the purpose of the meeting; and
•	 Reviews and approves minutes of the previous meet-
ing of the Board.

Corporate Governance
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 54 Details of our Directors’ attendance at Board and Com-
mittee meetings are shown in the table on page 57. In the 
event that any Director is unable to attend a meeting of the 
Board or Committee of which they are a member, he or she 
receives the necessary papers, including agendas, meet-
ing outcomes and any documents presented for review 
or information. Furthermore, I endeavour to discuss with 
them in advance of the meeting to obtain their views and 
decisions on the proposals to be considered.  
The Board meeting held one meeting in Cairo, Egypt in 2017 
to afford all Directors the opportunity to tour the Group’s 
Egypt offices and diagnostic facilities, as well as to meet 
with members of the Group’s senior management on an 
as-needed basis. 
Within the wider corporate governance framework, man-
agement established in 2016 a Management Committee 
led by the Chief Executive. Its members include all heads 
of departments, and it meets every second week to discuss 
issues related to sales, manual analysis units, automated 
analysis units, human resources, finance, marketing, qual-
ity and investor relations. The Group’s general counsel also 
attends these meetings on an as-needed basis. Senior man-
agement uses this as a forum to review upcoming priorities, 
recent performance, and the operational steps necessary to 
ensure the management team delivers on its business goals 
and the Group’s strategic plan.
Effectiveness 
The Board of IDH does not currently have formal mecha-
nisms in place to evaluate its effectiveness as regards to 
the on-boarding of new Directors, strategic planning or 
its formulation of goals. That said, having spent consider-
able time in both formal meetings and in learning about 
the skills of our Directors one on one — and drawing on 
my past experience as a Director — I am confident that 
the Board has the skills, talent and industry knowledge it 
needs to effectively deliver the Group’s agreed strategy. It is, 
moreover, our hope that we will over time develop formal 
evaluation mechanisms that will allow us to report on our 
effectiveness in a more rigorous manner. 
In the interim, it is my considered judgement that the 
Board receives from senior management sufficiently 
detailed budgets, forecasts, strategy proposals, reviews of 
the Group’s financial position and operating performance, 
and annual and half yearly reports to ensure that it may 
be effective. This enables us to effectively ask questions of 
senior management and to hold discussions on the Group’s 
strategy and performance. In 2017, senior management 
delivered regular reports to the Board ahead of regularly 
scheduled Board meetings.
All meetings of the Board and its Committees are min-
uted by the Group Secretary or a designated alternate. Any 
concerns raised by Directors are clearly recorded in the 
minutes of each meeting. I review Board minutes in my 
capacity as Chairman before these minutes are circulated 
to all Directors in attendance and then tabled for approval 
at the next meeting, at which time any necessary amend-
ments are made.
The Group has obtained customary directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity insurance covering the Chairman and the Non-
Executive Directors.
overview of the n omination Committee
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in reviewing 
the structure, size and composition of the Board. It is also 
responsible for reviewing succession plans for the Directors, 
including the Chairman and Chief Executive and other senior 
management. The Nomination Committee met on 21 August 
2017 within the context of the regular Board of Directors 
meeting, where it was resolved to appoint Mr. Omar Bedewy 
as Chief Financial Officer in succession to Mr. T arek Hamida. 
I note in this instance that all members of the Nomination 
Committee are Non-Executive Directors. As a result, we 
are fully compliant with the Code’s recommendation that 
a majority of the Nomination Committee should comprise 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. Hussein Choucri 
is deemed to be our Non-Executive Director with relevant 
financial experience in compliance with the DTR.

overview of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee recommends the Group’s 
policy on executive remuneration determines the levels of 
remuneration for Executive Directors and the Chairman 
and other senior management and prepares an annual re-
muneration report for approval by the Shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Code recommends that the Remuneration Committee 
should comprise, in the case of smaller companies, at least 
two Independent Non-Executive Directors. As all of the 
members of the Committee are Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, we are in full compliance with the recommenda-
tions of the Code in this respect.
The full report of the Remuneration Committee for 2017 
appears starting on page 62 of this Annual Report.

overview of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board with the 
discharge of its responsibilities in relation to financial 
reporting, including: reviewing the Group’s annual and 
half-year financial statements and accounting policies 
and internal and external audits and controls; reviewing 
and monitoring the independence and scope of the annual 
audit and the extent of the non-audit work undertaken by 
external auditors; advising on the appointment of external 
auditors; and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal 
audit, internal controls, whistleblowing and fraud systems 
in place within the Group. The Audit Committee will meet 
not less than three times a year. 
 
The Code requires that at least one member of the Audit Com-
mittee be independent and that at least one member has com-
petence in accounting and /or auditing. In addition, the Code 
recommends that the Audit Committee should comprise, in 
the case of smaller companies, at least two Independent Non-
Executive Directors and that at least one member has recent 
and relevant financial experience and that members of the 
Committee must have competence relevant to the sector in 
which the Group is operating. The Board considers that the 
Audit Committee complies with the requirements and recom-
mendations of the Code in those respects.

Internal Control and Risk Management
Given the business and geographies in which the Group 
operates, I believe as Chairman that risk mitigation will be 
key not just to the creation and preservation of shareholder 
value, but in the Group’s growth going forward. The Com-
pany’s risk matrix, outlined on pages 34-39, is sufficiently 
vital that it must be owned equally by the management 
team and members of the Board. 
Our view as a Board is that the Group must be proactive on 
risk in order to meet shareholder expectations, and I have 
advised that I expect the IDH management team to be ahead 
of the curve in this area. Senior management is working with 
the internal audit team to take the risk register forward. You 
may expect risk and its mitigation will be a theme to which 
your Board returns repeatedly in 2018, as we did in 2017. 
Corporate Governance
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s in-
ternal controls; however, they have delegated oversight 
of the Group’s system of internal controls to the Audit 
Committee so as to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and the interests of shareholders. The Audit Committee 
thus reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls on an ongoing basis to ensure the keeping of 
proper accounting records, safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and detecting fraud and other irregularities. 
The Audit Committee reports back to the Board with 
their findings and recommendations. 
The Board has accordingly established that the Group 
has in place internal controls to manage risk including:
•	 an Internal Auditor was appointed in May 2016; 
•	 the identification and management of risk at the 
level of operating departments by the heads of 
those departments; and
•	 regular Board level discussion of the major busi-
ness risks of the Group, together with measures 
being taken to contain and mitigate those risks.
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties and miti-
gation for them are set out on pages 34-39 of this Annual 
Report.
Your Board has furthermore put in place a control 
framework at the Group level that applies to all subsidi-
aries, including:
•	 Board approval of the overall Group budget and 
strategic plans;
•	 a clear organisational structure delineating lines of re-
sponsibility, authorities and reporting requirements;
•	 defined expenditure authorisation levels;
•	 a regular process for operational reviews at the 
senior management level on a weekly, monthly and 
quarterly basis covering all aspects of the business;
•	 a strategic planning process that defines the key 
steps senior management must take to deliver on the 
Group’s long term strategy;
•	 a comprehensive system of financial reporting 
including weekly flash reports to management, 
monthly reporting to management and an annual 
budget process involving both senior management 
and the Board; the Board received reports on a quar-
terly basis in 2017. 
•	 as part of the reporting process in 2017, manage-
ment reviewed monthly and year-to-date actual re-
sults against prior year, against budget and against 
forecast; these reports were circulated to the Board; 
any significant changes and adverse variances 
are reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and by 
senior management and remedial action is taken 
where appropriate.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 56 An internal audit plan for 2018 was prepared and agreed 
with the Audit Committee.
Investor Relations
Engagement with shareholders continues to be a key 
function at both the senior management and the Board 
level. Our investor relations function held more than 
50 meetings with current and potential investors dur-
ing the course of the year. Management met investors 
at seven investor conferences organised by CI Capital 
(Cairo and New York; counted as one conference), EFG 
Hermes (Dubai and London; two separate conferences), 
Renaissance Capital (Cape Town), Arqaam Capital 
(Dubai), HSBC (London) and, Deutsche Bank (Dubai); 
welcomed potential and current investors to meetings 
in Cairo; and handled queries, whether delivered ver-
bally or in writing, from more than 100 investors.
We published both half- and full-year results and further 
released trading updates on performance at the three- 
and nine-month periods. We intend to continue pub-
lishing trading updates at the first- and third-quarter 
marks in 2018, while simultaneously meeting the mini-
mum regulatory disclosure as required of a UK Standard 
listed entity. 
The Board communicates with shareholders through 
public announcements disseminated via the London 
Stock Exchange, analyst briefings, roadshows and press 
interviews. Copies of public announcements and finan-
cial results are published on the Group’s website, along 
with a number of other investor relations tools.
The Board receives regular updates from the senior 
management team on the views of major shareholders 
and on milestones in the investor relations program. 
We will continue throughout 2018 to grow our investor 
relations program to ensure that our shareholders and 
stakeholders remain informed of the Group’s strategy 
and ongoing financial and business performance.
Annual Reporting and Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders
We typically publish our Annual Report in March in respect of 
the prior year ended 31 December. We voluntarily comply with 
the Code’s requirement to send a Notice of Meeting of an An-
nual General Meeting (AGM) and related papers to sharehold-
ers at least 20 working days prior to the meeting. 
The Group’s second Annual General Meeting as a listed com-
pany will be held in London on 14 May 2018. Shareholders are 
encouraged to attend the AGM and to ask questions about the 
business, its financial performance and its strategy. All Board 
members are scheduled to attend the upcoming AGM. Details 
of the AGM are included in the Notice of Meeting that accompa-
nies this Annual Report and which is available on our website.
At the AGM, all of the Group’s Directors will retire and submit 
themselves for re-election. 
The outcome of the voting at the AGM will be announced by 
way of a London Stock Exchange announcement and full details 
will be published on the Group’ s website shortly after the AGM. 
Limitations of this Report
As I noted earlier, the Group is not bound to adhere to the re-
quirements of the 2016 U.K. Code of Corporate Governance. 
Nevertheless, we have endeavoured to ensure that this An-
nual Report is, as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable.
In formulating this Annual Report, we have called on the 
Group Chief Executive and her senior management staff to 
provide us with clear documentary evidence of the Group’s 
performance and policies for 2017. The Audit Committee has 
confirmed to us that the financial statements as contained in 
the 2017 Annual Report are true and fair and that the work of 
the external auditor has been accurate and effective.

Audit Committee       
Report  
James n olan 
Chairman, Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing IDH’s 
internal financial reporting and ensuring the integrity 
of the Group’s financial statements. The Committee is 
also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the ef-
fectiveness of the Group’s risk management processes 
and internal controls, as well as for ensuring that audit 
processes are robust.
At the date of this report, the Audit Committee comprises 
three Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are considered 
independent. In addition to myself, the members are Dan 
Olsson and Hussein Choucri.
2018 marks my third year as Chairman of the Audit Com-
mittee, having been appointed to that role owing to my 
relevant financial experience as required by the Code. 
I have served on the audit committees of three publicly 
quoted companies in the past. I have held the positions of 
Global Head of Mergers & Acquisitions both at Veon and at 
Royal Philips. I hold an MBA from INSEAD and studied law 
at university. The other members of the Committee have a 
broad range of appropriate skills and experience covering 
financial and healthcare industry matters and their biogra-
phies are summarised on pages 50 and 51. I am very grateful 
for their valuable contributions and am happy that we work 
well together as a team.
During 2017, the Audit Committee convened three times, 
once each in March, August and November. We provided 
governance of external financial reporting, risk manage-
ment and internal controls and reported our findings and 
recommendations to the Board. Outside of scheduled 
committee meetings, the Audit Committee also com-
municated throughout 2017 on an as-needed basis with 
the Group Chief Financial Officer and with KPMG as our 
external auditors.  
The audit partner and audit manager from the Group’s 
external auditor, KPMG, are invited to attend meetings of 
the Committee on a regular basis. During 2017, they at-
tended meetings in whole or in part, both in person and by 
telephone. The Vice-President Finance and Strategy, who is 
not a member of the executive board, attends our meetings 
by invitation, and other members of the senior manage-
ment team attend as required; these include the Director of 
Investor Relations and the Group Secretary. 
There are also private meetings between the Audit Commit-
tee and the external auditor outside the half-year and year 
end timetable at which senior management is not present. 
The Committee will continue with the practice of meeting 
in private with the external auditor in the future.
At our Board Meeting in August 2016, the Audit Com-
mittee approved the Internal Audit Activity Charter 
as well as the appointment of Mr. Ashraf Hallaba as 
Internal Auditor reporting to the Audit Committee. The 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 58 role reports functionally to the Audit Committee and 
administratively to the Chief Executive Officer. Since in-
ception, the Internal Auditor has been building a team, 
writing a manual on operations, reviewing process of 
key functions within the company and discussing the 
same with the company’s management. The Internal 
Auditor delivered his comprehensive risk register on 19 
November 2017, as well as his progress report in setting 
up and establishing his department. It was noted that 
the department was not yet fully staffed and that the 
position of Compliance Officer was not filled. Adequate 
staffing is an essential ingredient of the success of the 
Internal Audit function and is under review.
FRC Audit Quality Review  
The FRC is the UK’s independent regulator responsible 
for promoting high-quality corporate governance and 
reporting to foster investment. The FRC’s responsibilities 
include independent monitoring of audits of listed and 
certain other public interest entities performed by firms 
registered to conduct audits in the UK by a Recognised 
Supervisory Body ( further details are set out on the FRC’s 
website). This monitoring is performed by the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review (‘ AQR’) team. The reviews of individual au-
dit engagements are intended to contribute to safeguard-
ing and promoting improvement in the overall quality of 
auditing in the UK.
Roles and Duties of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist the Board with the 
discharge of its responsibilities in relation to financial re-
porting, including:
•	 reviewing the Group’s annual and half-year financial 
statements;
•	 reviewing the Group’s accounting policies, internal 
and external audits and controls;
•	 reviewing and monitoring the scope of the annual au-
dit and the extent of the non-audit work undertaken 
by external auditors; and 
•	 advising on the appointment of external auditors 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit, 
internal controls, whistleblowing and fraud systems 
in place within the Group.
During its scheduled meetings, the Committee also consid-
ers the following matters:
•	 confirm compliance with Directors’ duties and con-
sider any new conflicts of interest;
•	 review minutes of previous meetings;
•	 review actions from previous meetings; and
•	 review progress against current year objectives.
Audit Committee Activities During 2017
During 2017 the Audit Committee had three scheduled

each scheduled meeting, the Committee considers the 
matters outlined above under the subheading “Roles and 
Duties of the Audit Committee. ”

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  59 Significant Issues
The Committee considered several significant account-
ing issues, matters and judgements in relation to the 
Group’s financial statements and disclosures for the year 
ended 31 December 2017. As part of the half-year and 
full-year reporting process, management communicates 
key accounting issues to the Committee, and the exter-
nal auditor is asked to comment on the key significant 
areas of accounting judgement and disclosure. The infor-
mation presented is used by the Committee to critically 
review and assess the key policies and judgements that 
have been applied, the consistency of policy application 
from year to year and the appropriateness of key disclo-
sures made, together with compliance with the applica-
ble accounting standards. The significant issue arising 
and a description of how it was addressed is shown in the 
following table.
External Auditor
KPMG has acted as the Group’s external auditor since ap-
pointment in July 2015, with Mr. Adrian Wilcox serving 
as audit partner until August 2017, when the role was as-
sumed by Mr. David Neale on behalf of KPMG. The Auditors’ 
independence was considered by the Committee during the 
year and following careful consideration, it was agreed that 
the Auditors remained independent. We aim to comply with 
the requirement to rotate the audit partner every five years, 
and thus the term of appointment of our audit partner is 
expected to end in 2022. 
In acknowledgment of the Competition and Markets Au-
thority’s proposal that companies must put their statutory 
audit engagement out to tender at least every ten years, it 
is possible that we will tender the audit process in 2025, or 
earlier if KPMG’s performance falls short of the Audit Com-
mittee’s expectations.
provision of n on-Audit Services
IDH may, on occasion, retain the external auditor for non-
audit services on matters including accounting advice in 
relation to acquisitions and divestments, corporate govern-
ance and risk management advice, among other services.  
The Audit Committee reviewed the work completed by the 
external auditor, as well as the provision of non-audit servic-
es to ensure that the auditor maintained its independence. 
The Audit Committee confirms that during 2017, £61,500 
was paid to KPMG in respect of non-audit work compared 
to the audit fee for the Group financial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 of £243,500 (audit fee for the 
Group financial statements for the year ended 31 Decem-
ber 2016: £235,000). This non-audit work was related to the 
review of the half year financial statements.
Recommendation
Ultimately, it is the Board’s responsibility to review and 
approve the Group’s full-year and half-year financial state-
ments, as well as to determine that, taken as a whole, the 
Annual Report is balanced, understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy. It is the Audit Committee’s role to assist the 
Board in discharging its responsibilities with regards 
to financial reporting, external and internal audits and 
controls. Following a review of the process around the 
annual audit and the content of the financial statements, 
the Audit Committee advised the Board at its meeting on 
20 March 2018 that is was their opinion that the financial 
statements as at 31 December 2017 provide a true and 
fair view of the financial performance of the Group and 
recommend that it be adopted by the Board and recom-
mended to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that 
the Auditors be put forward for re-election at the forthcom-
ing Annual General Meeting. The Committee arrived at this 
recommendation after having: met with the Audit partner 
and Audit team; reviewed the quality of the Auditors’ 
reports and the quality of the work undertaken in respect 
of the half-yearly and Annual Report; considered the Audit 
fees of both Audit and Non-Audit work; and reviewed the 
Auditors’ independence.

Issue How it is being addressed
Impairment 
of intangible 
assets
The carrying value of goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing undertaken by management, 
who apply a series of assumptions concerning future revenue and cash flows and appropriate discount 
rates for Cash Generating Units (CGU). Management presented the outcome of the impairment review 
to the Audit Committee, highlighting the level of headroom. The external auditor also commented on 
this. The Committee critically reviewed management’s assessment of the outlook and carrying value of 
these intangible assets and their disclosure in the Group’s financial statements. The Committee con-
curred with management’s conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each CGU was 
fully supported, and no impairment is required at 31 December 2017.

Employees
The Group has one (1) Executive Director, namely Group 
Chief Executive Dr. Hend El Sherbini, as identified in the 
Corporate Governance section. Her biographical informa-
tion appears on page 50 of this Annual Report, and her 
compensation is reported in the Remuneration Committee 
Report on page 63. IDH has service agreements with the 
Group Chief Executive and with the Group Chief Financial 
Officer, Mr. Omar Bedewy, who is not a Company Direc-
tor. Dr. Hend El Sherbini leads the Company’s Executive 
Committee, which also includes all heads of departments 
and meets every second week to review and discuss per-
formance, priorities and upcoming events in light of the 
Group’s strategic plan. In view of the Company’s regional 
growth plans, IDH is committed to building out its senior 
management team in preparation for a larger footprint. The 
Group and its subsidiaries had total of 4,739 (2016: 4,688) 
employees as of 31 December 2017 employed in Egypt, 
Jordan and Sudan.
Creditor payment policy
Individual subsidiaries of the Group are responsible for 
agreeing on the terms and conditions under which busi-
ness transactions with their suppliers are conducted. It is 
the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in 
accordance with all relevant terms and conditions. 
post-Balance Sheet Events
In a transaction that closed in January 2018, IDH formed 
a joint venture with Man Capital LLC (“Man Capital”), the 
London-based investment arm of the Mansour Group, 
called Dynasty Holding Group (“Dynasty”), which is 51% 
owned and controlled by IDH. In turn, Dynasty has part-
nered with the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) 
to invest in Eagle Eye Echo-Scan Limited (“Echo-Scan”), a 
leading medical diagnostics business based in Nigeria. 
Going Concern
Having made enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to meet 
its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of these consolidated financial statements. 
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 66 preparing the financial information. The Group’s business 
activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Review on pages 02 to 45. The financial position 
of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrow-
ing facilities are described in the financial statements and 
notes thereon on pages 68 to 113.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual 
report and the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (“IFRS as adopted by the EU”), interpretations 
from the International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (“IFRIC”) and Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 
(as amended). Jersey Law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year, which give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group for that year. 
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
comparable, understandable and prudent;
•	 ensure that the financial statements comply with 
IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going con-
cern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that 
the Group will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper ac-
counting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the parent company and 
to enable them to ensure that the financial statements com-
ply with Jersey Law. The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. The Directors are also responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website on 
the internet. However, information is accessible in many 
different countries where legislation governing the prepa-
ration and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from that applicable in the United Kingdom and Jersey. 
The Directors of the Group confirm that to the best of their 
knowledge that:
•	 The consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards, including International Ac-
counting Standards; and Interpretations adopted by 
the International Accounting Standards Board give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole; and
•	 The sections of this Report, including the Chairman’s 
Statement, Strategic Report, Financial Review and 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties, which constitute 
the management report, include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with 
a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
So far as each person who was a Director at the date of 
approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information, being information needed by the auditor in 
connection with preparing its report, of which the audi-
tor is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow Directors 
and the Group’s auditors, each Director has taken all the 
steps that he/she is obliged to take as a Director in order 
to have made himself/herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of 
that information.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The 2018 AGM will be held at the Hilton London Tower 
Bridge on 14 May 2018 at 11:00 am BST, London, UK.
The Chairman of the Board and of each of the Board’s Com-
mittees as well as all company Directors will be in attend-
ance at the AGM to answer questions from shareholders. 
During the AGM, all of the Group’s Directors will retire and 
submit themselves for re-election. 
Auditor
KPMG LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in of-
fice as auditor and separate resolutions will be proposed at 
the forthcoming AGM concerning their reappointment and 
to authorise the Board to agree their remuneration.

nancial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in

related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2.  
In our opinion the financial statements:  
– give a true and fair view, in accordance with Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for 
the year then ended; and
– have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with Interna-
tional Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and 
applicable law.  Our responsibilities are described below.  
We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and 
are independent of the Company in accordance with, UK 
ethical requirements including FRC Ethical Standard as 
applied to  listed entities.  We believe that the audit evi-
dence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 70 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.  In arriving at our audit opinion above, the key audit matters were as follows 
[(unchanged from [2016)]:  
t he risk our response
Recoverability of goodwill and 
indefinite life brand intangible 
assets 
(EGP1,640million; 2016: 
EGP1,644million)
Refer to page 58 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 86 (accounting policy) 
and page 100 ( financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Each of the  CGU’s operate within 
a market subject to high degrees of 
competition, price inflation and cost 
rises which provide market challenges.
Recoverability of the goodwill and 
brand names intangible asset is subject 
to judgement in terms of the assump-
tions used and inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting the future cash 
flows that are used in the Group’s 
discounted cash flow models, in 
particular in respect of revenue growth 
(i.e. patient numbers and price) and 
discount rate. This is a key judgemental 
area that our audit is concentrated on.
Our procedures included: 
– Historical comparison: assessing 
the reasonableness of the Group’s 
forecasting by comparing actual 
performance for the year against 
forecasts for the same period in the 
prior year model;
– Benchmarking assumptions: 
evaluating the Group‘s assumptions 
included within the discounted 
cash flow forecasts by comparing 
key inputs such as projected 
growth, cost inflation and discount 
rates to internally and externally 
derived data;
– Sector expertise: We used our own 
valuation specialist to assist us in 
evaluating the assumptions and 
methodology used in calculating 
the discount rate;
– Sensitivity analysis: performing 
sensitivity analysis on the assump-
tions noted above; and
– Assessing transparency: assessing 
whether the group's disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome 
of the impairment assessment 
to changes in key assumptions 
reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill.
IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017  71 3.  our application of materiality 
and an overview of the scope  
of our audit 
Materiality for the group financial statements as a 
whole was set at EGP25m (2016: EGP 20m), deter-
mined with reference to a benchmark of group profit 
before tax, of which it represents 4.5% (2016: 5%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any cor-
rected or uncorrected identified misstatements ex-
ceeding EGP1.2m (2016: EGP1m), in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.  
Of the group’s 11 (2016: 11) reporting components, 
we subjected 6 (2016: 6) to full scope audits for 
group reporting purposes and 3 (2016: 3) to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not 
individually financially significant enough to require 
an full scope audit for group reporting purposes, 
but did present specific individual risk that needed 
to be addressed. For the residual 2 components, we 
performed analysis at an aggregated group level to 
re-examine our assessment that there were no signifi-
cant risks of material misstatement within these.
The components within the scope of our work ac-
counted for the percentages illustrated opposite. 
The Group team instructed the component auditors 
as to the significant areas to be covered, including 
the relevant risks detailed above and the informa-
tion to be reported back. The Group team approved 
component materialities which in the ranged from 
EGP2.2m to EGP8m (2016: EGP0.9m to EGP 7.5m), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components. The work on 7 of 
the 9 components (2016: 7 of the 9 components) was 
performed by component auditors and the rest was 
performed by the Group team. 
The Group team visited the 6 (2016: 6) components, 
all in the same location, in Egypt on multiple occa-
sions, including to assess the audit risk and strategy 
and to attend a clearance meeting. T elephone confer-
ence meetings were also held with this component 
auditor and with the component auditor in Jordan 
component that was not physically visited.. At these 
visits and meetings, the findings reported to the 
Group team were discussed in more detail, and any 
further work required by the Group team was then 
performed by the component auditor.

IDH ANNUAl REPORT 2017 72 4.  We have nothing to report on going 
concern   
We are required to report to you if we have concluded 
that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is 
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material un-
certainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of 
that basis for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date of approval of the financial statements.  We have 
nothing to report in these respects.  
5.  We have nothing to report on the other 
information in the Annual Report     
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the finan-
cial statements.  Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assur-
ance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether, based on our financial state-
ments audit work, the information therein is materially 
misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our audit knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have not 
identified material misstatements in the other information. 
6.  We have nothing to report on the other 
matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 proper accounting records have not been kept by the 
Company, or
•	 proper returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
•	 the Company’s accounts are not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns; or
•	 we have not received all the information and explana-
tions we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 . Respective responsibilities    
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 
67, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the 
financial statements including being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error; assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to go-
ing concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue our opinion in an auditor’ s report.  Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an au-
dit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of the financial statements
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8.  t he purpose of our audit work and to whom 
we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those mat-
ters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions 
we have formed.

IDH annual re Por t 2017 78 Integrated Diagnostics Holdings plc – “IDH” and 
its subsidiaries
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Integrated Diagnostics Holdings plc and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorized for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 20 
March 2018. Integrated Diagnostics Holdings plc “IDH” or “the company” has been established according to the provisions 
of the Companies (Jersey) law 1991 under No. 117257.
IDH’s purpose is not restricted and the Group has full authority to do any activity as long as it is not banned by the Compa-
nies law unless amended from time to time or depending on the Companies (Jersey) law.
The Group’s financial year starts on 1 January and ends on 31 December each year. The Group’s main activity is concen-
trated in the field of medical diagnostics.
2. Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (adopted IFRS) issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) and the Jersey Law 1991 an amendment to which means separate company financial statements 
are not required. 
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except where adopted IFRS mandates 
that fair value accounting is required.
Functional and presentation currency
Each of the Group’s entities is using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the 
functional currency’). The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Egyptian Pounds, being the report-
ing currency of the main Egyptian trading subsidiaries within the Group and the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial 
statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation 
and on disposal of a foreign operation; the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises 
from using this method.
Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. At 31 December 2017, the Group 
had net assets amounting to EGP 2,314,090. The Group is profitable and cash generative and the Directors have considered 
the Group’s cash forecasts for a period of 12 months from the signing of the balance sheet. The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of these condensed consolidated annual financial statements. Thus, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial information.
2.1 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31 Decem-
ber 2017. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  79 Financial Statements
i. Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. 
The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even 
if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
ii. Change in subsidiary ownership and loss of control
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transac-
tions. Where the group loses control of a subsidiary, the assets and liabilities are derecognised along with any related NCI 
and other components of equity.  Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.  Any interest retained in the 
former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
iii. Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the invest-
ment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
2.2 Significant accounting policies
Except for the changes below, the accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years pre-
sented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group has adopted the following new standard, including any inconsequential amendments to other standards, with 
a date of initial application of 1 January 2017.
•	 Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2014-2016 Cycle
•	 Disclosure initiative – amendment to IAS 7
•	 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses – Amendments to IAS 12    
This new standard had a non-material impact on these consolidated financial statements.
a) Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classifica-
tion and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as 
at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Finan-
cial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the 
statement of profit or loss. And when it is classified as equity it should not be remeasured and accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
IDH annual re Por t 2017 80 recognised for non-controlling interests) and any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. 
If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses 
whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures 
used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the 
fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing which it is done one an annual basis, goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when deter-
mining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of 
the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
b) Fair value measurement
The Group measures financial instruments such as non-derivative financial instruments, available-for-sale financial assets 
and contingent consideration assumed in a business combination, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair value 
is categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:
•	 Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
•	 Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
directly or indirectly observable
•	 Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group deter-
mines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing 
categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained above.
The fair value less any estimated credit adjustments for financial assets and liabilities with maturity dates less than one 
year is assumed to approximate their carrying value.   The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is esti-
mated by discounting the future contracted cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for 
similar transactions.
c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the value of medical diagnostic services rendered in the year, and is stated net of discounts. The Group 
has two types of customers: Walk-in patients and patients served under contract. For patients under contract, rates are 
agreed in advance on a per-test, client-by-client basis.
For both types of customers, revenue is recognized on completion of the services rendered. Revenue is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured, 
regardless of when the payment is received.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  81 Financial Statements
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined 
terms of payment and excluding taxes or duty.
d) Leases
i. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease.
At inception or on reassessment of an arrangement that contains a lease, the Group separates out payments and other con-
sideration required by the arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair 
values. If the Group concludes for a finance lease that it is impractical to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a 
liability are recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset; subsequently, the liability is reduced as 
payments are made and an imputed finance cost on the liability is recognised using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.
ii. Leased assets
Assets held by the Group under leases that transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership 
are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the assets are accounted for in 
accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Assets held under other leases are classified as operating 
leases and are not recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position.
iii. Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. Minimum 
lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the out-
standing liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
e) Income Taxes
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i. Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carry-
ing amounts in the consolidated financial statements. 
However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income 
tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any 
unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can 
be utilised. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax 
liability is settled.
IDH annual re Por t 2017 82 f) Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency 
spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Egyptian Pounds at the rate of ex-
change prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at average rate (unless this 
average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which 
case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions). The exchange differences arising on 
translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve or 
NCI as the case may be. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that 
particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at 
the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.
g) Property, plant and equipment
All property and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Historical cost includes expendi-
ture that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can 
be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the consolidated statement of income during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Land is not depreciated.  
Laboratory Equipment held to perform the ‘Hub spoke’ at the Mega Lab and provided under finance lease arrangements 
are depreciated under a unit of production method as this most closely reflects the consumption of benefits from the 
equipment.  
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their 
residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Buildings 50 years
Medical, electric and information systems equipment 4-10 years
Leasehold improvements 4-5 years
Fixtures, fittings & vehicles 4-16 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater 
than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amount and are recognized within ‘Other (losses)/gains – net’ in the consolidated statement of income.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  83 Financial Statements
h) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired 
in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, 
excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the 
period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there 
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an 
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to 
modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amor-
tisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category 
that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. The Group amortises intangible assets with finite lives using 
the straight-line method over the following periods:
IT development and software 4-5 years
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually 
or at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefi-
nite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over interest 
in net fair value of the net identifiable assets,liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill ac-
quired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs, that is 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated 
represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. the 
impairment assessment is done one an annual basis.
Brand  
Brand names acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and have an 
indefinite useful life. 
i. Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
i. Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and re-
ceivables, AFS financial assets, as appropriate. All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of 
financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established 
by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the 
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
IDH annual re Por t 2017 84 Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories:
•	 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
•	 Loans and receivables
•	 Available for sale (“ AFS”) financial assets
The Group did not hold financial assets classified as financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss or AFS financial 
assets at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method (“EIR”), less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or 
premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance 
income in the statement of profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss in finance costs for loans and in cost of sales or other operating expenses for receivables.
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:
•	 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired
Or
•	 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the 
received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) 
the Group has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards 
of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass- through arrange-
ment, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues 
to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an 
associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and 
obligations that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the origi-
nal carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
Impairment of financial assets
Further disclosures relating to impairment of financial assets are also provided in the following notes:
•	 Disclosures for significant estimates and assumptions  Note 2.3
•	Financial assets      Note 14
•	Trade receivables      Note 16
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial 
assets is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset 
(an incurred ‘loss event’), has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial 
assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debt-
ors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability 
that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and observable data indicating that there is a measurable 
decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  85 Financial Statements
ii. Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of 
directly attributable transaction costs.
All of the Group’s financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method.  The Group does not use derivative financial instruments or hedge account for any transactions. Unless otherwise 
indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, finance lease liabilities and loans and borrowings 
including bank overdrafts.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When 
an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms 
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the 
original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss.
iii.	 Offsetting	of	financial	instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on 
a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
j)	 Impairment	of	non-financial	assets
Further disclosures relating to impairment of non-financial assets are also provided in the following notes:
•	 Disclosures for significant assumptions and estimates   Note 2.3
•	 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives   Note 13
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication 
exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The 
recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair 
value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified, an 
appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for 
publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for 
each of the Group’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover 
a period of five years. A long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in expense categories consistent with 
the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to other comprehensive 
income (“OCI”). For such properties, the impairment is recognised in OCI up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication 
that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. 
IDH annual re Por t 2017 86 If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impair-
ment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not 
exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss 
unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 October and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which 
the goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as at 31 October at the CGU level, as ap-
propriate, and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Assets that are subject to amortisation 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes 
of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows (CGU). 
Prior impairments of non-financial assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
k) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net 
realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated selling and distribution expenses.
l) Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term 
deposits with a maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, 
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management. 
m) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is prob-
able that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for exam-
ple, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is 
virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when 
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of 
time is recognised as a finance cost.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The 
increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
n)	 Pensions	and	other	post-employment	benefits
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The 
Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to 
pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Obligations for contributions 
to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which 
services are rendered by employees.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  87 Financial Statements
o) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance 
of the operating segments, has been identified as the steering committee that makes strategic decisions.
2.3 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions
New and amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendments that have been issued but not yet 
effective for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
None of these are expected to have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements of the Group, except for the 
following which could change the classification and measurements of financial assets.
•	 IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” (expected effective date of January 2018).
•	 IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (effective date of January 2019) introduces an on balance sheet accounting model for operating 
leases. The Group has significant operating lease commitments through the lease of branches and is anticipated to 
have a material effect when these arrangements are required to be brought on balance sheet.
Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 
IFr S 15
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 15 Revenue From Contracts With Customers From 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ sets out the principles for the measurement and recognition of revenue 
and will replace IAS 18. The standard provides a five step model to determine when an entity should recognise revenue 
and at what amount, by allocation of the transaction price to separate performance obligations. The Group has two types 
of customer: walk-in patients and patients served under contract. For patients served under contract, rates are agreed 
in advance on a per-test, client-by-client basis. For both types of customer, revenue is recognized on completion of the 
services rendered.
The Group’s services are provided a point in time rather than over a period of time and there are stand alone sales prices 
per test stipulated in the contracts that exist with selected customers.
The Group considers the current basis of revenue recognition to remain appropriate as the only performance obligation, being 
completion of a test, reflects the current policy. Therefore the Group considers that the initial application IFRS 15 will have no 
impact on its consolidated financial statements based on the assessment undertaken to date, however the Group may enter 
into contracts in the near future that would be accounted for differently under IFRS 15 than the existing standards.
IFr S9
The Group is required to adopt IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ sets out the requirements for recognizing, classifying and measuring financial assets and 
financial liabilities and includes guidance in respect of general hedge accounting. This standard replaces IAS 39 and sets 
out two key criteria for determining the classification and measurement of financial assets including the entity’s business 
model for managing financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 also sets out a single impairment 
model to ensure expected credit losses on financial instruments are always recognized as soon as they are forecast. In 
relation to hedge accounting, IFRS 9 adopts a principles-based approach for testing hedge effectiveness instead of setting 
specific numerical thresholds.
The Group has made an initial assessment of the impact that the initial application of IFRS 9 will have on its consolidated 
Financial statement by considering the level of loss experienced from customers across the portfolio at a macro level. The 
financial impact of this assessment is an adjustment (net of tax) to the opening balance of the Group’s equity at 1 January 
2018 of EGP 2.5 m due to the recognition of an impairment charge for the expected credit loss of trade receivables. The 
final impact of adopting the standard at 1 January 2018 may change because the Group is in the process of undertaking an 
extensive exercise to assess the credit loss on a customer basis, which has not been finalised. 
IDH annual re Por t 2017 88 Additionally, the testing and assessment of controls over new IT systems has not been complete. It is not expected that the 
impact of the final assessment will be materially different.
The total estimated adjustment (net of tax) to the opening balance of the Group’s equity at 1 January 2018 is EGP 2.5 m due 
to the recognition of an impairment charge for the expected credit loss of trade receivables.
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management 
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and li-
abilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment 
to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
Other disclosures relating to the Group’s exposure to risks and uncertainties includes:
•	Capital management     Note 4
•	 Financial instruments risk management and policies  Note 14
•	 Sensitivity analyses disclosures     Notes 14
Judgments
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management have made a material judgment, that affect the ap-
plication of the Group’s lease accounting policy and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses. Information 
about judgment, estimate and assumptions relating to finance leases are set out in note 26.
Estimates and assumptions
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the 
consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, 
however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such 
changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives have suffered any impairment. Im-
pairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have 
been determined based on value in use. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model. The 
cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is 
not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the CGU being tested. 
The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the DCF model as well as the expected future cash-inflows 
and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.
Impairment of trade and notes receivables
The requirement for impairment of trade receivables is made through monitoring the debts aging and reviewing customer’s 
credit position and their ability to make payment as they fall due. An impairment is recorded against receivables for the 
irrecoverable amount estimated by management. At the year end, the provision for impairment of trade receivables was 
EGP 21,784K (31 December 2016: EGP 19,154k).
3. Segment information
The Group is viewed as a single operating segment, as the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews the 
internal management reports and KPIs of the Group as whole and not at a further aggregated level. 
The Group operates in three geographic areas, Egypt, Sudan and Jordan. Each area offers similar services and the KPIs of 
each are viewed to be the same and they are not viewed as individual operating segments. The revenue split between the 
three regions is set out below.

4 Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order 
to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The repatriation of a declared dividend from Egyptian group entities are subject to regulation by Egyptian authorities. The 
outcome of an Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders declaring a dividend is first certified by the General Authority for 
Investment and Free Zones (GAFI). 
Approval is subsequently transmitted to Misr for Central Clearing, Depository and Registry (MCDR) to distribute dividends to 
all shareholders, regardless of their domicile, following notification of shareholders via publication in one national newspapers.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt to equity ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total 
equity. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities (being total current liabilities plus long-term financial obligations) less cash 
and cash equivalents. 
As a provider of medical diagnostic services, IDH’s operations in Sudan are not subject to sanctions.

* Undistributed reserves from group subsidiaries
IDH annual re Por t 2017 96 The Group’s dividend policy is to distribute any excess cash after taking into consideration all business cash requirements 
and potential acquisition considerations. The expectation is to distribute profits held within subsidiaries of the Group in 
the near foreseeable future. During 2015 the Egyptian Government imposed a tax on dividends at a rate of 5% of dividends 
distributed from Egyptian entities. As a result a deferred tax liability has been recorded for the future tax expected to be 
incurred from undistributed reserves held within the Group which will be taxed under the new legislation imposed and

The Group performed its annual impairment test in October 2017. The Group considers the relationship between its mar -
ket capitalisation and its book value, among other factors, when reviewing for indicators of impairment.
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations and sensitivity to changes in assumptions 
IDH instructed FinCorp Investment Holding (referred to hereafter as “Fincorp”) an independent financial advisor, to pre-
pare an independent impairment assessment of the Group’s CGUs. The assessment was carried out based on business 
plans provided by IDH.  These plans have been prepared based on criteria set out below: 
Ultra	Lab Bio Lab Al-Mokhtabar Al-Borg
Average annual patient growth rate 
from 2018 -2022

Discount rate 25.8% 15.4% 19.58% 19.58%
IDH annual re Por t 2017 100 Fincorp has prepared discounted cash flow projections using the key assumptions above so as to be able to calculate the 
net present value of the asset in use and determine the recoverable amount. The projected cash flows from 2018- 2022 have 
been based on detailed forecasts prepared by management for each CGU and a terminal value thereafter. Management 
have used past experience and historic trends achieved in order to determine the key growth rate and margin assumptions 
set out above. The terminal value growth rate applied is not considered to exceed the average growth rate for the industry 
and geographic locations of the CGUs. 
This recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying value of the asset as recorded in the books and records of IDH 
plc.  The discount rate is the pre-tax rate taking into account the risks of each CGU. 
These risks include country risk, currency risk as well as the beta factor relating to the CGU and how it performs relative 
to the market. 
Based on the sensitivity analysis, A 1% change in the WACC would result in a 5-7% change in the valuation of the CGU. 
The conclusions from the impairment review were that there was headroom within the forecasts and therefore no impair-
ment is required.

Financial instruments risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial liabilities are trade and other payables, put option liability and finance lease liabilities. The 
Group’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that derive directly 
from its operations.
The Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on 
the unpredictability of markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The 
Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies 
for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. 
IDH annual re Por t 2017  101 Financial Statements
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, 
such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative 
financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity 
price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings and deposits.    
The sensitivity analyses in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 December in 2017 and 2016. The sensitivity 
analyses have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt 
and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on: the carrying values of pension and other post-
retirement obligations; provisions; and the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.The following assump-
tions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analyses:
•	 The sensitivity of the relevant statement of profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market 
risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2017 and 2016.
•	 The sensitivity of equity is calculated by considering the effect of any associated cash flow hedges and hedges of a net 
investment in a foreign subsidiary at 31 December 2017 for the effects of the assumed changes of the underlying risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 50 and 55% of this interest rate risk exposure is at a fixed rate. This is 
achieved partially by entering into fixed-rate instrument and partly by borrowing at the floating rate. 
Exposure to interest rate risk
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the group 
is as follow:
2017
EGP’000
2016
EGP’000
Fixed-rate instruments
Finance lease liabilities (note 26) 117,714 151,799
Variable-rate instruments 60,763 -
Loan and borrowings (note 24)
The Group does not account for any fixed-rate financial liabilities at FVTPL. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the 
reporting date would not affect profit or loss. 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments
A reasonable possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) 
profit or loss by the amounts EGP 779K. This analysis assumes that all other variables, remain constant. 
IDH annual re Por t 2017 102 Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in 
foreign exchange rates. 
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the US Dollar, Sudanese Pound and the Jordanian Dinar. Foreign exchange risk arises from to 
the Group’s operating activities (when revenue or expense is denominated in a foreign currency), recognized assets and 
liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. However, the management aims to minimize open positions in foreign 
currencies to the extent that is necessary to conduct its activities.
Management has set up a policy to require group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional 
currency. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets or liabilities are denomi-
nated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
At year end, major financial assets / (liabilities) denominated in foreign currencies were as follows (the amounts presented

EGP (8.4m)), mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of JOD - denominated financial assets and 
liabilities. The effect on equity would have been an increase/decrease by EGP 8m due to the impact from translation of 
foreign subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2017, if the Egyptian Pounds had weakened / strengthened by 10% against the Sudanese Pound with 
all other variables held constant, pre-tax profit for the year would have been increased / decreased by EGP 1.7m (2016: 
EGP 1.8m, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/losses on translation of SDG -denominated financial assets and 
liabilities. The effect on equity would have been an increase/decrease by EGP 1.1m due to the impact from translation of 
foreign subsidiaries.
Price risk
The group does not have investments in equity securities or bonds and accordingly is not exposed to price risk related to 
the change in the fair value of the investments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and 
from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and 
other financial instruments. 
Credit risk is managed on a group basis, except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances. Each local entity is 
responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard payment and delivery 
terms and conditions are offered. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and 
deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables 
and committed transactions. 
IDH annual re Por t 2017 104 For banks and financial institutions, the Group is only dealing with the banks which have a high independent rating and a 
good reputation.
Trade receivables
Each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk man-
agement manages customer credit risk. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an individual credit limits are 
defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored and the average 
general credit terms given to contract customers are 45 days.
An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis for major clients. In addition, a large 
number of minor receivables are grouped into homogenous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. The calcula-
tion is based on actual incurred historical data. The Group does not hold collateral as security.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed 
in Note 16. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accord-
ance with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit 
limits assigned to each counterparty. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the Group’s Board of Directors on an 
annual basis, and may be updated throughout the year subject to approval of the Group’s management. The limits are set 
to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through a counterparty’s potential failure to 
make payments.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents disclosed in Note 17.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of finance 
leases and loans.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’ s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:
Year ended 31 December 2017 1 year or less 1 to 5 years more than 5 years Total

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and aggregated by group finance. Group finance 
monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. 
Such forecasting takes into consideration the group’s compliance with internal financial position ratio targets and, if ap-
plicable external regulatory or legal requirements – for example, currency restrictions.

Capital reserve
The capital reserve was created when the Group’s previous parent company, Integrated Diagnostics Holdings LLC – IDH 
(Caymans) arranged its own acquisition by Integrated Diagnostics Holdings PLC, a new legal parent. The balances arising 
represent the difference between the value of the equity structure of the previous and new parent companies. When the 
capital position of the parent company is rearranged, the capital reserve is adjusted appropriately such that the equity 
balances presented in the Group accounts best reflect the underlying structure of the Group’s capital base.
Legal reserves
Legal reserve was formed based on the legal requirements of the Egyptian law governing the Egyptian subsidiaries. Ac-
cording to the Egyptian subsidiaries’ article of association 5% (at least) of the annual net profit is set aside to from a legal 
reserve. The transfer to legal reserve ceases once this reserve reaches 50% of the entity’s issued capital. If the reserve falls 
below the defined level, then the entity is required to resume forming it by setting aside 5% of the annual net profits until it 
reaches 50% of the issued share capital.  
Put option reserve 
Through acquisitions made within the Group, put option arrangements have been entered into to purchase the remaining 
equity interests in subsidiaries from the vendors at a subsequent date. At acquisition date an initial put option liability is 
recognised and a corresponding entry recognised within the put option reserve. After initial recognition the accounting 
policy for put options is to recognise all changes in the carrying value of the liability within put option reserve. When the 
put option is exercised by the vendors the amount recognised within the reserve will be reversed.
Translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries, including gains or losses arising on net investment hedges.

The accounting policy for put options after initial recognition is to recognise all changes in the carring value of the put 
liability within equity. 
Through the historic acquisitions of Makhbariyoun Al Arab the Group entered into separate put option arrangements to 
purchase the remaining equity interests from the vendors at a subsequent date. At acquisition a put option liability has 
been recognised for the net present value for the exercise price of the option.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  109 Financial Statements
The options are exercisable in whole from the fifth anniversary of completion of the original purchase agreement, which fell 
due in June 2016. The vendor has not exercised this right at 31 December 2017.

The Group entered into 2 significant agreements during the prior year ended 31 December 2015 to service the Group’s new 
state-of-the-art Mega Lab.Both agreements have minimum annual commitment payments to cover the supply of medical 
diagnostic equipment, kits and chemicals to be used for testing and ongoing maintenance and support services over the 
term of the agreement. The agreement periods are 5 and 8 years which is deemed to reflect the useful life of the equipment. 
If the minimum annual commitment payments are met over the agreement period ownership of the equipment supplied 
will legally transfer to the IDH. Management fully expect to be able to fulfil the minimum payments and the basis of treating 
the proportion of payments relating to the supply of equipment as a finance lease.
IDH annual re Por t 2017  111 Financial Statements
Management have performed a fair value exercise in order to allocate payments between the different elements of the ar-
rangements and identify the implicit interest rate of the finance lease. Due to the difficulty in reliably splitting the payments 
for the supply of medical equipment from the total payments made, the finance asset and liability has been recognised at 
an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying equipment. This is based on the current cost price of the equipment 
supplied provided by the suppliers of the agreement. The implicit interest rate of both finance leases has been estimated 
to be 11.5%. The equipment is being depreciated based on units of production method as this most closely reflects the 
consumption of the benefits from the equipment.
Both agreements have been judged to be US$ denominated due to the future minimum lease payments for the use of the 
equipment and corresponding finance lease liability being directly connected to the US$. 
Contingent liabilities
There are no contingent liabilities relating to the group’s transactions and commitment with banks.
