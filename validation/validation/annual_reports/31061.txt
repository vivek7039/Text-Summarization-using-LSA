Strategic Report
Why We Exist
Conference calls have 
become an important 
facet of everyday business, 
now accounting for 50%
(1)
 
of all voice communication. 
And yet after 30 years 
of innovation, nearly 
70% of enterprise users 
are still dialling in with 
phone numbers and 
access codes
(2)
. They’re 
not using any software at 
all for a better experience.
Thetime-wastingfrustrationsof
dial-inarealltoofamiliar:“That
accesscodeisn’trecognised.”
“Whojustjoined?”“Whoisitwith
allthebackgroundnoise?”Notto
mentionthesecurityconnotations.
Researchshowsthatpeoplewaste
anaverageof15minutesonatypical
conferencecallgettingthingsstarted
ordealingwithdistractionsthroughout.
Thatequatestomorethan£26bnof
timewasted
(3)
intheUKandUSalone.
Sowhydoesdial-inprevail?Certainly,
it’snotbecausedial-inprovidesa
betterexperience.Theanswerliesin
thewaypeopletendtoadoptsoftware.
Formost,thisisaprocessoftrialand
errorovertime.Ashostofaremote
meeting,however,you’reliveinthe’hot
seat’withmultipleguests.Thesituation
simplyisn’tconducivetotrial-and-
error-basedlearning.Thelastthing
youwantisforanythingtogowrong.
Dial-inmaywellbeapoorexperience,
butit’sthesafebet.Plentyoffeature-
richsoftwareproductshavetried
todragconferencingoutofthe
‘darkages’.Andthey’vehadsome
successwithtech-savvyearly
adoptersandspecialistusergroups,
suchasITandTrainingteams.
But,nonehave‘crossedthechasm’
intothemajorityofprofessionalswho
areintimidatedratherthanimpressed
bytheirbellsandwhistles.Asaresult,
mostuserscontinuetoplayitsafe,
trudgingonwiththepoorerexperience
ofdial-in.ITdecision-makers
remainfrustratedaswell,payingfor
softwarelicencesthatgounused.

to its product strategy 
and design.
LoopUpisapremiumremotemeetings
solutionspecificallydesignedfor
themajorityofprofessionals–the
risk-aversemainstream,whoneed
somethingthatjustworks.We
thinkthisisessentialifyou’reto
enticethe70%awayfromdial-in.
LoopUpdoesn’toverwhelmusers
withfeaturesandbelieves‘less

creatingafirstimpression,negotiating
adeal,orconnectingwithcolleagues,
LoopUpkeepsyoufocusedonthe
businessathand,notthemeeting.
LoopUpisasoftware-as-a-service
productofferedonbothpay-as-you-
go(PAYG)andmonthlysubscription
licencebasis.LoopUptargets

Our innovative Pod structure
Our Pods
LoopUp ‘Pods’ structure 
is central to the way 
in which we conduct 
our new business 
acquisition activities. 
Each Pod is comprised 
of a six-person team 
working as one unit, 
toward a common 
goal: three business 
development associates, 
two sales executives, 
and one account 
management executive.
Theyworktosharedprocessesand
metricsandareincentivizedsolelyas
ateamonthebasisofnewrecurring
revenuebroughtintothebusiness.
Podmembersarerecruitedexclusively
withnopriorsalesexperienceand
aretrainedintensivelytoLoopUp
methodsandpromotedupthrough
theteamastheyperform.
Unliketraditionalcommercialstructures,
thePodmake-uppromotesefficiency
betweenbusinessdevelopment,sales
andaccountmanagementactivities.
Itdrivesacollaborative‘bestfoot
forward’cultureandisalsorela-
tivelyself-policing.Podsarehighly
scalableand,alongwithourproduct

Formorethan15years,wehavebeen
workingtoeasethecommonfrustrations
oftheeverydaydial-inconferencecall.
Intheworldofremotemeetings,adding
valueusuallymeansslashingpricesor
introducingalaundrylistofspecialist

anexperiencethatexceedsexpectations
andthatyoucancountonwithoutfail.
And,welooktodeliverthisexperience
throughouteveryaspectofourservice,
in everydepartment,acrosseveryregion.
Weareateamofself-starting

Continued, strong and efficient growth
Chief Executive Officers’ Statement  
and Strategic Performance
We are pleased to report 
another period of robust 
business performance 
during financial year 
2017, maintaining our 
track record of 
consistently strong and

Looking ahead into 2018, we continue to see 
strong demand for the LoopUp product and  
we remain confident in our ability to deliver 
future growth.
Steve Flavell and Michael Hughes
Onaconstantcurrencybasis,LoopUp
Revenue(excludingthediscontinued
BTtechnologylicensingrevenues
of£0.7minFY2016)grewby33.5%
inFY2017,comparedto31%ineach

grossmarginimprovedby220basis

by161%to£3.5m,anddilutedEPS
growingby722%to4.4pence.
Ourperformancecontinuestobe
drivenbybothourdifferentiated
competitivepositioningandour
efficientandscalableteam-based
‘Pods’organisationalstructurefornew
businessacquisition,eachofwhich
isdiscussedingreaterdetailbelow.
Market positioning and 
competitive strategy
AttheheartoftheGroup’sconsistent
andefficientgrowthisourmarket
positioningandcompetitivestrategy.
Arecentsurveyof1,000frequent
conferencecallers,commissioned
byLoopUp,showedthat68percent
ofenterpriseconferencecallersare
still‘diallingin’tocallswithphone
numbersandaccesscodes.They’re
notusinganysoftwareatallfor
abettermeetingexperience.
Thisseemstoflyinthefaceoftheall
toocommontime-wastingfrustrations
associatedwithdial-inconferencing:
“Thataccesscodeisn’trecognised.”
“Whojustjoined?”“Whoisitwith
allthebackgroundnoise?”
Respondentsthoughtthat15 minutes
werewastedonatypicalcallgetting
themeetingstartedanddealing
withdistractions.That’smore
thanathirdofthetimetheworld
spendsonconferencecalls.
Thesecurityconnotationsarearguably
moreconcerningstill.Overhalfofthe
respondentsconsidereditquitenormal
nottoknowexactlywho’sontheir
conferencecalls.Withtheexperience
clearlysofarfromperfect,whydo
themajoritypersistwithdial-inrather
thanembracingsoftwarealternatives
thatmightofferabetterexperience?
Theanswer,LoopUpbelieves,lies
inthewaypeopletendtoadopt
software.Formost,thisisaprocessof
trialanderrorovertime.Ashostofa
remotemeeting,however,you’relive
inthe’hotseat’withmultipleguests.
Itsimplyisn’tconducivetotrial-and-
error-basedlearning.Thelastthing
youwantisforanythingtogowrong,
andwhiledial-inmaywellbeapoor
experience,atleastpeopleareusedto
it.Everyonecandialaphonenumber
andpunchinanaccesscode.
We don’t overwhelm 
users with features 
and believe ‘less is 
more’ when it comes 
to remote meetings. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

‘whojustjoined’and‘who’sspeaking.’
Finally,dial-incanfadeintothe

ofvisibilityandsecuritytolight.
Continued efficient growth
OurPodshavecontinuedtooperate

TheGrouphasmaintaineditslowgross

LoopUp revenue growth
+36%
FY2017:£17.5m 
A year of excellent progress
CFO’s Review
2017 was a year of 
excellent progress for 
LoopUp. The continued 
strong growth of our 
business combined with 
improved profitability has 
ensured that the business 
is in a strong position 
as we go into 2018. 
LoopUpRevenue(excludingthe
discontinued BT technology licensing 
revenuesof£0.7minFY2016)grew
by36%inFY2017to£17.5m,which
wasaheadofmarketexpectations
despiteasecondhalfcurrency
headwindwhichsawsterlingaverage
$1.32,upfrom$1.23atthestartof
theyear.Constantcurrencyrevenue
growthwas33.5%(H117:37%;H217
30%),aheadofthe31%recorded
ineachofFY2016andFY2015.
Operating results
TheGrouphascontinuedtoleverage
itsgrowthandimprovedbuyingpower
todrivedownthecostofpurchased
telephony,whichmakesupthemajority
ofcostofgoodssold.Asaresult,the
grossmarginpercentageimproved
from74.5%inFY2016to76.7%in
FY2017(adjustedfordiscontinued
BTtechnologylicensingrevenues).
Administrativeexpensesgrewby28%
intheyear,significantlylowerthan
therateofrevenuegrowth.Themain
areasofincreaseinspendingwere
salesandengineeringheadcount,
bothofwhichareimportant
underpinningsoffuturegrowth.
Consequently,LoopUpEBITDArose
161%from£1.3minFY2016to£3.5m
inFY2017(adjustedfordiscounted
BTlicensingrevenues).Unadjusted
EBITDAforFY2016was£2.0m.
Looking ahead into 2018, we continue to see 
strong demand for the LoopUp product and  
we remain confident in our ability to deliver 
future growth.

Strategic Report
TheGroup’sspendondevelopment
costsrosefrom£3.2min2016to
£3.8minFY2017.Theincrease
largelyrepresentsthefullyear
impactofinvestmentsmadein
engineeringheadcountduring2016.
Thesecostsareallocatedtospecific
developmentprojects,whichare
thenamortisedoncetheproject
isdeemedcomplete.Duetothe
timingofcompletionofthevarious
developmentprojectsworkedonin
recentyears,theamortisationcharge
at£2.1mlagsthelevelofspendfor
FY2017(FY2016:£1.4m).Aswehave
guidedpreviously,thischargeis
expectedtoincreaseandbroadly
equalisewiththelevelofspendover
thenextfewyears.Inaddition,£0.3m
ofcostwasdeemedtobeimpaired
attheendofFY2017(FY2016:£nil),
relatingtosmallprojectswhichwere
nolongercoretotheLoopUpproduct.
TheGroupachievedanoperating
profitof£0.7minFY2017,compared
toalossof£0.3minFY2016(adjusted
fordiscontinuedBTtechnology
licensingrevenues),oranunadjusted
profitof£0.4mforthesameperiod.
TheGroupcontinuestoreceivea
taxbenefitfromitsresearchand
developmentactivity,andweexpect
tosubmitaclaimfor£0.9moftaxcash
creditforFY2017,inadditiontothe
£0.8msuccessfullyclaimedforFY2016.
Assets and cash flows
Netcashflowbeforefinancingfor
thefullyearwas(£0.1m)(FY2016:
(£0.2m).Thesecondhalfoftheyear
showedapositivenetcashflow
beforefinancingof£0.5m.
TheGroup’smuchimprovedbalance
sheetshowed£10.5mofnetassets
and£2.9mofnetcashattheendof
FY2017.TheGrouppaiddownafinal
debtinstalmentof£0.3mon31January
2017andendedtheyeardebtfree.
Inaddition,theGrouphasover£12m
ofaccumulatedtaxlossesattheend
ofFY2017,whichitexpectstobe
abletoutiliseagainstfutureprofits.

Excellent momentum
Chairman’s Statement
As our co-CEOs noted 
in their statement, 
LoopUp has had another 
strong year, maintaining 
its track record of 
consistent, efficient 
growth and continued 
product innovation.
LoopUp offers a superior service to clients 
and customers. 
Lady Barbara Judge CBE 
Since joining the board at IPO in 2016, 
I have been pleased to be a part of 
LoopUp’s excellent momentum in the 
market and look forward to the 
Company maintaining this trend during 
2018 and beyond. 
LoopUp addresses a significant problem 
that businesses face – the proliferation 
of painful, time-wasting conference calls 
that frustrate busy professionals and 
diminish their productivity every day. 
Having experienced these very issues 
myself, I have found LoopUp’s approach 
an innovative alternative. Its business 
model and growing adoption among 
demanding enterprises is further proof 
of the value LoopUp delivers to its 
customers and shareholders.
The Company continues to experience 
strong demand for its differentiated 
product, which combined with its 
innovative and efficient Pods 
organisational strategy, makes for 
an exciting outlook, and we remain 
confident in our ability to deliver 
further growth.
The Directors and executive team have 
demonstrated their continued ability to 
take the business forward as a public 
company and maintain its upward 
momentum. I remain confident that the 
Company is well positioned to grow in 
line with market expectations and 
deliver against our strategic priorities in 
the year to come. 
I look forward to seeing you, our 
shareholders, at our AGM on 
15 June 2018.
A note on corporate governance 
LoopUp Group plc, as an AIM company, 
is not required to comply (and does not 
claim to comply) with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’). The 
Board, however, recognizes the 
importance of the principles set out in 
the Code and remains committed to the 
maintenance of high standards of 
corporate governance. 
After due consideration, the Board 
seeks to apply those aspects of the 
Code as far as it considers appropriate 
for a business of this size and nature. 
The composition of the Group’s Board 
was considered carefully prior to AIM 
admission, and no changes to the 
Board or its Committees have taken 
place since admission. 
The Board holds its strategic decision-
making meetings in various Group 
offices, taking the opportunity to meet 
with members of both the Executive 
team and the wider senior management 
team, building their knowledge of 
the business. 
In my opinion, LoopUp offers a superior 
service to clients and customers. It is my 
honour and pleasure to be its Chairman, 
and to have the opportunity to work with 
such an effective and impressive 
management team and Board.

Corporate Governance Report
Board meetings and attendance
The Board aims to meet at least quarterly, with at least two meetings held in person (once during the budget-setting process 
and once mid-year). The remaining meetings are held remotely on LoopUp’s platform. Two in-person Board meetings were held 
during 2017. The table below shows the number of and attendance at both Board and Committee meetings during the year.
Board composition
The Board comprises three Executive and four Non-Executive 
Directors (including the Chairman). The Group appointed Lady 
Barbara Judge as Chairman and Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director at the time of the IPO. 
Mike Reynolds, Barmak Meftah and Nico Goulet remain in 
place from the previous Ring2 Communications Board, with 
the former two Directors being considered independent.
Simon Healey, who has served as CFO to the Group since 2011, 
was formally appointed to the Board on IPO in August 2016.
Board responsibilities
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the 
Group. It sets strategic aims and oversees implementation 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls, ensuring 
that only acceptable risks are taken. It provides leadership and 
direction and is also responsible for corporate governance 
and the overall financial performance of the Group.
The Board has agreed the schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision, which includes ensuring that the necessary 
financial and human resources are in place to meet 
obligations to shareholders and others. It also approves any 
acquisitions and disposals, major capital expenditure, 
annual budgets and dividend policy.
Board papers are circulated before Board meetings 
in sufficient time to enable their review and consideration 
in advance of meetings.
Board effectiveness
The performance of the Board is evaluated on an ongoing 
basis with reference to all aspects of its operation including, 
but not limited to: the appropriateness of its skill level; the way 
its meetings are conducted and administered (including the 
content of those meetings); the effectiveness of the various 
Committees; whether corporate governance issues are 
handled satisfactorily; and whether there is a clear strategy 
and objectives.
The Co-Chief Executives’ and Chief Financial Officer’s 
performance is appraised by the Chairman. The Chairman 
is appraised by the other Non-Executive Directors, and the 
other Non-Executive Directors are appraised by the 
Chairman.

Governance
Corporate Governance Report
Directors’ independence
Three of the Non-Executive Directors are considered 
by the Board to be independent and are free to exercise 
independence of judgement. They have never been 
employed by the Group nor do they participate in the Group 
bonus scheme. They receive no remuneration apart from 
their fees and, in some cases, limited share options.
Board appointments
On appointment, a new Director is briefed on the activities of 
the Group. Ongoing training is provided as needed. Directors 
are updated on a regular basis on the Group’s business.
Directors are subject to re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting following their appointment. In addition, at each 
Annual General Meeting, one-third (or the nearest whole 
number) of the Directors retire by rotation.
Access to independent advice and support
In the furtherance of his or her duties or in relation to acts 
carried out by the Board or the Group, each Director is aware 
that he or she is entitled to seek independent professional 
advice at the expense of the Group. The Group maintains 
appropriate Directors’ and Officers’ insurance in the event of 
legal action being taken against any Director. Each Director 
has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary, if required, who is responsible for ensuring that 
Board procedures are properly followed and that applicable 
rules and regulations are complied with.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is 
designed to mitigate against and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Board confirms that there are ongoing processes for 
identifying, evaluating and mitigating the significant risks 
facing the Group. The processes are considered to be 
appropriate given the size and nature of the business.
The Group’s internal financial control and monitoring 
procedures include:
 Clear responsibility for the maintenance of good financial 
controls and the production of accurate and timely 
financial information.
 The control of key financial risks through appropriate 
authorisation levels and senior management oversight.
 Detailed monthly reporting of trading results and financial 
position, including variances against budget.
 Reporting of any non-compliance with internal financial 
controls.
 Review of reports issued by external auditors.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews reports 
from the external auditor together with management’s 
response. In this matter, it has reviewed the effectiveness 
of the system of internal controls for the period.
Shareholder communications
Executive Directors regularly meet with institutional 
shareholders to foster a mutual understanding of objectives. 
In particular, an extensive programme of meetings with 
analysts and institutional shareholders is held following the 
interim and preliminary results announcements. Feedback 
from these meetings is presented to the Board. The Chairman 
and other Non-Executives are available to shareholders 
to discuss strategy and governance.
All Directors encourage the participation of all shareholders, 
including private investors, at the Annual General Meeting 
and as a matter of policy the level of proxy votes lodged 
on each resolution is declared at the meeting and published 
by announcement to the London Stock Exchange and on the 
Group’s website.

Audit Committee Report
Committee composition
The Audit Committee (‘the Committee’) was established in 
August 2016, although a similar committee did operate under 
Ring2 Communications Limited prior to the establishment of 
the Group as it currently stands. Mike Reynolds is Chair of the 
Audit Committee and the other members are Barmak Meftah 
and Nico Goulet. The Board considers the members to have 
relevant and recent financial experience, given their 
biographies as set out on pages 18 and 19.
Committee responsibilities
The Committee is appointed by and responsible to the Board. 
It has written terms of reference. Its main responsibilities are:
 Monitoring its satisfaction with the truth and fairness of the 
Group’s financial statements before submission to the 
Board for approval, ensuring their compliance with 
appropriate accounting standards, the law and AIM rules.
 Monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control.
 Making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment and remuneration of the external auditor, and 
reviewing the auditor’s objectivity and independence on 
an ongoing basis.
 Implementing a policy relating to any non-audit services 
performed by the external auditor.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to seek and obtain 
information from any officer or employee of the Group and 
obtain external advice as it deems necessary.
Committee meetings
The Committee aims to meet at least three times per year. 
These meetings are scheduled to coincide with the review of 
the interim statement, the scope and planning of the external 
audit and, finally, the results and observations upon 
completion of the external audit.
Three meetings were held during the year which the external 
auditor, co-CEO and CFO attended. The Committee also has 
the opportunity to meet with the external auditor without any 
Executive Directors present if it wishes to do so.
The Committee carried out a full review of the year end 
results and of the audit, using as a basis the reports to the 
Committee prepared by the CFO and the external auditor. 
Questions were asked of senior management around any 
significant or unusual transactions where the accounting 
treatment could be open to different interpretations.
The Committee received from the external auditor a report 
of matters arising during the audit which the auditor deemed 
to be of significance. 
Significant matters considered by the Committee in relation 
to the financial statements and areas of judgement routinely 
considered and challenged were as follows:
 Revenue recognition
 Capitalisation of development costs
The Committee is satisfied that the judgements made by 
management are reasonable and that appropriate disclosures 
in relation to key judgements and estimates have been 
included in the financial statements. In reaching this conclusion 
the Committee has considered reports and analysis prepared 
by management and has also constructively challenged 
assumptions. The Committee has also considered reports 
prepared by the external auditor.
Committee performance
The Committee regularly reviews its own performance and 
has concluded that it is performing as expected.
External auditor
Grant Thornton UK LLP has been the external auditor 
since 2014.
As required, the external auditor provided the Committee 
with information for review about policies and processes 
for maintaining its independence and compliance regarding 
the rotation of audit partners and staff. The Committee 
considered all relationships between the external auditor 
and the Group and was satisfied that they did not compromise 
the auditor’s judgement or independence, particularly around 
the provision of non-audit services.
Management reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit 
process and were satisfied with the external auditor’s 
knowledge of the business and that the scope of the audit 
was appropriate and the audit process effective.
Following these processes, the Committee recommended 
to the Board that Grant Thornton UK LLP be proposed for 
re-election at the AGM.
Internal audit function
Given the size and nature of the Group, the Board did not 
consider it necessary to have an internal audit function during 
the year, though this need will be reviewed regularly. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017
24
Committee composition
The Nomination Committee was established in August 2016. 
Mike Reynolds is Chair of the Nomination Committee and the 
other members are Barmak Meftah and Steve Flavell.
Committee responsibilities
The primary purpose of the Committee is to lead the process 
for Board appointments and to make recommendations to the 
Board to achieve the optimal composition of the Board, 
having regard to:
 its size and composition;
 the extent to which required skills, experience or attributes 
are represented;
 the need to maintain the highest appropriate standard of 
corporate governance; and
 ensuring that it consists of individuals who are best able to 
discharge the responsibilities of Directors.
It has written terms of reference.
Committee meetings
The Nomination Committee did not meet during 2016 or 2017. 
With the Board only reaching its current format in August 2016, 
there was no reason for the Committee to meet in the year.
The Board has considered diversity in broader terms than 
gender and believes it is also important to reach the correct 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
on the Board. All Board appointments will be made on merit 
and with the aim of achieving a correct balance. The Group 
has formal policies in place to promote equality of opportunity 
across the whole organisation, and training is provided to 
assist this.

The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee was established in August 
2016. It is chaired by Mike Reynolds and the other Committee 
members are Steve Flavell and Barmak Meftah. 
The Committee’s primary purpose is to assist the Board in 
determining the Company’s remuneration policies and, in so 
doing, agree the framework for Executive Directors’ 
remuneration with the Board. It has written terms of reference.
The Committee met three times during the year, with other 
Board members in attendance as appropriate.
Remuneration Committee report
As an AIM-listed company, LoopUp Group plc is not required 
to comply with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008. The content of this report is unaudited unless stated 
otherwise.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
During the year, the Remuneration Committee comprised two 
Non-Executive Directors (Mike Reynolds as Chair and Barmak 
Meftah) and one Executive Director (Steve Flavell).
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance of 
the Executive Directors and makes recommendations to the 
Board on matters relating to remuneration, terms of service, 
granting of share options and other equity incentives.
Remuneration policy
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to ensure that 
the overall remuneration of Executive Directors is aligned with 
the performance of the Group and preserves an appropriate 
balance of income and shareholder value.
Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is negotiated by the 
Executive Directors and agreed by the Board. Non-Executive 
Directors are not permitted to participate in pensions, annual 
bonuses or employee benefits. They are entitled to participate 
in share option agreements relating to the Company’s shares. 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of 
appointment stating his or her annual fee and that their 
appointment is initially for a period of three years, renewable 
for a further period of three years. Their appointment may be 
terminated with three months’ written notice at any time.
Directors’ remuneration
The normal remuneration arrangements for Executive 
Directors consist of basic salary, annual performance-related 
bonuses and participation in share options schemes. In 
addition, they receive private healthcare benefits, and UK 
Executives participate in a company pension scheme.
Annual bonuses
The 2017 annual bonus plan comprised a target bonus of 50% 
of salary for Steve Flavell and Michael Hughes and 25% of 
salary for Simon Healey. Executive Directors are rewarded 
based on the performance of the Group versus predefined 
targets as well as the achievement of personal objectives.
Based on the 2017 performance targets set at in late 2016, 
the Group either achieved or exceeded the targets set for 
revenue, gross margin and EBITDA. As a result of this 
performance, the Remuneration Committee resolved to pay 
bonuses as set out in this report.
Similar bonus principles will be adopted for future years. 
Performance targets around revenue, gross margin and 
EBITDA have been set by the Board. Meeting these targets 
and achieving personal objectives will result in payouts in line 
with those for 2017. Payouts can exceed these amounts 
should performance exceed these targets, and are capped.

encouraged to provide a free flow of information and ideas.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are fully

It is the policy of the Group that the training, career 
development and promotion of a disabled person should,

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2017
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
have prepared the financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union. Under Company law, the Directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit 
or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that:
 so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
 the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to 
have taken as Directors in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information on the 
Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditor
A resolution for the re-appointment of Grant Thornton UK LLP 
as auditor of the Group is to be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.

Financial Statements
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of LoopUp Group PLC (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, 
the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Statement of Cash 
Flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion:
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of the group’s profit for the period then ended;
 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied 
to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Who we are reporting to
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where:
 the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; 
or
 the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for 
a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
 Overall materiality: £262,000, which represents 1.5% of the group’s total revenue. 
 Key audit matters identified were the occurrence of revenue recognition and 
capitalisation of development costs. 
 We performed a full scope audit of the financial information of four components out 
of the seven components within the group. These accounted for 98% of the Group’s 
revenue and 104% of the Group’s Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) (with the remaining three components contributing a 4% 
EBITDA loss for the financial year); and 
 There were no key changes in the scope of the audit from the prior year.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on 
these matters.
Key Audit Matter–Group How the matter was addressed in the audit–Group
Occurrence of revenue 
Revenue is generated by the sale of conferencing services. 
Revenue is typically recognised based on the number of 
seconds of each meeting at rates agreed with each individual 
customer.
The group’s revenue has increased from £12.8m to £17.5m. 
Revenue is recognised based on the conferences held by 
customers, the timings of which are recorded in the billing 
system. This information generates revenue recognised in the 
accounting system. There is an audit risk that revenue 
recognised is not supported by evidence of the relevant 
conferences taking place. Consequently, we identified 
occurrence of revenue as a significant risk, which was one of 
the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
 Gaining an understanding of the controls in the revenue 
cycle including the monthly billing process to record call 
details and billing rates. 
 For a sample of revenue, we agreed the seconds billed 
to the call detail records and the rates back to customer 
signed contracts. 
 Performing analytical procedures on revenue based on 
comparisons with prior year and focused on trends such 
as seasonality, gross profit percentage, and rates per 
minute across the group.
 Testing credit notes raised during the year and subsequent 
to the year-end to ensure revenue was recognised in the 
correct period. 
 Considering the appropriateness of the revenue 
recognition policy adopted and confirmed that transactions 
have been treated in accordance with the adopted policy. 
The group’s accounting policy on revenue recognition is 
shown in note 2.07 to the financial statements and related 
disclosures are included in note 6. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements 
in relation to the occurrence of revenue. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Financial Statements
Key Audit Matter–Group How the matter was addressed in the audit–Group
Capitalisation of development costs
The group capitalises development costs within intangible 
assets. The amount capitalised in the year amounted to £3.8m 
(2016: £3.2m).
The capitalisation of development costs under IAS 38 
involves judgement and therefore there is a risk that a 
material error could occur if items have been incorrectly 
capitalised. We therefore identified capitalisation of 
development costs as a significant risk, which was one of the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement.
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
 Reviewing the development costs capitalised to ensure 
these meet the requirements as stated within IAS 38 
‘Intangible Assets’. We gained further understanding 
of the projects under development based on the analysis 
of papers prepared by management, discussions with 
management and review of the changes in the software 
in the year. 
 Confirming that costs were capitalised in accordance 
with IAS 38, in particular that the development met the 
technical and commercial feasibility criteria.
 Agreeing, on a sample basis, relevant payroll costs 
to payroll records. 
 Reviewing the amortisation period of three years to ensure 
this is appropriate for the expected product life cycle given 
the history of the product. 
 Reviewing the impairment review carried out by 
management on projects under development and 
completed in the period and for those projects which 
require impairment, we have reviewed to ensure these 
have been written off as required. 
The group’s accounting policy on intangible assets is shown 
in note 2.03 to the financial statements and related disclosures 
are included in note 14. 
Key observations
Our testing did not identify any material misstatements in the 
capitalisation of development costs during the year.
There are no key audit matters relating to the parent company.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality in determining the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. 
Independent Auditor’s Report
To the members of LoopUp Group plc LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017
33
Financial Statements
Materiality was determined as follows:
Materiality measure Group Parent Company
Financial statements as a whole We determined materiality for the audit of 
the group financial statements as a whole 
to be £262,000 which is 1.5% of total 
revenue. This benchmark is considered 
the most appropriate given that the 
group’s results are driven directly by the 
volume of conference services. This 
approach is consistent with prior year.
We determined materiality for the audit of 
the parent company financial statements 
to be £128,000 which is 1% of total assets. 
This benchmark is considered the most 
appropriate as the company is a holding 
company with no trade occurring within the 
parent entity. This approach is consistent 
with prior year.
Performance materiality used to

year ended 31 December 2016 to reflect 
the growth of the group compared to the 
prior year. 
We use a different level of materiality,

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group’s business, its environment 
and risk profile and in particular included:
 Evaluation by the group audit team of identified components to assess the significance of that component and to determine 
the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality, considering each as a percentage of total group assets, 
liabilities, revenues and EBITDA. 
 We performed a full scope audit of the financial information of four components and for the remaining three components, 
we have performed other procedures appropriate to respond to the risk of material misstatements. 
 The four reporting components where we performed full audit procedures, these accounted for 98% of the Group’s revenue 
and 104% of the Group’s EBITDA, with the remaining group components reporting an EBITDA loss for the financial year. This 
includes all UK components as well as the US component. The remaining entities where other procedures were performed 
included the Hong Kong, Barbados and the Australian components. 
 We have obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the Group which assisted us in identifying and assessing 
risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.

Financial Statements
An overview of the scope of our audit continued
 We evaluated controls over the financial reporting systems identified as part of our risk assessment and addressed critical 
accounting matters. We then undertook substantive testing on significant transactions and material account balances.
 During the year, the group has incorporated a new component within Australia as a 100% owned subsidiary. The activity 
within this component was below group materiality. 
 All accounting records and the finance team are located at head office and our work was conducted there accordingly. 
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
Annual Report & Accounts set out on pages 2 to 29, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in 
our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is 
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matter on which we are required to report under the Companies Act 2006
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit 
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 29, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Business description and basis of preparation
1.01 Business description
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution for remote business meetings.
LoopUp Group plc (‘the Group’) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, with company 
number 09980752. Its registered office is 78 Kingsland Road, London E2 8DP.
The Parent Company (‘the Company’) LoopUp Group plc was incorporated on 1 February 2016 as Pacific Shelf 1812 Limited, and 
its name was changed on 11 March 2016 to LoopUp Limited, and on 8 June 2016 to LoopUp Group Limited. It re-registered as a 
plc with the name LoopUp Group plc on 18 August 2016.
On 2 August 2016, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of the former parent company of the Group, Ring2 
Communications Limited (now LoopUp Limited), by way of a share for share exchange (see note 21). This share for share 
exchange qualifies as a common control transaction and therefore falls outside of the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. 
Consequently, an accounting policy has been developed based on the principles of reverse acquisition accounting: 
 No goodwill has been recorded.
 The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary, Ring2 Communications Limited are recognised and measured in the 
consolidated financial statements at their pre-combination carrying amounts, without restatement to their fair value.
 The retained reserves recognised in the consolidated financial statements reflect the retained reserves of LoopUp Limited 
to the date of acquisition.
 In applying IFRS 3 by analogy, the equity structure appearing in the consolidated financial statements reflects the equity 
structure of the legal parent LoopUp Group PLC, including the equity instruments issued under the share exchange to effect 
the business combination.
 An ‘Other reserve’ has been created to enable the presentation of a consolidated balance sheet which combines the equity 
structure of the legal parent with the non-statutory reserves of the legal subsidiary.
1.02 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and International Accounting Standards (IASs) as adopted by the EU together with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Boards (IASB) 
that are currently effective or early adopted (collectively IFRS) and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
that are relevant to those companies that report in accordance with IFRSs.
The preparation of financial information requires the Directors to exercise judgements in the process of applying 
accounting policies.
Financial information is presented in Pounds Sterling (£) and, unless otherwise stated, amounts are expressed in thousands 
(£000), with rounding accordingly.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement 
of comprehensive income. The loss for the year dealt with in the financial statements of the Company was £nil. 
The accounting policies used have been consistently applied from the transition balance sheet and throughout all periods 
presented in the financial statements. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Business description and basis of preparation continued
1.03 Going concern
As part of their going concern review, the Directors have followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting Council entitled 
‘Guidance on the Going Concern basis of Accounting and Reporting on Solvency and Liquidity Risks’, published in April 2016.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had net cash of £2.9m and net assets of £10.5m.
The Directors have prepared a detailed budget and forecasts of the Group’s expected performance over a period covering at 
least the next 12 months from the date of these financial statements. These forecasts model the realisation of the current sales 
pipeline and also cover a number of scenarios and sensitivities in order for the Board to satisfy itself that the Group has sufficient 
cash resources to continue to trade successfully during this period.
As a consequence, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group can continue to operate and to meet its 
commitments and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for a period not less than 12 months from the date 
of these financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these Group 
financial statements.
1.04 Chief operating decision-maker
The Board of Directors acting together are considered the chief operating decision-maker.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below:
2.01 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (‘the Subsidiaries’) made up to the accounting reference date each year. Subsidiaries are all entities over which the 
Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies. Control is achieved when the Group has power over an 
entity in which it has invested (‘the Investee’); is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the Investee; 
and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an Investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one 
or more of the three elements of control listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over 
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group losses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or 
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains 
control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the members 
of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all Group undertakings.
Intragroup transactions, dividends and balances are eliminated, as are unrealised gains and losses on intragroup transactions.
2.02 Currencies
(a) Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the consolidated financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the Parent Company operates (‘the functional currency’) which is UK Sterling (£). The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in UK Sterling, as described in note 1.02 (‘the presentational currency’). LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of 
the transactions or at an average rate for a period if the rates do not fluctuate significantly. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-end exchange rates of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary 
items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
(c) Group companies that have a functional currency other than the presentational currency of the Group
The results and financial position of all Group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentational 
currency of the Group are translated into the presentational currency as follows:
 assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date;
 income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised in 
other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
2.03 Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are capitalised when the related projects meet the recognition criteria of an internally generated intangible 
asset, the key criteria being as follows:
(a) technical feasibility of the completed intangible asset has been established;
(b) it can be demonstrated that the asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
(c) adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development;
(d) the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset can be reliably measured; and
(e) management has the ability and intention to use or sell the asset.
These projects are designed to bring new capabilities into the LoopUp product. Salaries associated with development time 
and directly attributable overheads are capitalised within intangible assets. 
Development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life. Development 
expenditure is only amortised over the period the Group is expected to benefit and is subject to annual impairment testing. 
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any 
changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
2.04 Investments
Investments in subsidiary and associated undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
2.05 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost includes the 
original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the costs of assets over their estimated useful lives, on a straight-line basis starting 
from the month they are first used, as follows:
 Office equipment – 20-33% straight line
 Computer equipment – 20-33% straight line LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
2.06 Impairment of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Directors review the carrying amounts of all non-current assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates 
of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be 
less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2.07 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of services in the ordinary 
course of business and is shown net of Value Added Tax. 
Revenue arises from the delivery of conferencing services using LoopUp’s proprietary products. The majority of revenue arises 
upon usage by customers of services delivered on a pay as you go model, based on seconds of conference time and the 
number of participants on the conference. Revenue is recognised in relation to conferencing services as the service 
is performed.
Additionally, in the prior year, the Group has one material customer whose arrangement is based on a licence agreement for use 
of the service over an agreed time period. Revenue on this agreement is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of 
the licence.
Any difference between the amount of revenue recognised and the amount invoiced to a customer is included in the statement 
of financial position as accrued or deferred income.
2.08 Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of fees payable to third parties and other expenses that are directly related to sales.
2.09 Current and deferred tax
The tax expense or credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable or recoverable and the movement in deferred tax 
assets and liabilities.
(a) Current tax
Current tax is based on taxable income for the period and any adjustment to tax from previous periods. Taxable income differs 
from net income in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable 
or deductible in other periods or that are never taxable or deductible. The calculation uses the latest tax rates and laws for the 
period that have been enacted on substantively enacted by the reporting date.
(b) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated at the latest tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
that are expected to apply when settled. It is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case it is also dealt with in equity. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable income, 
and is accounted for using the liability method. It is not discounted.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Such assets are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that the underlying deductible temporary differences will be able 
to be offset against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred 
tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.10 Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, 
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. 
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
If lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit 
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
2.11 Payroll expense and related contributions
Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period 
in which the associated services are rendered.
2.12 Benefits and pension costs
In 2016 LoopUp Limited established a contributory pension scheme under the UK’s auto-enrolment rules. Company 
contributions (2% in FY2017) are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
US staff qualify for a non-contributory 401k pension scheme which has been in place since 2013. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been deducted and paid. The contributions are recognised as an in expense 
in the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
2.13 Share-based compensation
The Group issues share-based payments to certain employees and Directors. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over any vesting period, along with 
a corresponding increase in equity if they are deemed to be material to the Group.
At each reporting date, the Directors revise their estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of any revision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The fair value of share options is determined using a Black-Scholes model, taking into consideration the best estimate of the 
expected life of the option and the specific terms of the option grant.
2.14 Alternative performance measures
The Board assesses the performance of the Group using alternative performance measures (namely LoopUp Revenue, LoopUp 
Gross Margin and EBITDA) as in the Board’s view, this reflects the underlying performance of the business and provides a more 
meaningful comparison of how the business is managed and measured on a day-to-day basis and is used as a basis for 
incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
LoopUp Revenue is defined as total Group revenue adjusted to exclude discontinued technology licensing revenue. LoopUp 
Gross margin is total Group gross margin adjusted to exclude the same revenue.
EBITDA is defined as operating profit stated before depreciation, amortisation of intangible fixed assets and a reconciliation 
of EBITDA is included on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
 
It is important to note that alternative performance measures are not defined under IFRS and therefore defined as “non GAAP” 
measures. The alternative performance measures used by the Group may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures 
reported by other companies. They are not intended to be a substitute for, or be superior to GAAP measurements of performance.
2.15 Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the time they are approved. Otherwise dividends are 
disclosed if they have been proposed before the relevant consolidated financial statements are approved.
2.16 Accounting developments
The Group has adopted the following new standards, or net provisions of amended standards:
 Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to IAS 7 
 Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses 
There has been no material impact on either amounts reported or disclosure in the financial statements arising from first time adoption.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards have been published by the IASB but are not yet effective and have not been applied early by the Group. 
Management anticipates that the following pronouncements relevant to the Group’s operation will be adopted in the Group’s 
accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement, once adopted by the EU:
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2018)
 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018)
 Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle (effective 1 January 2018)
 IFRS 16 Leases (effective 1 January 2019)
 Clarification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (Amendment to IFRS 2) (not yet adopted by the EU)
 IFRIC Interpretation 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance considerations (not yet adopted by the EU)
 Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle (not yet adopted by the EU)
 IFRIC Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (not yet adopted by the EU) LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
Financial Statements
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
There are other standards and interpretations in issue but these are not considered to be relevant to the Group.
IFRS 16 will replace IAS 17 for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019 and from the perspective of the Group 
as lessee will require (subject to certain practical expedients) most of the Group’s lease obligations to be reflected on balance 
sheet with a corresponding asset reflecting the right to use the underlying leased asset.
Management are currently performing a detailed review of the Group’s lease arrangements and are deciding on how IFRS 16 
will be implemented and are considering which practical expedients might apply and whether or not the standard will be 
implemented on a full or partial retrospective basis. The full impact of IFRS 16 is therefore not yet known but is limited to the 
operating leases with regards to the land and buildings as indicated in note 23 of the financial statements. 
The Directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above, other than IFRS 16, will not have a material impact on the 
financial information of the Group in future reporting periods. This includes both IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 15 
Revenue from Contracts from Customers.
As per note 6, the whole of the Group’s revenue in 2017 was derived from LoopUp Revenue, which is delivered on a pay as you 
go model, recognised on the number of seconds of conference time and the number of participants on the conference. This is 
not expected to change after the implementation of IFRS 15 on the basis that there are no ongoing performance obligations.
3. Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are de-recognised when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows from the financial asset expire or when the contractual rights to those assets are transferred. Financial liabilities are 
de-recognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
3.01 Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method less provision for impairment. Appropriate provisions for estimated irrecoverable amounts are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when there is objective evidence that the assets are impaired. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest 
would be immaterial.
3.02 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with other short-term, highly liquid 
investments maturing within 90 days from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
3.03 Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise borrowings, finance leases and trade and other payables.
Borrowings and trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at their fair value and are subsequently measured at their amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method; this method allocates interest expense over the relevant period by applying the ‘effective 
interest rate’ to the carrying amount of the liability.
3.04 Classification as debt or equity
Debt and equity instruments issued are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of 
the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all liabilities. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
3. Financial instruments continued
3.05 Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued are recognised as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. The components 
of equity are as follows:
(a) Share capital
The nominal values of equity shares. The rights attributable to the classes of equity in issue are disclosed in note 20.
(b) Share premium
The fair value of consideration received in excess of the nominal value of equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
(c) Retained earnings
The retained net profits or losses to date less distributions.
(d) Foreign currency translation reserve
The net foreign exchange gains or losses to date on consolidation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
3.06 Research and development (R&D) tax credits
R&D tax credits for applicable research and development expenditure is accounted for as a credit to income tax expense in the 
year in which it is earned.
4. Financial risk management
4.01 Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, as explained below. The overall 
risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the Group’s financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the Directors, who identify and evaluate 
financial risks in close cooperation with key staff.
(a) Market risk is the risk of loss that may arise from changes in market factors, such as competitor pricing, interest rates, 
foreign exchange rates.
(b) Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to financial instruments fails to meet its 
contractual obligation. Credit risk arises from the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and receivables balances.
(c) Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This risk relates to the 
Group’s prudent liquidity risk management and implies maintaining sufficient cash. The Directors monitor rolling forecasts 
of liquidity, cash and cash equivalents based on expected cash flow.
4.02 Capital risk management
The Group is funded by equity and loans. The components of shareholders’ equity are:
(a) Share capital.
(b) Retained earnings, reflecting net comprehensive income to date less distributions.
The objective when managing capital is to maintain adequate financial flexibility to preserve the ability to meet financial 
obligations, both current and long term. The capital structure is managed and adjusted to reflect changes in economic 
conditions. Expenditures on commitments are funded from existing cash and cash equivalent balances, primarily received from 
issuances of shareholders’ equity. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Notes to the Financial Statements
Financial Statements
4. Financial risk management continued
Financing decisions are made based on forecasts of the expected timing and level of capital and operating expenditure 
required to meet commitments and development plans.
There are no externally imposed capital requirements.
4.03 Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values 
because the short-term nature of such assets renders the impact of discounting to be negligible.
5. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Details of significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates include:
Judgements
5.01 Functional currency
The functional currency is deemed to be Sterling, as the Directors consider that the primary economic environment. 
5.02 Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. 
This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether there will be sufficient 
taxable income available to offset the assets when they do reverse.
This requires assumptions regarding the future the profitability of the Group for the 12 months from the date of signing of the 
financial statements, and as this is inherently uncertain, no deferred tax asset in relation to tax losses has been recognised in 
the financial statements. The Group has trading losses of £12,768,000 (2016: £12,643,000) and non-trading losses of £401,000 
(2016: £401,000) carried forward.
5.03 Capitalised development costs
Capitalisation of development costs requires the Directors to make judgements in allocating staff time appropriately to relevant 
projects and in assessing the technical feasibility and economic potential of those projects.
These judgements have resulted in the intangible assets as set out in note 14.
Estimates
5.04 Intangible asset life
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
5.05 Impairment of assets
The impairment review process involves the Directors making judgements about, inter alia, future cash flows and the discount 
rate to be applied to those cash flows. Details of key assumptions made are given in note 15. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

6. Revenue and segmental reporting
The Directors have identified the segments by reference to the principal groups of services offered and the geographical 
organisation of the business as reported to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM).
Segmental revenues are external and there are no material transactions between segments.
The main segment is LoopUp Revenue which consists of ongoing contracts to provide customers with access to the LoopUp 
conferencing platform.
The discontinued licensing revenue represented a contract with a single customer in the UK which terminated in 2016. This was 
the only customer which represented more than 10% of revenues in either year.
No segmental balance sheet was presented to the CODM.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of assets to their recoverable amount. Where it is higher than the 
recoverable amount, an impairment results. Amortisation and any impairment charges are included in operating expenses in the 
statement of comprehensive income. Intangible assets not yet ready for use are tested for impairment at least annually. 
Amortisation of each asset begins from the date the asset becomes available for use.
Recoverable amounts have been measured based on value in use. Forecasts for the remaining life of each asset have been 
used (maximum three years), based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate 
of future performance.

The Directors believe that the carrying value of receivables represents their fair value. In determining the recoverability of 
a receivable, the Directors consider any change in its credit quality from the date credit was granted up to the reporting date.
The largest single receivable at any time would typically constitute no more than 5% of total receivables and would relate 
to a blue-chip customer. As such, the concentrated credit risk is considered minimal.
Details of the credit risk management policies are shown in note 19.05. No collateral is held as security for trade or

19. Financial instruments
There is an exposure to the risks that arise from the financial instruments. The policies for managing those risks and the 
methods to measure them are described in note 4.
19.01 Capital risk management
Funding to date has been by equity and loans. Loans are no longer outstanding as shown in note 18.

19.04 Market risk
There is an exposure to the financial risk of changes in exchange rates impacting overseas revenues and costs. The Directors 
do not consider it appropriate to engage in hedging activities at this point in time. The Group also held significant US Dollar-
denominated shareholder loans which were fully repaid in early 2017, as shown in note 18. Exchange rate movements on these 
loan balances resulted in currency translation losses in both 2017 and 2016 as shown in the statement of comprehensive 
income. As these loans have now been paid off, these losses are not expected to recur.
19.05 Credit risk
Careful consideration is given to the choice of bank in order to minimise credit risk. Cash is held with five institutions. The amounts 
of cash held with those banks at the reporting date can be seen in the financial assets table above. All of the cash and equivalents 
were denominated in UK Sterling.
There was no significant concentration of credit risk at the reporting date other than as described at note 15.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of any allowances for losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk 
without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. LoopUp Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2017

Financial Statements
Notes to the Financial Statements
19. Financial instruments continued
A provision of £103,000 (2016: £89,000) has been made for impairment losses in relation to trade receivables. In the Directors’ 
opinion, there has been no other impairment of financial assets. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss 
event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The Directors consider 
the above measures to be sufficient to control the credit risk exposure. No collateral is held as security in relation to its financial assets.
Amounts owed by subsidiaries are unsecured, have no fixed date of repayment and are repayable on demand.
19.06 Liquidity risk management
The Directors manage liquidity risk by regularly reviewing cash requirements by reference to short-term cash flow forecasts and 
medium-term working capital projections.
19.07 Maturity of financial assets and liabilities
All the non-derivative financial liabilities and assets at the reporting date are either payable or receivable within one year.
19.08 Fair value
The fair values of all the financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are considered to be equal to their carrying values.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting 
expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates with the following assumptions being applied:
 for trade and other receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year the carrying amount is deemed to 
reflect the fair value;
 for cash and cash equivalents the amounts reported on the balance sheet approximate to fair value.
