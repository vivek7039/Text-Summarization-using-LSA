Chairman’s Statement
A Year of 
Strong Growth
“We are pleased with the portfolio’s 
overall performance, especially given the 
current uncertainties in the market, and 
will be concentrating on further lettings 
and active management initiatives 
to continue driving growth forward”
Whilst the political and economic uncertainty 
of 2016 continues to play out, the 
underlying quality of Circle Property Plc’s 
portfolio of regional offices and the wealth 
of experience and expertise inherent 
within its management team has driven 
a period of growth for the Company. 
Circle has successfully realised a year-on-year 
growth of 19.9% in NAV, delivering a final NAV 
of 183p per share, as well as a proposed final 
dividend of 2.6p per share, an increase of 8.3%, 
to bring the annual dividend to 5p. This growth 
has come almost entirely through the team’s 
strong asset management and stock picking 
capabilities, with asset-transforming capex 
programmes at key sites including K2, Kents 
Hill Park in Milton Keynes and 36 Great Charles 
Street in Birmingham, which reached completion 
in the period, as well as solid progress being 
made at Somerset House in Birmingham’s CBD. 
Circle’s high level of tenant retention is largely 
attributable to both the high standards of 
management that we demand within our 
multi-let properties and our flexible approach 
to tenant renewal negotiations. Our vacancy 
rate in the standing investment portfolio is less 
than 1% as, where appropriate, we continue to 
place a greater emphasis upon the certainty of 
secure income and the creation of longer leases 
in preference to the maximisation of rents.
It is the strength of Circle’s asset management 
that differentiates the Company from its 
peers. In order to achieve lettings in a highly 
competitive market, it is essential to respond 
swiftly to tenants’ ever-changing occupational 
demands. By listening to tenants and taking 
advice from agents, the Company remains 
totally aware of emerging occupier trends, 
such as the increasing preference towards 
characterful or individualistic offices, and is 
able to increase value by providing supply for 
this demand. This strategy to deliver best-in-
class office properties in regional locations 
was further supported by the successful 
refinancing of Circle’s senior debt with RBS 
following the agreement of a new £50m facility.
Circle is well positioned in this uncertain 
political and economic environment with a 
closely managed business, a positive strategy 
and an entrepreneurial management team 
ready to exploit emerging opportunities..

Chairman  3
 Circle Property Plc
 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financials Governance Strategic Report
Strategic Report
Throughout the year we have continued 
with our asset management programme and 
have now assembled a core portfolio of high 
quality regional offices in prime locations 
which are primarily well let to high quality 
tenants on medium or long-term leases. As a 
result, and because of the resilient demand 
for the type of space we offer, we believe our 
portfolio will prove less susceptible to any 
downward valuation shifts arising from any 
prolonged political and economic uncertainty.
Following the refinancing of our debt facility 
with RBS, we are currently also reviewing our 
hedging strategy, including the possibility of 
entering into longer-term fixed rate funding. Our 
interest cover is sufficient to cover any potential 
or anticipated increased interest charges, but 
we are aware that inflationary pressures are 
growing as a result of the weaker pound. 
It is therefore likely that income will continue 
to feature as a prerequisite to attract 
investors but, through continued strong stock 
selection, appropriate portfolio recycling 
and strong asset management, we aim to 
provide a better total return over time, than 
a purely income driven stock, as evidenced by 
the 19.9% growth in EPRA NAV in the year 
under review compared to a 3.9% total return 
for the MSCI All Property index in 2016. 
Most encouragingly, almost all of the increase 
in NAV within the portfolio is attributable 
to our asset management. By successfully 
undertaking lease renegotiations, new lettings 
and lease renewals we have maximised income 
and have generated earnings per share of 35p.
In Birmingham, we only recently in July launched 
36 Great Charles Street into the letting market 
and it has been very well received, The façade 
has just been cleaned while the reception area 
has been enlarged, decorated and furnished 
to form a distinctive area for the tenants 
to meet and greet visitors as well as hold 
informal meetings, directly off street level.
Chief Executive’s Statement
Resilience Through 
the Cycle
Also in Birmingham, Somerset House, Temple 
Street will be available in the autumn. The 
specification we are implementing enhances 
and complements the building’s many art deco 
features including the restored parquet flooring 
that will help to differentiate our offering from 
many others in the vicinity. Prime rents in the 
city have now reached £35 psf, so our two 
buildings at £18 and £20 psf respectively 
should prove highly attractive to those tenants 
seeking well located high quality office space.
Although the letting market for requirements 
over 10,000 sq ft has been noticeably slower 
in the first half of the 2017 calendar year, 
we are in negotiations to let a substantial 
part of our 40,000 sq ft office building, K2 
at Kents Hill Park, Milton Keynes to a major 
occupier and have multiple interest in the 
remainder, following our decision to further 
subdivide the building into smaller suites. From 
the outset we built maximum flexibility into 
the layout of the property and by a simple 
repositioning of services, subdivision is possible 
with minimum loss of net internal area and 
at a modest additional construction cost.
All of our buildings that are either in the 
course of refurbishment or completed and 
available to let are capable of being occupied 
by tenants seeking less than 5,000 sq ft, which 
is the most active sector of the market.
Our optimism in the economy in the lead-
up to leaving the EU is being tested by the 
hung parliament and increasing political 
uncertainty following the general election. 
We are mindful that the heightened sense of 
nervousness may have an adverse effect upon 
some areas of the property market. However, 
with a strong cash flow and cash at bank 
we believe that our business is well placed 
to capitalise upon a regional office market 
that has, to-date, remained fairly robust due 
to sustained demand for offices in the sub 
5,000 sq ft range and the continuing loss of 
much of the lower quality office stock due to 
obsolescence and residential conversion.
In the short term, Circle Property Plc will 
concentrate on letting the space within the 
development portfolio which once fully let, 
on the basis of current rental levels, has the 
capability to treble the net operating profits, 
enhancing the future earnings per share and 
supporting our progressive dividend policy. We 
hope this will help drive demand for our shares, 
facilitating an expansion of our investor base 
and so creates greater liquidity in our stock.

Strategic Report
Market Overview
The market for regional offices located within major conurbations has been less 
affected by BREXIT as they are not as dependent as London on international 
finance and investment. Companies relocating to the regions to save costs, 
being attracted by lower employment costs, business rates and rent, coupled 
with existing demand from local professional occupiers and SMEs, have further 
enhanced tenant demand for good quality well located offices.
Market Opportunities
With REITs competing for income and 
institutions restricted by their large asset lot 
size requirement, there is less competition 
for us to acquire well located short let or part 
vacant provincial offices. Furthermore, major 
provincial cities have experienced the Permitted 
Development Rights effect, whereby offices can 
be converted to residential without planning 
permission. This has led to a shortage in supply 
of good quality office accommodation.
Significant Trends
A reduction in supply for good quality 
provincial offices, along with a stable 
provincial economy has created good office 
demand which has led to rental growth 
with reducing tenant incentives. Tenants’ 
occupational requirements are changing 
with many seeking something different, such 
as exposed mechanical services, which are 
not normally found in provincial offices.

Active Management 
Feeds Growth
During the year, we continued to increase 
the portfolio’s income by concentrating 
on lease renewals and lettings.
In addition, our three key developments are 
progressing well. Both K2, Kents Hill Business 
Park and 36 Great Charles Street, Birmingham 
are complete and we have good tenant interest 
for both. At Somerset House, Temple Street, 
Birmingham, planning permission was obtained 
for change of use of the ground floor for two 
enlarged restaurant units which attract a higher 
rental than offices, £40 psf against £20 psf. 
The offices above are undergoing refurbishment 
and are due to be completed by autumn 2017.
Our strategy of owning buildings capable of 
subdivision to provide smaller office suites 
of up to 5,000 sq ft is paying off, as 70% 
of all lettings in the cities where we are 
invested are within this size range. At this 
smaller end of the letting market, we attract 
local professionals and SMEs, which are less 
prone to the uncertainties of BREXIT.
The current uncertainty in the market may 
give rise to further opportunities which 
we will endeavour to exploit, should the 
returns be sufficiently attractive.
“We are pleased with the portfolio’s 
overall performance and will concentrate 
on further lettings and active 
management initiatives to continue 
driving growth”  9

Portfolio Overview
As at 31 March 2017 , the total portfolio value 
was £93,025,000, an increase of 19.7% from 
the previous year, mainly driven by asset 
management as opposed to yield compression.
The portfolio is made up of 15 assets, 
primarily well located provincial offices. 
Our car showroom in Warrington was sold 
at a price of £1.32m, an increase of 34% 
above the previous year’s valuation.
By floor area, 80% of the total portfolio is let 
and income producing and forms the investment 
portfolio. For the remaining vacant 20%, 19% 
is held within our development portfolio which 
consists of three office buildings, two of which 
have been refurbished and one is currently 
under refurbishment. Only 1% of the vacancy 
is held within the core investment portfolio.
89.7% of the portfolio by value is in the 
office (and conference) sector which forms 
the core portfolio. The remaining 10.3% is 
split across four sectors, being the non-core 
portfolio, which although providing good 
high yielding income, are likely to be sold 
once their business plans are complete.
73.7% of the portfolio by value is located in 
Milton Keynes, Bristol and Birmingham, an 
increase of 5% from the previous year end.
Principal tenants within the portfolio include 
Compass Contract Services Ltd (26.69% 
24.5 years to lease expiry), Which? Financial 
Services Ltd (5.89%), Grant Thornton 
LLP (5%), B&M Retail Ltd (5%) and New 
World Trading Company Ltd (4.3%).
As at 31 March 2017 , the weighted average 
unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) to first 
tenant’s break option increased from 5.6 
years to 7.39 years, whilst to lease expiry 
increased from 6.85 years to 11.23 years.
The total annual contracted income produced by 
the portfolio is over £5.6m, (net current annual 
income of £5.32m) with a reversionary rent 
based on full ERV and once the development 
assets are let of approximately £8.9m.

Kents Hill Park, Milton Keynes
When acquired in December 2013, the 22-acre estate provided 246,598 sq ft 
of conference, leisure and office accommodation across two parts. The first 
being a 176,941 sq ft office, leisure and conference facility housed within six 
self-contained buildings let to Compass Group on a rolling three-monthly 
management agreement paying £100,000 per annum. The second part 
comprises two self-contained offices providing 69,657 sq ft of 
accommodation, 30% of which was let to Accenture for a term of one and a 
half years unexpired at a rent of £291,987 per annum. The remaining 70% was 
old, unattractive vacant offices that required refurbishment. The combined 
rental income was £391,987 per annum.
During the acquisition, we agreed new letting terms with Compass Group, 
which surrendered its existing management agreement and entered into a 
10-year lease at an increased rent of £875,000 per annum. This lease has 
subsequently been re-geared again in September 2016, for a term of 25 years 
(tenant break options at 15 and 20 years) at a further increased rent of £1.5m 
per annum, subject to annual 3% per annum uplifts.
The remaining 70,000 sq ft of offices and former accommodation occupied by 
Accenture, have been refurbished and rebranded as K1 & K2 Kents Hill 
Business Park. K1, totalling 26,889 sq ft, is already fully let and produces an 
income of £389,326 (equating to £14.48 psf overall), whilst K2 totalling 
40,534 sq ft is available to let. We have good interest in this building where we 
are quoting a rent of £18.50 psf. 
The current rental income of both parts of Kents Hill Park is £1.889m, with the 
potential to increase by a further £609,000 per annum should K2 be let at the 
current quoting rent.

Circle Property Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
The Directors acknowledge the importance of good Corporate Governance and so their approach has been informed by the best practice principles outlined 
by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Company, whilst wishing to be as transparent as is practicable, recognizes the limitations of its internal resources. The Company, however, will continue 
to develop its policies and procedures but has ensured that it adopted policies which have significant implications, such as a disclosure (conflicts) policy, 
share dealing code, insider lists and an anti-bribery and corruption policy. As the Company evolves the Board is committed to enhancing the Company’s 
corporate governance policies and practices appropriate for its size and maturity.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the success of the Group and, through the independent oversight of management, is accountable to 
shareholders for the performance of the business.
Leadership
The Board of Directors comprises three independent Non-Executive Directors, two further Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors, 
providing the requisite independent oversight, expertise and experience to meet the responsibility of making the business a success.
The role of the Board
The principal role of the Board is to set the Group’s strategy and to review regularly its performance in relationship to the agreed strategy. In doing this, 
the Board is able to carry out its corporate governance duties and responsibilities.
The Board has established committees which are responsible for audit and remuneration. Nomination issues will be addressed by the entire Board.
Responsibility for day-to-day management of the business is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The Board directs and 
monitors the Group’s affairs within an evolving framework of controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed effectively.
Board Meetings
The core activities of the Board are carried out in scheduled quarterly meetings of the Board and its Committees. These meetings are timed to link to key 
events in the Company’s corporate calendar and regular reviews of the business are conducted. Additional meetings and conference calls are arranged to 
address matters which require consideration outside the scheduled meetings. All meetings are held in Jersey. The Board held four quarterly meetings and 
six standing committee meetings in its first full year of trading.
Outside the meetings of the Board, the directors maintain frequent contact with each other to discuss any issues of concern they may have relating to 
the Company or their areas of responsibility, and to keep themselves fully briefed on the Company’s operations.
Independent Non-Executive Directors
The independent Non-Executive Directors bring a broad range of business and property experience to the Company and have a particular responsibility 
to monitor and challenge independently and constructively the performance of the executive management team in the delivery of the agreed objectives 
and targets.
Delegations of authority
Certain other matters are delegated to the Board Committees, namely the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The memberships, roles and activities of these Committees are detailed on the Company’s website.
Each committee reports to the Board and the issues considered at meetings of the Committees are presented by the respective Committee Chairmen.
Other governance matters
All of the Directors are aware that independent professional advice is available to them in order to properly discharge their duties. In addition, each 
Director and Board Committee has access to the advice of the corporate Company Secretary.
The Company Secretary
The Company Secretary is Consortia Secretaries Limited, a limited liability company regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, which 
provides full secretarial services. Michael Farrow and Richard Herbert are both Directors of the Company Secretary.
Effectiveness
In assessing the composition of the Board, the Directors have had regard to the following principles:
• the Chairman should be an independent Non-Executive Director;
• the role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should not be exercised by the same person;
• the Board should include at least two independent Non-Executive Directors, increasing where additional expertise is considered desirable in certain 
areas, or to ensure a smooth transition between outgoing and incoming Non-Executive Directors; and
• the Board should comprise Directors with an appropriate range of qualifications and expertise.
Biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 16–17 of this Annual Report.
Governance Report  19
 Circle Property Plc
 Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financials Governance Strategic Report
Governance
The Directors are of the view that the Board and its Committees consist of Directors with an appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and 
diverse backgrounds to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively.
Independence
The Board has adopted a formal policy for the determination of the independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
Among the key criteria of the independence policy are independence from management and the absence of a relationship, such as ownership, which 
could materially interfere with the director’s independence of judgment.
Where contracts in the ordinary course of business exist between Circle Property Plc and a company in which a director has declared an interest, these 
are reviewed for materiality both to the Group, and the other party to the contract. “Material” is defined in the policy as being where the relationship 
accounts for more than 10% of either party’s consolidated gross revenue per annum, although the test also takes other circumstances into account.
Appointments
Directors appointed by the Board are subject to election by shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting of the Company and thereafter are 
subject to re-election in accordance with the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association.
Commitments
All Directors have disclosed any significant commitments to the Board and confirmed that they have sufficient time to discharge their duties.
Conflict of interest
A director has a duty to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict with the 
interests of the Company. The Board has satisfied itself that there is no compromise to the independence of those directors who have appointments on 
the boards of, or relationships with, companies outside the Company. The Board requires directors to declare all appointments and other situations which 
could result in a possible conflict of interest. The Company also maintains a register of gifts and no gifts were received in the reporting period although 
Mr Olins attended the Lambert Smith Hampton Ski Challenge designed to build business relationships in the commercial property sector.
Board performance and evaluation
The Board is not formally evaluated at present but will consider this at the appropriate juncture. It is envisaged that annual assessments will take place.
Accountability
The Board is committed to providing shareholders with a clear assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. This is achieved through this report 
and as required other periodic financial and trading statements. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of the relationship with the 
Company’s auditors.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future operations, financial position, and liquidity are set out in the 
Chairman’s Statement and the CEO’s Report in this report. In addition, note 22 to the consolidated financial statements discloses the Company’s financial 
risk management practices with respect to its capital structure, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and other related matters.
The Directors’ statement on going concern is set out in note 2 on page 30 of the consolidated financial statements.
Internal controls
The Board of Directors reviews the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls. The internal control system is designed to manage the 
risk of failure to achieve the Company’s business objectives. This covers internal financial and operational controls, compliance and risk management. 
The Company has necessary procedures in place and the directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Company’s system of internal controls and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. The Board confirms the need for an ongoing process for identification, evaluation and management of significant risks faced 
by the Company.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee regularly reviews and reports to the Board on the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Given the size of the Company 
and the relative simplicity of the systems, the Board considers that there is no current requirement for an internal audit function. The procedures that 
have been established to provide internal financial control for the Company are considered appropriate for a company of its size and include controls over 
expenditure, regular reconciliations and management accounts.
The directors are responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably available to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities.
Remuneration Committee
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for agreeing the remuneration policy for senior executives. 20

Governance
Shareholder relations
Open, relevant and transparent communication with shareholders is given high priority. No shareholder or interested party is to be provided information 
that is not available to all shareholders without restrictive covenants related to trading in equities. The Board has processes to manage disclosures in 
compliance with all regulations and Company share trading policies.
All Directors are kept aware of changes in major shareholders in the Company and are available to meet with shareholders who have specific interests or 
concerns within the constraints of not placing any party in a position of advantage.
The Company issues its results to shareholders promptly and also publishes them on the Company’s website. Regular updates to record news in relation 
to the Company and the status of its assets are included on the Company’s website.
The Directors are available to meet with shareholders to discuss any issues and gain an understanding of the Company’s business, its strategies and 
governance. Meetings may also be held with the corporate governance representatives of institutional investors when requested.
At every Annual General Meeting shareholders are given the opportunity to put questions to the Chairman, Executive Directors and to other members of 
the Board that may be present.

Financial risk management and financial instruments
The Group’s policy in relation to financial risk management and use of financial instruments is set out in note 22 to the financial statements.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
Under Company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that year. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates which are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website and for 
the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements. Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Provision of information to auditors
The Directors who held office at the date of approval of the financial statements confirm that, so far as they are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
• each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
KPMG Channel Islands Limited have indicated their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution proposing their reappointment will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Governance
I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committee (“RemCom” or “Committee”) Report for the year ended 31 March 2017. The RemCom comprises 
only Non-Executive Directors with the Chairman being independent. The Terms of Reference take into account the UK Corporate Governance Code 
published in 2014 but applies the Code only in so far as it is consistent with the nature of, size and stage of development of the business. Its objective is 
to design and maintain processes that retain and reward the Executive Directors and senior management in accordance with best practice and to ensure 
that members of the executive management of the Company are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are also, 
in a fair and reasonable manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The RemCom shall agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chairman and Executive Directors. The 
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors shall be a matter for the Chairman and the executive members of the Board. It will ensure that failure is not 
rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised. It will also determine the policy and scope for pension arrangements for each Executive 
Director.
The Committee will arrange for periodic reviews of its own performance and review its constitution and Terms of Reference to ensure it is operating 
effectively and recommend any changes it considers necessary for Board approval.
The Committee is authorised by the Board to obtain, at the Company’s expense, outside legal or other professional advice on any matters within its 
Terms of Reference.
Reporting Responsibilities
The Committee Chairman shall report to the Board on its proceedings after each meeting on all matters within its duties and responsibilities. The 
RemCom shall make whatever recommendations to the Board it deems appropriate on any area within its remit where action or improvement is needed.
The RemCom shall produce a report of the Company’s remuneration policy and practices to be included in the Company’s Annual Report and ensure each 
year that it is put to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
Policy
Non-Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is to pay fees to Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, which are at the lower end of peer group companies listed on 
AIM with the intention of revision in line with the success of the Company. Non-Executives are not currently eligible for bonuses, share options, long 
term incentives, pensions or other remuneration. They are entitled to reasonable expenses made in pursuit of their duties.
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy is to provide remuneration and other benefits sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Executives of the required calibre. Total 
remuneration includes salary, performance-related bonus, benefits (including pension and health insurance) and long-term incentives based on share 
options. The latter are designed specifically to align shareholder interests within the Company over time.
Rewards
The Company’s remuneration policy is based on three pillars: an industry competitive salary, a bonus calculated on fixed performance indicators and a 
Long Term Incentive Share Plan (“LTIP”) with a rolling three-year vesting cycle. The bonus and LTIP are scaled to vary awards but each have a cap at 
100% of salary. The amounts involved are described in the table on page 24.
Salaries
The Company has undertaken to increase executives’ salaries in line with inflation and a 2.5% increase has been awarded for the year ending 31 March 2018.
Bonus
A bonus may be awarded to an employee of the Company. The key performance indicators (“KPIs”) comprise the net asset value, earnings (EBITDA) and 
maintenance of a progressive dividend policy, each evenly weighted. Such bonus awards, against KPIs, will always take regard of the individual 
performance of the Executive and of the business as a whole but remain at the absolute discretion of the Board. Due to the exceptional performance of 
the Company over the year the bonus has achieved the capped amount of 100% of salary.
Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”)
A key employee of the Company may be invited to join the LTIP scheme, the purpose of which is to align the longer-term objectives of shareholders and 
management. Awards will take the form of a conditional right or nil cost option to acquire ordinary shares. There will follow a three-year vesting period 
over which the performance of the Company must satisfy the targets in order that the awards will vest at the end of that period.
There are two equally weighted targets, being total shareholder return (“TSR”) and a fixed hurdle rate for NAV. TSR is a comparison of share price plus 
dividends paid with a bespoke basket of peer companies and REITs. The NAV target is fixed such that a NAV total return (“NAVTR”) of less than 8% will 
not attract a vesting but where the NAVTR is between 8% and 14% the amount vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
The quantum of LTIP awards is restricted to 100% of the equivalent salary of the Executive which will alter from time to time in line with the salary and 
share price. In numeric terms the awards previously granted are capped at 255,034 shares (at a price of £1.49 per ordinary share). 
Remuneration Committee Report 24
Circle Property Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Governance
There are standard good and bad leaver provisions included in the LTIP terms. Where awards vest the beneficiary will be entitled to the notional 
dividends accrued over the three-year period. Standard “claw back” provisions are included as is the absolute discretion of the Board to deal with 
unvested shares.
Defined Contribution Pension Plan
The Company operates a defined contribution pension plan for the Executives and senior management. Currently only John Arnold and Edward Olins 
have been offered this benefit. It has been agreed that the Company contributes 10% of base salary and Executives contribute 5%. John Arnold is 
excused from contribution as his SIPP is closed, and so the Company has made a payment in lieu of pension at a rate of 5%, to bring historic rights up to 
date at year end, and 8% going forward.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Circle Property Plc
We have audited the group financial statements of Circle Property Plc (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively the “group”) for the year ended 
31 March 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no 
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on pages 21 and 22, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit, and express an opinion on, the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the groups’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Highlights of the Year, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive Statement, the Business Model, the Market Overview, 
Our Strategy, the Portfolio Review, the Principal Risks, the Board of Directors, the Governance Report, the Directors’ Report and the Remuneration 
Committee Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on the financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company; or
• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Financials
1 General information
These financial statements are for Circle Property Plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (together referred to as “the Group”). Notes in 
respect of the Company’s subsidiary undertakings are outlined in note 23.
The Company’s shares are admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange plc. The Company is domiciled and registered in 
Jersey, Channel Islands. The address of its registered office is 3rd Floor, Standard Bank House, 47–49 La Motte Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 4SZ.
The nature of the Company’s operations and its principal activities are that of property investment in the UK.
2 Principal accounting policies
The Group financial statements show a true and fair view and have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU and the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. The financial statements have been prepared in 
pounds sterling, which is the Group’s functional currency, and under the historic cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment property 
and derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Statement on page 3. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in these 
financial statements. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Group’s financial management objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and its exposures to credit, liquidity and market risk. The Group’s policy for managing capital is included in note 20.
The Group has adequate financial resources together with long-term rental contracts with a wide range of tenants. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation and business combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, as outlined in note 23.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has variable returns from, its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains 
and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains 
control. They are deconsolidated on the date that control ceases.
If the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is more than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, the difference is 
recognised as goodwill and is written off directly in the statement of comprehensive income if there is no future economic benefit associated with the 
goodwill.
If the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is less than the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, the difference is 
recognised as negative goodwill and is reflected directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Adoption of new and revised IFRSs
New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which came in to effect for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2016 have not 
had a material impact on the preparation of these financial statements.
New standards and interpretations
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 , and 
have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
IAS 12 “Income Taxes” was amended to clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the 
asset’s tax base. This amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The standard is

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of 
financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. The 
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted.
IFRS 16 “Leases” was issued in January 2016. For lessees, it will result in almost all leases being recognised on the statement of financial position, as the 
distinction between operating and finance leases will be removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial 
liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low value leases. The accounting for lessors will not significantly change. 
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group. The Group does not intend to apply any of these pronouncements early.
Estimates and judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenue and expenses during the period. The 
nature of the estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are 
based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
Significant estimates
Fair value of investment property
Investments in property and property-related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property. As a result, valuations 
are subject to substantial uncertainty. There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price 
even where such sales occur shortly after the valuation date. The Directors employed professional valuers Savills (UK) Limited to perform valuations of 
the investment property using Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) valuation standards as at 31 March 2017. Volatility in the economic 
environment is reflected in commercial real estate markets. In arriving at their estimate of market value as at 31 March 2017 , the valuers used their 
market knowledge and professional judgement and did not rely solely on comparable historical transactions. There is an inherent degree of uncertainty 
when using professional judgement in estimating the market values of investment property. 
The significant methods and assumptions used by the valuers in estimating the fair value of investment property are set out in note 13.
Fair value of interest rate contracts
The fair values of interest rate contracts have been calculated and provided by the relevant counterparty bank using recognised valuation techniques. 
Details of the interest rate contracts are set out in note 17.
Significant judgements
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessor
The Group has entered into commercial property leases on its investment property portfolio. The Group has determined that it retains all the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and therefore accounts for them as operating leases.
Revenue recognition
Rental income from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the term of the lease. The term of the lease is the full 
lease period where there is a reasonable expectation at the inception of the lease that the tenant will not utilise the lease break clause. Lease incentives 
granted are spread evenly over the term of the lease.
Property service charges
The properties service charge accounts are managed by third parties and therefore the Group considers that it is acting in the capacity of an agent. 
Service charges receivable from tenants and related costs are not recognised by the Group. Service charge costs in relation to void areas are recognised 
within property expenses on an accruals basis.
Administrative fees, listing costs and other expenses
Administrative and other expenses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises bank and loan interest income. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and net interest on interest rate 
swaps. Finance income and finance costs are recognised on an effective interest rate basis.
Investment property
Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 
“Investment Property”.
2 Principal accounting policies continued 32
Circle Property Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financials
Investment properties, including properties under development, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of consideration given, including 
associated transaction costs. Any subsequent qualifying capital expenditure incurred in improving investment properties is capitalised in the period in 
which the expenditure is incurred and included in the book cost of the properties.
After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. The fair value is based on valuations provided by Savills (UK) Limited at the balance sheet date using recognised valuation techniques.
An investment property shall be derecognised on disposal or at a time that no benefit is expected from future use or disposal. Any gain or loss is 
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount and is recognised in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Recognition and derecognition occurs on the completion of a sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller. Any investment properties on which 
contracts for sale have been exchanged but which had not completed at the year end are disclosed as properties held for sale and stated at fair value. At 
31 March 2017 and 2016 none existed.
In accordance with IAS 40 “Investment Property” property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property is classified as 
investment property during its construction or development. At 31 March 2017 and 2016 none existed.
Technique used for valuing investment properties
The traditional method converts anticipated future cash flow benefits in the form of rental income into present value. This approach requires careful 
estimation of future benefits and application of investor yield or return requirements. One approach to value the property on this basis is to capitalise 
net rental income on the basis of an initial yield, generally referred to as the “All Risks Yield” approach or “Net Initial Yield” approach.
These fair values are based on active market prices where possible, adjusted if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the 
specific assets.
The fair value of investment properties is measured based on each property’s highest and best use from a market participant’s perspective and 
considers the potential uses of the property that are physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible. 
Operating leases
Properties leased out under operating leases, where the Group is the lessor, are included in investment property in the consolidated statement of 
financial position. Please refer to revenue recognition for the discussion of recognition of rental income.
Financial Instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less. These are carried at cost.
Trade and other receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such assets are recognised 
initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value. The subsequent carrying amount of these liabilities approximates their 
fair value.
Loan borrowings
Loan borrowings are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs incurred. Loan borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised, within finance costs, in the income statement over 
the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. The Group’s policy is not to trade in 
derivative instruments. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
Recognition of the derivative financial instruments takes place on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into. Such derivative financial 
instruments are measured initially and subsequently at fair value; transaction costs are included as incurred in the statement of comprehensive income 
under finance costs. Gains or losses on derivatives are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in net gain or loss from financial 
instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Interest expenses on derivative financial liabilities are included as incurred in the statement of 
comprehensive income in finance costs.

Impairment
The Group considers evidence of impairment for financial assets at both an individual asset and a collective level. All individually significant assets are 
individually assessed for impairment. Those found not to be impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not 
yet individually identified. Assets that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment. Collective assessment is carried out by 
grouping together assets with similar risk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information on the timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred, and makes an 
adjustment if current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or lesser than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference between an asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. When the Group 
considers that there are no realistic prospects of recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are written off. If the amount of impairment loss 
subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously 
recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Taxation
The Company, Circle Property Unit Trust (“CPUT”) and CPUT’s subsidiary investments are registered in Jersey, Channel Islands. The Company and CPUT’s 
subsidiaries are taxed at the Jersey company standard rate of 0%. CPUT is not subject to tax in Jersey.
Circle Property Management Limited (“CPML”) was registered in the UK and subject to corporation tax at a rate of 20%. No corporation tax was incurred 
during the year (2016: nil) and CPML was dissolved on 30 May 2017.
The Company is registered under the Non-Resident Landlord Scheme and is liable to UK taxation at a rate of 20% on net rental income from its 
investment properties.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited in profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Share capital
Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are approved.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares are equity shares of the Company held for the purpose of awarding shares in the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). The shares are 
recorded at cost and are deducted from equity.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” to share options. To the extent that the Directors assess this to be material, 
the fair value of the share options are determined at the grant date and are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of 
resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement. If the effect of 
the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre–tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the 
liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired 
subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included within intangible assets. Goodwill is tested annually for 
impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of 
an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Negative goodwill recognised in the year relates to the recognition of additional capital allowances, available to the Group to carry forward against 
future profits, on the acquisition of Circle Property Unit Trust in the prior period.
3 Operating segments
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” which requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about 
components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance. For the purposes of IFRS 8 the CODM takes the form of the two Executive Directors of the Company.
The CODM considers that there is only one geographical segment, which is the UK, and one reporting segment, which is investment in commercial 
property. Therefore no segmental reporting is required.

For the purposes of the above calculation the comparative period is deemed to start from 16 February 2016 being the date on which operating revenue 
and expenditure commenced.
In the opinion of the Board, treasury shares held to satisfy share awards to management, as disclosed in note 21, currently do not have any material 
value and hence do not have any dilutive effect. Therefore no diluted earnings per share has been presented.

The Group has pledged all of its investment properties to secure banking facilities granted to the Group as detailed in note 16.
The fair value of the Group’s investment properties at 31 March 2017 has been arrived at on the basis of a valuation carried out by Savills (UK) Limited. 
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the Practice Statements contained in the Appraisal and Valuation Standards as published by the RICS. 
In forming their opinion of the fair value, the independent valuers had regard to the current best use of the property, its investment attributes and 
recent comparable transactions. The valuation was carried out using the “All Risks Yield” method taking into consideration both sales and rental evidence 
and formulating the opinion of market value taking into account the properties’ locations, specifications and specific characteristics.
All investment properties are categorised as Level 3 fair values as they use significant unobservable inputs. There were no transfers between Levels 
during the year. 38

On 29 September 2016 Compass Contract Services (UK) Limited (“Compass”) surrendered their existing 10 year lease, relating to land and buildings at 
Kents Hill Park, and entered into a new 25 year lease for the same property. The Group made a payment of £4,494,955, inclusive of SDLT and land 
registry fees, to Compass in relation to the surrender of their ten year lease. This payment is recognised as a lease incentive and spread evenly to the 
statement of comprehensive income over the term of the lease.
The Group was party to a loan facility agreement with Circle Property Trading (Maidstone) Limited (“CPTML”). The purpose of the loan was to finance 
CPTML’s acquisition of a 999-year lease of the residential elements of the Group’s property located at 69–77 Week Street, Maidstone, Kent and its 
subsequent refurbishment and development works. Rent is charged under the lease at a rate of one peppercorn (if demanded). The loan was secured by 
a first legal mortgage over the property and a fixed charge over the assets of CPTML. The loan was interest-bearing at a rate of 8% per annum. The loan 
and all interest thereon was repaid on 2 February 2017.

The Group was party to a revolving credit facility (the “previous facility”) with National Westminster Bank Plc (“Natwest”) for a total commitment of 
£39.2m. The facility was secured by the investment properties and rental income detailed in notes 13 and 4 and a security interest agreement over the 
issued share capital of the wholly owned subsidiaries, Circle Property (Milton Keynes) Limited and Circle Property (Warrington) Limited. Interest was 
charged at a rate of 2.95% over LIBOR.
On 21 June 2016 the Directors agreed a £50m revolving facility (the “new facility”) with Natwest for the purpose of refinancing the previous facility. 
The new facility has a three-year term with two options, at the absolute discretion of Natwest, to extend for a further year. Where the loan to value is 
less than 55% of the Group’s gross portfolio value an interest rate of 1.85% over LIBOR is charged, where the loan to value equals or exceeds 55% an 
interest rate of 2.75% over LIBOR is charged. The new facility was drawn down on 22 June 2016 and the previous facility repaid.
The new facility is secured by a first and only legal charge over the Group’s investment properties, an assignment of rental income, charges over 
specified bank accounts of the Group and a floating charge granted over all assets of the Group.
The financial covenants relating to the previous facility were 55% loan to value, 2.25:1 interest cover and 11:1 debt to rent cover. In relation to the new 
facility the financial covenants are 65% loan to value, 1.75:1 interest cover to the second anniversary of the date of the facility agreement and 2.00:1 
thereafter and 11:1 debt to rent cover to the second anniversary of the date of the facility agreement and 10:1 thereafter. There were no breaches of 
any of these covenants during the year.
The undrawn facility as at 31 March 2017 was £4,279,645.

The Group uses interest rate caps and swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a proportion of its variable rate borrowings. 
An interest rate swap entered into with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. (“RBS”), had a notional value of £10,000,000, and a fixed interest rate of 1.98% 
to maturity on 29 September 2016. An interest rate cap, entered into with RBS, has a notional value of £10,000,000 and a strike rate or 3% from 
15 October 2016 to maturity on 31 January 2019.
At 31 March 2017 the fair value of the interest rate cap resulted in an asset of £710 (2016: liability of £94,855). The interest rate cap is fair valued 
using recognised valuation techniques and the movement in fair value has been recorded in profit and loss. 40

2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
By a resolution of the Board dated 29 January 2016, the Company adopted the LTIP for the purpose of properly motivating and rewarding key employees 
of the Group in a manner that aligns their interests with that of the shareholders by measuring performance against shareholder returns over the three 
financial years ending 31 March 2019.
On admission to AIM, the Company issued 255,034 ordinary shares at a price of £1.49 each to be held in treasury subject to award under the LTIP.
A key employee of the Company may be invited to join the LTIP scheme, the purpose of which is to align the longer term objectives of shareholders and 
management. Awards take the form of a conditional right or nil cost option to acquire Ordinary shares. These follow a three year vesting period over 
which the performance of the Group must satisfy the targets in order that the awards will vest at the end of that period.
There are two equally weighted targets, being Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) and a fixed hurdle rate for NAV. TSR is a comparison of share price plus 
dividends paid with a bespoke basket of peer companies and REITs. The NAV target is fixed such that a NAV Total Return (“NAVTR”) of less than 8% will not 
attract a vesting but where the NAVTR is between 8% and 14% the amount vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
The quantum of LTIP awards is restricted to 100% of the equivalent salary of the executive which will alter from time to time in line with the salary and 
share price. In numeric terms the awards previously granted are capped at 255,034 shares (at a price of £1.49 per ordinary share).
There are standard good and bad leaver provisions included in the LTIP terms. Where awards vest the beneficiary will be entitled to the notional 
dividends accrued over the three year period. Standard “claw back” provisions are included as is the absolute discretion of the Board to deal with 
unvested shares.
At the reporting date no Ordinary Shares had vested and the board have concluded that the fair value of the options at the grant date and the period 
end are not material to these financial statements.
22 Financial risk management
The strategy of the Group is to invest in UK commercial property with a view to holding it for capital appreciation whilst enhancing rental and capital 
growth opportunities.
Consistent with that objective, the Group holds UK commercial property investments. In addition, the Group’s financial instruments during the year 
comprised interest-bearing receivable and payable loans, cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its 
operations. The Group does not have any exposure to any derivative instruments other than the interest rate cap entered into to hedge the interest paid 
on the interest-bearing bank loans.
The Group is exposed to various types of risks that are associated with financial instruments. The most important types are credit risk, liquidity risk, 
interest rate risk and market price risk. There is no foreign currency risk as all assets and liabilities of the Group are maintained in pounds sterling.
The Directors review and agree policies for managing its risk exposure. These policies are summarised on the following pages.
These disclosures include, where appropriate, consideration of the Group’s investment properties which, whilst not constituting financial instruments as 
defined by IFRS, are considered by the Board to be integral to the Group’s overall risk exposure.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty to an asset will be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the Group.
In the event of default by an occupational tenant, the Group will suffer a rental shortfall and incur additional costs including: legal expenses; and in 
maintaining, insuring, and re-letting the property. The Board produces regular reports on any tenant arrears which are monitored by the Directors in 
order to anticipate, and minimise the impact of, defaults by occupational tenants.
The carrying amount of financial assets, including cash balances, recorded in the financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk. The carrying amount of these assets at 31 March 2017 was £5,283,875 (2016: £6,501,377). There were no financial assets which were past 
due or considered impaired at 31 March 2017 and 2016.
All of the Group’s cash is placed with financial institutions with a Moody’s long-term credit rating of A3. Bankruptcy or insolvency of such financial 
institutions may cause the Group’s ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed or limited. Should the credit quality or the financial position of 
the banks currently employed significantly deteriorate, cash holdings would be moved to another bank. 42

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter in realising assets or otherwise raising funds to meet financial commitments. The Group’s 
investments comprise UK commercial property. Property and property-related assets in which the Group invests are not traded in an organised public 
market and may be illiquid. As a result, the Group may not be able to liquidate quickly its investments in these properties at an amount close to their fair 
value in order to meet its liquidity requirements.
The Group’s liquidity risk is managed on an ongoing basis by the Directors. In order to mitigate liquidity risk the Group aims to have sufficient cash 
balances (including the expected proceeds of any property sales) to ensure that the Group is able to meet its obligations for a period of at least 12 
months.

Interest rate risk
Some of the Group’s financial instruments are interest-bearing. They are variable rate instruments with differing maturities. As a consequence, the 
Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing market rate.
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group’s bank borrowings. As detailed in note 16, the Group uses an interest rate cap to 
manage exposure to the interest on its bank borrowings. The cap has been entered into with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc on a notional amount of £10m.
As a result, the Group is exposed to changes in prevailing interest rates on the remaining balance of its borrowing detailed in note 16. Having assessed 
the level of risk the Directors have concluded that it is within acceptable limits.
The interest profile of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities after the impact of the interest rate contracts held at the year end are as 
follows:

Loan borrowings 28,966,135 10,000,000 – 38,966,135
When the Group retains cash balances, they are ordinarily held on interest-bearing deposit accounts. The benchmark which determines the interest 
income received on interest-bearing cash balances is the bank base rate which was 0.25% as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 0.5%). The Group’s policy is to 
hold cash on variable rate bank accounts.
The Group has borrowings amounting to £45,720,355 which have interest rates linked to the 3 month LIBOR interest rates. A 1% increase in the LIBOR 
rate will have the effect of increasing interest payable by £457 ,204 (2016: £298,661). A decrease of 1% would have an equal but opposite effect.

Market price risk
The Group holds a portfolio of UK commercial properties. The Group invests in properties which the Directors believe will generate a combination of 
long-term growth in income and capital for shareholders. Investment decisions are based on analysis of, amongst other things, prospects for future 
income and capital growth, sector and geographic prospects, tenant covenant strength, lease length and initial and equivalent yields.
Investment risks are spread through letting properties to low risk tenants. The management of market price risk is part of the investment management 
process and is typical of commercial property investment. The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse valuation movements 
through detailed analysis, with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders. Investments in property and property-related assets are 
inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of each property. As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty. There is no 
assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where such sales occur shortly after the 
valuation date. Such risk is managed through the appointment of independent external property valuers, Savills (UK) Limited.
Any changes in market conditions will directly affect the profit or loss reported through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Details of 
the Group’s investment portfolio held at the balance sheet date are disclosed in note 13. A 10% increase in the fair value of the properties at 31 March 
2017 would have increased net assets and profit for the year by £9,302,500 (2016: £7 ,773,500). A decrease of 10% would have an equal but opposite 
effect.
The calculations are based on the investment property valuations at the respective balance sheet dates.
Fair values
Accounting standards recognise a hierarchy of fair value measurements for financial instruments which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The classification of fair value 
measurements depends on the lowest significant applicable input, as follows:
• Level 1: Unadjusted, fully accessible and current quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and or liabilities, or other directly or indirectly observable inputs which exist for the duration of the period of 
investment.
• Level 3: External inputs are unobservable. Value is the Directors’ best estimate, based on advice from relevant knowledgeable experts, use of 
recognised valuation techniques and on assumptions as to what inputs other market participants would apply in pricing the same or similar 
instruments. All investments in property would be included in Level 3.
All of the Group’s investment properties are classified as Level 3. There have been no transfers of investment properties in or out of Level 3 during the 
year. The Group determines transfers between levels at the end of each accounting period. A table reconciling opening and closing balances of Level 3 
properties is included in note 13 of the financial statements.
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments are not materially different from their carrying values. The classification of the fair value of the 
interest rate cap outstanding at the year end, as detailed in note 17 , is deemed Level 2.
