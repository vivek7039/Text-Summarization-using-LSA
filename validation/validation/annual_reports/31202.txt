Industry overview
$52bn global market: 
This is defined as the geotechnical contracting market within the 
construction industry. It includes China, Japan, Korea and Russia 
– markets where we don’t operate. If removed, the size drops to 
$25bn. It is an estimate based on data from IHS and other local 
sources. Typically geotechnical contracting is around 1% of the 
construction market.
Wide variety of projects: 
Variety in terms of scale, location, end use, geotechnical technique. 
Scale is from around £25k up to more than £10m but typically 
short duration and around £300,000. Locations are spread 
all around the globe. End use covers the full range including 
Infrastructure/Public Buildings, Power/Industrial, Office/
Commercial and Residential. Geotechnical techniques includes all 
our ten product groups (eg bored piling, driven piles, diaphragm 
walls, deep-soil mixing, vibro compaction, anchors/nails).
Meeting market demands
Diverse customer base: 
T ypically no single customer is more than 5% of group revenues 
in a single year. We mostly serve as a sub-contractor working 
for a general contractor, however, we also contract directly.
Fragmented competition: 
Three types of competitor with a large variation between 
geographies. Type one is the global geotechnical contractors 
(three of these), not all present in all markets. Type two is the 
general contractor-owned, national geotechnical contractor. 
Type three is the local, independent geotechnical contractor 
(typically family‑owned businesses).
Niche sub-sector:
Geotechnical solutions are a small, niche sub-sector of 
construction. Growing faster than construction, reflecting:
 – More pressure to build on brownfield and marginal land.
 – More ambitious development and infrastructure projects. Brenner

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
Global market trends offer 
positive opportunities for 
Keller because we excel in 
sophisticated geotechnical 
solutions.
Our group strategy is 
designed to capitalise on 
these trends and our KPIs 
measure our progress in 
doing so.
Our regional business 
units adapt to local market 
conditions in pursuit of the 
group strategy.
Market demand trends 1. Urbanisation and more large-
scale development projects 
This holds for almost all geographies. It is driving growth and 
increased complexity in the market. As urban areas and large 
developments are constructed they require increasingly 
sophisticated solutions. 
More detail on the trend
As our cities grow we demand larger structures capable of 
housing more, creating new working environments, retail 
experiences and large-scale leisure facilities. 
Why this is good for Keller
Keller has both the operational and financial scale to take on 
larger jobs and the largest branch network of any geotechnical 
contractor putting us in nearly all the major metropolitan areas 
around the world. This breadth of market exposure also allows 
us to share new techniques for working in urban areas.
2. Increasing land shortage, 
driving a need to use more 
brownfield and marginal land
Typically in developed nations, means that Keller’s more 
sophisticated ground improvement techniques come into play.
More detail on the trend
Most of the world’s development happens in cities and along 
coastlines, either for metropolitan development, freight or 
commodity terminals and ports. As new facilities are required this 
typically means redeveloping land for a second, third or even fourth 
time; it can even mean reclaiming land from the sea. All of these 
operations require more sophisticated geotechnical techniques.
Why this is good for Keller
With our world-leading geotechnical engineering team, our near 
shore marine capable businesses (Waterway and Austral) and 
the breadth of our product base we are able to cope with the 
most complex challenges when working on brownfield/marginal 
land sites.
3. Infrastructure renewal and 
expansion, eg road, rail, power 
Creates new demand for us, typically operationally efficient 
given scale.
More detail on the trend
As populations grow and current infrastructure ages there is an 
imperative to invest in new, greater capacity. Given the loads 
involved in transport and energy infrastructure the geotechnical 
solution is often sophisticated and large-scale. In cramped 
metropolitan environments new infrastructure typically replaces 
old in-situ, adding complexity to the solution.
Why this is good for Keller
The combination of scale and complexity typical of infrastructure 
projects reduces the field of capable geotechnical contractors, 
meaning only those with the resources and skills to deliver are 
capable of working in this sector. Keller has a very strong 
reputation here given our project portfolio.
4. Increasing demand from 
customers for complete solutions 
Customers want to reduce their burden of managing complexity 
and are trusting us to take on more roles for them. This helps 
make our work more efficient.
More detail on the trend
As projects are executed in more complex environments and to 
a greater scale the geotechnical solutions required are also more 
complex – typically requiring multiple products in one solution, 
plus a number of additional services alongside (eg site clearing, 
excavation works, groundwater management). A large urban 
project may require load-bearing capacity, earth retention and 
water sealing capabilities.
Why this is good for Keller
Keller’s broad product portfolio means our engineers have more 
options to design an effective and efficient solution for our 
clients, plus our project management capabilities mean we can 
integrate other sub-contractors to reduce the management 
burden on our clients.
5. Increasing technical complexity 
The equipment and products required by the market are 
increasing in sophistication and complexity. Our rigs are 
becoming more digital (including monitoring and automatic 
controls), making us more efficient and creating barriers to entry.
More detail on the trend
This is about working smarter, using modern digital tooling to 
better share information with the rest of the supply chain and 
clients, to better analyse how our rigs are working, drive 
productivity improvement and to better monitor the ground 
and job-site to ensure risk-free delivery.
Why this is good for Keller
Keller has a strong history of technology development, 
leveraging our in-house equipment manufacturing team in 
Germany as well as in Hayward Baker and Bencor in the USA 
to develop market-leading data acquisition systems. Through 
Getec we have very strong capabilities globally to integrate 
instrumentation and monitoring solutions into our geotechnical 
projects. Finally, where the market demands it we are BIM 
(Building Information Modelling) capable. All of the above 
contribute to greater transparency into performance and more 
effective collaboration in the supply chain and with clients.

with Trevi is our largest ever design and build ground 
improvement project in the region.
Extensive geophysical surveys and ground investigation 
helped identify the different soil profiles and enabled the 
design of the optimum ground improvement solution. To 
meet the requirements for bearing capacity and mitigate 
the risk of liquefaction, this involved a variety of techniques 
including vibro-replacement, cavity grouting, rapid impact 
compaction, dynamic compaction and replacement.
As urbanisation increases, Keller consistently demonstrates 
that it has the financial strength, operational know-how, and 
capacity to tackle even the largest and most demanding projects.

driving a need to use more 
brownfield and marginal land
Technology transfer supports  
land re-use
As land gets increasingly scarce, there’s greater demand than 
ever for our business units to offer a wider range of innovative 
geotechnical techniques. A great example is Franki Africa, 
our Keller business in South Africa, which is helping transform 
Durban’s former racecourse into a 368,000m
2
 logistics site. 
When it’s completed in 2019, the Clairwood Logistics Park 
will house seven platforms for warehousing, ranging from 
25,000m
2
 to 130,000m
2
. But with the site underlain by soft 
clays up to 38m deep, the project consultants required 
specialist help to stabilise the ground.
Franki tapped into global expertise to offer Columns with 
Mixed Moduli (CMM®). This ground-improvement technology 
developed by Keller combines rigid inclusions and a stone 
column head, carried out with a bottom-feed vibrator system. 
The project calls for more than 46,700 CMM® to be installed 
in grids of 2.5-3.5m in depths of 25m-38m. 
This is Franki’s first ever rigid inclusions project and reflects 
the successful transfer of technology from colleagues 
elsewhere in Keller to the local team.
It’s a great example of how we can tap into our global 
knowledge base and draw on a wealth of experience and 
proven best practice methods to offer the very best solution.

Keller tackles complex subway works
The C$5.3bn Eglinton Crosstown Line is Toronto’s biggest 
ever light rapid transit expansion. Keller’s toolkit of 
techniques, unrivalled in Canada, enabled us to win the 
C$43m contract for the technically complex supporting 
works on the line’s largest and busiest interchange. 
Keller is installing a temporary excavation support shoring 
wall, enabling the construction of a new subway station. 
Surface works include a 30m-deep secant pile wall, soldier 
piles and lagging, 40m-deep structural caissons, jet grouting 
and construction of the traffic deck. Subsurface work involves 
bracing, soil anchors, shotcrete, soil nails and low-headroom 
jet grouting. 
With both the existing north-south Yonge subway line, and 
the busy Eglinton Avenue above staying open, heavy road 
traffic, pedestrians, utilities and overhead power lines, a well 
thought through design was essential, along with careful 
safety and logistical planning.
Infrastructure projects often require complex solutions 
and the ability to deliver them in busy urban environments. 
Keller’s strong reputation in this sector and track record 
of projects like this prove we are more than up to the task.

customers for complete solutions
Foundations for one of the tallest 
buildings in Australia
Queensland’s Gold Coast in Australia is undergoing a huge 
construction boom, with billions of dollars pouring into 
hundreds of developments. One of the most high profile 
is Spirit, a A$1.2bn residential skyscraper that, at 297m, 
will be among the country’s tallest structures. 
After beating stiff competition, Keller was appointed 
as principal contractor for the particularly complex 
foundation works. 
These include site investigation; site clearance and set-up; 
32 x 1,800mm diameter bored piles with precast plunge 
columns; a 250m diaphragm wall 45m deep to form the 
basement; and 53 barrettes for the core foundations. 
Twenty-six of the barrettes have steel plunge columns 
weighing up to 43 tonnes, allowing for a top-down 
construction – a method that allows the tower to be 
progressively constructed above ground at the same 
time as the basement floor slabs are laid below. 
Working closely with the client and our Diaphragm Wall 
Global Product Team, we were able to design a scheme 
that met all the requirements for the extremely high loads 
imposed and reduced the size and complexity of the 
barrettes, saving the client money.
When it comes to complex and high-profile projects, this 
project shows Keller is more than capable of developing 
the optimum solution that adds real value for the client.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5. Increasing technical complexity 
Monitoring success
The Regional Connector Project in Los Angeles links a series 
of light rail stations downtown. Keller company Hayward 
Baker provided compensation grouting to control settlement 
under the structures during twin-bore tunnelling. Sister 
companies Getec and Geo-Instruments provided settlement 
monitoring design, instrumentation, installation, software 
and data management throughout the project. 
Due to site conditions and our commitment to stakeholders 
to provide a non-intrusive monitoring programme, innovative 
mini wireless biaxial tilt meters and water level cells were 
installed in properties above the tunnel route to measure 
structural movement, with four-second response instruments 
used on floor slabs. Accuracies were below 0.1mm.
To measure in-ground settlement above the tunnel boring 
machine, electromagnetic soundings were used to accurately 
drill horizontally on a curve for 450ft from the portal. 
Horizontal inclinometers were then installed one metre apart 
and programmed to read every five minutes. This allowed 
evaluation of the effects of face pressure and tail grouting 
virtually and in real time.
This high-tech instrumentation and proprietary grouting and 
monitoring software with the ability to read data in real time 
allowed complete control of structural movement through 
compensation grouting. And data collected on the first drive, 
meant the second tunnel boring drive could be completed 
at a record rate.
One example of how Keller is working smarter, using modern 
digital tooling to enable informed decision-making, reduce 
risk and improve productivity for our clients.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Group overview 
Financial results
Group revenue for the year was £2,070.6m, up 16% on 2016. 
Constant currency revenue was up 10%, primarily as a result of 
strong organic growth in the EMEA and APAC regions. Constant 
currency revenue in North America was down 4% year on year.
Underlying operating profit was £108.7m, an increase of 14% 
on the £95.3m generated in 2016. On a constant currency basis 
underlying operating profit was up 10%. The group underlying 
operating margin decreased from 5.4% to 5.2%, mainly due to 
lower margins in North America offset by improved profitability 
in EMEA. Pre‑tax Return on capital employed was stable at 15.1% 
(2016: 15.3%).
After taking account of £9.0m of amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, a £21.0m exceptional credit relating to a 
historical contract dispute and other non-underlying items, 
totalling a net £0.6m credit, the statutory operating profit was 
£121.3m (2016: £85.2m). Further details on non‑underlying items 
are given after the discussion of divisional results.
On an underlying basis, after net finance costs of £10.0m 
(2016: £10.2m), the profit before tax was £98.7m, up 16% on 
the previous year’s £85.1m. The underlying effective tax rate 
decreased from 35.0% in 2016 to 25.0% in 2017, mainly due to 
a £9.7m credit for the revaluation of US deferred tax liabilities 
following the recent US tax reforms.
Underlying earnings per share for the year were 102.2p 
(2016: 75.9p), an increase of 35%. On a constant currency 
basis, underlying earnings per share were up 30%.
The statutory profit before tax was up 50% at £110.6m 
(2016: £73.9m). After the statutory tax charge of £23.1m 
(2016: £25.9m), statutory profit after tax was £87.5m 
(2016: £48.0m) and statutory earnings per share were 121.0p, 
compared with 65.7p in 2016. 
Net debt at the year‑end was £229.5m (2016: £305.6m), 
representing 1.3x underlying EBITDA. The financial position 
of the group remains strong with undrawn borrowing facilities 
totalling £194.9m. The group continues to operate well within 
all of its financial covenants.
Cash generated from operations before non-underlying items 
was £136.1m, which represents 77% of EBITDA. This cash 
conversion rate is lower than previous years due to a £28.8m 
increase in working capital mainly as a result of the fourth 
quarter’s like‑for‑like revenue being 16% ahead of the same 
period in 2016.
The group continues to invest in growing and upgrading its 
equipment capability, with net capital expenditure of £74.5m 
in 2017, representing 1.1x depreciation.
Reflecting confidence in 
the group’s prospects, the 
Board recommends a 20% 
increase in the 2017 full 
year dividend.
Peter Hill CBE
Chairman 
12 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Chairman’s statement Dividends
As noted above, the group’s underlying earnings per share 
increased by 35% from 75.9p in 2016 to 102.2p in 2017. About 
12p of this increase was due to the one‑off revaluation of US 
deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted US tax 
reforms. As previously announced, these changes are expected 
to reduce the group’s future effective tax rate from a percentage 
number in the mid-thirties to a number in the high-twenties, 
resulting in an ongoing earnings per share enhancement of 
between 5p and 10p per share each year.
As a result, and reflecting confidence in the group’s prospects, 
the Board has decided to rebase future dividends and accordingly 
recommends a 20% increase in the 2017 full year dividend to 
34.2p (2016: 28.5p). Full year 2017 dividend cover, before 
non‑underlying items, is 3.0x (2016: 2.7x).
This recommendation results in a proposed 2017 final dividend 
of 24.5p per share (2016: 19.25p per share), a 27% increase, to be 
paid on 22 June 2018 to shareholders on the register as at the 
close of business on 1 June 2018. 
The group intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy 
in the future.
Outlook
Our group order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we 
start 2018. Most of our markets remain robust, bidding activity 
is at a healthy level and Keller is well positioned to address the 
market trends of urbanisation and infrastructure growth. Two 
significant loss‑making contracts in APAC in 2017 masked some 
good progress in the region and we continue to expect the 
division to return to profit in 2018. Overall, despite the completion 
of our excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another 
year of underlying progress, albeit with recent currency 
movements expected to result in translational headwinds 
on reported profits.
We are now seeing tangible results from a number of the 
strategic initiatives launched in the last two years. We are 
confident that a combination of these improvement initiatives, 
our technical leadership, wide product portfolio, broad branch 
network and operational strength will continue to drive our 
business forward.

Road Traffic Accident
We were devastated after a serious road accident in July 
of 2017, near Machadodorp, South Africa, left 18 of our 
Franki Africa employees dead and a number seriously injured. 
We provided care and support to those directly impacted and 
trauma counselling was made available for the families of the 
deceased and injured as well as for colleagues. Practical and 
financial arrangements were also made to assist families to 
travel from their homes around South Africa to the various 
hospitals where the deceased and injured had been taken. 
We also advanced financial support for funeral costs and other 
expenses and provided assistance to families and victims to 
claim benefits from pension and insurance providers. 
Memorial services were arranged and held in Machadodorp 
(jointly with our client, the Nkomati Mine), and at Franki Africa 
branches in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.
The hundreds of messages received from all over the world via 
a Keller-wide online condolence board have formed a memorial 
book. An online portal was also established for colleagues to 
make voluntary financial contributions to the victims’ families 
if they wished.
In recognition of those employees involved in the accident, 
Keller has recently established an educational trust to benefit 
the children of the deceased and injured, and partnered with 
Arrive Alive, a major road safety organisation, to improve road 
safety generally in South Africa. On behalf of the Directors, 
I again offer sincere condolences to all of those affected.
Employees
Over 10,000 employees continued to contribute to the group’s

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Chief Executive Officer’s review
Strategic progress
Keller’s vision is to be the world leader in geotechnical solutions. 
We will achieve this through five strategic levers:
 – Growing our product range and entering new markets, 
organically and by acquisition.
 – Building strong, customer-focused businesses.
 – Leveraging the scale and expertise of the group.
 – Enhancing our engineering and operational capabilities.
 – Investing in our people.
Growth
In 2017 we consolidated our positions in our key markets by 
extending our branch network, as well as extending our product 
range. Examples include new branches in Hamburg and Charlotte, 
bringing our soil mixing capability into Singapore and Malaysia, 
our first diaphragm wall jobs in India and introducing new ground 
improvement techniques into South Africa. We also invested in 
a new Keller Marine team to leverage our experience in Australia 
in near-shore marine construction into new geographies. This 
team is already actively bidding work in India and Africa.
We completed two small acquisitions: Geo Instruments in 
North America to enhance our instrumentation and monitoring 
capability and, via our Finnish joint venture, Sotkamon Porapaalu, 
expanding our regional footprint in Finland and gaining capability 
in a specific type of drilled piling. In January, we announced our 
intention to acquire Moretrench, a geotechnical contractor in the 
US. If completed, this acquisition will further strengthen our US 
East Coast presence and add new specialist technical capabilities 
to the group.
Strong business units
During the year we completed the roll-out of our standard 
strategic planning model to all 21 business units. All business 
units now have detailed strategic plans in a common structure, 
incorporating specific action plans which are being implemented. 
In addition, we continue to strengthen our business units through 
functional engagement and active benchmarking of our key KPIs.

Leverage of group and divisional scale
Our procurement capability continues to gain strength and 
traction, with teams now established in each division. Significant 
benefits from this investment are already being realised. We have 
also created one global IT organisation. This pulls together our 
efforts on infrastructure and applications, reducing the burden 
on local teams as well as creating economies of scale.
Enhancing engineering and operations
Our Global Product Teams are helping us focus on R&D 
opportunities, developing product strategies and continuing 
to share best practice and innovations. We also continued to 
make progress on operational productivity, with our 5S roll-out 
implemented across Keller and starting to become part of the 
cultural norm. We will continue to build our ‘lean’ capabilities 
in 2018.
We executed 6,300 projects throughout the world in 2017 . These 
continue to set the standard in the industry and enhance Keller’s 
strong reputation for providing innovative solutions, combined 
with excellent execution focused on our customers’ needs. 
Average project size is still comparatively small at £300k per 
project. Local and smaller projects remain the foundation of 
Keller, supported by our extensive branch network (around 180 
locations) and our skilled local teams who know their markets 
and customers well. We also had significant success in the large 
project domain with many market-leading projects across all 
regions. Most notably, the Caspian project has set the 
benchmark internally for a very well-conceived and executed 
effort in a challenging environment.
The vast majority of our projects were executed well and, 
between them, they generated around £370m of gross profit 
in 2017. In APAC, however, where the difficult pricing and 
contractual environment of the 2015/16 downturn left little 
project contingency, we have underperformed our expectations 
notably on two major Australian projects. Risk and opportunity 
management remain an enduring focus area and we are confident 
that lessons learned from all loss-making projects are being 
shared and absorbed around the group.
Investing in people
Throughout the year we have continued to strengthen our 
business unit leadership. We have appointed new leaders in a 
number of our business units: Canada, Middle East, North East 
Europe, Case and Brazil. We also launched our global Project 
Manager Academy. The Academy will take our younger project 
managers to the next level in their careers, focusing on people, 
commercial and technical leadership skills. 
We continued to make progress in our safety accident frequency 
rate (AFR) performance, with another significant decline in the 
frequency rate from 0.34 in 2016 to 0.23 in 2017. We have cut our 
AFR by around 80% since the introduction of our Think Safe 
programme in 2013. We received many safety accolades from 
customers around the world, with one of our Australian business 
units winning the Rio Tinto worldwide safety award. However, we 
take nothing for granted in this domain, sadly illustrated by the 
tragic road traffic accident in South Africa where 18 of our 
colleagues lost their lives. We thank our whole community in 
South Africa for the support and humanity they showed to all the 
bereaved and their relatives in the difficult time last summer.

2020 benefits target
We said in our 2016 preliminary results announcement that we 
expected to realise £50m of annualised total gross benefits from 
the group’s strategic initiatives by 2020, around half of which was 
expected to be reflected as improved profitability. We broke this 
down as £20m to come from procurement, £20m from operational 
improvements and £10m from growth. Progress against this 
target at the end of 2017 is set out below:
Gross benefits (£m)
2020 
target
Progress 
to date
Procurement 20.0 11.3
Operational improvements 20.0 1.3
Growth 10.0 4.6
50.0 17.2
In the first year of a four‑year programme we have achieved 
around one‑third of the targeted gross benefits. We estimate 
that between £5m and £7m of the benefits realised to date 
have directly impacted profit and are sustainable. Of the rest, 
either their sustainability is as yet unproven or they have been 
leveraged to win more work, or offset by incremental investment 
in strategic initiatives.
Meaningful procurement savings have been achieved from 
national and regional agreements on categories as diverse as 
equipment rental, IT, haulage, spares/consumables and lodging. 
The benefits from Operational improvements to date mainly 
relate to equipment management and maintenance, as the 
programme to introduce lean techniques to project sites is in 
its infancy. Benefits under growth include both those from new 
offices and from a more structured approach to the transfer 
of technology.
Summary
Overall Keller has had a positive year with good growth in group 
revenue and profits. The results were extremely strong in EMEA 
and solid in North America, but disappointing in APAC. Ongoing 
operational improvements, strengthened leadership and market 
recovery should lead to APAC returning to profitability in 2018. 
Our confidence in group fundamentals and the recent US tax 
changes have allowed us to significantly raise the dividend to 
shareholders.
The order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we start 
2018. Most of our markets remain robust and bidding activity 
is at a healthy level. Overall, despite the completion of our 
excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another year 
of underlying progress.

In North America, which accounts for around half the group’s 
revenue, reported revenue increased by 2%, although constant 
currency revenue was down 4%. Underlying operating profit 
was £78.7m, down 14% on a constant currency basis and the 
underlying operating margin decreased from 9.1% to 8.1%. 
After first half 2017 constant currency revenue decreased 10% 
year-on-year, the division returned to year-on-year revenue 
growth in the second half. Whilst the second half profitability 
was lower than in 2016, this was largely due to the impact of 
hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter, which together 
had an estimated negative one‑off profit impact of £3m. 
Looking forward, the year-end North American order book of 
work to be undertaken over the next 12 months was 5% above 
last year. This, together with the improving trend in underlying 
trading, gives us confidence for 2018.
US
The US construction market as a whole remains solid, but with 
significant regional and sectoral variations. Total construction 
spend in the US in 2017 was up 4% on 2016, driven by residential 
construction which grew by 10%. Residential construction has 
the most impact on the group’s Suncoast business. Elsewhere, 
public expenditure on construction was down 3% year‑on‑year 
whilst private non‑residential spend was flat.
Keller’s US business had a mixed year, with varying performances 
across the business units. Our largest North American business, 
Hayward Baker, had a very strong year, producing record results. 
Its business model of undertaking a wide variety of small to 
medium sized contracts across a broad range of products and 
geographies across the US continues to produce good results. 
Following some management changes early in 2017, there was 
a significant improvement in Hayward Baker’s Western region, 
an area which has disappointed in the last two years.
This strong performance however was more than offset by lower 
profits at both Case and HJ Foundation which, between them, 
reported 2017 underlying operating profits around £16m down 
on 2016 and account for the margin decrease in North America. 
For HJ Foundation, the reduction reflects a return to more 
normal levels of profitability after the boom period in its home 
city of Miami in 2015 and 2016, which attracted a major 
competitor to enter the south Florida market. Case had a very 
disappointing year with revenue well down as a result of fewer 
large projects than in previous years, particularly in its Chicago 
base, as well as some difficult projects. Case starts 2018 with 
a strong order book and performance is expected to improve 
in 2018. 
Bencor, acquired in 2015 to give the group access to diaphragm 
wall technology and expertise, had a steady 2017, continuing 
work on the major remediation project at East Branch Dam. 
The business is actively helping the group to bid and execute 
diaphragm wall jobs outside North America. McKinney, which 
had a disappointing 2016, reported an improved result in 2017.
Suncoast, the group’s post-tension business which mainly serves 
the residential construction market, had healthy revenue growth 
in 2017, benefiting from the continued increase in housing starts 
where it operates, particularly in its home state of T exas. However, 
having benefited from raw material price decreases in 2016, 
in 2017 the business faced some significant raw material price 
increases which it was unable to recover from customers in full. 
As a result, profits were significantly down year‑on‑year.
We announced in January that the group was in discussions 
to acquire Moretrench, a geotechnical contracting company 
operating predominantly along the east coast of the US. 
Moretrench has a strong heritage of complex geotechnical 
projects and, in 2016, had revenue of US$170m, normalised 
operating profit of US$9.3m and EBITDA of US$13.9m. Due 
diligence is ongoing and the acquisition is expected to complete 
before the end of March.
Canada
Keller Canada continues to operate in a difficult market and in 
June we announced changes in leadership and some further 
cost-saving measures. These, together with good progress on 
the major C$43m subway contract in Toronto and the refocusing 
of the business towards urban areas, have resulted in the business 
returning to profit in the second half and for 2017 as a whole.

In EMEA, constant currency revenue increased by 26% and 
underlying constant currency operating profit increased by 74%. 
As a result, the underlying operating margin improved from 5.5% 
to 7.2%. 
This significantly higher result is largely the result of two large 
projects, both of which were substantially complete at the 
year-end; the Caspian project and Zayed City in Abu Dhabi. 
Between them, these projects accounted for around £100m 
of revenue and £30m of operating profit in 2017, and together 
account for most of the year‑on‑year profit increase. As these 
are now essentially complete, EMEA’s 2018 revenue and 
profitability will be well down on that achieved in 2017. The 2018 
result however is still expected to be better than that achieved 
in 2016, which also benefited significantly from the Caspian 
project, as a result of a healthy order book and actual and further 
expected improvements in the underlying business. 
Our core businesses in central Europe all performed well, 
reflecting strong project disciplines and growing construction 
markets in Germany, Austria and Poland. Our South East Europe 
business unit, centred around Austria, had its best ever year with 
record revenue, operating profit and operating margin. These 
business units have good momentum and are all also leading the 
way in helping business units elsewhere in the world to expand 
their product ranges, offering them significant expertise, 
resources and training.
The UK had a solid year in 2017, working on a wide variety of 
commercial and infrastructure projects. We have seen a notable 
slowdown in orders in recent months and expect 2018 to be a 
challenging year. However, the major infrastructure projects 
coming up in the UK, most notably HS2, should mean that the 
market for geotechnical work picks up noticeably in 2019 and 2020.
The excellent execution of a major project in the Caspian region, 
currently the group’s largest project, continued throughout 2017. 
At the year-end however, the project, which is now expected to 
exceed US$200m in total, was over 90% complete. 
The group had a very busy year in the Middle East, largely due to 
working on two major projects; an urban development project in 
Zayed City, Abu Dhabi, which is now complete, and the East Port 
Said Development Complex in Egypt, which will complete in the 
first half of 2018. As a result, revenue in 2017 was more than 
double that in 2016 and the operating margin was healthy. There 
are a number of good prospects in the region and the current 
challenge for the business unit is to replenish the order book.
We have now fully integrated Tecnogeo, the business we 
acquired in Brazil in 2016, with Keller’s existing Brazilian 
operation. The business continues to struggle in what remains 
a very difficult market.
Franki Africa performed well in 2017, increasing both revenue and 
profitability. The £40m design and build contract for a foundation 
solution at the Clairwood Logistics Park development near Durban 
has been an excellent example of knowledge and skill transfer 
within Keller, with the project using a technique new to the South 
African market. Performance is exceeding original expectations.
The EMEA division’s order book at the end of 2017, while at 
a healthy level, was around 20% down on this time last year 
reflecting the run off of the large projects. Excluding these, 
however, the year-end order book of work to be undertaken 
over the next 12 months was around 10% up year‑on‑year.

Asia‑Pacific (APAC)
In APAC, constant currency revenue was up 25% with significant 
increases in both Asia and Australia. However the operating loss 
was only slightly less than in 2016, largely as a result of two major 
contracts in Australia, where adverse ground conditions, technical 
issues and a contractual dispute resulted in a total loss on these 
contracts of £14m.
We are changing our leadership of the APAC division. Peter 
Wyton joined the business from AECOM in mid-February 2018 
and will take over from Mark Kliner as President of APAC with 
effect from 1 April 2018.
Our difficult markets in APAC are slowly recovering, with 
encouraging signs of new Australian mining and infrastructure 
projects. The year‑end APAC order book was more than 20% 
above last year which, combined with our ongoing internal 
improvements, means we remain confident of a return to 
divisional profitability in 2018.
Australia
The group’s geotechnical business in Australia had an improved 
year, with revenue significantly up on 2016. Losses were materially 
reduced despite the loss-making joint venture mentioned in the 
2017 interim results announcement. Pricing remains challenging, 
but investment in infrastructure in Australia is robust, the 
business has a good order book and we are hopeful of winning 
some major work on the A$11bn Melbourne Metro extension 
project. As a result, we are confident that this business will return 
to profit in 2018.
It was a very mixed year for the near-shore marine businesses. 
Waterway was already having a difficult year in a tough east coast 
market, before being hit by a surprisingly negative arbitration 
outcome in December in connection with a contractual dispute 
on a project in New South Wales. We have subsequently 
negotiated a settlement with the customer and are undertaking 
remedial works.
Austral, which was acquired in 2015 and operates mainly in the 
west leveraging good relationships with major mining groups, 
had an improved year and has been very busy bidding work in 
recent months as investment in the resources industry returns. 
The business has an excellent order book and is poised for a 
strong 2018. 
Asia
Revenue in ASEAN was broadly flat year ‑on‑year, with a significant 
increase in Malaysia as a result of an improving market and our 
introduction of new products, offset by a significant decrease in 
Singapore following the substantial downsizing of the piling business.
The ASEAN business was still loss-making in 2017, but at a lower 
level than in 2016. The business continued to be challenged by a 
very difficult pricing environment for heavy foundations projects, 
some legacy Resource Piling contracts and additional costs and 
teething problems associated with introducing new products. 
On the positive side, project execution improved significantly in 
the second half. The ground improvement side of the business 
was profitable, helped by the successful large vibro‑compaction 
contract at Changi airport. 
Keller India performed well in 2017. Revenue doubled, the 
operating margin increased and the business continues to build 
its structure and capabilities to enable it to grow further and 
continue to introduce new products.
Underlying performance showed real 
improvement in 2017 while we were 
still challenged by tough competitive 
conditions in a couple of key markets 
and two exceptional loss-making 
outcomes on projects in Australia.

Statutory results
Revenue for the year was £2,070.6m, up 16% on 2016 (£1,780.0m). 
Statutory operating profit was £121.3m, an increase of 42% on 
the £85.2m generated in 2016, mainly due to underlying operating 
profit being £13.4m higher, a £6.7m year‑on‑year increase in 
credits from a historical contract dispute and the 2016 statutory 
operating profit being impacted by a £14.3m exceptional 
restructuring charge. Statutory profit before tax was up 50% 
at £110.6m (2016: £73.9m). After the statutory tax charge of 
£23.1m (2016: £25.9m), statutory profit after tax was £87.5m 
(2016: £48.0m) and statutory earnings per share were 121.0p, 
up 84% on the 65.7p earned in 2016. These statutory results 
include the impact of foreign exchange movements and 
non-underlying items.
Adjusted performance measures
The group’s results as reported under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and presented in the financial 
statements (the ‘statutory results’) are significantly impacted 
by movements in exchange rates relative to sterling, as well 
as by exceptional items and non-trading amounts relating 
to acquisitions. 
As a result, adjusted performance measures have been used 
throughout the Annual Report and Accounts to describe the 
group’s underlying performance. The Board and Executive 
Committee use these adjusted measures to assess the 
performance of the business because they consider them more 
representative of the underlying ongoing trading result and allow 
more meaningful comparison to prior year. Where not presented 
on the face of the consolidated income statement (page 88) 
or cash flow statement (page 91), the adjusted measures are 
defined and reconciled to the amounts reported under IFRS 
in the Adjusted performance measures section on page 125.

 Acquisitions
The constant currency basis (‘constant currency’) adjusts the 
comparative to exclude the impact of movements in exchange 
rates relative to sterling on the translation of the results of 
overseas operations. Retranslating at 2017 average exchange 
rates increases prior year revenue and underlying operating 
profit by £106.0m and £3.5m respectively.
The term ‘underlying’ excludes the impact of exceptional items, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other non-trading 
amounts relating to acquisitions (collectively ‘non‑underlying 
items’), net of any associated tax. Non-underlying items mainly 
comprise a £21.0m exceptional credit relating to a historic 
contract dispute on a project in Avonmouth, in the UK, and 
£9.0m of amortisation of acquired intangible assets. 
Underlying trading results
1
Group revenue for the year was £2,070.6m, up 16% on 2016. 
Constant currency revenue was up 10%, primarily as a result 
of strong organic growth in the EMEA and APAC regions. 
Constant currency revenue in North America was down 4% 
year‑on‑year. The difference between the headline and constant 
currency revenue growth mainly reflects the full‑year benefit in 
2017 of weaker average sterling following the material weakening 
of sterling over the course of 2016. The average US$:£ rate in 
2017 was 1.29, compared with 1.36 in 2016, a weakening of 5% 
in the full-year average rate.
Underlying EBITDA was £177.2m, compared to £158.6m in 2016, 
and underlying operating profit was £108.7m, an increase of 14% 
on the £95.3m generated in 2016. On a constant currency basis 
underlying operating profit was up £9.9m, a 10% annual increase. 
The group’s underlying operating margin decreased from 5.4% 
to 5.2%. The reduction in the margin is attributable to the North 
America Division.
In North America, which represents about half of group revenue, 
underlying operating profit decreased by 9% from £86.9m in 
2016 to £78.7m in 2017. On a constant currency basis, revenue 
was down 4% and underlying operating profit decreased by 14%. 
The operating margin was 8.1% (2016: 9.1%), down as a result of 
regional softness in the Miami and Chicago markets, the home 
cities of HJ and Case respectively. Suncoast, after a very strong 
2016, was impacted by increased raw material prices. In addition, 
the second half result was impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and 
Irma, which together cost the group around £3m. These factors 
were partly offset by a good performance by Hayward Baker, 
the group’s largest US business, and Canada returning to profit.
In EMEA, reported revenue increased by 33% with constant 
currency revenue up 26%. Underlying operating profit increased 
from £30.2m to £53.3m, a 76% increase (74% on a constant 
currency basis), achieving a 7.2% operating margin (2016: 5.5%). 
EMEA’s 2017 result benefited from high‑performing projects in 
the Caspian region and Middle East which are now approaching 
completion. Aside from these projects, the group’s European 
businesses recorded strong growth and profitability in the year. 
However, market conditions in Brazil and Sub-Saharan Africa 
remain challenging.
In APAC, revenue was up 33% on a reported basis with constant 
currency revenue up 25% mainly due to improved market 
conditions in Australia. The APAC Division reported a £16.5m 
underlying loss for the year (2016: loss of £18.0m) with the loss 
only slightly less than in 2016, largely as a result of two major 
contracts in Australia where adverse ground conditions, 
technical issues and a contractual dispute resulted in a total loss 
on these contracts of £14m. Keller India performed well in 2017, 
doubling revenue and increasing operating margin.

Details of the non-underlying items are set out in note 7 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
Interest
Underlying net finance costs were £10.0m (2016: £10.2m). 
Although net debt has declined over the course of 2017, 
average net borrowings during the year were consistent with 
2016. Statutory net finance costs reduced from £11.3m in 
2016 to £10.7m in 2017.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying items before taxation totalled a credit of 
£11.9m in 2017. These comprise:
Amortisation: £9.0m of amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets (2016: £9.7m).
Exceptional contract dispute: A £21.0m credit as a further part 
reversal of a £54.0m exceptional charge taken in 2014 for a 
contract dispute relating to a UK project completed in 2008. 
The project was in connection with the construction of a major 
warehouse and processing facility in Avonmouth, near Bristol. 
As previously announced, the group acquired the relevant 
property in May 2016 pursuant to the dispute settlement 
agreement for £62.0m and subsequently sold it for the same 
amount in 2017. The property was held on the group’s 2016 
balance sheet as a non-current asset held for sale at a value 
of £54.0m. The sale therefore realised an exceptional profit 
before costs of £8.0m. 
In addition, the group received £11.7m of insurance proceeds 
in respect of this dispute in 2017. 
As noted at the time, the original provision was expected to 
be reduced by future insurance recoveries and the sale of the 
property. Taking account of credits in both 2016 and 2017, the 
group has recovered £35.3m of the original £54.0m provision. 
No significant further recoveries are expected. 
Other: A net credit of £0.6m (2016: £0.3m) relating to changes in 
estimated contingent consideration payable in respect of recent 
acquisitions, offset by finance charges of £0.7m.
Further details of non-underlying items are set out in note 7 
of the consolidated financial statements.
25 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Tax
The group’s underlying effective tax rate was 25.0%, a significant 
reduction on the 2016 effective rate of 35.0%. This is mainly 
attributable to a £9.7m non‑cash credit as a result of the 
revaluation of US deferred tax liabilities following the recent US 
tax reforms, as well as, to a lesser extent, a lower proportion of 
the group’s profit before tax being earned in the US.
A non‑underlying tax credit of £1.6m has been recognised, 
representing the net tax impact of the 2017 non-underlying items. 
Earnings and dividends
Underlying earnings per share increased by 35% to 102.2p 
(2016: 75.9p), in line with the increase in the group’s underlying 
profit after tax. 
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 24.5p per 
share (2016: 19.25p per share), which brings the total dividend 
for the year to 34.2p (2016: 28.5p), an increase of 20% for the 
year. The 2017 dividend cover before non-underlying items was 
3.0x (2016: 2.7x).
The group’s policy on dividends is to increase the dividend 
sustainably so that the group is able to grow, or at least maintain, 
the level of dividend through the market cycle. Keller Group plc 
has distributable reserves of £136.3m at 31 December 2017 that 
are available immediately to support the dividend policy, which 
compares to the total proposed dividend for 2017 of £24.6m. 
Keller Group plc is a non-trading investment company that 
derives its profits from dividends paid by subsidiary companies. 
The dividend policy is therefore impacted by the performance of 
the group which is subject to the principal risks and uncertainties 
disclosed on pages 39 to 41 as well as the level of headroom on the 
group’s borrowing facilities and future cash commitments and 
investment plans.
Cash flow and financing
1
In 2017, underlying cash generated from operations was £136.1m 
(2016: £135.7m), representing 77% (2016: 86%) of underlying 
EBITDA. The 2017 cash conversion is below that of previous 
years largely as a result of constant currency fourth quarter 
revenue being 16% up on the equivalent period in 2016, leading 
to higher levels of working capital at the year end, and an 
increased value of inventory at Suncoast following steel price 
increases in the year. Historically, the group has an excellent 
record of converting profits into cash, with the aggregate of the 
last 10 years’ of cash generated from operations representing 
96% of EBITDA (2016: 98%). 
Net underlying capital expenditure totalled £74.5m (2016: £73.0m), 
compared to depreciation and amortisation of £68.5m. The 
group continues to invest in transferring technologies into new 
geographies and to upgrade the equipment fleet. 
At 31 December 2017, net debt amounted to £229.5m (2016: 
£305.6m). The decrease in net debt is explained as follows:
£m
Net debt at 1 January 2017 (305.6)
Free cash flow 23.4
Dividends (21.2)
Foreign exchange movements 7.8
Non-underlying items
2
72.6
Acquisitions (6.5)
Net debt at 31 December 2017 (229.5)
Based on net assets of £472.2m, year‑end gearing was 49% 
(2016: 71%).
The group’s term debt and committed facilities principally 
comprise $165m of US private placements, $40m of which 
matures in 2018 with the remainder maturing between 2021 and 
2024, a £250m multi‑currency syndicated revolving credit facility 
expiring in September 2019 and a $62.5m revolving credit facility 
expiring in September 2019. At the year end, the group had 
undrawn committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities 
totalling £194.9m.
The most significant covenants in respect of our main borrowing 
facilities relate to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, EBITDA 
interest cover and the group’s net worth. The group is operating 
well within all of its covenant limits. The most critical is net debt 
to EBITDA and at the year end the group’s net debt to EBITDA 
ratio, calculated on a covenant basis, was 1.5x, well within the 
limit of 3.0x.
Impact of Brexit
The UK referendum vote to leave the European Union is expected 
to lead to a period of prolonged economic and political uncertainty 
in the country. Whilst this is likely to impact our operations in the 
UK, Keller’s UK business represents less than 3% of group revenue.
After the Brexit vote in 2016, sterling weakened considerably 
against most currencies. Virtually all Keller’s earnings and most 
of its debt are in foreign currencies, primarily the US dollar. As a 
result, there has been a full‑year beneficial effect on Keller’s 2017 
profits when translated into sterling compared to only a part‑
year effect on 2016.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Finance Director’s review
continued Capital structure and allocation
The group’s capital structure is kept under constant review, 
taking account of the need for and availability and cost of various 
sources of finance.
The group’s objective is to deliver long-term value to its 
shareholders whilst maintaining a balance sheet structure that 
safeguards the group’s financial position through economic 
cycles. In this context, the Board has established clear priorities 
for the use of capital. In order of priority these are:
(i)  To fund profitable organic growth opportunities
(ii)   To finance bolt‑on acquisitions that meet the group’s 
investment criteria
(iii)  To pay ordinary dividends at a level which allows dividend 
growth through the cycle
(iv)  Where the balance sheet allows, to deploy funds for the 
benefit of shareholders in the most appropriate manner.
The deployment of funds to shareholders other than through 
ordinary dividends is unlikely to be considered when the group’s 
net debt to EBITDA is above 1.5 times, or where it might result 
in net debt exceeding 1.5x EBITDA, after taking account of other 
investment opportunities and the seasonality of cash flows.
Pensions
The group has defined benefit pension arrangements in the UK, 
Germany and Austria. 
The group’s UK defined benefit scheme is closed for future 
benefit accrual. The last actuarial valuation of the UK scheme 
was as at 5 April 2014, when the market value of the scheme’s 
assets was £35.8m and the scheme was 77% funded on an 
ongoing basis. Following the valuation, the level of contributions 
increased marginally to £1.6m a year, a level which will be 
reviewed following the next triennial actuarial valuation. The 
actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2017 is still ongoing. The 2017 
year-end IAS 19 valuation of the UK scheme showed assets of 
£46.1m, liabilities of £58.9m and a pre‑tax deficit of £12.8m.
In Germany and Austria, the defined benefit arrangements only 
apply to certain employees who joined the group prior to 1991. 
The IAS 19 valuation of the defined benefit obligation totalled 
£16.4m at 31 December 2017. There are no segregated funds 
to cover these defined benefit obligations and the respective 
liabilities are included on the group balance sheet. 
All other pension arrangements in the group are of a defined 
contribution nature.
Management of financial risks
Currency risk
The group faces currency risk principally on its net assets, 
most of which are in currencies other than sterling. The group 
aims to reduce the impact that retranslation of these assets 
might have on the balance sheet by matching the currency of its 
borrowings, where possible, with the currency of its other net 
assets. A significant portion of the group’s borrowings are held in 
US dollars, Canadian dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Singapore 
dollars and South African rand, in order to provide a hedge 
against these currency net assets.
The group manages its currency flows to minimise currency 
transaction exchange risk. Forward contracts and other 
derivative financial instruments are used to hedge significant 
individual transactions. The majority of such currency flows 
within the group relate to repatriation of profits, intra‑group loan 
repayments and any foreign currency cash flows associated with 
acquisitions. The group’s foreign exchange cover is executed 
primarily in the UK.
The group does not trade in financial instruments, nor does 
it engage in speculative derivative transactions.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is managed by mixing fixed and floating rate 
borrowings depending upon the purpose and term of the 
financing. As at 31 December 2017, approximately 90% of the 
group’s third‑party borrowings bore interest at floating rates.
Credit risk
The group’s principal financial assets are trade and other 
receivables, bank and cash balances and a limited number of 
investments and derivatives held to hedge certain of the group’s 
liabilities. These represent the group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The group has stringent procedures to manage counterparty 
risk and the assessment of customer credit risk is embedded 
in the contract tendering processes. Customer credit risk is 
mitigated by the group’s relatively small average contract size, 
its diversity, both geographically and in terms of end markets, 
and by taking out credit insurance in many of the countries in 
which the group operates. No individual customer represented 
more than 5% of revenue in 2017.
The counterparty risk on bank and cash balances is managed 
by limiting the aggregate amount of exposure to any one 
institution by reference to their credit rating and by regular 
reviews of these ratings.

through the market cycle
In providing geotechnical 
solutions, Keller operates 
in the initial stages of the 
construction value chain. 
Whilst the value chain and 
construction process varies 
significantly from project to 
project, Keller is typically the 
first contractor on‑site and 
the first off‑site. Ensuring 
our work is done efficiently 
is critical for our customers 
in saving them money and 
providing a sound platform 
for the remaining work on 
a project. 
Our projects are often for 
a short duration and the 
majority have an average 
value of £300,000. We work 
across the construction 
spectrum. Very often we 
will partner with a main 
contractor on a bid. 
Depending on the nature of 
a project, Keller may provide 
insights into design and other 
phases of the construction 
process but generally value 
is created and captured 
principally from our 
groundwork activities. 
Our products and services 
are not solely foundations 
for construction but are 
commonly used for other 
applications to solve complex 
geotechnical problems, such 
as earth retention, urban 
redevelopment and near-
shore marine structures. 
We are unique given our 
market-leading positions 
derived from combinations 
of technology, scale and 
customer relationship 
leadership.

solutions.
In 2017 , we continued to 
make progress in delivering 
against our strategy. There 
are five levers: 
Strategic lever Progress
Growth
Growing our product range and entering new markets, 
organically and by acquisition
We have a set of target product segments based on growth, 
profit and strategic considerations; leveraging our 10 major 
product groups into new markets where relevant. 
We also have a set of target geographies to either consolidate 
market position or open up new markets. 
We maintain a short-list of potential acquisitions to help us 
access target markets, where required.
In 2017, we introduced new products into our existing geographies with our current product range, 
bringing the benefit of our experience in one locale to create market‑leading capabilities in 
another. Examples of this type of organic growth investment include bringing soil mixing capability 
into Malaysia and new ground improvement techniques into South Africa.
We also invested in a new Keller Marine team to leverage our strong experience in Australia (Waterway 
and Austral) into new geographies. This team is already active bidding work in India and Africa.
During the year we also completed two smaller strategic acquisitions. We acquired Geo 
Instruments in North America to complement our Getec instrumentation and monitoring 
capability in that Division. We also acquired Sotkamon Porapaalu in Finland, both expanding our 
regional footprint and gaining capability in a specific type of drilled piling.
Customers
Building strong, customer-focused local businesses
Geotechnical contracting is a local business that demands 
local expertise and relationships. We will continue to focus 
on and satisfy the needs of our customers at local level.
Our businesses evaluate the quality of their customer feedback 
(amongst other things).
Our businesses offer two routes to value creation: 
high operational utilisation and/or strong technical 
differentiation.
During the year we completed our first full business unit level standard strategy roll out. All 21 
businesses now have strategic plans to a high standard in a common format. While the plans were 
built ‘bottom-up’ we have been careful to align them ‘top-down’ with group and divisional 
strategies. The multi‑year plans are a first for Keller in a historically short‑term industry.
In 2017 we worked on our customer feedback programme to expand our understanding and 
insights on more projects in more local markets. This improves our ability to spot trends in our 
performance and better target improvement programmes. Already we are seeing the benefit 
that our strong customer orientation and schedule adherence has on satisfaction scores.
We have also been investing organically in strengthening our local branch network. Examples 
include: Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, Hamburg and Hannover, Germany, Cancun and Mexico 
City, Mexico. These actions typically involve adding local sales and project management capability 
either in new or existing offices.
Scale
Leveraging the scale and expertise of the group
Keller has globally leading expertise and a corporate structure 
that allows us to bring the best of Keller to every customer 
engagement. We will be investing in the tools and processes 
to make this more effective and efficient.
Synergies in operating model will be selectively implemented 
so that we don’t lose local responsiveness.
Keller’s scale provides security for customers and employees 
through resilience to risk.
Our group level procurement capability has gained real strength and traction in the last year. 
For instance, by combining our equipment buying power around the world we have signed new 
framework agreements with a number of suppliers, improving financial and service terms. 
Benefits from this investment are already being realised.
In our customer relationships we have also been leveraging the scale of the group this year by 
working with regional and global clients to bring the benefits of working with the connected 
companies of Keller. For example, working with a global client to develop common business 
around the world that previously would have been managed in silos.
This year we have taken the step to create one global IT organisation. This pulls together our 
efforts on infrastructure and applications, reducing the burden on local teams as well as creating 
economies of scale. One example of improvement is our approach to electronic security and 
data protection.
Engineering and operations
Enhancing our engineering and operational capabilities
We are investing in connecting our global network of engineers 
and project managers to share best practices on project 
execution, equipment management and maintenance and 
technology innovation.
Our global supply chain is optimised to balance equipment 
utilisation with efficient transport.
We aim to be a leader and investor in new technologies.
An example of sharing best practices on project execution over the past year is the Polavaram 
Dam project. The project involves the construction of a 3km long, 30m deep groundwater 
barrier using our jet grouting capability. Delivery of this project has included bringing subject matter 
experts and equipment from Poland and the US to India.
We have also continued to make progress on operational productivity, with our 5S roll out hitting 
all divisions and starting to become part of the cultural norm. We are already seeing productivity 
and safety benefits from site‑level standardisation of operations, equipment and tool 
management and communications.
Our software algorithms help find optimal design solutions with the right balance between 
performance and cost. This is a unique capability and is helping us differentiate in all of our divisions. 
People
Investing in our people
We are investing in developing the talent of our employees 
to help deliver world-class solutions to our customers as well 
as creating opportunities for all to maximise their potential.
We continue to strive for leadership in HSEQ.
Throughout the year we have continued to strengthen our business unit leadership. We have 
created new opportunities for talent in many locations, including Keller Brazil, Canada, Middle East, 
North East Europe and Case Foundations. Each of these changes has helped us strengthen our 
local teams while also demonstrating our strong internal management development pipeline.
This year we also launched our Project Manager Academy. The Academy will take our project 
managers to the next level in their careers, focusing on people, commercial and technical 
leadership skills. This programme is very important because project managers have one of the 
most critical roles in our company: they are involved in work winning, execution and skills 
development in all of our markets.

Dam project. The project involves the construction of a 3km long, 30m deep groundwater 
barrier using our jet grouting capability. Delivery of this project has included bringing subject matter 
experts and equipment from Poland and the US to India.
We have also continued to make progress on operational productivity, with our 5S roll out hitting 
all divisions and starting to become part of the cultural norm. We are already seeing productivity 
and safety benefits from site‑level standardisation of operations, equipment and tool 
management and communications.
Our software algorithms help find optimal design solutions with the right balance between 
performance and cost. This is a unique capability and is helping us differentiate in all of our divisions. 
People
Investing in our people
We are investing in developing the talent of our employees 
to help deliver world-class solutions to our customers as well 
as creating opportunities for all to maximise their potential.
We continue to strive for leadership in HSEQ.
Throughout the year we have continued to strengthen our business unit leadership. We have 
created new opportunities for talent in many locations, including Keller Brazil, Canada, Middle East, 
North East Europe and Case Foundations. Each of these changes has helped us strengthen our 
local teams while also demonstrating our strong internal management development pipeline.
This year we also launched our Project Manager Academy. The Academy will take our project 
managers to the next level in their careers, focusing on people, commercial and technical 
leadership skills. This programme is very important because project managers have one of the 
most critical roles in our company: they are involved in work winning, execution and skills 
development in all of our markets.

Good health and well-being 
Keller’s first five‑year health and safety strategic plan, ‘Think 
Safe’, ran from 2013 to the end of 2017. We have made some 
welcome improvements in employee safety performance over 
the period and for 2017 we are pleased to report that the group 
has reached a record low in the rate of recordable incidents of 
0.23 per 100,000 hours worked.

Accident Frequency Rate (AFR)
We have reduced the severity of incidents with major injuries 
improved by 42% since 2016, down from 19 in 2016 to 11 in 2017, 
and the number of incidents resulting in lost time (over one day 
away from work) has reduced by 12%. 
We did see an increase in the number of reported property 
damage incidents for the year, totalling 582 (2016: 580): this is 
against a continued reduction in the number of overhead utility 
strikes (down by 46%), underground utility strikes (down by 4%) 
and incidents involving mobile equipment (down by 5%) 
compared to 2016.
Our largest challenge in 2017 related to the increase in the number 
of small and large rigs becoming unstable and overturning. In 
2017, 15 rigs overturned on our sites (2016: 4). We were fortunate 
that there were no injuries to employees or third parties in these 
events: we have promoted a comprehensive programme of 
training to both our employees and our customers. Keller’s 
HSEQ Committee provided oversight and robust challenge to 
management on its progress in this area during the year and 
further details of this can be found on page 51. 
Our systematic approach to behavioural change has improved 
our performance in the medium term and will achieve the cultural 
changes we are seeking in the longer term. In 2018, we will 
maintain our focus on continued improvement in health, safety 
and wellbeing whilst we develop our plan for delivery for the next 
five years. 
Our sustainability 
commitments
Our values align to the United Nations Sustainability Development 
Goals (SDGs) which provide a universal language for sustainability 
and provide a framework to guide all businesses in this area 
regardless of size, complexity or location. 
In 2016, we set out our support for the SDGs and agreed to 
report annually against those aligned to our current sustainability 
commitments and reporting framework: 
Good health and well-being 
Quality education 
Gender equality 
Decent work and economic growth 
Climate change 
Life on land 
In 2017, we have defined our longer‑term sustainability ambitions 
and commitments and in 2018 we will formalise and report on 
our plan for delivery for the next five years. We have started to 
align our ambitions with our activities and initiatives across our 
functions; define our targets and how we measure our progress 
against them; and drive an internal understanding and change 
within our business units. 
Our functional activities include: reinvigorating our HSEQ 
leadership and capability; launching our HR strategic delivery 
plan, ‘Keller People’; increased Engineering focus on sustainable 
products and solutions; and our refreshed ethics and compliance 
agenda will continue to underpin how we deliver.
We have been working in collaboration with the University of 
Surrey Centre of Environment and Sustainable Development 
and Cambridge’s Centre of Sustainable Development to 
further understand the impact of the SDGs with regards to the 
construction sector and, specifically, embodied carbon in 
products. Much of Keller’s revenue is from client projects that 
are part of climate adaptation and thus provide social net benefit 
to many communities. Keller remains committed to better 
understanding its contribution to climate change and working 
collaboratively with stakeholders to reduce potential impacts.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Quality education 
Keller actively supports the education of its people in a variety 
of ways. In addition to safety, technical and competency-based 
training, graduate and management training programmes 
operate at a group and at a divisional level.
We are focused on improving the skills and competencies of 
employees and have developed a number of bespoke training 
programmes for employees: as a group, we are constantly 
looking at how we share these leading best practices across all 
of our businesses. Our goal is to combine the individual career 
aspirations of our employees with our business needs, ultimately 
ensuring knowledge is transferred and retained in the business 
as well as training our future leaders – our talent pipeline.
Case study
Keller Project Manager Academy
In 2017, 24 project managers from around the world gathered 
in Park City, Utah, for Keller’s first‑ever Global Project Manager 
Academy. As Keller becomes a more interconnected global 
company – sharing best practice, technologies and people – 
it’s vital that we give our clients a consistent level of service 
across the world. That’s the aim behind a new training and 
development initiative, the Project Manager Academy. 
The five‑day Academy covered a broad range of topics, such 
as contracts, planning, risk assessment, change management, 
decision‑making and finance. It also explored ‘softer’ skills, 
like communication, coaching, goal-setting, leadership and 
emotional intelligence. The group will reconvene for a second 
workshop in February in Dallas to explore how they’ve put into 
practice what they’ve learned. Plans are also underway for 
Academies in APAC and EMEA in 2018.
Gender equality 
We promote working together to create an environment where 
everyone at Keller has equal opportunities to achieve their full 
potential, diversity can flourish, everyone is respected, and talent 
is recognised and developed. No employee will be discriminated 
against due to their age, gender, race, religion, national origin, 
sexual preference or gender identity. This is not only about ‘being 
fair’, it also makes sound business sense. 
We believe that equal opportunity means hiring and retaining the 
best people, developing all employees to their potential and using 
their talents and resources to the full. Diversity of people, skills 
and abilities is a strength which will help us to achieve our best.
However, there is clearly room for improvement and more for 
us to do in this area. During 2017, we updated our diversity and 
inclusiveness policies and, in 2018, will develop our plan for 
delivery for the next five years. 
At the end of the financial year, the breakdown of male/female 
employees was as follows:

Case study
The recent International Women in Engineering Day focused 
attention on the amazing careers in engineering and technical 
roles for girls, and celebrated the achievements of outstanding 
women engineers. To mark the event, we asked three Keller 
colleagues from around the world to share their experiences 
as female engineers, which can be found on our website at 
www.keller.com.
Katja Maihold
Branch Manager, Hamburg, Germany
“As a female engineer with Keller, my experiences in being 
accepted have predominantly been positive. Sometimes 
women are expected to be loving, friendly and more reserved. 
Restraint, however, is not usually a useful characteristic for 
running a construction site or being successful in negotiations! 
There’s also a tendency to view women with ambitious 
character traits negatively compared to men. At times I’ve 
found it difficult to be accepted by customers, but over the 
years it has become easier – in fact I’d say that sometimes 
it’s been a positive.
I’d like to see us playing a more active role in searching for 
women at universities and promoting them – challenging 
the established view that construction companies aren’t 
interested in female engineers.”

Our employees
Keller employs around 10,000 people worldwide, most of whom 
are working in front-line roles meeting with, and delivering for, 
our customers. 
As a group, we believe in treating all employees with fairness, 
encouragement and respect and we do not tolerate any 
behaviour or attitude that discriminates against anyone, coerces, 
intimidates, bullies or harasses others, or threatens them with 
verbal or physical violence. We support every individual’s human 
rights and refuse the use of child labour and forced labour under 
any circumstances. 
One of the ways in which we measure how well we are doing 
as an employer is to measure our staff turnover, and this key 
performance indicator for each Division is shown in the 
Operating review on pages 18 to 23.
Communities
Geotechnical community
Our companies take a leadership role within their industry by 
providing employees, customers, suppliers and potential 
employees with technical papers, seminars, field trips and site 
visits. Staff from companies throughout the group maintain 
close contact with partner universities in order to share best 
practice and provide examples of their leading-edge engineering. 
Many of our senior managers play key roles in the geotechnical 
construction industry’s professional associations and activities 
around the world, getting involved in writing building codes, 
specifications, guidelines, and industry‑wide safety initiatives.
Wider community
In terms of engagement with the wider community in which we 
work, we are generally working for a main contractor, who is the 
party responsible for consulting with any community affected by 
the project. Our work comes at the outset of a project and we 
are typically on and off the project very quickly; and our job sites 
are often in remote locations, where we have no interface with 
members of the public. There are occasions when we are 
working in built-up areas or in proximity to the public, and on 
these projects we strive to reduce our noise and dust levels and 
to conduct our work in a considerate manner.
Typically, where we have some community engagement, it is by 
supporting our employees when they get involved with community 
groups and local charities. 
Case study
RAPID project (ASEAN):
The largest and most complex project ever performed by 
Keller Malaysia was a global effort that lifted safety standards 
and project management capabilities across the region.
In 2015, Spanish contractor Tecnicas Reunidas won the tender 
for a multi-billion dollar oil and gas development in Johor, 
Malaysia. The company was new to Johor and required 
experienced local contractors to perform the works. With more 
than 30 years’ experience in the region, Ansah (Keller’s driven 
piling business based in Malaysia) was selected as the 
contractor for driven piles and micropiles works and after a 
good performance was invited to tender for other works on 
the project so that works eventually included earthworks, 
foundations for oil pipes and structures (such as pilecaps and 
sleepers), roads, storm water drains and pre-stressed bridges.
As a specialist subcontractor, most projects performed by 
Keller ASEAN involve less than 50 staff. However, the need for 
a trusted source of local expertise meant it was engaged as the 
main subcontractor on the RAPID project, managing more than 
25 local subcontractors and coordinating the activities of more 
than 700 people working on-site. 
The largest challenge Ansah faced was that Keller’s safety 
standards were much higher than the local subcontractors 
were used to. Keller developed a large programme of activity to 
get them on board with our way of thinking, train them to work 
according to the higher standards, monitor their progress and 
reward them along the way. It was a huge effort, but critical to 
delivering the project safely and on schedule.
In February 2017, the project was awarded the best 
subcontractor in terms of operation and health, safety and 
environment performance. “It’s a wonderful achievement,” 
says Seah Yeow Teck, General Manager of New Territories 
for Keller ASEAN. “Not only will we deliver the project to a high 
standard of quality and safety, but the local subcontractors are 
now trained to deliver projects to this standard in the future. 
So we’ve really had an impact on the communities in which 
we work.”

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview Third-party assurance statement
Keller Group plc appointed Carbon Credentials to provide 
independent verification against the ISO 14064‑3 standard 
on the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG accounts presented (left). 
Their summary opinion is provided below (full opinion and 
recommendations are available on request).
“Based on the data and information provided by Keller and the 
processes and procedures conducted, Carbon Credentials 
concludes with limited assurance there is no evidence that the 
GHG assertion:
 – is not materially correct;
 – is not a fair representation of the GHG emissions data and 
information; and
 – is not prepared in accordance with the criteria listed above.
It is our opinion that Keller has established appropriate systems 
for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data 
for determination of these GHG emissions for the stated 
period and boundaries.”
Climate action 
In terms of Keller’s contribution to global efforts to mitigate 
climate change, it has committed to developing a science-based 
target for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions using a validated 
methodology and using 2016 data as a baseline. To ensure 
transparency to investors and other stakeholders we participate 
in the CDP Climate Change reporting programme annually and 
have seen our score increase year on year to an A‑ in 2017 (this 
relates to activities and emissions in 2016). This compares 
favourably with both our competitors and clients alike.

internal guidance note on reducing energy usage in the business 
has been developed and will be rolled out in 2018.

continued Life on land 
Keller has improved its processes for the capture and recording 
of environmental incidents and, as a consequence, we have 
seen a slight increase in the number of reported environmental 
incidents in 2017 (12% year on year). Most incidents were low 
impact involving spillages from diesel and hydraulic fluid; however, 
we had one significant incident in Australia when 20 cubic metres 
of bentonite was released. Keller employees worked to contain 
and clean‑up the affected area resulting in minimal environmental 
contamination of flora and fauna. 
We continue to engage with our employees, primarily on-site, 
to reduce the potential for such incidences. The roll out of our 
lean techniques and continued site supervisor talks and poster 
campaigns will help us in reducing these incidents significantly.

Case study
Bat cave: AUSTRALIA
Area Mine C is an iron ore mine in the Pilbara; a large, dry, thinly 
populated region in the north of Western Australia. As an 
environmental condition of its lease, BHP Billiton had to build 
a new home for the resident ghost bats, so named because the 
thin membrane of their wings makes them appear ghostly at 
night. Ghost bats, or false vampire bats, are native to Australia, 
and with a total population of less than 10,000, are listed as 
a vulnerable species.
Because of the location in the middle of the desert, 
constructability was a real issue. While not one of their typical 
jobs, BHP Billiton asked Keller company Austral to construct 
the bat cave, due to their local relationship and knowledge.
As bats can’t latch onto a smooth surface, Austral used 
pre-cast beams and poured rough concrete over, to create the 
right environment inside. To stop snakes, they also built a block 
wall at the entrance. They can’t climb over the wall, but as the 
bats always fly high, they’re not affected. Built four metres 
under the ground, the bat cave is about 20-30 metres long, 
with an entrance 1.3 metres high and wide.
Austral says: “They’ve recorded bats going in and out so we 
know it’s being used. But you can’t look inside, so it’s hard to 
tell just how many have made it their new home.”

Our ways of working
Keeping everyone healthy and safe 
We believe no one should be harmed as a result of any work 
we do – so everyone stays safe and well.
Supporting employees’ rights and diversity
We value, support and protect the rights and dignity of the 
individual and the diversity of our people – so we are all 
treated with respect.
Maintaining ethical and honest behaviour
We are always honest, act with integrity and comply with the 
law – so everyone trusts us.
Staying free from bribery and corruption
We always make sure we are free from bribery and 
corruption – so people know our decisions are made for the 
right reasons.
Keeping our communications open and responsible
We communicate openly, honestly, clearly and responsibly.
Delivering excellent customer service and working with our 
suppliers to ensure our standards are adhered to
We work to meet our customers’ needs and exceed their 
expectations – so they work with us again and again. We 
ensure we build constructive relationships with our suppliers 
and they understand our ways of working and the standards 
we operate by. 
Working within the community
We act responsibly and respectfully towards the 
communities we work in – because we are a part of them.
Protecting our environment
We respect and protect the environment, and minimise 
our impact on it – so we safeguard the future.
Standing up for what’s right
We always speak up when we believe our ways of working 
are being undermined – so we uphold our ways of working 
together.
Our Code of Business Conduct – continuous 
improvement
In 2016, we set out our high standards and guidance on how 
we work in a simple Keller Code of Business Conduct. 
During 2017, we completed online and face to face training 
on our ways of working across our businesses and 
established a network of Ethics and Compliance Officers 
who work in our business units alongside management, 
ultimately reporting into the Company Secretary. Keller’s 
externally facilitated whistleblowing hotline has been in 
place since 2015 and employees can access the hotline by 
post, website, email and telephone. Reports of potential 
breaches of our Code made to our ECOs or through the 
hotline are reported quarterly to the Audit Committee.
All matters were investigated internally and action taken 
where the complaint has been found to be substantiated.
We place a high priority on the review and refresh of our 
efforts each year to ensure that we mitigate risk and support 
our employees to do business the right way. In 2018, we are 
focused on further embedding awareness of our Anti-
bribery and Anti-fraud Policy, Competition Compliance 
Policy and our supply chain management procedures 
through a programme of targeted training for all employees. 
We monitor the effectiveness of training through assessments 
undertaken by our ECOs and PwC, our internal auditors.
Modern slavery
The group’s modern slavery and human trafficking 
statement can be found on our website. We continue to 
work to improve our policies and procedures to ensure 
slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in 
our supply chains. Work is ongoing to introduce or improve 
controls through our Legal, HR and Procurement functions, 
bringing greater oversight of our local employment 
practises, and standardised purchasing and invoicing 
processes across a greater proportion of our procurement 
activities. In 2018 we will continue this work and we will also 
gather data on our progress so far and measure the impact 
of our training and awareness activities.
Data protection and GDPR
Sound data protection and privacy practices are vital for 
Keller. The implementation of the EU General Data 
Protection Regulations (‘GDPR’) planned for May 2018 is 
therefore a critical project for us. We are working hard to 
ensure that we are ready, and our customers can be ready 
too. We have established a Data Governance Project Team 
and Committee to oversee our response to GDPR. Subject 
to specific local data laws, GDPR will be the standard against 
which we assess all of our future data protection activities.

continued How we identify risk
Our risk management process has been built to identify, 
evaluate, analyse and mitigate significant risks to the achievement 
of our strategy. Our risk identification processes seek to identify 
risks from both a top down strategic perspective and a bottom 
up local operating company perspective.
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for risk management, 
the setting of risk appetite and the implementation of the risk 
management policy. The Board reviews and challenges the 
group’s principal risks and uncertainties and has adopted an 
integrated approach to risk management by regularly 
discussing the principal risks as a part of key agenda items. 
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee ensures adequate assurance is obtained 
over the risks that are identified as the group’s principal risks. 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for the independent 
review and challenge of the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
risk management approach.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is responsible for the identification, 
reporting and ongoing management of risks and for the 
stewardship of the risk management approach. The Executive 
Committee reviews and assesses the key strategic risks to 
the group and the outputs of the assessment are sent to 
the Divisional Presidents for inclusion in their local risk 
assessment exercises. 
Divisional Executive Committees
Divisional Executive Committees are responsible for the 
identification, reporting and ongoing management of risks in 
their respective regions. The outputs of these assessment 
exercises are reviewed and challenged by the Executive 
Committee as part of their assessment of the key strategic 
risks facing the group.
Our risk appetite
We use an assessment of the level of risk and our associated 
risk appetite to ensure the appropriate focus is placed on the 
correct risks.
Risk identification and impact
The group’s principal risks are analysed on a gross (pre ‑mitigation) 
and net (post‑mitigation) basis. 
Risk trends 
The ongoing review of the group’s principal risks focuses on 
how these risks may evolve. The Audit Committee and Board 
reviewed the group’s principal risks and uncertainties at their 
meetings in February 2018, taking into account the recent 
developments in the UK construction sector and with particular 
regard to the under-performance of two large contracts in APAC 
during 2017. Following a robust discussion, the Committee 
concluded that our principal risks and uncertainties have remained 
unchanged since the publication of last year’s Annual Report.
Developing the viability statement 
In developing the viability statement, it was determined that 
a three-year period should be used, consistent with the period 
of the group’s business planning processes and reflecting a 
reasonable approximation of the maximum time taken from 
procuring a project to completion. Management reviewed the 
principal risks, and considered which of these risks might 
threaten the group’s viability. It was determined that none of 
the individual risks would in isolation compromise the group’s 
viability, and so a number of different severe but plausible 
principal risk combinations were considered. A downside 
sensitivity analysis, as well as a consideration of any mitigating 
actions available to the group, were applied to the group’s 
three‑year cash flows forecasted as part of the business 
planning process and presented to the Board for discussion, 
further to review by the Audit Committee. The Board discussed 
the process undertaken by management, and also reviewed the 
results of stress testing performed to ensure that the sensitivity 
analysis was sufficiently rigorous. The Board also carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
Viability statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2016 revision of the 
Code, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the group 
over a three-year period. 
i) The Board selected the three-year period as:
 a.  the group’s business planning and budget processes are 
carried out over a three-year period which provides the 
relevant estimates; and
 b.  three years is a reasonable approximation of the maximum 
time taken from procuring a project to completion and 
therefore reflects our current revenue earning cycle.
ii)  The review included cash flows and other key financial ratios 
over the three-year period. These metrics were subject to 
sensitivity analysis which involves flexing a number of the main 
assumptions underlying the forecast both individually and in 
unison. This downside sensitivity analysis was carried out to 
evaluate the potential impact on the group if both the effects 
of the global financial crisis were to be repeated and there was 
a substantial charge arising from a contract dispute. Revenues 
were assumed to decrease by 10% year on year and operating 
margins reduced to 3%. It was also assumed that the group’s 
working capital position deteriorated so that working capital 
represented 50% of three months’ revenue and there was 
a £25m cash outflow arising from a contract dispute. It was 
assumed that the group’s principal revolving credit facilities 
expiring September 2019 were refinanced.
The Directors’ assessment has been made with reference to 
the group’s current position and prospects, the group’s strategy, 
the Board’s risk appetite and the group’s principal risks and how 
these are managed, as detailed in the Strategic report.
On the basis of the above and other matters considered and 
reviewed by the Board during the year, the Board has reasonable 
expectations that the group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years. 
In doing so, it is recognised that such future assessments are 
subject to a level of uncertainty that increases with time and, 
therefore, future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted 
with certainty.

Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview
Principal risks and uncertainties Going concern 
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic report. The financial position of the group, 
its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Finance 
Director’s report, with details of the group’s treasury activities, 
long‑term funding arrangements and exposure to financial risk 
included in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
The group has sufficient financial resources which, together with 
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient 
sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its 
contractual and commercial commitments and any proposed 
dividends. The group is therefore well placed to manage its 
business risks. After making enquiries, the Directors have 
formed the judgement at the time of approving the financial 
statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the 
group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the 12 months from the date of this Annual Report 
and Accounts. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Principal risks
T o achieve our objective of being the world’s leading geotechnical 
contractor, we recognise that we must have a good understanding 
of the risks we face, those inherent in our strategy and operations 
and those posed by external conditions. We aim to continuously 
monitor those risks, our risk management and internal controls 
systems and evolve our management accordingly.
Movement in risk
 Increased
 No change
 Reduced
Risk A rapid downturn in our markets
Inability to maintain a sustainable level of financial 
performance throughout the construction 
industry market cycle which grows more than 
many other industries during periods of economic 
expansion and falls harder than many other 
industries when the economy contracts.
Potential 
impact
Failure to continue in operation or to meet 
our liabilities.
Mitigation Diversification of our markets, both in terms 
of geography and market segment.

Case study
Working capital management
Managing working capital is a key area of management focus 
across the group. The working capital position of our 21 
business units is reported monthly on the financial dashboards, 
which form a key part of our management framework. On a 
quarterly basis, working capital trend charts are produced for 
each division and business unit, as well as a chart benchmarking 
each of the business units against each other, showing which 
business units are the most improved and which business units’ 
working capital position has deteriorated the most since the 
prior quarter. This analysis is the basis for discussion in the 
detailed quarterly reviews by the Executive Committee and 
allows the early identification of underperformance so the 
necessary mitigating actions can be taken.
The benchmarking performed allows us to identify the 
strongest performing business units. A working capital 
management guide has been created which highlights best 
practices and success stories that some businesses have had 
with regard to managing working capital and share these with 
the rest of the group.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance Further information on the Board’s succession planning, the 
Board Committees evaluation and the work of the Nomination 
Committee in 2017 can be found on pages 52 and 53 of this report.
The Board continues to believe in the importance of collectively, 
and its Non-executive Directors individually, staying close with 
the Company and its people. In October, the Board attended 
the Company’s Group Leadership Conference in Dallas, Texas, 
and met with the Company’s top leadership team and local 
management. Individual Non-executive Directors also made 
visits to operations in continental Europe, North America, 
Asia and Australia. We continue to encourage executives 
below Board level to make presentations at the Board where 
and when appropriate. 
An effective Board must maintain a level of independence and 
objectivity and have the correct balance of experience, diversity 
and skills. It also needs a good understanding of the operations 
of the business and I am pleased to be leading a Board with such 
independence, experience, diversity and knowledge.
We continuously review and seek to improve our governance 
frameworks and systems. The terms of reference for each of 
the Committees were reviewed and adjusted as necessary in 
2017 to improve their efficiency and reflect changes in legislation 
and best practice. 
The Board continued to monitor the implementation of a new 
Code of Business Conduct, designed to promote our culture 
of a global Keller – just one element of our wider Ethics and 
Compliance programme to further promote honesty, fairness 
and integrity in relations between the Company, employees and 
their work colleagues, customers, suppliers, competitors and 
the communities in which we work. 
In the Directors’ remuneration report, set out on pages 69 to 76, 
we describe the strategic review of executive remuneration that 
was undertaken to ensure that Directors’ remuneration remains 
fit for purpose and aligned to both long-term shareholders’ 
interests and to the achievement of the Company’s refreshed 
strategy. Consistent with good governance, an extensive 
consultation was conducted with our major shareholders before 
we arrived at our policy changes. We hope that you will support the 
new Remuneration Policy at the Annual General Meeting this year.
We have complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 throughout the year (the full text of 
which can be found at www.frc.org) and the remainder of this 
report contains the narrative reporting variously required 
by the Code, the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, setting out in greater detail the framework 
and processes that Keller has in place to ensure the highest 
levels of corporate governance.
Yours faithfully,
Peter Hill CBE
Chairman
26 February 2018
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Corporate governance report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017, on behalf of the Board. 
I believe that a strong, effective and efficient governance 
framework is essential in supporting management to deliver 
the Company’s strategy and long-term business success. Good 
governance has supported the Board and Executive team in 
progressing Keller’s long-term strategy over the year and ensured 
that the business has remained resilient in delivering shorter-
term performance despite a number of challenging markets.
I have continued to be impressed by the time and commitment 
given by all of my Board colleagues in supporting and challenging, 
where required, the Executive team, whose job it is to manage 
the Company day to day, to drive performance and create value 
for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 
In May 2017, Ruth Cairnie retired as Non-executive Director and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee after seven years on 
the Board. Ruth provided valuable strategic insight, commercial 
challenge and humour to the Board discussions. I would like to 
thank her personally for her contribution to the Board. 
After undertaking an external recruitment process, Eva Lindqvist 
joined us with effect from 1 June 2017 as a Non-executive 
Director. Eva is a Swedish national, and brings a broad, very 
international management skillset in the industrial and service 
sectors to the Board.
At the end of 2017, I carried out an externally facilitated Board 
Committee evaluation. The results of this evaluation confirmed 
that the Committees continue to operate effectively and that 
each Director continues to make an effective contribution and 
retains a strong commitment to their role. The resulting 
development themes that arose from the evaluation are 
discussed on page 49 and will help shape the Board’s priorities 
for the 2018 year. Paul Withers, your Senior Independent 
Director, carried out a review of my performance as Chairman 
since my appointment in July 2016 and I received constructive 
feedback from him which will assist my continued development 
in this role. 
Good governance has supported 
the Board and Executive team in 
progressing Keller’s long-term 
strategy over the year.

47 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance Directors’ conflicts of interests
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Director must avoid a 
situation where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with Keller’s 
interests. The Act allows Directors of public companies to 
authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, where appropriate, 
where the Articles of Association contain a provision to this 
effect. The Articles of Association give the Directors authority 
to approve such situations and to include other provisions to 
allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with. To address this issue, 
at the commencement of each Board meeting, the Board 
considers its register of interests and gives, when appropriate, 
any necessary approvals. 
There are safeguards which will apply when Directors decide 
whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict. First, only 
Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered 
will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking 
the decision, the Directors must act in a way that they consider, 
in good faith, will be most likely to promote Keller’s success. The 
Directors are able to impose limits or conditions when giving 
authorisation if they think this is appropriate. These procedures 
on conflict have been followed throughout the year and the 
Board considers the approach to operate effectively.

2  Eva Lindqvist was appointed to the Board as a Non-executive Director on 
1 June 2017. Existing diary commitments agreed with the Chairman prior to 
Eva’s appointment, meant that Eva was unable to attend the meetings held 
in September.
Board diversity
Keller continues to be supportive of the need for diversity on 
its Board to provide the necessary range of background, 
experience, values and perspectives to optimise the decision-
making process. Ethnicity and gender are important aspects of 
diversity to which the Chairman and the Nomination Committee 
must pay due regard when deciding upon the most appropriate 
composition of the Board and in considering wider Executive 
succession planning. 
The Board has established a range of backgrounds, capabilities 
and experiences that are critical for the overall Board composition 
and this forms the key objective and basis for the search and 
assessment of candidates for future positions. Within this 
context, in the ongoing process of refreshing the Board, the 
Company continues to encourage and welcome interest from 
women, as from other candidates who will add to the Board’s 
diversity. Against this overriding objective, the Company does 
not currently propose to set targets for the percentage of 
women or other aspects of diversity on its Board in future years.
The Board, as at the date of this Annual Report and Accounts, 
comprises 25% women – two women: six men (25% at 
26 February 2018 – two women: six men). Within the Keller Group, 
our overall senior management population comprises 10% 
women, our engineering/contract manager capability comprises 
7% women and women employees account for 11% of the 
organisation as a whole. 
Professional development
On appointment, Directors are provided with induction training 
and information about the group, the role of the Board and the 
matters reserved for its decision, the terms of reference and 
membership of the Board Committees and the latest financial 
information about the group. This is supplemented by meetings 
with the Company’s legal and other professional advisers, and, 
where appropriate, visits to key locations and meetings with 
certain senior executives to develop the Directors’ 
understanding of the business. 
Throughout their period of office, Non-executive Directors are 
continually updated on the group’s business, its markets, social 
responsibility matters and other changes affecting the group 
and the industry in which it operates, including changes to the 
legal and governance environment and the obligations on 
themselves as Directors. 
Eva Lindqvist’s induction
Eva has spent the past few months familiarising herself 
with Keller and its people. Her tailored induction programme 
has included:
 – A formal induction pack on appointment which included key 
information on Keller’s corporate governance framework; 
its shareholders, customers and the general contractors 
we work with; our financial and operational performance; 
and our products and solutions.
 – Individual meetings with members of the Executive 
Committee and wider senior management.
 – Attended Keller’s Group Leadership Conference in October 
2017 where Eva had the opportunity to meet the group’s top 
70 senior leaders and listen to management presentations 
setting out the leadership priorities for the next 18 months.

Corporate governance report continued
Leadership For each Board and Committee meeting, Directors are provided 
with a tailored Board pack at least one week prior to the meeting. 
To improve the delivery and security of meeting papers, the 
Company continues to use an electronic system allowing the 
Board to easily access information, irrespective of geographic 
location. Directors regularly receive additional information from 
the Company between Board meetings, including a monthly 
group performance update. Should a Director be unable to attend 
a meeting, they will be provided with all the papers and information 
relating to that meeting and have the opportunity to discuss 
issues arising directly with the Chairman and Chief Executive.

Directors and Directors’ independence
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, four other 
Non-executive Directors and three Executive Directors. The 
names of the Directors at the date of this report, together with 
their biographical details, are set out on pages 42 and 43. All of 
these Directors served throughout the year with the exception 
of Ruth Cairnie, who served as Non-executive Director until 
11 May 2017 and Eva Lindqvist who was appointed a Non-
executive Director on 1 June 2017. 
The Non-executive Directors constructively challenge and 
help to develop proposals on strategy and bring strong 
independent judgement, knowledge and experience to the 
Board’s deliberations. Periodically, the Chairman meets with 
the Non-executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
present. Apart from formal contact at Board meetings, there 
is regular informal contact between the Directors.
Chris Girling, Eva Lindqvist, Nancy Tuor Moore and Paul Withers 
are all considered to be independent Non-executive Directors. 
Ruth Cairnie was considered an independent Non-executive 
Director until her retirement from the Board. Peter Hill was 
independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman on 
26 July 2016. Peter’s other professional commitments are as 
detailed on page 42. 
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
AGM following their appointment and to annual re-election 
thereafter, in accordance with the Code.
Board evaluation
In 2017 an external Board Committee evaluation was carried 
out by Lintstock, the London-based corporate advisory firm, 
and facilitated by the Chairman and the Group Company 
Secretary. All members of the Board Committees participated. 
Outcomes from this review were discussed as part of the 
Board meeting in January 2018. The Board agreed that, overall, 
the Committee structures were working well, and a number 
of key points and development themes were identified from 
the evaluation:
 – Audit Committee: continued engagement by members 
in the development of the Company’s ethics and 
compliance programme.
 – Remuneration Committee: the change in the remuneration 
advisory services consultant was seen as positive.
 – HSEQ Committee: continued improvement in management’s 
ability to conduct and report on root cause analysis.
 – Nomination Committee: positive steps taken on succession 
planning for the Board as a whole with increasing focus on 
Executive succession.
Paul Withers, in his role as Senior Independent Director, carried 
out an evaluation of the performance of the Chairman through a 
series of individual interviews with members of the Board and 
the Group Company Secretary. The key points were fed back 
to the Chairman.
The Chairman has confirmed that the Directors standing for 
election at this year’s AGM continue to perform effectively and 
to demonstrate commitment to their roles. 
Information and support
The Board and each Committee are satisfied that they receive 
sufficient, reliable and timely information in advance of meetings 
and are provided with all necessary resources and expertise to 
enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and undertake their 
duties in an effective manner.
49 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance
Effectiveness (e) Financial reporting
Detailed monthly management accounts are prepared which 
compare profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, cash flows 
and other information with budget and prior year, and significant 
variances are investigated.
(f) Cash control
Each business reports its cash position weekly. Regular cash 
forecasts are prepared to monitor the group’s short- and 
medium-term cash positions and to control immediate 
borrowing requirements.
(g) Investments and capital expenditure
All significant investment decisions, including capital expenditure, 
are referred to the appropriate divisional or group authority level.
(h) Internal audit
The group has a structured programme of independent, 
outsourced audit reviews, covering tendering, operational 
processes and internal financial controls. The intention is to 
conduct an internal audit of all material business units at least 
once every four years. This programme has been carried out 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers since 2010. The programme is 
approved and monitored by the Audit Committee, which reviews 
the findings of each such exercise.
(i) Electronic Internal Control Questionnaire (‘EICQ’)
Each year, every principal business unit is required to complete 
an electronic questionnaire responding to whether key internal 
financial and non-financial controls are in place. The results of 
these questionnaires are summarised in a ‘heat map’, which is 
presented to and discussed by the Audit Committee. The 
responses to the questionnaires are also reviewed by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers during each internal audit.
(j) Annual compliance statement
Once a year, managers are asked to confirm the adequacy of the 
systems of internal controls for which they are responsible; and 
their compliance with group policies, local laws and regulations; 
and to report any significant control weaknesses or ‘breakdowns’ 
identified in the past year.
(k) Code of Business Conduct
The group’s Code of Business Conduct and 10 group policies 
set out the standards with regards to conducting business in 
all business units worldwide. All business units are required to 
self-certify that they are compliant with the group’s Code of 
Business Conduct and with the Code is considered as part of 
the independent reviews.
(l) Whistleblowing procedures
Employees are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about 
malpractice at the earliest possible stage. An externally 
facilitated whistleblowing hotline service was introduced in 
2016 for employees. Any issues raised under our procedures 
are thoroughly investigated and reported back to the 
Audit Committee.
The management of financial risks is described in the Finance 
Director’s review on page 27.
Internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. However, 
such a system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks faced 
by the group, which has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. This process is regularly reviewed by the Board and 
accords with the guidance of the Financial Reporting Council. 
Details on the identification and evaluation of risk can be found 
in the section headed ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ on pages 
39 to 41.
The principal elements of the internal control framework are 
as follows:
(a) Board delegated approvals
Documented authorisation procedures provide for an auditable 
trail of accountability. These procedures are relevant across 
group operations and provide for successive assurances to be 
given at increasingly higher levels of management and, finally, 
the Board.
(b) Management of project risk
Project risk is managed throughout the life of a contract from 
the bidding stage to completion.
Detailed risk analyses covering technical, operational and 
financial issues are performed as part of the bidding process. 
Authority limits applicable to the approval of bids relate both to 
the specific risks associated with the contract and to the total 
value being bid by Keller, or any joint venture to which Keller is 
a party. Any bids involving an unusually high degree of technical 
or commercial risk, for example those using a new technology 
or in a territory where we have not previously worked, must be 
approved at a senior level within the operating company. 
On average, our contracts have a duration of around six weeks 
but larger contracts may extend over several months or years. 
The performance of contracts is monitored and reported by 
most business units on a weekly basis. In addition, thorough 
reviews are carried out by senior managers on any poorly 
performing jobs and full cost-to-complete assessments are 
routinely carried out on extended duration contracts. 
Further detail on the management of project risk is provided in 
the section headed ‘Principal risks and uncertainties’ on pages 
39 to 41. 
(c) Health and safety
Regular reporting, monitoring and reviews of health and safety 
matters are made to the HSEQ Committee and the Board.
(d) Budgeting and forecasting
There is a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual 
budget approved by the Board. This budget includes monthly 
profit and loss accounts, balance sheets and cash flows. In 
addition, forecasts are prepared for the two subsequent years. 
Forecasts for the full year are regularly updated during the year.

Accountability Nancy Tuor Moore
Chairman of the Health, Safety, Environment & Quality Committee
The group’s overall Accident 
Frequency Rate continues to 
improve and is at an all-time low.
Dear stakeholder 
It is my pleasure to present the Health, Safety, Environment & 
Quality Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2017 . 
The Committee is required to meet at least three times a year. 
During this financial year the Committee met three times and 
attendance at these meetings is shown on page 48. 
As previously reported, on 4 July 2017, a fatal incident occurred in 
South Africa involving a head on collision of two vehicles carrying 
Keller employees and a truck. Sadly, 18 colleagues died and 14 
were injured. Multiple memorial services were held to honour 
those who had died and to support family and friends affected 
by this tragic event. A JustGiving site and an online condolence 
book was set up to give our colleagues across Keller an opportunity 
to show their support. In addition to the benevolence of our 
employees, and the financial assistance via the Company’s 
insurance programmes, Keller has also established an Educational 
Trust in memory of our employees killed in the incident. Funding 
from the Trust is available to children of the deceased, as well as 
other Franki Africa employees and will run for the duration of 
their academic lives. I would like to commend the management 
team for their compassionate and collaborative response in 
dealing with this tragic incident.
The Committee noted a deterioration in the company’s ability to 
reduce the number of rigs overturning during 2017. Whilst there 
have been no fatalities, these remain a major concern for the 
Committee and we challenged management to respond with an 
appropriate and urgent action plan. Details of management’s 
action plan and response can be found on page 33.
At the end of 2016, the Committee approved management’s 
proposal to support the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals. Further details and progress to date can be found in our 
Sustainability report on pages 32 to 38. 
Despite the challenges we have faced in 2017, I am pleased to say 
that the group’s overall Accident Frequency Rate continues to 
improve and is at an all-time low of 0.23 per 100,000 hours worked.
Corporate governance
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during 
the year, are available on the group’s website (www.keller.com) 
and on request from the Group Company Secretary.
The membership of the Committee comprises the Non-
executive Directors of the Company. The Committee may invite 
members of the senior management to attend meetings where 
it is felt appropriate and the Chairman, Chief Executive and the 
group’s Health, Safety, Environment & Quality Director regularly 
attend meetings of the Committee. Divisional Presidents are 
required to attend to report to the Committee in the event of 
a major safety incident or near-miss occurrence and other 
members of the Executive Committee may be invited to attend 
on occasion.
During the year, an external evaluation was carried out on the 
Committee’s performance, facilitated by the Chairman and 
the Group Company Secretary. Further to the review, it was 
concluded that, consistent with the Code and its own terms of 
reference, the HSEQ Committee is discharging its obligations 
in an effective manner.

Health, Safety, Environment & Quality Committee report  Peter Hill CBE
Chairman of the Nomination Committee
We have continued to develop 
and monitor succession plans at 
the Board level.
Dear shareholder
Welcome to the report of the Nomination Committee for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
The Committee keeps under review the balance of skills on the 
Board and the knowledge, experience, length of service and 
performance of the Directors. During the year, the Committee 
met twice and attendance at these meetings is shown on page 48.
This year, the recruitment of a new Non-executive Director was 
a particular area of focus for the Nomination Committee.
Succession planning
We have continued to develop and monitor succession plans at 
the Board level. The length of tenure for Non-executive Directors 
is two terms of three years each, to be followed by annual 
renewal of up to three years, allowing for increased flexibility 
in our succession planning and timing.
Further to Ruth Cairnie’s decision to retire from the Board in May 
2017, I led the process to identify and recommend her successor. 
Below I set out how that process was managed:
 – I worked with the Group Company Secretary to agree the 
profile and criteria for selection, seeking input from members 
of the Board to ensure alignment.
 – A number of search firms were approached and The Zygos 
Partnership (‘Zygos’) was selected. Based on the profile and 
criteria selection, together with individual interviews with the 
Board, Zygos determined a long list of candidates for review. 
 – After discussion in the Committee, a shortlist was put forward 
to me for which detailed references were sought by Zygos and 
soundings taken from our advisers. 
 – Agreed candidates were invited to meet with me and the 
Group Company Secretary, and the preferred candidate was 
then invited to meet the rest of the Board.
 – The Nomination Committee recommended the appointment 
of Eva Lindqvist, as our preferred candidate, to the Board.
We were delighted to welcome Eva to the Board in June 2017.
Board effectiveness and skills 
As part of its work on the Board’s effectiveness, the Nomination 
Committee activities included: 
 – Consideration of the number of Executive and Non-executive 
Directors on the Board and whether the balance is appropriate 
to ensure optimum effectiveness.
 – Reviewing the balance of industry knowledge, relevant 
experience, skills and diversity on the Board.
 – Assessment and confirmation that all the Non-executive 
Directors remain independent.
The Nomination Committee is confident that each Director 
remains committed to their role; the Board continues to work 
well and has an appropriate and diverse mix of skills and industry 
knowledge. The Directors collectively bring a range of expertise 
and experience of different business sectors to Board 
deliberations, which encourage constructive and challenging 
debate around the boardroom table.
The Nomination Committee continues to work to balance 
the skills and experience of the Board members to meet the 
changing needs of the business. The mix of skills keeps us 
relevant and up-to-date with the market and further details 
on the Board’s breadth of skills can be found on page 43.

Nomination Committee report Diversity
The Committee continues to encourage and welcome interest 
from women, as from other candidates who will add to the 
Board’s diversity. The Board’s overriding objective is to continue 
to provide effective leadership and, therefore, the Committee 
continues to recommend for appointment only the most 
appropriate candidates to the Board. There are, therefore, no 
formal targets set for female or other aspects of diversity at 
Board level. For further information on Boardroom diversity 
and diversity more generally at Keller, please refer to page 34.
Non-executive appointments and time commitments 
In making recommendations to the Board on Non-executive 
Director appointments, the Nomination Committee will consider 
the expected time commitment of the proposed Non-executive 
Director, and other commitments they already have to ensure 
that they have sufficient time available to devote to the Company.
Prior to accepting any additional commitments, Non-executive 
Directors will, in the first instance, discuss these with the Chairman 
of the Board, or in the case of the Chairman, with the Senior 
Independent Director and the Chief Executive. Agreement of the 
Board is then required to ensure that any conflicts of interest are 
identified and that they will continue to have sufficient time 
available to devote to the Company.
Independence and re-election to the Board 
The composition of the Board is reviewed annually by the 
Nomination Committee to ensure that there is an effective 
balance of skills, experience and knowledge.
The Committee conducted a review of the independence of 
Nancy Tuor Moore in the year as her three-year appointment 
expired at the end of June 2017. Nancy was not present during 
the Committee’s discussion. Having conducted its review, the 
Committee was satisfied that it was appropriate to recommend 
to the Board that Nancy’s appointment should be extended for

The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during 
the year, are available on the group’s website (www.keller.com) 
and on request from the Group Company Secretary. 
Only the Chairman and Non-executive Directors are members of 
the Committee. No one other than a member of the Committee 
is entitled to be present at its meetings. The Committee may 
invite members of the senior management to attend meetings 
where it is felt appropriate and Alain Michaelis, Chief Executive, 
attended certain meetings during the year. 
The 2017 external evaluation concluded that, consistent with 
the Code and its own terms of reference, the Nomination 
Committee is discharging its obligations in an effective manner.
In accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all members of the Board will seek re-election 
at the Annual General Meeting in May 2018, with the exception 
of Eva Lindqvist who will seek her first election.

to the Company’s working capital 
and going concern, contract 
assessments and goodwill.
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present our 
report for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. 
The Audit Committee met four times during the year. Attendance 
at these meetings is shown in the table on page 48. To ensure 
compliance with the Code, the Committee’s membership is 
limited to independent Non-executive Directors of the 
Company. The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director, 
Group Financial Controller and the Company’s external auditors 
KPMG LLP (‘KPMG’) normally attend, by invitation, all meetings 
of the Committee. PricewaterhouseCoopers, in their role as 
internal auditors, attend at least two meetings of the Committee 
each year. On two occasions, the Committee met privately with 
KPMG without management being present and I also met with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers without management present.
The Board is satisfied that I have the necessary level of relevant 
financial and accounting experience required by the provisions 
of the Code, to perform the role of Chairman, having previously 
held Chief Financial Officer positions in public companies. I am 
also a Chartered Accountant and I continue to chair the Audit 
Committee for another public limited company.
The Audit Committee collectively has the competence relevant 
to the sector as required by the provisions of the Code, as well as 
the contracting and international skills and experience required 
to fully discharge its duties. The Committee is authorised by the 
Board to seek any information necessary to fulfil its duties and 
to obtain independent legal, accounting or other professional 
advice, at the Company’s expense, which might be necessary 
for the fulfilment of its duties.
Activities of the Committee
During the year under review, the Committee has continued 
to review and report to the Board on the group’s financial and 
narrative reporting, internal control and risk management 
processes and the performance, independence and 
effectiveness of KPMG. This report describes the Committee’s 
main activities since my last report in 2016.
The Audit Committee ensures the integrity of financial reporting 
and audit processes and the maintenance of a sound internal 
control and risk management system, details of which are 
described on page 50. 
The table below summarises the key agenda items covered at 
the Committee’s meetings during this period:
 – Review a report on the group’s system of internal control and 
its effectiveness and receive regular updates on the group’s 
principal risks.
 – Review a report from management on their process for 
assessing the group’s going concern and viability over a 
three-year period and report the outcomes of the assessment 
to the Board.
 – Undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal 
audit process.
 – Approve a rolling four-year programme of internal audit 
reviews of aspects of the group’s operations and financial 
controls and receive reports on all reviews carried out during 
the year.

The Audit Committee also reviewed the Company’s processes 
for the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts and the 
outcomes of those processes to ensure that it was in a position 
to recommend to the Board that the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts satisfy the requirement of being fair, balanced and 
understandable. The following processes are in place to provide 
this assurance: 
 – Co-ordination and review of the Annual Report and Accounts 
performed within an exacting time-frame which ran alongside 
the formal audit process undertaken by KPMG. 
 – Guidance issued to contributors at an operational level.
 – Internal challenge and verification process dealing with the 
factual content of the information within the Annual Report 
and Accounts.
 – Comprehensive review by senior management and external 
advisers to ensure consistency and overall balance.
Significant issues considered by the Committee included those 
identified in the Independent Auditor’s Report. They related to 
the financial statements focused on the group’s approach to key 
estimates and judgements in connection with:
Accounting for construction contracts
The main factors considered when making those estimates and 
judgements include the percentage of work completed at the 
balance sheet date on longer-term contracts, the costs of the 
work required to complete the contract and the outcome of 
claims and variations raised against customers and claims raised 
against the group by customers or third parties. The Committee 
reviewed a report prepared by management on the key 
estimates and judgements relating to construction contracts 
having a material impact on the group’s result for the year and 
agreed with the conclusions of this report.
Carrying value of goodwill
The group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out 
in note 2 to the financial statements. The group estimates the 
recoverable amount based on value-in-use calculations. These 
calculations require the use of assumptions, the most important 
being the forecast revenues, operating margins and the discount 
rate applied. The key assumptions used for the value-in-use 
calculations are set out in note 13 to the financial statements. 
The Committee has reviewed the key assumptions used for all 
impairment tests of material goodwill balances. In particular, 
this review has focused on the Keller Canada and ASEAN Heavy 
Foundations cash-generating units where there is the most 
uncertainty surrounding the projections used in the value-in-
use calculation.
The Committee also examined the disclosure of items which 
are described as non-underlying in the consolidated income 
statement and considered the appropriateness of those items 
listed in note 7 to the financial statements. 
These matters and any audit differences are considered in 
the Committee meetings that review the full-year and interim 
results. At these meetings, the Committee discusses with 
KPMG the reasonableness of the assumptions made by 
management in arriving at their estimates and judgements 
underpinning the financial statements. In addition, during 
such meetings, the Committee meets with KPMG without 
management being present.
Internal audit
PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’) continues to provide a 
structured programme of independent, outsourced reviews of 
all material business units at least once every four years. During 
2017, the Audit Committee received and considered reports 
from PwC which detailed the progress against the agreed work 
programme. This programme covered reviews of eight business 
units in six countries, which together represented approximately 
35% of the group’s revenue for the year. It included assessments 
of the Hayward Baker and HJ Foundation businesses in the US; 
the German, French, UAE, India and Singapore businesses; and 
the APAC head office in Singapore. Although there remains 
scope to improve the formality of certain controls in certain 
businesses to ensure they operate more effectively, there were 
no findings that PwC considered of a significant nature. In 
September, the Committee formally reviewed the effectiveness 
of these arrangements and discussed them and any action plans 
arising with management, concluding that the internal audit 
arrangements were appropriate and effective.
55 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance External audit
The Committee places great importance on ensuring there are 
high standards of quality and effectiveness in the external audit 
process and complied with the provisions of the Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory 
Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the CMA Audit Order) throughout 
the year.
KPMG, and its predecessor firms, has been the Company’s 
auditor since the Company first listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in 1994. As set out in our 2013 Annual Report and 
Accounts, KPMG were reappointed as the Company’s Auditor 
in 2014 subsequent to a robust retendering of the external audit 
process. Following the introduction of the UK and EU guidance 
on mandatory auditor rotation, the Committee anticipates 
retendering the external audit again for the 2019 year-end, 
the year after the Company’s existing lead audit partner will 
be required to rotate off the audit of the group.
The Committee has undertaken an assessment of the 
effectiveness of the external audit process of the 2016 financial 
statements. This assessment focused on: the calibre of the 
audit firm (including reputation, presence in the industry, size, 
resources and geographic spread); its quality control processes; 
the quality of the team assigned to the audit; the audit scope, 
fee and audit communications; and the governance and 
independence of the audit firm. 
During the year, the 2016 external audit of the group by KPMG was 
reviewed by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review team (AQR). The AQR 
routinely monitors the quality of audit work of certain UK audit firms 
through inspections of sample audits and related procedures at 
individual audit firms. The Committee and KPMG have discussed 
the review findings, which were incorporated into the 2017 audit 
work. The Committee does not consider any of the findings to 
have had a significant impact on KPMG’s audit approach.
There are a number of checks and controls in place for safeguarding 
the objectivity and independence of KPMG. These include open 
lines of communication and reporting between KPMG and the 
Committee and, when presenting their ‘independence letter’, 
KPMG LLP discuss with the Committee their internal process 
for ensuring independence.
A detailed assessment of the amounts and relationship of audit 
and non-audit fees and services is carried out each year and the 
Audit Committee has developed and implemented a policy 
regulating the placing of non-audit services to KPMG, which 
should prevent any impairment of independence and ensure 
compliance with the updates to the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and revised Auditing and Ethical Standards with regards 
to non-audit fees. Any work awarded to KPMG, other than audit, 
with a value in excess of £20,000 requires the specific pre-
approval of the Audit Committee Chairman. In addition, once 
total approved non-audit services exceeds £50,000 in any year, 
every subsequent service, regardless of amount, requires 
pre-approval by the Audit Committee Chairman.
Over the last three years, the ratio of non-audit related fees paid 
to the Auditor averaged 21% of the total audit fee. The ratio of 
non-audit related fees paid to the Auditor in 2017 is 2% of the 
total audit fee. These relate predominantly to finalising US tax 
compliance services provided in earlier years. Since 2016, PwC 
has been engaged as the Company’s tax advisers.
Also, as part of its annual review of KPMG’s independence, 
the Committee reviews the level and nature of entertainment 
between KPMG and management.
Risk management and internal control 
The Audit Committee has a key role in ensuring appropriate 
governance and challenge around risk management. It also sets 
the tone and culture within the organisation regarding risk 
management and internal control.
Key elements of the group’s system of internal control include: 
 – A comprehensive system of financial reporting. 
 – An organisational and management Board structure with 
clearly defined levels of authority and division of 
responsibilities. 
The group aims to continuously strengthen its risk management 
processes, with the involvement of the Audit Committee to 
ensure these processes are embedded throughout the 
organisation. The Audit Committee has reviewed the group’s 
system of controls including financial, operational, compliance 
and risk management during the year with no significant failings 
or weaknesses identified. However, any such system can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against any 
material misstatement or loss.
Further information on the group’s risks is detailed on pages 
39 to 41.
Corporate governance
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during 
the year, are available on the group’s website (www.keller.com) 
and on request from the Group Company Secretary. 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG LLP will be put to shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held in May 2018.
As a Committee we are continually looking at opportunities to 
improve our effectiveness and better understand the risks and 
opportunities of the markets in which the group operates. 
During the year, an external evaluation was carried out on the 
Committee’s performance, facilitated by the Chairman and the 
Group Company Secretary. Further to the review, it was 
concluded that, consistent with the Code and its own terms of 
reference, the Audit Committee is discharging its obligations 
in an effective manner. 
I meet regularly with both KPMG and the Finance Director to 
discuss key issues relevant to the Committee’s work. Ensuring 
these lines of communication are open and working well is vital 
to the success of the Committee in carrying out its work.
In the year ahead we will continue to ensure the group’s risk 
management and internal controls remain robust.

Relations with shareholders Paul Withers
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Overall, annual performance 
improved and 2017 annual bonus 
outcomes reflect this.
Dear shareholder
It is my pleasure to present the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 on behalf of the Board. 
This is my first year as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee following my appointment to that role in May 2017. 
In line with my predecessors, I am committed to an ongoing and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders and their representative 
bodies in the area of executive remuneration.
During the course of 2017, the Committee has worked to 
develop the proposed new Remuneration Policy outlined below 
which reflects the feedback received from shareholders in 
previous consultations and will be put to a binding vote at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting in May 2018.
As highlighted last year, the Committee believes that to align 
with the strategy set out by our CEO in 2015, management 
should be incentivised over the long term and have meaningful 
shareholding and Keller needs to provide competitive remuneration 
in order to attract and retain the talent required to implement 
the strategy.
Incentive outcomes for 2017
In respect of 2017, the annual bonus payments reflect the 
performance of the group. Underlying group profit before tax 
increased by 16% and underlying earnings per share by 35%. 
Group net debt was £229.5m. Overall, annual performance 
improved and 2017 annual bonus outcomes reflect this 
performance, with the Committee determining that 64.2% of 
the maximum annual bonus opportunity in relation to financial 
targets should pay out for the Executive Directors. Progress 
against personal objectives, which are aligned to the Company’s 
five strategic levers, was encouraging. These paid out at 
between 20% and 24.5% of salary.
The Performance Share Plan vested at 33.9% of the maximum 
opportunity in respect of the performance period ending in 2017.

58 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report
Annual statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee As a reminder, we proposed a number of changes last year to meet these goals including increasing Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
awards, introducing a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period of the PSP , increasing the 
shareholding guideline from 100% to 200% of base salary and introducing a third measure in the PSP . The majority of shareholders 
were supportive, recognising the need for Keller rewards to be competitive and the gap that has developed in the nine years since 
incentive levels were last increased, the benefits of a holding period and the rationale for a shift in the balance to the longer term. 
They also recognised the importance of senior executives having the requirement and opportunity to build significant shareholdings. 
However, a minority expressed concern about making any increase to opportunities at that time given the business context at the time.
As reported by my predecessor in our 2016 remuneration report, whilst continuing to believe that the full set of changes originally 
proposed are needed to underpin Keller’s future success with a well balanced and competitive reward structure aligned to the 
strategic direction, the Committee determined to revisit these changes over the course of 2017, with a likely further consultation 
and change in policy after one or two years.
Since my appointment, the Committee has therefore conducted a further extensive review of executive remuneration, during which 
we discussed alternative remuneration structures. The Committee concluded that our current structure of bonus and PSP remains 
appropriate at this stage in our strategy. We also took account of the feedback received during the consultation.
Business context
Our strategic priorities remain the same: to be the world’s leading geotechnical solutions provider. 
Our current strategy is built around five strategic levers and we see these priorities continuing over the next three years. These are:
To be the world leader in geotechnical solutions
Growth
Growing our product range 
and entering new markets, 
organically and by acquisition
Customers
Building strong, customer-
focused local businesses
Scale
Leveraging the scale and 
expertise of the group
Engineering and 
Operations
Enhancing our engineering 
and operational capabilities
People
Investing in our people
Further details on our strategy can be found on page 30 of the Strategic report. 
The adoption by Keller of this strategy in 2015, with clear actions and a multi-year implementation plan, sets the context for our 
proposed revisions to remuneration which seek to:
 – increase the importance of weighting our incentives to the longer term, linking reward to performance arising from the delivery 
of the plan;
 – provide a stronger opportunity to build alignment between executive and shareholder interests, for example by encouraging 
and facilitating the building of significant shareholding by the executives; and
 – require reward in Keller to be competitive, to enable recruitment of new talent bringing in additional experience in driving change 
and strengthening functional capabilities. This talent is needed at different levels in the Keller organisation but competitiveness 
must start with senior roles and a coherent framework for reward across the group as a whole.
Proposed changes
Further alignment with the strategy
When we consulted with shareholders last year, a number of shareholders expressed interest in the introduction of a third measure 
in the PSP , with a number expressing preference for a returns measure. 
Return on Capital Employed is one of our key performance indicators and, as highlighted in our September 2017 Capital Markets 
Day, Keller has an aspiration to generate a ROCE of 20% (2016 ROCE stood at 15% and the average over the last five years is 16%). 
We have reflected on this and have concluded that ROCE would be an appropriate measure to include as a third measure in the PSP 
for future awards. 
Part of our decision was based on the fact that we have extended participation in the PSP in 2016 to a broader group of around 
70 senior managers and ROCE is a measure that we use internally and provides good line of sight for participants.
We propose to keep the weight on EPS at 50% and reduce the weight on TSR from 50% to 25% with 25% now being based on ROCE.
Consistently with the approach taken for EPS, we intend to measure ROCE on an average basis over the three-year performance 
period. Our intention is that the target ranges for ROCE should be applicable through the cycle. We therefore envisage using a 
threshold level of performance of 14% and a maximum of 20%, in line with our aspiration to generate a ROCE of 20%. 
59 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance We also took the opportunity to review our TSR comparator group and our approach for measuring TSR. The Committee concluded 
that, although Keller’s market capitalisation now stands just below the FTSE 250, given Keller’s size and complexity (Keller’s revenues 
are towards the upper quartile of the FTSE 250 and it employs 10,000 staff in over 40 countries), the FTSE 250 remains a relevant 
comparator group. The Committee therefore determined to keep the FTSE 250 as comparator group, excluding investment trusts 
and now also excluding financial services. As the PSP has been extended to senior executives, following feedback from management, 
the Committee determined to measure TSR on a ranked basis rather than outperformance of the index, as it is easier to understand 
for participants.
Full details of the PSP measures, weight and targets are set out on page 75 of the Annual remuneration report. 
Increase PSP opportunity to realign with market levels and offer adequate long-term focus
There has been no change in incentive levels (bonus or PSP) at Keller in the last 10 years despite Keller’s increased size and complexity 
as outlined earlier. We propose that the maximum PSP award granted is increased from 100% of base salary to 150% of base salary. 
Our intention is to make awards in 2018 of 150% of base salary for the CEO, 125% of base salary for the CFO and 75% for the 
Engineering and Operations Director. 
The Committee is mindful of the sensitivity surrounding executive pay. Our historical pay-out shows that the Committee has a track 
record of setting robust targets with average bonus pay-out at 38% of the maximum opportunity over the last eight years and average 
PSP pay-out of 37% of the maximum opportunity over the same period.
Further alignment with shareholders
The Committee is also proposing to introduce a two-year holding period following the vesting of PSP awards. 
We propose to increase the annual bonus deferral from a deferral of any bonus above 100% of salary into shares for three years (the 
current approach) to a straight deferral of 25% of any bonus earned into shares for two years. This will simplify the design and further 
increase the long-term focus. The deferral period will align with the holding period of the PSP .
We will also increase the shareholding guideline from 100% to 200% of base salary for all Executive Directors.
Shareholder engagement
In 2017 and early 2018, the Committee consulted extensively with our largest shareholders and their representative bodies on the 
development of our Remuneration Policy. We were very encouraged by the level and quality of engagement and welcomed the 
constructive feedback provided through the consultation process and this has been taken on board in our final proposals.
Our shareholders have been supportive towards our overall proposed approach. In particular, we received widespread support for our 
proposals to: increase the maximum PSP award grant from 100% of base salary to 150% of base salary; introduce a two-year holding 
period following the vesting of PSP awards; to increase the annual bonus deferral from a deferral of any bonus above 100% of salary 
into shares for three years (the current approach) to a straight deferral of 25% of any bonus earned into shares for two years; and to 
increase the shareholding guideline from 100% to 200% of base salary for all Executive Directors.
We also received useful feedback on the proposed application of ROCE as a third financial measure in the PSP for future awards which 
was taken into account in setting a target range for ROCE applicable through the cycle. 
2018 Salary review
The base salaries of Alain Michaelis, James Hind and Venu Raju were increased by 2.5% in line with general pay increases of 2.5% 
awarded across the group.
Remuneration advisers
During the first half of the year the Committee retendered its contract for remuneration advisory services. After meetings and 
discussions with four advisory services firms, including the prior incumbents Kepler, the Committee appointed Deloitte as the 
Company’s independent remuneration adviser with effect from 31 July 2017.
2018 Annual General Meeting
I very much hope that you will support our proposed Remuneration Policy along with our 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration at our 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting in May. I will be available at the meeting to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.

As described in the Chairman’s letter, the Committee engaged with its major shareholders in 2017 as part of its review of the 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy. We wrote to our largest shareholders and the major shareholder representative bodies 
in October 2017 to consult on the development of our executive remuneration and, having considered the feedback, we wrote again 
in January 2018 to explain the outcome of the review, the changes proposed and associated rationale. Shareholders were offered 
the opportunity to discuss the proposals with the Remuneration Committee Chairman. We are grateful to those shareholders who 
responded and are satisfied that, having taken into account the feedback received, we have developed an appropriate way forward.
This policy will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM to be held on 23 May 2018. The policy is intended to apply, subject to 
shareholder approval, for three years from 1 January 2018. Where a material change to this policy is considered, the Company will 
consult with major shareholders prior to submitting to all shareholders for approval. The Remuneration Policy will be displayed on the 
Company’s website (www.keller.com) following the 2018 AGM.
Remuneration Policy main changes 
As indicated in the Chairman’s letter, the Committee believes that to align with the strategy set out by our CEO in 2015, management 
should be incentivised over the long term and have meaningful shareholding and Keller needs to provide competitive remuneration 
in order to attract and retain the talent required to implement the strategy. 
Summary of our proposed changes and rationale:
Increase PSP opportunity to provide competitive levels geared towards long-term performance
 – Reduce the competitive gap that has developed in the 10 years since incentive levels were last increased. During that time, Keller’s 
revenues have doubled to £2.1 billion, the number of employees has tripled to over 10,000 and Keller now operates in over 40 
countries. We are proposing to increase the maximum PSP award from 100% of base salary to 150% of base salary for the CEO, 
125% of base salary for the CFO and from 75% of base salary to 100% of base salary for the Engineering and Operations Director. 
Further align with shareholders 
 – Increased shareholding requirement from 100% to 200% of base salary;
 – Introduction of a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performance period of the PSP; and
 – Increased bonus deferral from a deferral of any bonus above 100% of salary (the current approach) to a straight deferral of 25% 
of any bonus earned for two years. 
We have made other small editorial changes notably reflecting that the PSP awards is now based on three metrics.

Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy table 
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors: base salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus, and 
performance share plan. The table below summarises these elements, how they link to strategy and how they operate. 
The policy is designed to provide market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with 
shareholders and long-term focus.
61 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance
Remuneration Policy report Fixed remuneration – base salary, benefits and pension
Base salary
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Reflects the individual’s role, experience and contribution to the Company.
Set at sufficiently competitive levels to attract and retain high-calibre individuals needed to execute and deliver 
on the group’s strategic objectives.
Operation Paid in cash. Salaries are normally set in the home currency of the Executive Director and reviewed annually. 
In making salary decisions the Committee notably takes account of: 
 – Changes in the scope or responsibility of the role;
 – Company and individual performance; 
 – Periodically, salary levels for comparable roles at relevant international comparators; and
 – General increases across the group.
Performance Both the group and the individual’s performance are considered when determining salary increases.
Opportunity Determined having considered market practice for relevant roles in similar size international companies.
Whilst there is no prescribed maximum level of salary, increases are normally not expected to exceed average 
increases for the wider workforce taking into account relevant geography. 
Larger increases could be awarded in circumstances where there is a significant increase in the complexity, 
scope or responsibility of the role or in the case of appointment at a level lower than a predecessor and/or market 
level with a view to increase over time. Current base salaries are set out in the Annual remuneration report.
Benefits
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To be market-competitive for the purpose of attracting and retaining high-calibre individuals needed to execute 
and deliver the strategic objectives.
Operation Benefits typically include:
 – A company car or a car allowance; 
 – Private health care; and 
 – Life assurance, and long-term disability insurance.
Other benefits may be provided from time to time if considered reasonable and appropriate by the Committee. 
Where applicable, reasonable relocation expenses may be provided, which may include but which are not limited 
to: removal costs, housing allowance, immigration assistance, reallocation and cost of living allowance, school 
fees and tax equalisation. 
Executive Directors would also be able to participate in any all-employee share plans on the same basis as other 
eligible employees, should such plans be implemented by the Company.
Performance None
Opportunity There is no formal maximum as the cost of benefit provision can fluctuate depending on changes in provider 
cost, location and individual circumstances.
Pension
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To provide a market competitive level of retirement benefit.
Operation Executive Directors participate in the Company pension schemes that apply in their home country. Current UK 
Directors can elect to receive either a contribution to a UK defined contribution (‘DC’) scheme or a salary cash 
supplement in lieu of pension benefits.
Performance None
Opportunity The maximum annual pension contribution/cash supplement is 18% of base salary unless the contribution rates 
are determined by the rules of a specific country pension plan.
62 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration Policy report continued Short-term variable remuneration
Annual Bonus Plan
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Rewards achievement of the short-term financial and strategic targets of the Company.
Operation At the start of each financial year, performance measures and weightings are determined and annual financial 
targets and personal strategic objectives are set by the Committee. Bonus outcomes are determined based on 
performance against those targets. 
25% of any bonus earned is deferred into Company shares for two years. 
Deferred bonus shares are eligible for dividend equivalents over the period from the date the deferred award is 
granted, to the date of its vesting.
Malus and clawback may be applied in the event of financial misstatement, serious reputational damage, or 
material misconduct in individual cases. Malus provisions allow the Committee to reduce (partly or wholly) bonus 
payout or share awards granted under the deferred bonus. Clawback may apply to the cash bonus and deferred 
bonus for a period of two years following the end of the performance period. 
Performance The annual bonus is predominantly based on delivering financial performance (usually 80%) and may include for 
example financial measures such as underlying profit before tax (‘PBT’) and working capital management.
The Committee agrees targets annually for threshold and maximum payouts, ensuring targets are achievable 
but stretching. The award opportunity at threshold performance is 0%, with around 50% of maximum bonus 
normally payable for target. Payouts between threshold and target, and target and maximum are normally 
determined broadly on a straight-line basis.
Around 20% of the bonus is usually based on personal performance which is assessed by the Committee.
The measures are reviewed by the Committee each year and will be explained in the annual report on remuneration. 
The Committee retains full discretion to adjust the performance measures/targets/weightings on an annual 
basis for future years to reflect the prevailing strategic objectives of the business.
The Committee also has discretion to adjust the bonus outcomes (cash bonus and deferred bonus) if it determines 
this is needed to achieve an appropriate outcome having considered the broader performance of the Company 
and/or the individual. This could for example take into account factors such as a material deterioration in safety 
performance, events impacting the reputation of the Company, or failure to achieve a minimum level of financial 
performance impacting the scope for payout under personal strategic objectives.
Opportunity The maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors is up to 150% of base salary.
Long-term variable remuneration 
Keller Long-Term Incentive Plan: Performance Share Plan 
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Focuses on delivering sustainable performance for the Company over the long term.
Operation Subject to a performance period of at least three years with a subsequent mandatory two-year holding period 
making it a five-year plan.
Dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue during the five-year period.
Malus and clawback may apply in the event of financial misstatement, serious reputational damage, or material 
misconduct in individual cases. These provisions provide the Committee with discretion to reduce (including, if 
appropriate, to nil) the payout or to recover the relevant value following vesting of an award. Clawback will apply 
to the PSP awards for a period of two years following the end of the performance period. 
Performance The performance measures and targets are determined at the start of each performance period in line with the 
Company’s financial and strategic objectives.
Vesting of PSP awards is subject to performance against relevant share price and/or financial performance 
measures as determined by the Committee. 
For 2018, the PSP awards are based on:
 – Earnings per Share (EPS) with a weighting of 50%; 
 – Total Shareholder Return (TSR) with a weighting of 25%; and
 – Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) with a weighting of 25%.
The Committee may amend performance measures and weightings for future awards to reflect the prevailing 
strategic objectives of the Company. Material changes will be subject to prior consultation with shareholders.
Opportunity The maximum annual award limit in each financial year is 150% of base salary. Individual award levels may vary 
and will be set out in the relevant Annual remuneration report. 
For 2018, the CEO will receive an award of 150% of base salary, the Finance Director an award of 125% of base 
salary and the Director of Engineering and Operations an award of 75% of base salary.
In exceptional circumstances (for example recruitment or retention) the Committee may make awards of up to 
200% of base salary.
For threshold performance, 25% of the award will vest. For maximum performance, 100% will vest. Vesting will 
normally operate on a straight-line basis.
63 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance Shareholding guidelines
Purpose: aligns interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are expected to retain 50% net of tax of shares following the vesting of share awards until the guideline is 
attained. The Committee encourages the Directors to buy shares on the market. 
Minimum shareholding guideline for Executive Directors is 200% of (pre-tax) base salary.
Notes to the Policy Table: 
The Committee believes that incentive metrics should be simple and aligned with the delivery of the annual business plan and with 
long-term sustainable growth.
Annual Bonus and Deferred Bonus Plans
 – Profit-related measures are chosen by the Committee as they support the strategic objectives of profitable growth and 
leveraging Keller’s technical expertise globally; good management of working capital emphasises the Company’s focus on efficiency 
of operations; personal performance assessed by the Committee allows the Executive Directors to focus on strategic initiatives 
which support delivery of the annual business plan in any relevant year as well as laying foundations for delivery of the longer-term 
group strategy.

Timeline for Deferred Bonus Plan Performance

Award Release
Performance Share Plan 
 – The Committee believes that the measures for 2018 awards (EPS, TSR and ROCE) provide a balance of performance measures 
aligned with strategic delivery. The Committee also has flexibility to adopt different measures to support the strategy as and when 
it evolves. 
 – From 2018, relative TSR performance will be measured by ranking against FTSE250 companies (excluding investment trusts and 
financial services). Under a ranked approach, a threshold vesting will be for median performance against the comparator group; 
maximum vesting for upper quartile performance (or above) against the comparator group. Straight-line vesting between these 
points. For relative TSR, we measure and rank growth based on the data points at the end of the performance period compared 
with those at the beginning of the period.
 – Underlying EPS is considered as an important indicator of the revenue growth and profitability and is a simple and well-understood 
measure. Targets are set by the Committee taking into account internal forecasts of performance, any guidance provided to the 
market and market expectations, as well as historical performance.
 – ROCE is one of our key performance indicators well-understood and used internally to drive profitability. Targets are set taking into 
account our aspirations of ROCE improvement, as well as historical performance. Whilst EPS targets are set for each award, it is the 
Committee’s intention that ROCE targets should be set through the cycle, so that participants may be rewarded for achieving 
acceptable levels of returns with maximum awards only available for meeting our aspirational targets.

Prior commitments
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including the exercise of 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy where the 
terms of the payment were (i) agreed before the 2014 AGM (when the Company’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy came into effect); (ii) before the Policy came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the 
shareholder-approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; and (iii) at a time when the individual to 
whom the payment is made was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.
For these purposes, ‘payments’ include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over 
shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Any awards or remuneration-related commitments made to Directors under previous remuneration policies will continue to be honoured.
64 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration Policy report continued Committee’s discretion 
 – If an event occurs which causes the Committee to consider that an outstanding PSP Award or bonus would not achieve its original 
purpose without alteration, the Committee has discretion to amend the targets, provided the new conditions are not materially less 
challenging than the original conditions. 
 – Such discretion could be used to adjust appropriately for the impact of material acquisitions or disposals, or for exceptional and 
unforeseen events outside the control of the management team. The application of any such discretion would have regard to the 
Committee’s practice of ensuring the stability of measures and targets throughout the business cycle.
 – Awards may also be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or any demerger, capital distribution or 
other event that may materially impact the Company’s share price.
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this Report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has 
the discretion to amend the Policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, 
disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
Pay for performance scenarios
The charts provide an illustration of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split 
between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’. 
Illustrations are intended to provide further information to shareholders regarding the pay for performance relationship.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Keller’s Remuneration Policy applied from 1 January 2018 excluding the impact of any 
share price movement and dividend accrual during the performance period. 
The ‘minimum’ scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits (ie fixed remuneration). Benefit levels are assumed to be the same 
as the last financial year. No annual bonus payable and threshold performance under PSP is not achieved. 
The ‘on-target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus bonus payout of 50% of maximum and PSP vesting at 50% of 
normal maximum award. 
The ‘maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to remuneration for newly appointed Directors (both internal and external) is consistent with that for 
existing Directors. However, where the Company is considering an internal promotion to the Board, the Remuneration Committee 
may, at its discretion, decide that any remuneration commitment agreed or entered into prior to the promotion will continue to be 
honoured even though that commitment may not be consistent with the prevailing policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of both Keller and its shareholders and will seek not to pay more than is necessary for this purpose. 
65 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance The table below summarises the Committee’s approach on recruitment/promotion: 
Component Approach Maximum
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference 
to relevant market data, experience and skills of the individual, internal 
relativities and their current base salary. Where new appointees have 
initial basic salaries set below market, phased increases may be 
awarded over a period of two to three years subject to the individual’s 
development in the role.
Benefits New appointees may be eligible to receive benefits in line with the policy.
Pension New appointees may be eligible to receive pension contributions or 
an equivalent cash supplement in lieu of pension in line with the policy. 
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new 
appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to reflect 
the proportion of employment over the year. Targets for the 
individual element will be tailored to each Executive.
150% of salary
Keller Long Term Incentive Plan New appointees may be granted awards under LTIP on the same 
terms as other Executives, as described in the policy table.
200% of salary 
(exceptional maximum)
In addition, the Committee may offer appropriate compensation where the Committee considers it reasonable to do so in order 
to recruit a particular individual. The Committee may offer compensation on a like-for-like basis, for any amounts of variable 
remuneration being forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors such as 
expected values, any performance conditions attached to these awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met, time 
horizons, delivery mechanism and the terms of the forfeited remuneration.
To facilitate such compensation, the Committee may also rely on exemptions, procedures or provisions contained in the Listing Rules 
that permit awards to be granted in exceptional circumstances. To ensure alignment from the outset with shareholders, malus and 
clawback provisions may also apply where appropriate and the Committee may require new Directors to acquire Company shares up 
to a pre-agreed level. Shareholders will be informed of any buyout arrangements at the time of appointment. 
In making any decision on the remuneration of a new Director, the Committee would balance shareholder expectations, current best 
practice and the circumstances of any new Director. It would strive not to pay more than is necessary to recruit the right candidate 
and would give full details in the next remuneration report.
The Committee may offer to pay reasonable relocation expenses for the new Executive Director in line with the policies described 
in this report.
Service contracts
Executive Directors’ contracts are for an indefinite term with one year’s notice. Service contracts between the Company (or other 
companies in the group) and current Executive Directors are summarised below. Executive Directors’ service contracts are available

Payment for loss of office
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders 
and participants. 
In a departure event, the Committee will typically consider: 
 – Whether any element of annual bonus should be paid for the financial year. Any bonus paid will be limited to the period served during 
the financial year in which the departure occurs. 
The default position is that a deferred bonus awarded in prior years will be preserved in full, unless the Committee, in its discretion, 
chooses to apply malus or clawback.
 – Whether any awards under the PSP should be preserved either in full or in part.
66 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Remuneration Policy report continued The rules of the share plans set out the treatment of specific categories of leavers as set out below. In other cases where an 
executive leaves employment, the Committee will consider the specific details of each case before determining whether to award 
Good Leaver status. 
Injury/Ill-health/Disability: deferred bonus share awards vest in full. To the extent that performance conditions are met, PSP awards 
are pro-rated for service during the performance period and released at the normal vesting date.
Death, or sale of employing entity out of the group: deferred bonus share awards vest in full on cessation of employment. PSP awards 
will be pro-rated for service during the performance period and taking into account the extent to which performance conditions have 
been achieved at the relevant date, but released early.
The default position is that an unvested PSP award or entitlement lapses on cessation of employment, unless the Committee applies 
discretion to preserve some or all of the awards. This provides the Committee with the maximum flexibility to review the facts and 
circumstances of each case, allowing differentiation between good and bad leavers and avoiding ‘payment for failure’.
For good leavers, deferred bonus awards will normally vest in full at the normal vesting date and PSP awards will normally continue until 
the normal vesting date or the end of the holding period although the Committee may allow awards to vest (and be released from any 
holding period) as soon as practicable after leaving where appropriate. The award will vest taking into account the extent to which 
performance conditions have been satisfied and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the period of service during the 
performance period. 
The Committee maintains a discretionary approach to the treatment of leavers, on the basis that the facts and circumstances of each 
case are unique. In an exit situation, the Committee will consider: the individual circumstances; any mitigating factors that might be 
relevant; the appropriate statutory and contractual position; the position under the relevant plan documentation; and the 
requirements of the business for speed of change. 
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a Director’s cessation of office or employment 
where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a Director’s office or employment or for any 
fees for outplacement assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/or professional advice fees in connection with his cessation of office 
or employment. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including 
(but not limited to) settlement or consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly and are only entered into where the 
Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so. 
Change of control
In the event of a change of control, the Committee will determine the appropriate treatment of unvested PSP awards, taking into 
account all relevant factors at the time, including performance achieved up to the change of control date and the period of time 
elapsed since the grant of the award. Deferred shares earned under the annual bonus plan would vest in full.
External appointments 
The Board may allow Executive Directors to accept external appointments and retain the fees; however, in accordance with the Code, 
the Board will not agree to a full-time executive taking on more than one Non-executive Directorship, or the chairmanship of any 
company. None of the Executive Directors held external appointments during 2017.
Remuneration policy for other employees
Keller’s approach to remuneration is broadly consistent across the group. Consideration is given to the experience, performance and 
responsibilities of individuals. Senior managers are eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme with similar performance 
measures to those used for the Executive Directors. Maximum opportunities vary by seniority, with business-specific measures 
applied where appropriate.
Senior managers (currently approximately 70 individuals) are also eligible for long-term share awards. The award sizes vary according 
to seniority. Pensions and benefits provision follows local country practice.
Considerations of conditions elsewhere in the group 
When reviewing and setting executive remuneration, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the relevant pay and 
employment conditions elsewhere in the group. Specifically, the level of salary increases across the group are reviewed annually. 
All senior managers are set annual objectives at the beginning of each year which support the execution of our strategic levers 
through delivering specific objectives relevant to their business unit. Annual bonuses payable to senior managers across the group 
depend on the satisfactory completion of these objectives as well as performance against local business unit financial targets. 
It should be noted that the workforce employed across the group’s geographically diverse businesses is not a homogenous group and 
pay and conditions are designed to be competitive in, and appropriate to, the local employment market. The Committee does not 
currently seek the views of employees on its remuneration policy. 
67 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance Non-executive Director remuneration
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board annually within the limits set out in the Articles of 
Association. When setting the fee levels consideration is given to market practice for companies of similar size and complexity. 
The Chairman receives an all-inclusive fee. Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee and additional fees may be payable for chairing 
a committee or performing the role of Senior Independent Director. The Non-executive Directors’ fees are non pensionable and 
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive plans.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors will be reimbursed by the Company for all reasonable expenses incurred in performing 
their duties. This may include costs associated with travel where required and any tax liabilities payable.
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement, the dates of which are set out below. All appointments are for an 
initial three-year period, and thereafter are subject to review by the Nomination Committee, unless terminated by either party on 
three months’ notice. 
There are no provisions for compensation payable in the event of early termination. 
Fees for a new Non-executive Director will be set according the principles set out above.
Details of the policy on fees paid to Non-executive Directors are set out in the table below:

original award plus accrued dividend shares; the vesting percentage; and the average share price for Q4 2017 of 941p.
Total pension entitlements (audited)
Alain Michaelis, James Hind and Venu Raju receive a cash supplement of 18% of salary, which has been included in the single figure 
table. A proportion of the 18% of Venu Raju’s pension supplement is contributed into the Central Provident Fund (CPF), which is a

Payments to past Directors
Dr Wolfgang Sondermann stepped down as a Director of the Company with effect from 31 December 2016, and was employed 
by Keller Holding GmbH in Germany until 30 April 2017. For this period, he received a base salary of €151,300 (£132,719) and benefits 
of €64,655 (£56,715). 
On 4 March 2016, Wolfgang Sondermann received a PSP award with a performance period of 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017, 
which is expected to vest in March 2018 at 33.9%. The estimated value at vesting of the PSP shares is €107,767 (using 4Q 2017 average 
share price of 941p and 1.14 exchange rate), following pro-rating. As previously disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report, the shares will not 
be released to Wolfgang until March 2019 to reflect the full three years from the grant of the award. Wolfgang did not receive any share 
award in respect of the 2016–2019 performance period. The 2014 PSP awards with performance period ending in 2016 did not vest.
Exit payments made in the year
The Company paid no exit payments to Directors during the year.
2017 Annual Bonus outcomes 
Overall, annual performance was encouraging with underlying profit before tax increasing by 16%, however working capital as 
percentage of revenue deteriorated. The 2017 annual bonus outcomes reflect this performance, with the Committee determining 
that 64.2% of the maximum annual bonus opportunity should pay for achieving the profit target and no bonus should be payable for 
working capital.
Progress against personal strategic objectives, which are aligned to the Company’s five strategic levers was encouraging for all 
Executive Directors. Further details of the personal strategic objectives and the outcomes are provided in the table on page 70. 
The financial targets and personal strategic objectives, together with the actual performance achieved against each target and 
resulting bonuses, are set out on pages 70 and 71.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ remuneration report continued
Annual remuneration report continued Summary of implementation of the remuneration policy for 2018
2018 Base Salary 
The Committee noted that salary increases for UK-based employees across the group were generally around 2.5%. Effective from 
1 January 2018, the base salaries were increased to £528,000 (+2.5%) for Alain Michaelis, CEO, £359,300 (+2.5%) for James Hind, 
Finance Director and £287,000 (+2.5%) for Venu Raju, Group Engineering and Operations Director. 
Benefits for 2018 will remain broadly unchanged from prior years. 
2018 Annual Bonus 
For 2018, 80% of Executive Directors’ bonus will be based on group financial results and 20% will continue to be based on personal 
strategic objectives. The 2017 performance measures will continue to apply: Profit before tax (PBT), an important indicator of the 
Company’s financial and operating performance and working capital ratio as a percentage of revenue, a more operational measure. 
Targets for each measure are challenging but realistic and have been set in the context of the business plan and current environment. 
Targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2018 Annual remuneration report to the extent that they are no longer considered 
commercially sensitive.
25% of any bonus earned will be deferred into Company shares for two years, subject to the approval of the 2018 Remuneration Policy 
at the AGM. 
2018-2020 Performance Share Plan 
Shares will be awarded in May 2018 subject to the approval of the 2018 Remuneration Policy and the Keller Long Term Incentive Plan 
at the AGM. Subject to receiving these approvals, the awards will be granted as follows: 150% of salary for Alain Michaelis, 125% of 
salary for James Hind and 75% of salary for Venu Raju. 
The 2018-2020 PSP performance conditions will be assessed over three years based on the following measures: Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) (25% weight), cumulative Earnings per Share (EPS) (50% weight), and will also include a third measure – Return on Capital 
Employed (ROCE) (25% weight), putting greater focus on capital efficiency. These measures strongly align potential payout under the 
PSP with Keller’s strategic priorities. 
From 2018, relative TSR performance will be measured by ranking against FTSE250 companies (excluding investment trusts and 
financial services). Under a ranked approach, a threshold vesting (resulting in 25% of that portion of the award vesting) will be for 
median performance against the comparator group; maximum vesting for upper quartile performance (or above) against the 
comparator group. Straight-line vesting between these points.
Return on capital employed will be measured on an average basis over the three-year performance period, with a threshold level 
of performance of 14% (leading to 25% of that portion of the award vesting) and a maximum of 20%. Straight-line vesting between 
these points.
These targets have been carefully assessed and the Committee considers them to be appropriately stretching, given the Company’s 
business plans, opportunity set and investor expectations. 
In respect of the EPS element, targets will be set prior to the grant of awards following the 2018 AGM (thus allowing the Committee 
to consider all relevant factors prior to determining the awards). The actual targets will be disclosed when awards are granted as well 
as in the 2018 Remuneration report.
Chairman and Non-executive Director fees 
With effect from 1 January 2018, the basic fee payable to each Non-executive Director was increased by 2% to £49,000 per annum. 
An additional payment of £8,000 is made to those Non-executive Directors who additionally act as Chairman of a Committee and the 
Senior Independent Director. The Chairman’s fee is set at £180,000 per annum with no fee review due until 1 January 2020.

During the year, an external evaluation was carried out on the Committee’s performance, facilitated by the Chairman and the Group

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The following Directors were members of the Remuneration Committee when matters relating to the Directors’ remuneration for the 
year were being considered:
 – Ruth Cairnie (until 11 May 2017)
 – Eva Lindqvist (from 1 June 2017)
 – Chris Girling
 – Nancy Tuor Moore 
 – Paul Withers
During the year, the Committee received assistance from Kerry Porritt (Group Company Secretary), Graeme Cook (Group HR Director) 
and Irina Kapustina (Head of Reward and Performance) on salary increases, bonus awards, share plan awards and vesting and policy 
and governance matters. In determining the Executive Directors’ remuneration for 2017 and 2018, the Committee has consulted the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive about its proposals, except (in the case of each) in relation to their own remuneration. No Director 
is involved in determining their own remuneration.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflict of interest arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. Given their diverse backgrounds, the Board believes that the 
members of the Committee are able to offer an informed and balanced view on executive remuneration issues.

The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are available on the group’s website (www.keller.com) and 
on request from the Group Company Secretary. 
During the year, an external evaluation was carried out on the Committee’s performance, facilitated by the Chairman and the Group 
Company Secretary. Further to the review, it was concluded that, consistent with the Code and its own terms of reference, the 
Remuneration Committee is discharging its obligations in an effective manner.
External advisers
During the year, the Committee received advice from Kepler, a brand of Mercer (‘Kepler’), an independent firm of remuneration 
consultants appointed by the Committee after consultation with the Board. In the first half of 2017, Kepler provided independent 
advice on remuneration policy and the external remuneration environment and benchmarking data.
Kepler reported directly to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and did not advise the Company on any other issues. 
Kepler’s total fees for the provision of remuneration services in 2017 were £18,542 on the basis of time spent. 
Following a review of remuneration advisers during 2017, which consisted of a full competitive tender process, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) 
was appointed by the Committee as independent adviser to the Committee with effect from 1 August 2017. The Committee is 
satisfied that Deloitte is and remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is impartial and objective. Deloitte 
is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at 
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
During the year Deloitte also provided advice to the Group HR Director in respect of its design of the remuneration framework for the 
group’s senior leaders and group share plans. The Committee is satisfied that the provision of these services did not impair Deloitte’s 
ability to advise the Committee independently. Their total fees for the provision of remuneration services to the Committee since 
appointment to 31 December 2017 were £74,750.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice they have received has been objective and independent.

Directors’ report Share capital
Details of the share capital, together with details of the 
movements in the Company’s issued share capital during the 
year, are shown in note 25: Share capital and reserves. The 
Company has one class of Ordinary Shares which is listed on the 
London Stock Exchange (‘Ordinary Shares’). Ordinary Shares 
carry no right to a fixed income; and each Ordinary Share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a shareholding, 
nor on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the 
Articles of Association and the prevailing law. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on voting rights and the transfer of 
securities. No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 29: 
Share-based payments. Shares held by the Keller Group plc 
Employee Benefit Trust are not voted.
Repurchase of shares
The Company obtained shareholder authority at the last AGM 
(11 May 2017) to buy back up to 7,196,202 Ordinary Shares. 
The authority remains outstanding until the conclusion of the 
2017 AGM but could be varied or withdrawn by agreement of 
shareholders at an intervening General Meeting. The minimum 
price which must be paid for each Ordinary Share is its nominal 
value and the maximum price is the higher of an amount equal 
to not more than 5% above the average of the middle market 
quotations for an Ordinary Share as derived from the London 
Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days 
immediately before the purchase is made and an amount equal to 
the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an Ordinary 
Share and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary 
Share on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out.
The Directors have not used, and have no current plans to use, 
this authority.
Allotment of shares and pre-emption disapplication
Shareholder authority was also given at the last AGM for the 
Directors to allot new shares up to a nominal amount of 
£2,398,734, equivalent to approximately one-third of the 
Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as 
at 27 February 2017 and to disapply pre-emption rights up to 
an aggregate nominal amount of £359,810, representing 
approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital as 
at 27 February 2017. 
The Directors have not used, and have no current plans to use, 
these authorities.

Directors’ report continued Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the group and Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and applicable law 
and they have elected to prepare the Company financial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the group and Company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and 
Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
 – For the group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU;
 – For the Company financial statements, state whether the 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Company financial statements; 
 – Assess the group and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going 
concern; and
 – Use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Directors’ remuneration report and Corporate governance 
statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the 
Annual Report and the financial statements
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation as a whole; and
 – The Strategic report and Directors’ report, including content 
contained by reference, includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
and performance of the Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Board confirms that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. 
The Strategic report (pages 12 to 41) and the Directors’ report

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 1. Our opinion is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Keller Group plc (‘the Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, consolidated cash flow statement, company balance sheet and company statement of changes in 
equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1 to both the consolidated financial statements and company 
financial statements.
In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2017 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
 – the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our
opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.
We were appointed as auditor by the Company before 1994. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for more than the 
23 financial years ended 31 December 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the 
group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. 
No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.

2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at 
our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, 
our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the 
context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and 
consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Accounting for construction 
contracts:
(Construction revenue – 
£1,835.4 million; 
2016: £1,574.3 million)
Refer to page 55 
(Audit Committee Report) and 
page 95 (accounting policy).
Subjective estimate:
Contract accounting is 
considered to be a 
significant audit risk as it 
requires a high degree of 
estimation and judgement 
including: estimation of 
the total forecast costs 
of the contract at 
completion which drives 
the recognition of revenue 
and profit on contracts; 
and assessing the likely 
outcome of claims and 
variations. 
Error in any of these 
could result in a material 
variance in the amount of 
revenue and profit or loss 
recognised.
Our procedures included: 
 – Control design and reperformance: Testing the design and 
operating effectiveness of controls over contract revenue and 
related expenditure.
 – Our sector experience: We identified contracts with the 
greatest impact on the group’s financial results, including 
those considered to be high risk due to such factors as known 
issues on the contract or the nature of work being undertaken. 
For these contracts we challenged the group’s assumptions on 
costs to complete the contract through enquiries with project 
managers and agreeing cost estimates to internal forecasts 
and sub-contracts.
 – Historical comparisons: We assessed the reliability of the 
group’s forecasts of costs to complete by considering 
historical accuracy of their forecasts on completed contracts. 
 – Test of detail: 
 – For contracts completed by the year end, we assessed 
subsequent settlement of revenue recognised. 
 – We checked that claims and variations raised against 
customers were recognised only once agreed with the 
customer or once there was a valid expectation that the 
additional revenue would be agreed, in which case we held 
discussions with in-house legal counsel and inspected 
project reports submitted to the customer. 
 – We challenged the group’s assumptions over the progress of 
a selection of claims raised against the group by inspecting 
correspondence with the counterparty and with the group’s 
legal advisers or insurers where applicable.
 – Disclosures: We considered the adequacy of the group’s 
disclosures in respect of contract accounting and the 
accounting estimates.
Our results
 – The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered 
the amounts recognised in respect of construction contracts 
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).

Carrying value of goodwill:
(£159.0 million; 
2016: £166.5 million)
Refer to page 55 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 95 
(accounting policy) and page 102 
and 103 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based 
valuation:
There is a risk of 
impairment of the group’s 
significant goodwill 
balances due to prolonged 
downturn or structural 
change in the relevant 
construction markets. In 
particular there is increased 
risk with respect to:
 – the balance of £33.5 
million related to Keller 
Canada where the 
business is currently 
experiencing a downturn 
and the carrying 
amount of goodwill was 
impaired to its 
recoverable amount at 
31 December 2015; and 
 – the balance of £11.9 
million related to ASEAN 
Heavy Foundations 
where financial 
performance has 
deteriorated 
significantly over the 
last two years. 
The group estimates 
recoverable amount 
based on value in use 
which includes significant 
estimation and judgement 
in the selection of key 
inputs for the future cash 
flows, specifically forecast 
revenue and operating 
margin and discount rates.
Our procedures included: 
 – Historical comparisons: We assessed the reasonableness 
of the group’s revenue and operating margin assumptions by 
reference to past performance. 
 – Sensitivity analysis: We considered the sensitivity of the 
level of headroom available in the calculations to reasonably 
possible changes in assumptions to identify inputs on which 
to focus our testing. 
 – Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the 
reasonableness of the group’s assumptions by reference to 
externally derived data, forecasts for economic factors and 
current order book. 
 – Our sector experience: Our valuation specialists assisted 
in evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and 
methodologies underlying the discount rates adopted by 
the group. 
 – Disclosures: We assessed whether the group’s disclosures 
about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment 
assessment to changes in key assumptions reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill.
Our results
 – The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered 
the carrying amount of goodwill to be acceptable (2016: 
acceptable).

Parent Company financial 
statements:
Valuation of investments and 
recoverability of intercompany 
receivables 
Investments £364.7 million 
(2016: £366.1 million) 
Intercompany receivables 
£419.1 million 
(2016: £475.6 million) 
Low risk, high value
The carrying amount of:
 – the company’s 
investments in 
subsidiaries held at cost 
less impairment; and
 – intercompany 
receivables
represent 99% 
(2016: 98%) of the 
company’s total assets.
We do not consider the 
valuation of these 
investments and recovery 
of intercompany 
receivables to be at a 
high risk of significant 
misstatement, or to be 
subject to a significant 
level of judgement. 
However, due to their 
materiality in the context 
of the company financial 
statements, this is 
considered to be the area 
that had the greatest 
effect on our overall 
parent company audit.
Our procedures included: 
 – Test of details: Comparing the carrying amount of a sample 
of the highest value investments and intercompany receivables, 
representing 99% (2016: 99%) of the total investments and 
intercompany receivables balance with the relevant subsidiaries’ 
draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being 
an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were 
in excess of their carrying amount.
Our results
 – We found the assessment of the carrying value of investments 
and the recoverability of intercompany receivables to be 
acceptable (2016: acceptable).
In our audit report for the year ended 31 December 2016, we also had a key audit matter in respect of the valuation of non-current 
assets held for sale. As all these have been disposed of by the group during the year ended 31 December 2017, this is not a key audit 
matter in the current year.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £4.5 million (2016: £4.2 million), determined with reference to 
a benchmark group profit before non-underlying items and tax, 
of £98.7 million (2016: £85.1 million), of which it represents 4.6% 
(2016: 4.9%). 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a 
whole was set at £3.4 million (2016: £3.2 million), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of company total assets of 
£790.8 million (2016: £858.1 million), of which it represents 
0.4% (2016: 0.4%). 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.2 million 
(2016: £0.2 million), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the group’s 47 (2016: 50) reporting components, we 
subjected 21 (2016: 22) to full scope audits for group purposes 
and none (2016: one) to specified risk-focused audit procedures. 
The components within the scope of our work accounted for 
the percentages illustrated opposite. 
The remaining 18% (2016: 12%) of total group revenue, 7% 
(2016: 10%) of group profit before tax and 23% (2016: 17%) of 
total group assets is represented by reporting components, 
none of which individually represented more than 4% (2016: 2%) 
of any of total group revenue, group profit before tax or total 
group assets. For these residual components, we performed 
analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these. 
The group team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks 
detailed above and the information to be reported back. The 
group audit team approved the divisional component materialities, 
which ranged from £2.8 million to £3.8 million (2016: £2.8 million 
to £3.6 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile 
of the group across the components. 
Aside from the audit of the parent company and the 
consolidation process that was performed by the group audit 
team, the work on all of the components was performed by the 
component auditors. 
The group team performed procedures on the items excluded 
from group profit before non-underlying items and tax. 
The group team visited the three (2016: three) divisional 
component locations in each of North America, EMEA and APAC 
(2016: each of North America, EMEA and APAC) to assess the 
audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were 
also held with these component auditors. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the group team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the 
group team was then performed by the component auditor.

Independent Auditor’s report continued 4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
 – we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement in note 2 to the 
consolidated financial statements on the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt over the group and Company’s 
use of that basis for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
 – if the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on 
page 40 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the 
Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:
 – we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report and the directors’ report;
 – in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and
 – in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ remuneration report
In our opinion the part of the directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on 
page 39 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity;
 – the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and
 – the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Strategic report Overview Financial statements Governance Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect.
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy; or
 – the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which 
we are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 79, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or 
to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see 
below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably 
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
from our sector experience, through discussion with the directors 
and other management (as required by auditing standards).
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly affect 
the financial statements including financial reporting (including 
related company legislation), pension and taxation legislation. 
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statements items.
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations 
in the specific areas of health and safety, building and 
environmental regulations, anti-bribery and employment law, 
recognising the nature of the group’s activities. With the 
exception of any known or possible non-compliance, and as 
required by auditing standards, our work in respect of these was 
limited to enquiry of the directors and other management and 
inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence. We 
considered the effect of any known or possible non-compliance 
in these areas as part of our procedures on the related financial 
statements items.
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout 
our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance 
throughout the audit. This included communication from the 
group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations 
identified at group level, with a request to report on any indications 
of potential existence of non-compliance with relevant laws and 
regulations (irregularities) in these areas, or other areas directly 
identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of 
non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations irregularities, 
as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our 
responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Consolidated cash flow statement
For the year ended 31 December 2017 1 General information
Keller Group plc (‘the parent’ or ‘the Company’) is a company 
incorporated	in	the	United	Kingdom.	The	consolidated	financial	
statements are presented in pounds sterling (rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand), the functional currency of the 
parent.	Foreign	operations	are	included	in	accordance	with	the	
policies set out in note 2.
2 Principal accounting policies
Statement of compliance
The	consolidated	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	and	
approved	by	the	Directors	in	accordance	with	International	
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU.
The	Company	prepares	its	parent	company	financial	statements	
in	accordance	with	FRS	101;	these	are	presented	on	pages	116	
to 124.
Basis of preparation
The	financial	statements	are	prepared	on	the	historical	cost	
basis	except	that	derivative	financial	instruments	are	stated	at	
their	fair	value.	The	carrying	value	of	hedged	items	are,	where	
relevant,	re-measured	to	fair	value	in	respect	of	the	hedged	risk.	
Except	as	noted	below,	these	accounting	policies	have	been	
applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
consolidated	financial	statements	and	have	been	applied	
consistently by subsidiaries.
The	consolidated	financial	statements	are	prepared	on	a	going	
concern basis as set out on page 40.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
There	is	no	significant	financial	impact	on	the	group	financial	
statements	of	the	following	new	standards,	amendments	and	
interpretations	that	are	in	issue	for	the	financial	year	ending	
31 December 2017:
 – Amendments to IAS 12 – Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets 
for Unrealised Losses.
 – Amendments to IAS 7 – Disclosure Initiative.
Disclosure	of	the	changes	in	liabilities	arising	from	financing	
activities,	including	both	changes	arising	from	cash	flows	and	
non-cash changes, has been included in note 24 as a result of 
adopting Amendments to IAS 7 – Disclosure Initiative.
IFRS	15	–	Revenue	from	Contracts	with	Customers	became	
effective	on	1	January	2018.	This	standard	modifies	the	
determination	of	how	much	revenue	to	recognise,	and	when,	
and	provides	a	single,	principles-based	five-step	model	to	be	
applied	to	all	contracts	with	customers.	It	replaces	the	separate	
models for goods, services and construction contracts under 
current	IFRS.	The	standard	will	be	adopted	retrospectively	with	
the	cumulative	effect	of	initially	applying	the	standard	
recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings at 1 January 
2018. Additional disclosures required as a result of adopting 
IFRS	15	will	be	presented	in	the	2018	financial	statements.
Impact of IFRS 15 on construction contracts: The standard is 
only expected to have a potential impact on those contracts that 
are ongoing at the end of a reporting period and have multiple 
performance obligations. With a typical contract size of around 
£300k	with	short	duration,	revenue	will	continue	to	be	recognised	
in year for the vast majority of contracts and the accounting for 
costs	will	remain	unchanged:	costs	(including	bid	costs)	will	be	
expensed as incurred or as materials are consumed. It is 
expected that the amount of costs capitalised and spread over 
the	life	of	contracts	will	not	be	material.	Revenue	on	construction	
contracts meets the criteria for over time recognition under 
IFRS	15	and	revenue	will	be	recognised	with	reference	to	the	
input (costs) method.
In order to establish the impact of adopting IFRS 15 on construction 
contracts at 31 December 2017, the group completed impact 
assessment	checklists	for	all	contracts	awarded	prior	to	the	end	of	
November that had expected revenue greater than £2m and that 
were	going	to	be	in	progress	at	31	December	2017 .	A	threshold	of	
£2m	was	used	as	it	is	the	larger	contracts	that	are	more	complex	
and	more	likely	to	have	multiple	performance	obligations	and	
contracts	awarded	in	December	would	not	have	made	sufficient	
progress	by	31	December	2017	to	have	a	material	difference	in	
treatment under IFRS 15. Of the 150 contracts that met this criteria, 
it	was	determined	that	only	16	had	multiple	performance	obligations.	
This	low	number	of	contracts	with	multiple	performance	obligations	
was	as	expected	due	to	the	fact	that	the	work	performed	by	the	
group under construction contracts is generally the repetitive 
performance of a single technique (eg driving an agreed number 
of	piles)	or	where	separate	techniques	are	applied	they	are	
generally	providing	the	client	with	an	integrated	solution,	and	are	
therefore highly interrelated. Contracts that had multiple 
performance	obligations	were	typically	those	that	were	split	into	
phases	that	were	not	highly	interrelated	and	the	work	performed	
was	not	a	series	of	distinct	activities	that	were	substantially	the	
same.	For	the	16	contracts	that	were	identified	as	having	multiple	
performance obligations, an assessment of the impact of adopting 
IFRS	15	resulted	in	no	material	differences	being	identified.	On	this	
basis, the group expects there to be no material adjustment to 
retained earnings from construction contracts at 1 January 2018.
Impact of IFRS 15 on goods and services: The group’s revenue 
recognised from the supply of goods and services primarily relates 
to the Suncoast business. Under IFRS 15, all customer contracts 
are considered single performance obligations because contracts 
that involve installation or post-delivery services provide an 
integrated solution and modify the materials delivered to the 
customer. For contracts that are just the supply of materials, 
revenue	will	continue	to	be	recognised	on	delivery.	For	contracts	
that involve delivery of materials and an element of installation or 
post-delivery	services,	these	now	qualify	for	overtime	recognition	
under IFRS 15 as the group has an enforceable right to payment 
for performance to date and the performance does not create an 
asset	with	an	alternative	use	for	the	group.	Currently	all	revenue	is	
deferred on these contracts until the contract has been completed. 
This	will	result	in	a	credit	to	opening	retained	earnings	at	
1	January	2018,	the	quantum	of	which	is	expected	to	be	below	£3m.
This	assessment	of	the	impact	of	IFRS	15	is	provisional	and	will	
be	finalised	in	2018.
IFRS	9	–	Financial	Instruments	became	effective	on	1	January	
2018. The group has assessed the impact of adopting this 
standard	and	has	concluded	that	there	will	not	be	a	significant	
financial	impact	on	the	group	financial	statements.	Additional	
disclosures	required	as	a	result	of	adopting	IFRS	9	will	be	
presented	in	the	2018	financial	statements.
IFRS	16	–	Leases	becomes	effective	from	1	January	2019.	The	
group is in the early stages of assessing the impact of adopting 
this standard.
Basis of consolidation
The	consolidated	financial	statements	consolidate	the	accounts	
of	the	parent	and	its	subsidiary	undertakings	(collectively	‘the	
group’) made up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are 
entities	controlled	by	the	Company.	Control	exists	when	the	
Company	has	power	over	an	entity,	exposure	to	variable	returns	
from	its	involvement	with	an	entity	and	the	ability	to	use	its	
power	over	the	entity	to	affect	its	returns.	Where	subsidiary	
undertakings	were	acquired	or	sold	during	the	year,	the	accounts	
include	the	results	for	the	part	of	the	year	for	which	they	were	
subsidiary	undertakings	using	the	acquisition	method	of	
accounting. Intra-group balances, and any unrealised income 
and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are 
eliminated	in	preparing	the	consolidated	financial	statements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements Joint arrangements
From	time	to	time	the	group	undertakes	contracts	jointly	with	
other parties. These fall under the category of joint operations 
as	defined	by	IFRS	11.	In	accordance	with	IFRS	11,	the	group	
accounts	for	its	own	share	of	assets,	liabilities,	revenues	and	
expenses measured according to the terms of the agreements 
covering the joint operations. Where an arrangement is 
categorised as a joint venture, the investment in the joint venture 
is	recognised	as	an	asset	and	the	group’s	share	of	the	net	profit	
or loss of the joint venture is recognised in the income statement 
in	accordance	with	the	equity	method.
Revenue recognition
Revenue	represents	the	fair	value	of	work	done	on	construction	
contracts performed during the year on behalf of customers or the 
value of goods or services delivered to customers. In accordance 
with	IAS	11,	contract	revenue	and	expenses	are	recognised	in	
proportion to the stage of completion of the contract as soon as 
the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably.
The	fair	value	of	work	done	is	calculated	using	the	expected	
final	contract	value,	based	on	contracted	values	adjusted	for	the	
impact	of	any	known	variations,	and	the	stage	of	completion,	
calculated as costs to date as a proportion of total expected 
contract costs. Bid costs are expensed as incurred.
In the nature of the group’s business, the results for the year 
include adjustments to the outcome of construction contracts, 
including joint operations, completed in prior years arising from 
claims from customers or third parties and claims on customers 
or third parties for variations to the original contract.
Provision against claims from customers or third parties is made in 
the	year	in	which	the	group	becomes	aware	that	a	claim	may	arise	
and is considered probable. 
Income from variations and claims on customers or third parties 
is	only	recognised	once	agreed,	or	where	there	is	a	high	level	of	
certainty in receiving the claim.
Where	it	is	probable	that	a	loss	will	arise	on	a	contract,	full	
provision	for	this	loss	is	made	when	the	group	becomes	aware	
that a loss may arise.
Revenue in respect of goods and services is recognised as the 
goods and services are delivered.
Leases
Leases	are	classified	as	finance	leases	whenever	the	terms	of	the	
lease	transfer	substantially	all	the	risks	and	rewards	of	ownership	
to	the	lessee.	All	other	leases	are	classified	as	operating	leases.
Property,	plant	and	equipment	acquired	under	finance	leases	
are	capitalised	in	the	balance	sheet	at	the	lower	of	fair	value	or	
present value of minimum lease payments and depreciated in 
accordance	with	the	group’s	accounting	policy.	The	capital	
element of the leasing commitment is included as obligations 
under	finance	leases.	The	rentals	payable	are	apportioned	
between	interest,	which	is	charged	to	the	income	statement,	
and	capital,	which	reduces	the	outstanding	obligation.
Amounts payable under operating leases are charged to 
operating costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies
Balance sheet items in foreign currencies are translated into sterling 
at closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income 
statements	and	cash	flows	of	overseas	subsidiary	undertakings	are	
translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange	differences	arising	from	the	retranslation	of	opening	
net assets and income statements at closing and average rates 
of	exchange	respectively	are	dealt	with	in	other	comprehensive	
income,	along	with	changes	in	fair	values	of	associated	net	
investment	hedges.	All	other	exchange	differences	are	charged	
to the income statement. 
The exchange rates used in respect of principal currencies are:
2017 2016
US dollar: average for period 1.29 1.36
US dollar: period end 1.35 1.23
Canadian dollar: average for period 1.67 1.80
Canadian dollar: period end 1.69 1.66
Euro: average for period 1.14 1.22
Euro: period end 1.13 1.17
Singapore dollar: average for period 1.78 1.87
Singapore dollar: period end 1.80 1.78
Australian dollar: average for period 1.68 1.82
Australian dollar: period end 1.73 1.71
Interest income and expense
All interest income and expense is recognised in the income 
statement	in	the	period	in	which	it	is	incurred	using	the	effective	
interest method.
Employee benefit costs
The	group	operates	a	number	of	defined	benefit	pension	
arrangements,	and	also	makes	payments	into	defined	
contribution schemes for employees.
The	liability	in	respect	of	defined	benefit	schemes	is	the	present	
value	of	the	defined	benefit	obligations	at	the	balance	sheet	
date, calculated using the projected unit credit method, less the 
fair	value	of	the	schemes’	assets.	As	allowed	by	IAS	19,	the	group	
recognises the administration costs, current service cost and 
interest on scheme net liabilities in the income statement, and 
remeasurements	of	defined	benefit	plans	in	other	
comprehensive	income	in	full	in	the	period	in	which	they	occur.
Payments	to	defined	contribution	schemes	are	accounted	for	
on an accruals basis.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable 
and the deferred tax charge.
Provision	is	made	for	current	tax	on	taxable	profits	for	the	year.	
Taxable	profit	differs	from	profit	before	taxation	as	reported	in	
the income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred	tax	is	recognised	on	differences	between	the	carrying	
amounts	of	assets	and	liabilities	in	the	financial	statements	and	
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit,	and	is	accounted	for	using	the	balance	sheet	liability	method.	
Full	provision	is	made	for	deferred	tax	on	temporary	differences	
in	line	with	IAS	12,	‘Income	Taxes’.	Deferred	tax	assets	are	
recognised	when	it	is	considered	likely	that	they	will	be	utilised	
against	future	taxable	profits.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to 
apply	in	the	period	when	the	liability	is	settled	or	the	asset	is	
realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income 
statement,	except	when	it	relates	to	items	charged	or	credited	
directly	to	equity	or	to	other	comprehensive	income,	in	which	
case	the	related	deferred	tax	is	also	dealt	with	in	equity	or	in	
other comprehensive income.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements Governance Strategic report Overview 2 Principal accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation	is	provided	to	write	off	the	cost	less	the	estimated	
residual value of property, plant and equipment by reference to 
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. 
The rates of depreciation used are:
Buildings 2%
Long-life plant and equipment 8%
Short-life plant and equipment 12%
Motor vehicles 25%
Computers 33%
The cost of leased properties is depreciated by equal instalments 
over	the	period	of	the	lease	or	50	years,	whichever	is	the	shorter.
Non-current assets held for sale
The	group	classifies	a	non-current	asset	as	held	for	sale	when	
the asset is available for immediate sale and management is 
committed to selling the asset, an active programme to locate 
a	buyer	has	been	initiated	and	the	sale	is	highly	probable	within	
12	months	of	classification	as	held	for	sale.
At	the	time	of	classification	as	held	for	sale	the	non-current	
asset	is	measured	at	the	lower	of	the	carrying	amount	and	the	
fair value less costs to sell. Any subsequent impairment losses 
are recognised in the income statement. Any subsequent 
increase in the fair value is recognised in the income statement 
to the extent that it is not in excess of any previous impairment.
Business combinations
The group accounts for business combinations in accordance 
with	IFRS 3,	‘Business	Combinations	(2008)’	using	the	acquisition	
method	as	at	the	acquisition	date,	which	is	the	date	on	which	
control is transferred to the group.
Costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Any 
contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at 
the	acquisition	date	with	subsequent	changes	to	the	fair	value	
being	recognised	in	profit	or	loss,	unless	the	change	was	as	a	
result	of	new	information	about	facts	or	circumstances	existing	
at the acquisition date being obtained during the measurement 
period,	in	which	case	the	change	is	recognised	in	the	balance	
sheet	as	an	adjustment	to	goodwill.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill	arising	on	consolidation,	representing	the	difference	
between	the	fair	value	of	the	purchase	consideration	and	the	fair	
value	of	the	identifiable	net	assets	of	the	subsidiary	undertaking	
at the date of acquisition, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The	fair	value	of	identifiable	net	assets	in	excess	of	the	fair	value	
of purchase consideration is credited to the income statement 
in the year of acquisition. 
Subsequent	to	initial	recognition,	goodwill	is	measured	at	cost	
less	accumulated	impairment	losses.	Goodwill	is	reviewed	for	
impairment	annually	and	whenever	there	is	an	indication	that	the	
goodwill	may	be	impaired	in	accordance	with	IAS	36,	with	any	
impairment losses being recognised immediately in the income 
statement.	Goodwill	arising	prior	to	1	January	1998	was	taken	
directly	to	equity	in	the	year	in	which	it	arose.	Such	goodwill	has	
not been reinstated on the balance sheet. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible	assets,	other	than	goodwill,	include	purchased	
licences,	software,	patents,	customer	contracts,	non-compete	
undertakings,	customer	relationships,	trademarks	and	trade	
names. Intangible assets are capitalised at cost and amortised 
on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from the 
date that they are available for use and are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Useful 
economic lives do not exceed seven years.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are 
accounted for initially at fair value.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill
At	each	balance	sheet	date	the	group	reviews	the	carrying	
amounts	of	its	assets	to	determine	whether	there	is	any	
indication	that	those	assets	have	suffered	an	impairment	loss.	
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset 
is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment 
loss, if any.
Capital work in progress
Capital	work	in	progress	represents	expenditure	on	property,	
plant and equipment in the course of construction. Transfers are 
made	to	other	property,	plant	and	equipment	categories	when	
the assets are available for use.
Inventories
Inventories	are	measured	at	the	lower	of	cost	and	estimated	net	
realisable	value	with	due	allowance	being	made	for	obsolete	or	
slow-moving	items.	
Cost	comprises	direct	materials	and,	where	applicable,	direct	
labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Financial instruments
Financial	assets	and	financial	liabilities	are	recognised	on	the	
group’s	balance	sheet	when	the	group	becomes	party	to	the	
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative	financial	instruments	are	accounted	for	in	accordance	
with	IAS	39	and	recognised	initially	at	fair	value.
The	group	uses	currency	and	interest	rate	swaps	to	manage	
financial	risk.	Interest	charges	and	financial	liabilities	are	stated	
after	taking	account	of	these	swaps.
The	group	uses	these	swaps	and	other	hedges	to	mitigate	
exposures to both foreign currency and interest rates. 
Hedges	are	accounted	for	as	follows:
Cash flow hedges:	The	effective	part	of	any	gain	or	loss	on	the	
hedging instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. 
Any	ineffective	portion	of	the	hedge	is	recognised	immediately	
in the income statement. The associated cumulative gain or loss 
is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement 
in	the	same	period	or	periods	during	which	the	hedged	forecast	
transaction	affects	profit	or	loss.
Fair value hedges: Changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying 
value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value 
that	is	attributable	to	the	risk	being	hedged	and	any	gains	or	
losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Net investment hedges: The	effective	portion	of	the	change	in	
fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in the 
translation	reserve.	Any	ineffectiveness	is	recognised	
immediately in the income statement. 
94 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest, are initially recognised 
at fair value and are carried at amortised cost as reduced by 
appropriate	allowances	for	estimated	irrecoverable	amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing, are initially recognised 
at fair value and are carried at amortised cost.
Borrowings
Borrowings	are	recognised	initially	at	fair	value	less	attributable	
issue	costs.	Subject	to	initial	recognition,	borrowings	are	stated	
at amortised cost.
Provisions
A	provision	is	recognised	in	the	balance	sheet	when	the	group	
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event	and	where	it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	will	be	required	to	
settle the obligation.
Financial guarantees
Where	group	companies	enter	into	financial	guarantee	
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness or obligations of 
other	companies	within	the	group,	these	are	considered	to	be	
insurance arrangements, and accounted for as such. In this 
respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent 
liability until such time as it becomes probable that the guarantor 
will	be	required	to	make	a	payment	under	the	guarantee.
Share-based payment
Charges for employee services received in exchange for 
share-based	payment	have	been	made	in	accordance	with	IFRS 2.
Options granted under the group’s employee share schemes are 
equity settled. The fair value of such options has been calculated 
using	a	stochastic	model,	based	upon	publicly	available	market	
data, and is charged to the income statement over the 
performance	period	with	a	corresponding	increase	in	equity.
At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimate 
of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the 
service	and	non-market	vesting	conditions.	It	recognises	the	
impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement,	with	a	corresponding	adjustment	to	equity.	
Segmental reporting
IFRS 8	requires	operating	segments	to	be	identified	on	the	basis	
of internal	reports	about	components	of	the	group	that	are	
regularly	reviewed	by	the	Chief	Operating	Decision	Maker	to	
allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance.	The group	determines	the	Chief	Operating	
Decision	Maker	to	be	the	Board	of	Directors.
An operating segment is a component of the group that engages 
in business	activities	from	which	it	may	earn	revenues	and	
incur expenses,	including	revenues	and	expenses	that	relate	
to transactions	with	any	of	the	group’s	other	components.	
Segmental	results	are	presented	as	operating	profit	before	
non-underlying	items.	Segment	assets	are	defined	as	property,	
plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and trade 
and	other	receivables.	Segment	liabilities	are	defined	as	trade	
and	other	payables,	retirement	benefit	liabilities,	provisions	and	
other	liabilities.	The accounting	policies	of	the	operating	
segments	are	the	same	as the	group’s	accounting	policies.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recorded in the group’s consolidated 
financial	statements	when	paid.	Final	dividends	are	recorded	
in	the	group’s	consolidated	financial	statements	in	the	period	
in	which	they	receive	shareholder	approval.
Non-underlying items
Non-underlying	items	are	disclosed	separately	in	the	financial	
statements	where	it	is	necessary	to	do	so	to	provide	further	
understanding	of	the	financial	performance	of	the	group.	They	
are	items	which	are	exceptional	by	their	size	or	are	non-trading	
in nature, including amortisation of acquired intangibles and 
other non-trading amounts relating to acquisitions.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The	preparation	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements	
in	conformity	with	IFRS requires	management	to	make	
judgements,	estimates	and	assumptions	that	affect	the	
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical experience and various 
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances,	the	results	of	which	form	the	basis	of	making	the	
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may 
differ	from	these	estimates.
The	estimates	and	underlying	assumptions	are	reviewed	on	an	
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in	the	period	in	which	the	estimate	is	revised	if	the	revision	affects	
only that and prior periods, or in the period of the revision and 
future	periods	if	the	revision	affects	both	current	and	future	periods.
The	key	estimates	and	judgements	in	drawing	up	the	group’s	
consolidated	financial	statements	are	in	connection	with	
accounting for construction contracts and the carrying value 
of	goodwill.
Construction contracts:	The	group’s	approach	to	key	estimates	
and judgements relating to construction contracts is set out in the 
revenue recognition policy above. The main factors considered 
when	making	those	estimates	and	judgements	include	the	costs	
of	the	work	required	to	complete	the	contract	in	order	to	estimate	
the percentage completion, and the outcome of claims raised 
against the group by customers or third parties. The group 
performed	around	6,300	contracts	during	2017 ,	with	the	average	
contract size being approximately £300,000 and a typical range 
of	between	£25,000	and	£10	million	in	value.	The	majority	of	
contracts	were	completed	in	year	and	therefore	there	are	no	
estimates involved in accounting for these. For contracts that are 
not complete at year end, the group estimates the costs to 
complete	in	order	to	measure	progress	and	therefore	how	much	
revenue	to	recognise.	The	actual	outcome	of	these	contracts	will	
differ	to	the	estimate	at	31	December	and	it	is	reasonably	possible	
that	outcomes	on	these	contracts	within	the	next	year	could	be	
materially	different	in	aggregate	to	those	estimated.	It	is	not	
possible	to	quantify	the	expected	impact	of	this,	however	the	
estimated costs to complete are management’s best estimate 
at this point in time and no individual estimate or judgement is 
expected	to	have	a	materially	different	outcome.
Carrying value of goodwill:	The	group	tests	annually	whether	
goodwill	has	suffered	any	impairment	in	accordance	with	the	
accounting policy set out above. The group estimates the 
recoverable amount based on value-in-use calculations. These 
calculations require the use of assumptions, the most important 
being the forecast revenues and operating margins and the 
discount rates applied. Further details on the assumptions used 
are set out in note 13.
The group also uses estimates in assessing the amount of any 
contingent consideration payable and the recoverability of 
deferred	tax	assets.	Significant	assumptions	used	in	these	
calculations	are	forecast	revenue	growth	and	forecast	margins	
and for the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax 
assets,	forecast	taxable	profits.	A	change	in	these	forecasts	in	
the next year is not expected to have a material impact on the 
valuation of these balances.

2017 acquisitions
On 6 March 2017, the group acquired the assets and liabilities of Geo Instruments, an instrumentation and monitoring company based 
in North America, for cash consideration of £2.8m ($3.6m). The purchase price is a premium of £0.5m ($0.7m) to the fair value of the 
net	assets	acquired.	This	goodwill	is	attributable	to	the	knowledge	and	expertise	of	the	assembled	workforce,	the	expectation	of	
future	contracts	and	customer	relationships	and	the	operating	synergies	that	arise	from	the	group’s	strengthened	market	position.
In	the	period	to	31	December	2017,	Geo	Instruments	contributed	£3.4m	to	revenue	and	a	profit	for	the	period	of	£0.4m.	Had	the	
acquisition	taken	place	on	1	January	2017,	total	group	turnover	would	have	been	£2,071.3m	and	total	profit	for	the	period	before	
non-underlying	items	would	have	been	£74.1m.
The	adjustments	made	in	respect	of	acquisitions	in	the	year	to	31	December	2017	are	provisional	and	will	be	finalised	within	12	months	
of the acquisition date.

On 29 February 2016, the group acquired 100% of the share capital of the Tecnogeo group of companies, a business based in 
São Paulo, Brazil, for an initial cash consideration of £12.8m (BRL 60.8m). The fair value of the intangible assets acquired represents 
the	fair	value	of	customer	contracts	at	the	date	of	acquisition	and	the	trade	name.	Goodwill	arising	on	acquisition	is	attributable	to	
the	knowledge	and	expertise	of	the	assembled	workforce,	the	expectation	of	future	contracts	and	customer	relationships	and	the	
operating	synergies	that	arise	from	the	group’s	strengthened	market	position.	
On 4 April 2016, the group acquired assets and certain liabilities of Smithbridge Group Pty Limited, a business based in Brisbane, Australia, 
for	an	initial	cash	consideration	of	£1.8m	(A$3.4m).	The	purchase	price	reflects	the	fair	value	of	the	assets	and	liabilities	acquired.

Amortisation	of	acquired	intangible	assets	primarily	relate	to	Keller	Canada,	Austral,	Bencor	and	Franki	Africa.
Additional contingent consideration provided relates to the Geo-Foundations and Ellington Cross acquisitions. 
The	£21.0m	exceptional	profit	relating	to	the	contract	dispute	represents	the	gain	on	disposal	of	the	freehold	of	the	processing	and	
warehousing	facility	at	Avonmouth,	near	Bristol,	acquired	in	2016	(note	20),	rental	income	less	operating	costs	to	the	date	of	disposal	
and	insurance	recoveries	in	the	period.	The	£14.3m	exceptional	profit	in	2016	relating	to	the	contract	dispute	is	attributable	to	insurance	
proceeds	received	after	an	initial	settlement	with	insurers,	rental	income	less	operating	costs	from	the	acquired	processing	and	
warehousing	facility	and	the	reversal	of	impairment	of	the	valuation	of	the	property	following	an	external	valuation	at	31	December	2016.
Contingent consideration released relates to adjustments to estimated amounts payable for the Austral and Ansah acquisitions.
The	£14.3m	exceptional	restructuring	charge	in	2016	relates	to	asset	write	downs,	redundancy	costs	and	other	reorganisation	charges	
in	markets	experiencing	significantly	depressed	trading	conditions	(Singapore,	Australia,	Canada	and	South	Africa).	This	includes	the	
write-down	of	surplus	equipment	to	current	market	values	where	it	is	not	being	relocated	to	more	active	parts	of	the	group.

The	additional	tax	charged	at	other	rates	of	tax	relates	primarily	to	tax	arising	on	profits	from	operations	in	North	America	where	rates	
have	been	significantly	higher	than	in	the	UK.
In	December	2017	the	US	Government	approved	a	package	of	tax	reform	which	included	a	reduction	in	the	federal	rate	of	corporation	
tax	from	35%	to	21%,	effective	from	1	January	2018.	Whilst	this	benefit	has	been	partly	offset	by	other	changes,	the	reforms	as	a	
whole	are	expected	to	result	in	a	significant	reduction	in	the	group’s	tax	costs	due	to	the	relatively	large	size	of	its	US	business.	The	tax	
charge	for	2017	includes	a	credit	of	£9.7m	from	the	remeasurement	of	deferred	tax	liabilities.	In	future	the	effective	rate	of	US	tax	on	
the	group’s	US	profit	before	tax	is	expected	to	fall	from	high	thirties	percent	to	high	twenties	percent,	inclusive	of	state	taxes	and	
recurring permanent adjustments.
The	group	is	subject	to	taxation	in	over	40	countries	worldwide	and	the	risk	of	changes	in	tax	legislation	and	interpretation	from	tax	
authorities	in	the	jurisdictions	in	which	it	operates.	The	assessment	of	uncertain	positions	is	subjective	and	subject	to	management’s	
best	judgement.	Where	tax	positions	are	uncertain,	provision	is	made	where	necessary	based	on	interpretation	of	legislation,	
management experience and appropriate professional advice. We do not expect the outcome of these estimates to be materially 
different	from	the	position	taken.	
The	financing	of	group	companies	includes	some	activities	which	are	subject	to	exemptions	under	the	UK’s	Controlled	Foreign	
Company	Regime.	The	group	is	monitoring	the	EU	Commission’s	investigation	of	whether	such	exemptions	are	in	breach	of	EU	State	
Aid	rules.	The	investigation	is	not	expected	to	be	concluded	within	the	next	12	months.	No	provision	has	been	made	for	any	additional	
tax that might become payable at this time due to the uncertain nature of the outcome of these investigations.

arise	in	Canada	(£5.9m)	and	Australia	(£9.3m).	Canadian	tax	rules	currently	allow	tax	losses	to	be	carried	forward	up	to	20	years	and	
Australian	tax	rules	currently	allow	tax	losses	to	be	carried	forward	indefinitely.	We	have	assessed	the	recovery	of	deferred	tax	assets

The	recoverable	amount	of	the	goodwill	allocated	to	each	CGU	has	been	determined	based	on	a	value-in-use	calculation.	
The	calculations	all	use	cash	flow	projections	based	on	financial	budgets	and	forecasts	approved	by	management	covering	
a three-year period.
The	group’s	businesses	operate	in	cyclical	markets,	some	of	which	are	expected	to	continue	to	face	uncertain	conditions	over	the	
next	couple	of	years.	The	most	important	factors	in	the	value-in-use	calculations,	however,	are	the	forecast	revenues	and	operating	
margins	during	the	forecast	period	and	the	discount	rates	applied	to	future	cash	flows.	The	key	assumptions	underlying	the	cash	flow	
forecasts are therefore the revenue and operating margins assumed throughout the forecast period. The discount rates used in the 
value-in-use	calculations	are	based	on	the	weighted	average	cost	of	capital	of	companies	comparable	to	the	relevant	CGUs,	adjusted	
as	necessary	to	reflect	the	risk	associated	with	the	asset	being	tested.
Management	considers	all	the	forecast	revenues,	margins	and	profits	to	be	reasonably	achievable	given	recent	performance	and	the	
historic	trading	results	of	the	relevant	CGUs.	Cash	flows	beyond	2020	have	been	extrapolated	using	a	steady	revenue	growth	rate,	
usually	2%,	which	does	not	exceed	the	long-term	average	growth	rates	for	the	markets	in	which	the	relevant	CGUs	operate.
Management	believes	that,	with	the	exception	of	Keller	Canada	and	ASEAN	Heavy	Foundations,	any	reasonably	possible	change	in	
the	key	assumptions	on	which	the	recoverable	amounts	of	the	CGUs	identified	above	are	based	would	not	cause	any	of	their	carrying	
amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.
In	2015,	the	carrying	value	of	the	Keller	Canada	goodwill	was	impaired	by	£31.2m	(C$60.9m)	due	to	the	results	of	Keller	Canada	being	
below	those	expected	at	the	time	of	the	acquisition,	primarily	due	to	a	severe	slowdown	in	investment	in	the	Canadian	oil	sands	
following	the	very	significant	reduction	in	the	oil	price	since	the	time	of	acquisition.	Keller	Canada	continues	to	operate	in	a	challenging	
market	but	is	seeing	some	improvement	in	margins.	The	assumptions	underlying	the	forecasts	used	in	the	value-in-use	calculation	
at	31	December	2017	are	for	a	gradual	recovery	in	the	Canadian	market	in	the	medium	term	such	that	the	operating	margins	gradually	
recover	to	9%.	In	order	for	the	recoverable	amount	to	equal	the	carrying	amount,	assumed	operating	margins	in	each	year	would	have	
to decrease by 2.2%. Alternatively, a 2.5% increase in the discount rate or an 8% reduction in forecast revenue, at the assumed 
operating	margins,	in	each	year	would	lead	to	the	recoverable	amount	being	equal	to	the	carrying	value.
Although	no	impairment	has	been	recorded	against	the	goodwill	allocated	to	the	ASEAN	Heavy	Foundations	CGU,	financial	performance	
has	deteriorated	significantly	over	the	last	two	years	and	the	markets	this	CGU	operates	in	remain	challenging.	The	assumptions	
underlying the forecasts used in the value-in-use calculation at 31 December 2017 are for a gradual recovery in the ASEAN Heavy 
Foundations	markets	in	the	medium	term	such	that	operating	margins	gradually	recover	to	8%.	In	order	for	the	recoverable	amount	
to	equal	the	carrying	amount,	assumed	operating	margins	in	each	year	would	have	to	decrease	by	1.9%.	Alternatively,	a	2.7%	increase	
in	the	discount	rate	or	a	4.7%	reduction	in	forecast	revenue,	at	the	assumed	operating	margins,	in	each	year	would	lead	to	the	
recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value.

20 Non-current assets held for sale
On	12	May	2016,	the	group	acquired	the	freehold	of	a	processing	and	warehousing	facility	at	Avonmouth,	near	Bristol,	for	a	consideration	
of	£62m.	As	set	out	in	the	2015	Annual	Report	and	Accounts,	the	group’s	final	liability	with	regards	to	the	historic	contract	dispute	
involving	the	property	was	in	part	dependent	on	the	value	of	the	property.	In	order	to	maximise	this	value,	the	group	decided	to	acquire	
the	property	with	a	view	to	marketing	it	to	third	parties.
In	accordance	with	IFRS	5,	the	property	was	being	held	at	the	lower	of	carrying	amount	and	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell.	At	30	June	
2016,	the	fair	value	of	the	property	was	£48m,	based	on	an	external	valuation.	The	property	was	impaired	by	£14m	at	30	June	2016,	
however	the	group	previously	held	a	£14m	provision	for	the	diminution	in	value	of	the	property	as	part	of	the	overall	contract	dispute	
provision,	and	therefore	no	additional	impairment	charge	was	recognised.	At	31	December	2016,	the	fair	value	of	the	property	based	
on	an	external	valuation	was	£54m.	The	£6m	reversal	of	impairment	was	recognised	in	2016	as	exceptional	other	operating	income	
(note 7).
On 11 May 2017, the group disposed of the property for a consideration of £62m. The £8m gain on disposal has been recognised 
as	an	exceptional	item	within	other	operating	income	in	the	period	(note	7).

24 Financial instruments
Exposure	to	credit,	interest	rate	and	currency	risks	arise	in	the	normal	course	of	the	group’s	business.	Derivative	financial	instruments	
are	used	to	hedge	exposure	to	fluctuations	in	foreign	exchange	and	interest	rates.
The	group	does	not	trade	in	financial	instruments	nor	does	it	engage	in	speculative	derivative	transactions.
Currency risk
The	group	faces	currency	risk	principally	on	its	net	assets,	most	of	which	are	in	currencies	other	than	sterling.	The	group	aims	to	
reduce the impact that retranslation of these net assets might have on the consolidated balance sheet, by matching the currency of 
its	borrowings,	where	possible,	with	the	currency	of	its	assets.	The	majority	of	the	group’s	borrowings	are	held	in	sterling,	US	dollars,	
Canadian dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Emirati dirham and South African rand, in order to provide a hedge 
against these currency net assets.
The	group	manages	its	currency	flows	to	minimise	currency	transaction	exchange	risk.	Forward	contracts	and	other	derivative	
financial	instruments	are	used	to	hedge	significant	individual	transactions.	The	majority	of	such	currency	flows	within	the	group	relate	
to	repatriation	of	profits,	intra-group	loan	repayments	and	any	foreign	currency	cash	flows	associated	with	acquisitions.	The	group’s	
foreign exchange cover is executed primarily in the UK. 
At	31	December	2017,	the	fair	value	of	foreign	exchange	forward	contracts	outstanding	was	£0.5m,	included	in	current	liabilities	
(2016: £0.2m, included in current assets).
106 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued Interest rate risk
Interest	rate	risk	is	managed	by	mixing	fixed	and	floating	rate	borrowings	depending	upon	the	purpose	and	term	of	the	financing.	
Credit risk
The	group’s	principal	financial	assets	are	trade	and	other	receivables,	bank	and	cash	balances	and	a	limited	number	of	investments	
and	derivatives	held	to	hedge	certain	of	the	group’s	liabilities.	These	represent	the	group’s	maximum	exposure	to	credit	risk	in	relation	
to	financial	assets.	
The	group	has	stringent	procedures	to	manage	counterparty	risk	and	the	assessment	of	customer	credit	risk	is	embedded	in	the	
contract	tendering	processes.	Customer	credit	risk	is	mitigated	by	the	group’s	relatively	small	average	contract	size,	its	diversity,	both	
geographically	and	in	terms	of	end	markets,	and	by	taking	out	credit	insurance	in	many	of	the	countries	in	which	the	group	operates.	
No	individual	customer	represented	more	than	5%	of	revenue	in	2017.	The	counterparty	risk	on	bank	and	cash	balances	is	managed	
by	limiting	the	aggregate	amount	of	exposure	to	any	one	institution	by	reference	to	their	credit	rating	and	by	regular	review	of	these	
ratings.	The	ageing	of	trade	receivables	that	were	past	due	but	not	impaired	is	shown	in	note	17.
Liquidity risk and capital management
The	group’s	capital	structure	is	kept	under	constant	review,	taking	account	of	the	need	for,	availability	and	cost	of	various	sources	
of	finance.	The	capital	structure	of	the	group	consists	of	net	debt,	as	shown	on	page	108,	and	equity	attributable	to	equity	holders	
of	the	parent	as	shown	in	the	consolidated	balance	sheet.	The	group	maintains	a	balance	between	certainty	of	funding	and	a	flexible,	
cost-effective	financing	structure	with	all	main	borrowings	being	from	committed	facilities.	The	group’s	policy	continues	to	be	to	
ensure that its capital structure is appropriate to support this balance and the group’s operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to	shareholders,	issue	new	shares	or	sell	assets	to	reduce	debt.	The	group’s	debt	and	committed	facilities	mainly	comprise	a	$40m	
private placement repayable in 2018, a $50m private placement repayable in 2021, a $75m private placement repayable in 2024, a 
$62.5m revolving credit facility expiring in 2019 and a £250m syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in 2019. These facilities are 
subject	to	certain	covenants	linked	to	the	group’s	financing	structure,	specifically	regarding	the	ratios	of	debt	and	interest	to	profit.	
The	group	has	complied	with	these	covenants	throughout	the	period.
At	the	year	end,	the	group	also	had	other	committed	and	uncommitted	borrowing	facilities	totalling	£73.0m	(2016:	£69.2m)	to	support	
local requirements.
Private placements
In	August	2012,	$40m	was	raised	through	a	private	placement	with	US	institutions.	The	proceeds	of	the	issue	of	$40m	5.0%	notes	
due 2018	were	used	to	repay	existing	debt.	In	October	and	December	2014,	a	further	$50m	and	$75m	respectively	were	raised	
through	a	private	placement	with	US	institutions.	The	proceeds	of	the	issue	of	$50m	3.81%	Series	A	notes	due	2021	and	$75m	4.17%	
Series	B	notes	due	2024	were	used	to	refinance	maturing	private	placements.
The US private placement loans are accounted for on an amortised cost basis, adjusted for the impact of hedge accounting (as 
described	below),	and	retranslated	at	the	spot	exchange	rate	at	each	period	end.	The	carrying	value	of	the	private	placement	liabilities	
at	31	December	2017	was	£123.7m	(2016:	£136.3m).
Hedging
The	August	2012	$40m	fixed	rate	private	placement	liabilities	were	swapped	into	sterling	by	means	of	dollar	sterling	cross-currency	
fixed	interest	rate	swaps.	Also,	on	the	same	date,	£25.5m	of	sterling	was	swapped	into	euros	by	means	of	sterling	euro	cross-currency	
fixed	interest	rate	swaps.	These	interest	rate	swaps	(‘the	2012	swaps’)	have	the	same	maturity	as	the	private	placement	liability.	The	
dollar	sterling	swaps	have	been	designated	as	cash	flow	hedges	of	the	Company’s	exposure	to	the	variability	of	cash	flows	on	the	
private	placement	resulting	from	changes	in	foreign	exchange	rates	and	the	sterling	euro	swaps	have	been	designated	as	net	
investment hedges of the group’s euro-denominated net assets.
The	fair	value	of	the	2012	swaps	at	31	December	2017	represented	an	asset	of	£4.0m,	included	in	current	assets	(2016:	£6.9m	
included in other non-current assets) and a liability of £3.2m, included in current liabilities (2016: £2.5m included in other non-current 
liabilities).	The	effective	portion	of	the	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	dollar	sterling	swaps,	a	loss	of	£2.9m	(2016:	gain	of	£5.5m),	has	
been	taken	to	the	hedging	reserve	and	fully	recycled	through	the	income	statement	during	the	year.	The	effective	portion	of	the	
changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	sterling	euro	swaps,	a	loss	of	£0.7m	(2016:	loss	of	£3.8m),	has	been	taken	to	the	translation	reserve	
through	other	comprehensive	income	along	with	the	foreign	exchange	gains	and	losses	arising	on	retranslation	of	the	euro-
denominated assets they hedge.
The	2014	$50m	and	$75m	fixed	rate	private	placement	liabilities	were	swapped	into	floating	rate	by	means	of	US	dollar	interest	rate	
swaps	(‘the	2014	swaps’).	The	2014	swaps	have	the	same	maturity	as	the	private	placement	liabilities	and	have	been	designated	as	fair	
value hedges	of	the	group’s	exposure	to	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	US	private	placement	loans	and	related	interest	cash	flows	
due	to changes	in	US	dollar	interest	rates.
The	fair	value	of	the	2014	swaps	at	31	December	2017	represented	an	asset	of	£1.8m	(2016:	£2.5m)	which	is	included	in	other	
non-current	assets.	The	effective	portion	of	the	changes	in	the	fair	value	of	the	2014	swaps,	a	loss	of	£0.7m	(2016:	loss	of	£1.2m),	
has	been	taken	to	the	income	statement	along	with	equal	and	opposite	movement	in	fair	value	of	the	corresponding	hedged	items.
All	hedges	are	tested	for	effectiveness	every	six	months	using	the	cumulative	dollar	offset	method.	All	hedging	relationships	remained	
effective	during	the	year.	The	ineffective	portion	of	the	movement	in	the	fair	value	of	the	hedging	instruments	was	£nil	(2016:	£0.2m).

continued Non-interest-bearing	financial	liabilities	comprise	trade	and	other	payables	of	£419.0m	(2016:	£381.6m)	which	were	payable	within

is	payable	between	one	and	two	years	and	£nil	(2016:	£5.1m)	is	payable	between	two	and	five	years.
The	group	had	unutilised	committed	banking	facilities	of	£161.3m	at	31	December	2017	(2016:	£108.3m).	This	mainly	comprised	the	
unutilised	portion	of	the	group’s	£250m	facility	which	expires	on	4	September	2019.	In	addition,	the	group	had	unutilised	uncommitted	
borrowing	facilities	totalling	£33.6m	at	31	December	2017	(2016:	£40.7m).	£4.6m	(2016:	£5.4m)	of	drawn	facilities,	including	finance

Fair values
The	fair	values	of	the	group’s	financial	assets	and	liabilities	are	not	materially	different	from	their	carrying	values.	The	following	
summarises	the	major	methods	and	assumptions	used	in	estimating	the	fair	values	of	financial	instruments:
Derivatives
The	fair	value	of	interest	rate	and	cross-currency	swaps	is	calculated	based	on	expected	future	principal	and	interest	cash	flows	
discounted	using	market	rates	prevailing	at	the	balance	sheet	date.	In	2017	and	in	2016,	the	valuation	methods	of	all	of	the	group’s	
derivative	financial	instruments	carried	at	fair	value	are	categorised	as	Level	2.	Level	2	is	defined	as	inputs,	other	than	quoted	prices	
(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability,	either	directly	(ie	as	prices)	
or indirectly (ie derived from prices).
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Fair	value	is	calculated	based	on	expected	future	principal	and	interest	cash	flows	discounted	using	market	rates	prevailing	at	the	
balance sheet date.
Contingent consideration
Fair value is calculated based on the amounts expected to be paid, determined by reference to forecasts of future performance of the 
acquired	businesses	discounted	using	market	rates	prevailing	at	the	balance	sheet	date	and	the	probability	of	contingent	events	and	
targets being achieved.
In 2017 and in 2016, the valuation methods of all of the group’s contingent consideration carried at fair value are categorised as Level 3. 
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
There	are	no	individually	significant	unobservable	inputs	used	in	the	fair	value	measurement	of	the	group’s	contingent	consideration	
as	at	31	December	2017.	£3.0m	was	based	on	performance	up	to	the	31	December	2017	and	will	be	settled	during	2018.	£3.9m	is	
dependent on performance in the last 2.5 years plus forecast performance to the period ended 30 June 2018. The remaining balance 
depends on the forecast outcome of one project.

The	fair	value	measurement	of	the	contingent	consideration	could	be	affected	if	the	forecast	financial	performance	is	different	to	that	
estimated. A better than estimated performance may increase the value of the contingent consideration payable.
Payables, receivables and construction assets
For	payables	and	receivables	with	a	remaining	life	of	one	year	or	less,	the	carrying	amount	is	deemed	to	reflect	the	fair	value.	All	other	
payables	and	receivables	are	discounted	using	market	rates	prevailing	at	the	balance	sheet	date.

Sensitivity analysis
At	31	December	2017,	it	is	estimated	that	a	general	increase	of	one	percentage	point	in	interest	rates	would	decrease	the	group’s	profit	
before taxation by approximately £2.0m. The estimated impact of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates is to increase the 
group’s	profit	before	taxation	by	approximately	£2.0m.	The	impact	of	interest	rate	swaps	has	been	included	in	this	calculation.
It is estimated that a general increase of 10 percentage points in the value of sterling against other principal foreign currencies 
would	have	decreased	the	group’s	profit	before	taxation	and	non-underlying	items	by	approximately	£10.6m	for	the	year	ended	
31	December	2017,	with	the	estimated	impact	of	a	10	percentage	points	decrease	in	the	value	of	sterling	being	an	increase	of	£12.9m	
in	the	group’s	profit	before	taxation	and	non-underlying	items.	This	sensitivity	relates	to	the	impact	of	retranslation	of	foreign	earnings	
only.	The	impact	on	the	group’s	earnings	of	currency	transaction	exchange	risk	is	not	significant.
These sensitivities assume all other factors remain constant.

The	average	share	price	during	the	year	was	887.5p.
Under	IFRS 2,	the	fair	value	of	services	received	in	return	for	share	options	granted	is	measured	by	reference	to	the	fair	value	of	share	
options granted. The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured based on a stochastic model. The contractual life 
of	the	option	is	used	as	an	input	into	this	model,	with	expectations	of	early	exercise	being	incorporated	into	the	model.
The	inputs	into	the	stochastic	model	are	as	follows:
2017 2016
Weighted average share price 879p 815p
Weighted average exercise price 0.0p 0.0p
Expected volatility 31.0% 31.0%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Risk-free	rate 0.13% 0.45%
Expected dividend yield 3.06% 3.1%
Expected	volatility	was	determined	by	calculating	the	historical	volatility	of	the	group’s	share	price	over	the	previous	three	years,	
adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The group recognised total expenses (included in operating costs) of £2.8m (2016: £1.0m) related to equity-settled, share-based 
payment transactions.
The	weighted	average	fair	value	of	options	granted	in	the	year	was	681.2p	(2016:	599.0p).
30 Retirement benefit liabilities
The group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
In	the	UK,	the	group	operates	the	Keller	Group	Pension	Scheme	(‘the	Scheme’),	a	defined	benefit	scheme,	which	has	been	closed	to	
new	members	since	1999	and	was	closed	to	all	future	benefit	accrual	with	effect	from	31	March	2006.	Under	the	Scheme,	employees	
are	normally	entitled	to	retirement	benefits	on	attainment	of	a	retirement	age	of	65.	The	Scheme	is	subject	to	UK	pensions	legislation	
which,	inter	alia,	provides	for	the	regulation	of	work-based	pension	schemes	by	the	Pensions	Regulator.	The	Trustees	are	aware	of	and	
adhere to the Codes of Practice issued by the Pensions Regulator. The Scheme Trustees currently comprise one member-nominated 
Trustee and one employer-nominated Trustee. The employer-nominated Trustee is also the Chair of the Trustees. The Scheme 
exposes	the	group	to	actuarial	risks,	such	as	longevity	risk,	interest	rate	risk	and	market	(investment)	risk,	which	are	managed	through	
the	investment	strategy	to	acceptable	levels.	The	Scheme	can	invest	in	a	wide	range	of	asset	classes	including	equities,	bonds,	cash,	
property, alternatives (including private equity, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure, currency, high yield debt and derivatives) 
and	annuity	policies.	Any	investment	in	derivative	instruments	is	only	made	to	contribute	to	a	reduction	in	the	overall	level	of	risk	in	the	
portfolio	or	for	the	purposes	of	efficient	portfolio	management.	With	effect	from	the	most	recent	actuarial	valuation	date	(5	April	2014),	
the	group	has	agreed	to	pay	annual	contributions	of	£1.6m	until	the	next	actuarial	review	in	2017 .	The	actuarial	valuation	as	at	5	April	2017 ,	
including	discussion	of	the	level	of	company	contributions	going	forward,	is	still	ongoing.
112 Keller Group plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued The	group	has	two	UK	defined	contribution	retirement	benefit	schemes.	There	were	no	contributions	outstanding	in	respect	of	these	
schemes	at	31	December	2017	(2016:	£nil).	The	total	UK	defined	contribution	pension	charge	for	the	year	was	£1.0m	(2016:	£0.9m).
The	group	also	has	defined	benefit	retirement	obligations	in	Germany	and	Austria.	Under	these	schemes,	employees	are	entitled	to	
retirement	benefits	on	attainment	of	a	retirement	age	of	65,	provided	they	have	15	years	of	employment	with	the	group.	The	amount	
of benefit	payable	depends	on	the	grade	of	employee	and	the	number	of	years	of	service,	up	to	a	maximum	of	40	years.	Benefits	
under	these	schemes	only	apply	to	employees	who	joined	the	group	prior	to	1991.	These	defined	benefit	retirement	obligations	are	
funded	on	the group’s	balance	sheet	and	obligations	are	met	as	and	when	required	by	the	group.	
The	group	operates	a	defined	contribution	scheme	for	employees	in	North	America,	where	the	group	is	required	to	match	employee	
contributions	up	to	a	certain	level	in	accordance	with	the	scheme	rules.	The	total	North	America	pension	charge	for	the	year	was	
£5.4m (2016: £5.0m).
In	Australia,	there	is	a	defined	contribution	scheme	where	the	group	is	required	to	ensure	that	a	prescribed	level	of	superannuation	
support of an employee’s notional base earnings is made. This prescribed level of support is currently 9.5% (2016: 9.5%). The total 
Australian	pension	charge	for	the	year	was	£4.1m	(2016:	£3.6m).

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
continued A	reduction	in	the	discount	rate	of	0.1%	would	increase	the	deficit	in	the	schemes	by	£1.2m,	whilst	a	reduction	in	the	inflation	
assumption	of	0.1%,	including	its	impact	on	the	revaluation	in	deferment	and	pension	increases	in	payment,	would	decrease	the	
deficit	by	£0.7m.	An	increase	in	the	mortality	rate	by	one	year	would	increase	the	deficit	in	the	schemes	by	£3.0m.
The	weighted	average	duration	of	the	defined	benefit	obligation	is	approximately	17	years	for	the	UK	scheme	and	12	years	for	the	
German and Austrian schemes.

meets	the	definition	of	a	qualifying	entity	under	FRS 100	(Financial	Reporting	Standard	100)	issued	by	the	Financial	Reporting	Council

Except	as	noted	below,	the	Company’s	accounting	policies	are	consistent	with	those	described	in	the	consolidated	financial	
statements	of Keller	Group	plc.	As	permitted	by	FRS 101,	the	Company	has	taken	advantage	of	the	disclosure	exemptions	available	
under	that	standard	in	relation	to	share-based	payments,	financial	instruments,	capital	management,	presentation	of	a	cash	flow	
statement, related party transactions and comparative information. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the 
consolidated	financial	statements.	In addition,	disclosures	in	relation	to	share	capital	(note	25)	and	dividends	(note	11)	have	not	been	
repeated	here	as	there	are	no	differences	to	those	provided	in	the	consolidated	financial	statements.

Amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings
The	Company	holds	inter-company	loans	with	subsidiary	undertakings	with	repayment	dates	being	a	mixture	of	repayable	on	demand

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Company financial statements 
continued The	group’s	results	as	reported	under	International	Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRS)	and	presented	in	the	financial	statements	
(the	‘statutory	results’)	are	significantly	impacted	by	movements	in	exchange	rates	relative	to	sterling,	as	well	as	by	exceptional	items	
and non-trading amounts relating to acquisitions. 
As a result, adjusted performance measures have been used throughout the Annual Report and Accounts to describe the group’s 
underlying performance. The Board and Executive Committee use these adjusted measures to assess the performance of the 
business	because	they	consider	them	more	representative	of	the	underlying	ongoing	trading	result	and	allow	more	meaningful	
comparison to prior year. 
Underlying measures
The	term	‘underlying’	excludes	the	impact	of	items	which	are	exceptional	by	their	size	or	are	non-trading	in	nature,	including	
amortisation of acquired intangible assets and other non-trading amounts relating to acquisitions (collectively ‘non-underlying 
items’),	net	of	any	associated	tax.	Underlying	measures	allow	management	and	investors	to	compare	performance	without	the	
potentially	distorting	effects	of	one-off	items	or	non-trading	items.	Non-underlying	items	are	disclosed	separately	in	the	financial	
statements	where	it	is	necessary	to	do	so	to	provide	further	understanding	of	the	financial	performance	of	the	group.	
Constant currency measures
The constant currency basis (‘constant currency’) adjusts the comparative to exclude the impact of movements in exchange rates relative 
to sterling. This is achieved by retranslating the 2016 results of overseas operations into sterling at the 2017 average exchange rates.
A	reconciliation	between	the	underlying	results	and	the	reported	statutory	results	is	shown	on	the	face	of	the	consolidated	income	
statement,	with	non-underlying	items	detailed	in	note	7.	A	reconciliation	between	the	2016	underlying	result	and	the	2016	constant	
currency	result	is	shown	below	and	compared	to	the	underlying	2017	performance:
