Wizz Air was founded in 2003 by its current Chief Executive Officer (CEO) József Váradi and five other

STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
I am delighted to report that Wizz Air’s 2017 financial year saw the Company achieve another year of market 
leading growth while continuing to deliver one of the highest profit margins of all European airlines.  Despite 
the challenging business conditions facing the European airline industry during the year, Wizz Air carried 23.8 
million passengers, an increase of 18.9 per cent. year-on-year.  The Company generated an underlying net 
profit of €225.3 million, an increase of 0.6 per cent. year-on-year, which translates to an underlying net profit 
margin of 14.3 per cent., a performance which few airlines in Europe can match.  
Capacity growth and a dedication to achieving the lowest possible operating costs are, and will remain, the 
key focus for Wizz Air. Together, they allow Wizz Air to continue to take advantage of the significant growth 
opportunity in Central and Eastern Europe and to strengthen our market leading position as Central and 
Eastern Europe’s largest low-cost carrier.  We believe that our unique position in Central and Eastern Europe, 
ultra-low-cost base, diversified point-to-point network and ability to adjust capacity quickly altogether place 
Wizz Air in an enviable position to meet industry challenges and continue to deliver significant growth and 
create long-term value for our Shareholders.   
Wizz Air’s business achieved a number of key milestones during the 2017 financial year, including: 
 continuing to grow and diversify our network by opening four new bases and announcing two future base 
openings, including our first in the United Kingdom, and launching 113 new routes. Wizz Air now offers 
more than 500 routes from 28 bases, connecting 141 destinations across 42 countries; 
 the delivery of a further twelve brand new A321ceo aircraft, increasing our fleet of Airbus A320-family 
aircraft to 79 and the average seat count per aircraft to 190 at the end of the financial year; and 
 driving load factors higher with an impressive 1.9 percentage point increase year-on-year to 90.1 per cent.   
Customers 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers for their continued support. As we expand 
our network we are delighted that many new customers throughout the region will be able to enjoy our 
services at incredibly low fares.  Enhancing the service we deliver to our customers is a constant focus for us. 
In the last twelve months we have undertaken a number of initiatives including the launch of our new 
wizzair.com website and the introduction of a simple three-step booking process for registered 
customers.  Now more than ever before, it’s faster and simpler to book the lowest fare flights with Wizz Air.  
Employees 
Our team of over 3,000 aviation professionals delivered a superior service to the 23.8 million customers who 
flew with us over the last twelve months. Our colleagues’ dedication, passion and enthusiasm for the airline 
and our customers makes the airline what it is today. I want to thank them once again for all their hard work – 
without them we would not have achieved our success to date nor will we realise the growth which we are 
targeting in the future.  
Board of Directors  
I would also like to thank the Board for its continued support and hard work in what has been another 
successful year for the Company.  During the year, we welcomed Ms Wioletta Rosołowska to the Board as a 
Non-Executive Director. Ms Rosołowska has had an accomplished career in Central and Eastern Europe 
specialising in the consumer and marketing sector and she brings valuable and relevant experience and 
consumer insights to the Board. I know that the Board is looking forward to working with the Company’s senior 
management team and all colleagues in what will be another year of exciting growth. 
Looking ahead  
As the 2018 financial year begins we remain very optimistic for the coming twelve months.  Growth will 
continue to be a top priority for us and, with an ever stronger balance sheet, a continued focus on driving 
operating costs lower, one of the youngest, most efficient fleets in Europe and an underpenetrated market in 
Central and Eastern Europe, we believe we can continue to deliver improving returns for our Shareholders.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
Financial performance 
The 2017 financial year delivered profitable growth, with passenger numbers increasing by 18.9 per cent. year-
on-year to 23.8 million. The trading environment experienced in FY 2017 of very low fares and increasing fuel 
prices unquestionably favoured our ultra-low-cost business model and we were able to increase our growth 
rate, strengthen our number one position in CEE and also maintain one of the highest profit margins of any 
European carrier.  Our market leading position, with the combination of one of the highest growth rates and 
profit margins of all European airlines, makes Wizz Air one of the most exciting airline businesses in Europe. 
Operating the most efficient aircraft with the latest technology has always been a key foundation stone of 
Wizz Air’s ultra-low cost base. Our fleet currently has an average age of just 4.4 years, one of the youngest in 
Europe.  We continue to build on that foundation with a delivery stream of brand new A321ceo aircraft which 
deliver double digit cost savings compared to A320ceo aircraft. At the end of FY 2017 we operated 16 A321ceo 
aircraft, representing a quarter of the airline's seat capacity, which gives us a clear cost advantage compared 
to most of our rivals.  
The resilience of our ultra-low cost business model, which we are convinced is the best model for stimulating 
air travel in CEE, combined with our growing diversified network and our ever stronger balance sheet places 
Wizz Air in a unique position to exploit the significant market opportunity that exists in a market of over 300 
million people.  
Our strong performance was driven by capacity expansion, higher load factors, higher passenger growth and 
continued improvements to our industry-leading ultra-low-cost base. In numbers, we delivered: 
 ticket revenues that increased by 2.3 per cent. to €915.5 million; 
 ancillary revenue that increased by 22.7 per cent. to €655.7 million; 
 total airline unit cost that decreased by 7.8 per cent. to €3.15 cents per Available Seat Kilometre (ASK); 
 a 19.7 per cent. increase in the capacity offered to the market (as measured by ASKs), as we extended and 
deepened our network of routes to and from Central and Eastern Europe; and 
 an increase in our average load factor by 1.9 percentage points to 90.1 per cent. in the financial year, 
despite significant capacity expansion. 
Strategic progress 
The Company is convinced that its strategy of building on its strong network, highly efficient model, 
compelling customer proposition, solid finances and sound risk management policies will enable it to deliver 
sustainable growth and returns for Shareholders. 
Wizz Air’s management team enforces rigorous cost control in all aspects of the Group’s business and has 
created a company-wide business culture that is keenly focused on driving costs lower. The Company believes 
that this cost advantage protects Wizz Air’s market position, enables it to offer some of the lowest ticket prices 
in its markets, stimulates demand in its markets and supports continued profitable growth.  
With its ultra-low-cost structure, innovative unbundled pricing strategy, leading market position among low-
cost carriers in CEE and track record of expansion in CEE and beyond, the Company believes that it is well 
positioned to continue to grow profitably. Wizz Air’s infrastructure, including personnel, processes, systems 
and relationships with suppliers of outsourced services, is scalable and sufficiently flexible to support Wizz 
Air’s growth plans.  
The Company believes that Wizz Air is a “pioneering” airline in the markets in which it operates by seeking to 
bring the low-cost carrier concept and Western European aviation standards into currently under-served new 
Eastern markets and is at the forefront of airline innovation in these new markets. Wizz Air has a strong track 
record of working with regulators to develop appropriate regulatory structures in non-EU countries. Wizz Air 
has been able to leverage the know-how, market understanding and cultural awareness of its senior 
management team and employees to build strong relationships with airport operators, suppliers, governments 
and regulators in new markets and is able to present itself as a reliable partner that, to date, has never exited 
from a country where it has established an operating base.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED 
Strengthened leadership in CEE 
Wizz Air continues to be the clear market leader in Central and Eastern Europe, maintaining our market share 
of over 39 per cent. of low-cost airline traffic. The expansion of our network with 113 new routes launched in 
FY 2017 has allowed us to strengthen our position, reaching new customers throughout the region. 
Today we operate in 19 of the 21 CEE countries, serving the market by offering a network of 28 bases and 141 
destinations in 42 countries. With a low propensity to travel and low-cost market penetration currently at 40.4 
per cent. (source data: Innovata, April 2016 – March 2017), there remains a significant opportunity for Wizz Air 
and we continue to believe that the ultra-low-cost business model is best placed to serve this market. 
Wherever we operate, Wizz Air brings safe, reliable operations, low fares, hassle-free services and a distinctive 
brand designed to appeal to the whole market. 
As a result, Wizz Air’s aggregate market share in CEE was 39.1 per cent. in the 2017 financial year and we are 
the number one or number two low-cost airline in all but one of our CEE base countries. The table below shows 
the Company’s ranking by low-cost market share in each of its CEE base countries.

Fleet development securing long-term growth

18 months we are already operating 16 of the type representing 24.5 per cent. of the Company’s total seat capacity.  
We are excited about the cost savings we are seeing from the A321ceo aircraft, and the continued roll-out of these 
aircraft across our network is expected to further improve our cost base and competitive edge.

purchase rights for a further 90 of the type. During the 2017 financial year the Company selected and contracted Pratt 
& Whitney’s new technology geared turbofan engines to power these aircraft. 
We anticipate that, based on the estimates of both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the A321neo will deliver significantly 
better fuel burn efficiency and even lower unit costs compared to the ceo version, making it the perfect aircraft to 
underpin the Company’s ambitious growth plans and replace older aircraft as they are returned to lessors.  Our first 
A321neo is scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and deliveries will continue until the end of 2024. The purchase 
agreement includes uncommitted purchase rights for 90 additional A321neo aircraft as well as certain conversion 
rights to receive the smaller A320neo, providing the flexibility needed to match aircraft deliveries with the 
Company’s capacity needs. 
Based on our current order book with Airbus, and lessor return schedule, our fleet will nearly double in size 
from the end of FY 2017 to the end of FY 2024. 
Improving the customer experience 
New routes and base operations 
We launched 113 new routes during the 2017 financial year, taking our route network to 486 routes from 28 
bases, connecting 141 destinations in 42 countries at the end of March 2017.    
Our markets are also reacting very well to the emergence of air travel within CEE with the Company launching 
13 new routes connecting CEE countries in FY 2017.  This trend is continuing into FY 2018 with the Company 
commencing operations on five previously unserved Western Balkan routes between Budapest and Kosovo, 
Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Albania.  In addition to connecting CEE countries we 
are also experiencing significant demand on the two domestic routes launched in Romania and Bulgaria.

Improving the customer experience continued 
Offering our customers more 
We know that our customers welcome the opportunity to fly at Wizz Air’s lowest prices yet experience the 
great on-board service provided by our dedicated crew. We also know that many of our customers also 
welcome the opportunity to tailor their travel experience to their requirements by adding additional services.  
We took a look at what our customers are buying and decided to make it easier and cheaper for them to buy 
some of the most popular additional services together, with the "WIZZ Go" bundle, which offers a discount 
over the “Basic Fare” and the prices of the included additional services when bought separately. 
Many of our customers are loyal Wizz Air fans who fly with us on multiple occasions each year.  Our Wizz 
Discount Club enables our most loyal customers and their friends and families to benefit from even lower fares 
than normal, throughout the year.  No wonder it’s popular: membership of the Wizz Discount Club reached 
1.05 million members by the end of the 2017 financial year, representing a 29 per cent. growth compared to 
the 2016 financial year. 
Our customers have always enjoyed the convenience of being able to book accommodation and car hire, 
along with other travel services, with our partners through wizzair.com. But, demonstrating our commitment 
always to give our customers more, for less, we launched our own inclusive package tour operator Wizz Tours, 
in 2015. The opportunity to book flights and accommodation at the same time, in a single package and at a 
discounted price, is proving increasingly popular – Wizz Tours’ revenues increased fourfold to €18.1 million in 
the 2017 financial year.  
None of this means that we’ve taken any less interest in ancillary revenue, though, which continues to be a 
very important part of the Company’s business model. For the financial year ended 31 March 2017, total 
ancillary revenues represented 41.8 per cent of overall airline revenue, up from 37.4 percent in the previous 
financial year. 
Technology advancements 
In FY 2017 Wizz Air launched the new wizzair.com website across all platforms through a mobile-first phased 
roll-out in May and August. The new responsive design caters for the needs of Wizz Air's young and mobile savvy 
audience, through a clean and fast one-page booking process. The introduction of our unique three-click express 
booking functionality enables an even faster booking experience. Throughout the year hundreds of major and 
minor digital optimizations contributed to a record high conversion rate on ticket and ancillary sales.  
With a website now available in 24 languages and 11 on the app, Wizz Air served over 200 million sessions to 
more than 50 million users. Wizz Air is the eighth most visited airline website in the world with one of the 
highest (56%) share of mobile visitors. Our mobile app user base more than doubled to 3.7 million users in FY 
2017. With 1.8 million followers on Facebook, Wizz Air has by far most fans per available seat among its peers 
in Europe. New digital initiatives in the next financial year will further strengthen the engagement with our ever 
more connected customers. 
Balanced hedging approach  
Wizz Air operates under a clear set of treasury policies approved by the Board and supervised by the 
Audit Committee. The aim of our hedging policy is to reduce short-term volatility in earnings and liquidity. 
Therefore Wizz Air hedges a minimum of 50 per cent of the projected US Dollar and jet fuel requirements 
for the next twelve months (40 per cent on an 18-month hedge horizon). Recently, the Company started 
to hedge it largest non-EUR revenue currency, GBP against EUR in order to smooth out potential future 
volatility due to Brexit.  Unlike for the US Dollar, there is no minimum coverage set, while the maximum is 
60% of projected net GBP exposure on rolling twelve-month basis. 
Details of the current hedging positions (as at 15 May 2017) are set out below:

Sensitivities 
 Pre-hedging, a one cent movement in the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate impacts the 2018 financial year 
operating expenses by €6.9 million. 
 Pre-hedging, a one penny movement in the Euro/British Pound exchange rate impacts the 2018 financial 
year operating expenses by €2.3 million. 
 Pre-hedging, a $10 (per metric ton) movement in the price of jet fuel impacts the 2018 financial year fuel 
costs by $8.3 million. 
In the Company’s view, the profit impact of such changes is likely to be less given the empirical evidence 
of major industry-wide movements in input costs being passed through to air fares with a lag of twelve 
to eighteen months.  
Management changes 
There were a number of management changes throughout the year. 
John Stephenson, the Group’s Executive Vice President and Gyorgy Abran, Chief Commercial Officer stepped 
down from their positions in August 2016. I would like to take this opportunity to thank John and Gyorgy for 
their significant contribution they have made to the Company over the last 10-12 years, respectively. They 
played a central role in building Wizz Air into the leading low cost carrier in CEE and one of the strongest 
airlines in Europe. We wish them all the best in the future.  
As announced earlier in the year Sonia Jerez Burdeus stepped down from her position of Chief Financial Officer 
in order to relocate back to Spain. I would like to thank her once again for her contribution during the time 
that she was with us. We are making good progress in recruiting her replacement and will make a further 
announcement in due course. 
During the 2017 financial year George Michalopoulos, Chief Commercial Officer and Jozsef Ujhelyi, Chief Flight 
Operations Officer, were promoted to their current roles and Diederik Pen was promoted to become Executive 
Vice President & Chief Operations Officer, reflecting the importance of the Operations function to the success 
of Wizz Air. I would like to congratulate each of them on their appointments and wish them well as their careers 
continue to develop at Wizz Air. Between them, Diederik, George and Jozsef have collectively been with Wizz 
Air for over 25 years, which demonstrates the continuity and depth of experience within the Wizz Air 
management team, something which the Company is fortunate to be able to call upon as it continues its fast 
growth in the coming years.

Outlook 
2018 financial year 
In FY2018 growth continues as a top priority with increase in capacity by around 23% targeting to carry nearly 
30 million passengers. The Company recorded a strong start to FY2018 due to the timing of Easter, and 
although still at an early stage of the financial year, currently the Group net profit is expected to be in a range 
between €250 million and €270 million in FY2018.  This guidance is heavily caveated by the revenue 
performance for the all-important summer period as well as the second half of FY2018, a period for which the 
Company currently have limited visibility.

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air carried 23.8 million passengers, an 18.9 per cent. increase compared to 
the previous year. Revenue grew to €1,571.2 million, representing a 9.9 per cent. increase compared to the 
previous year. Wizz Air recorded a balanced capacity growth measured in terms of available seat kilometres 
(ASK) of 19.7 per cent. and seats of 16.4 per cent. 
As indicated throughout the 2017 financial year, most airlines, including Wizz Air, added capacity in response to 
lower fuel prices. During the 2017 financial year Wizz Air collected ca. 20% of its revenues in British Pounds, which 
leading up to the UK referendum to leave the European Union and right after the actual vote has devalued 
significantly against the Euro. In addition the peculiarity of the 2017 financial year was that both Easter holidays of 
2016 and 2017 calendar years fell outside of the 2017 financial year, resulting in related additional revenues 
materializing in the 2016 and 2018 financial years. The combined effect of the above mentioned events resulted in 
revenue per ASK decreasing by 8.5 per cent. in 2017 compared to the previous financial year.  
Despite the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (“Brexit”), there are no signs of demand weakness on 
routes to/from the UK. The negative translation effect on British pound revenues due to Brexit in the 2017 
financial year is estimated at €17 million, which was partially offset by the positive translation effect on British 
pound costs. The Company continues to examine the terms on which Brexit might materialize, the potential 
implications of these to Wizz Air’s business, and take actions that are considered necessary. 
Unit costs further improved as lower fuel prices complemented by a healthy fuel hedging position resulted in 
fuel unit cost (per ASK) declining 21.9 per cent. This, combined with another strong performance on non-fuel 
cost, which declined 0.6 per cent., delivered a total unit cost decline of 7.8 per cent. 
The profit for the year was €246.0 million and included a €20.7 million net gain from unrealised FX gains and 
exceptional items.  These comprised unrealised foreign exchange gains of €1.9 million and a gain from the change 
in the time value of hedge positions of €14.3 million, and a €4.5 million net gain on fuel caps sold before expiry. 
The income tax expense for the year was €9.8 million (2016: €8.5 million) giving an effective tax rate for the 
Group of 3.8 per cent. (2016: 4.2 per cent.). The main components of this charge are local business tax and 
innovation tax paid in Hungary, and corporate income tax paid in Switzerland. 
Underlying profit after tax increased by 0.6 per cent. to €225.3 million in 2017 from €223.9 million in 2016. 
 2017 2016 Change 
Average jet fuel price ($/metric ton, including into plane

for the year.

 Starting from the 2017 financial year the Company introduced separate reporting for its airline and tour operator business units. Where a measure is 
reported for a business unit as opposed to the Group as a whole then this fact is explicitly stated. All other measures and statements relate to the Group 
as a whole. See also Note 5 to the financial statements.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Return on capital employed and capital structure 
ROCE** is a non-statutory performance measure commonly used to measure the financial returns that a 
business achieves on the capital it uses. ROCE for the 2017  financial year was 17.6 per cent., a decrease of 4.8 
percentage points compared to the previous year driven by varying level of growth in earnings before interest 
and tax (EBIT), shareholder’s equity, net cash position, and capitalised leases.   
The Company’s leverage, defined as net debt adjusted to include capitalised operating lease obligations* 
divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and aircraft rentals (EBITDAR), fell to a 
ratio of 1.7 from 1.4 at the end of the 2017 financial year. 
The year-on-year comparisons of ROCE and leverage were negatively impacted by the translation effect of 
the stronger US Dollar compared to last year as capitalised US dollar aircraft leases are translated into a higher 
Euro value. 
Liquidity, defined as cash and equivalents as a percentage of the last twelve months’ revenue, rose from 
45.2 per cent. at the end of the 2016 financial year to 49.3 per cent. a year later.

* Annual aircraft lease expenses multiplied by seven as an estimate of the total outstanding obligation. 
** ROCE: underlying operating profit after tax/average capital employed, where average capital employed is the sum of average 
equity (excluding convertible debt) and capitalised operating lease obligations, less average free cash. 
Financial performance 
Starting from 2017, revenues and operating expenses are analysed by business segment, compared to the 
same measures for the 2016 financial year. In the 2016 Annual Report these analyses were done for the Group 
as a whole. Therefore revenues, certain expenses, and certain KPIs for 2016 (for the Airline) are different in this 
report from the corresponding numbers presented in the 2016 report (for the Group). The remaining measures 
(financial income and expenses, taxation, other comprehensive income and expense) are continued to be 
analysed for the Group, as the share of the tour operator business unit is immaterial or nil in these measures.

Total revenue  1,562.0 100% 1,427.4 100% 9.4% 
The decline in RASK by 8.5 per cent. was the main driver for passenger ticket revenue increasing by only 1.8 per 
cent. to €909.3 million, while ancillary (or “non-ticket”) revenue increased by 22.3 per cent. to €652.7 million.  
Average revenue per passenger decreased from €71.4 in 2016 to €65.7 in 2017, a decrease of 8.0 per cent 
which helped stimulate more passenger volumes.  Average passenger ticket revenue per passenger declined 
from €44.7 in 2016 to €38.3 (-14.4 per cent.), while average ancillary revenue per passenger increased from 
€26.7 in 2016 to €27.5 in 2017, an increase of €0.8 per passenger or 2.8 per cent. This slight decrease in average 
revenue per passenger was due to: 
 a decrease in average passenger ticket revenue per passenger in 2017 compared to 2016, which was the 
result of lower input prices feeding into lower fares even though load factors increased by 1.9 percentage 
points to 90.1%; and 
 the combined impact of the modification of certain products, the introduction of new services (‘Go Fare’), 
and the adaptation of customers to some of the longer standing products such as allocated seating and 
different checked-in luggage sizes. 
Airline operating expenses 
Total airline operating expenses increased by 10.3 per cent. to €1,314.5 million in 2017 from €1,191.2 million in 
2016. Airline CASK declined by 7.8 per cent. to 3.15 Euro cents in 2017 from 3.42 Euro cents in 2016. This 
reduction in CASK was principally driven by a reduction in the average fuel price and continued improvement 
of the airport mix. CASK excluding fuel expenses decreased to 2.25 Euro cents in 2017 from 2.27 Euro cents in 
2016 driven by the combined effect of further improvement of major cost items (maintenance, airport, 
handling and en-route charges) set off by increasing aircraft rentals.

Staff costs increased by 10.3 per cent. to €112.6 million in 2017, up from €102.1 million in 2016. The increase in 
overall staff costs reflected a 15.7 per cent. rise in aircraft block hours and reduced bonus payments made 
compared to the previous year as certain profitability targets were not reached.  
Fuel expenses decreased by 6.6 per cent. to €375.2 million in 2017, down from €401.5 million in 2016. Although 
there was an increase of 19.7 per cent. growth in ASKs, and an 8.0 per cent. appreciation of the US Dollar 
against the Euro after hedging (moving from an average 1.20 rate in 2016 to 1.10 in 2017), it has been offset by 
a 1.6 per cent. reduction in fuel consumption per block hour and a 25.2 per cent. decline in the average fuel 
price (after hedging). The average fuel price (including hedging impact and into-plane premium) paid by Wizz 
Air in 2017 was US$553 per ton, a decline of 25.2 per cent. from the previous year’s figure of US$740 per ton.  
Distribution and marketing costs rose 16.0 per cent. to €27.0 million in 2017 from €23.3 million in 2016. This 
increase is modestly lower than the passenger growth of 18.9 per cent. during the same period. 
Maintenance, materials and repair costs decreased by 3.6 per cent. to €74.7 million in 2017 from €77.5 million 
in 2016. This cost decrease was the combined result of several renegotiated maintenance contracts with third 
party providers and the timing of certain maintenance events. 
Aircraft rental costs increased 32.8 per cent. to €233.9 million in 2017, from €176.2 million in 2016. This increase 
was largely due to fleet growth (equivalent aircraft expanded by 15.3 per cent.), an increasing average lease 
rate due to the A321 aircraft joining the fleet and the appreciation of the US Dollar to the Euro which was 8.0 
per cent. stronger than the previous year (after hedging impact). 
Airport, handling and en-route charges increased by 13.7 per cent. to €390.0 million in 2017 from €343.1 million 
in 2016. This category comprised €224.2 million of airport and handling fees and €165.8 million of en-route and 
navigation charges in 2017 and €193.9 million of airport and handling fees and €149.3 million of en-route and 
navigation charges in 2016. The cost increase was primarily due to a 12.9 per cent. increase in the number of 
flights, and an 18.9 per cent. rise in passenger numbers. 
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by 99.9 per cent. to €57.5 million in 2017, up from €28.8 
million in 2016 as the airline is preparing to return older leased aircraft back to lessors and engine maintenance 
programs are required. See Note 13 to the financial statements for more details. 
Other expenses increased by 12.3 per cent. to €43.6 million in 2017 from €38.8 million in 2016.  Other expenses 
include cancellation and delay related costs of €12.2 million, an increase of 92.5 per cent year-on-year. The 
European airline industry is experiencing a significant increase in customer compensation costs – to levels that 
the Company believes is disproportionate to the Company’s very low fares, especially as the Company only 
cancelled 214 flights out of a total of 141,698 flights in the financial year.  With the exception of cancellation 
and delay related costs the Company delivered a strong cost performance on all other areas in this line item. 
Airline operating profit 
As a result of the foregoing factors, the Airline made an operating profit in respect of its airlines operations of 
€247.4 million in 2017, a 4.8 per cent. increase from the operating profit of €236.1 million made in 2016.  
Wizz Tours 
Wizz Tours generates revenue by selling package holidays made up of flight tickets purchased from the airline 
and hotel accommodation purchased from wholesalers (bedbanks). Revenue grew by 364.1 per cent. in the 
2017 financial year to €18.1 million from €3.9 million in 2016 financial year. Operating costs in the same period 
increased from €4.5 million to €18.9 million.

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Financial performance continued 
Net financing income and expense 
The Group’s net financing income resulted in a net gain of €9.1 million in 2017 after an expense of €34.1 million 
in 2016. This significant change was driven primarily by the change in the time value of hedges, with the net 
impact of all other items being limited, as shown in the table below: 
€ million  2017 2016 Change 
Net FX-related impacts (including exceptional item in 2016) 2.6 (3.1) 5.7 
Change in time value of hedges (exceptional) 14.3 (25.0) 39.3 
Fuel cap impacts (including exceptional item in 2017) (4.5) (5.3) (0.9) 
All other financial income and expenses, net (recurring) (3.3) (0.7) (2.7) 
Net financing income and expense* 9.1 (34.1) 43.2 
* See also Notes 9 and 10 to the financial statements. 
Changes in the time value of hedges, as accounted for under IAS 39, resulted in significant gains and losses in 
the two years, respectively. Such changes will stop impacting earnings from the 2018 financial year as the 
Group adopted IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017.   
Fuel caps impacted the two years similarly, after taking into account for 2017 the one-off impacts of the closure 
of caps in September 2016.  By that date all caps expired or were sold, so there will be no further impacts from 
these instruments in future years. 
The remaining recurring items had relatively limited impacts. The €2.7 million higher net financial income and 
expenses in 2017 was caused by (i) the lower interest yield environment; (ii) some gains in 2016 coming from 
ineffective fuel hedges; and (iii) the net impact of discounting long-term financial assets. 
Taxation 
The Group recorded an income tax expense of €9.8 million in 2017, slightly higher than the €8.5 million in 
2016. The effective tax rate for the Group was 3.8 per cent. in 2017 and 4.2 per cent. in 2016. The reduction in 
the effective tax rate reflects the impact of Hungarian local taxes, the tax base of which is different from the 
corporate tax base – particularly given that financial income and expenses are not in the scope of these taxes. 
Profit for the year 
As a result of the foregoing factors, the Group generated an IFRS profit for 2017 of €246.0 million, a 27.5 
per cent. increase from the profit of €192.9 million in 2016. 
Other comprehensive income and expense 
In 2017 the Group had other comprehensive income of €15.5 million compared to €33.2 million in 2016. This 
change was driven by the movements in the balance of the cash flow hedging reserve (in equity) in the two 
years. This situation arises when, based on the spot prices at year end there is an overall more favourable 
position on the Group’s open hedge instruments than a year before.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Cash flows and financial position continued 
Cash flow from operating activities 
The vast majority of Wizz Air’s cash inflows from operating activities are derived from passenger ticket sales. 
Net cash flows from operating activities are also materially affected by movements in working capital items. 
Operating cash flows improved from €288.9 million in 2016 to €310.9 million in 2017 primarily due to the 
following factors:  
 Profit before tax and depreciation: Profit before tax in 2017 was €54.4 million higher than in 2016. However, 
this increase in the profits was almost exclusively due to the impacts from financial income and expense 
items that are non-cash. (It is for similar reasons that on an ‘underlying’ basis there was only a small 
increase in profits from 2016 to 2017, as shown earlier.) On the other hand, depreciation and amortisation 
expenses were €28.8 million higher in 2017 – this almost alone explains the €29.0 million increase in 
operating cash flows before adjusting for changes in working capital. 
 Changes in working capital:  The movements in working capital items helped the 2016 operating cash 
flows by €20.7 million, while the same impact was only €14.1 million for 2017. This is a relatively small 
difference between the two years when compared to the absolute size of the respective asset and liability 
balances. There are two differences between the two years that are worth noting as contributors: (i) the 
restricted cash balance increased by €20.8 million more during 2017 than in 2016; and (ii) the trade and 
other payables balance increased by €25.2 million less during 2017 than in 2016 (primarily because the 
increase in 2016 was particularly high). 
Cash flow from investing activities 
Net cash used in investing activities increased by €89.1 million from a net cash outflow of €90.6 million in 
2016 to a net cash outflow of €179.7 million in 2017. There are three contributors to the higher 
investments in 2017: 
 Aircraft maintenance assets: There was €35.0 million more invested into aircraft maintenance assets in 
2017 than in 2016, caused primarily by the increase in the number of engine LLP replacements performed 
in the year (there was one such event in 2016 and nine in 2017). 
 Purchases of tangible assets:  The Group invested €25.7 million more into tangible assets in 2017 than in 
2016 due primarily to more spare engines being purchased. 
 Advances paid for aircraft (pre delivery payments, ‘PDP’):  The net PDP flows (payments paid to Airbus 
less refunds received) required €28.3 million more cash investment in 2017 than in 2016. 
Cash flow from financing activities 
Net cash used in financing activities were immaterial and increased by only €0.1 million to a €1.8 million outflow 
in 2017 from a €1.7 million outflow in 2016.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED 
Summary statement of balance sheet continued 
Property, plant and equipment increased by €152.1 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 (see Note 
13 to the financial statements). This was driven by investments in all the important fixed asset categories, as follows: 
(i) the gross book value of aircraft maintenance assets (including advances paid for these assets) increased by 
€87.7 million, mainly due to more engines being out of condition under the respective lease contract  at the end of 
2017 than a year before; (ii) PDPs increased by €64.0 million due to the growing number of aircraft deliveries and 
their respective payments as well as the relatively higher PDP of the A321ceo compared to the A320ceo; and (iii) 
investment into aircraft parts in the amount of €37.3 million, with most of this related to the delivery of several spare 
engines during the year. 
Restricted cash (current and non-current) increased by €54.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 
31 March 2016. This was driven by the growth in the amount of lease-related letters of credit, particularly as 
security in relation to future maintenance obligations.  
Derivative financial instruments (current and non-current) increased by €8.4 million as at 31 March 2017 
compared to 31 March 2016 (see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements). The receivable from open hedge 
instruments at the end of 2016 was close to nil (rather there were payable positions, see below), but at the end 
of 2017 there were few million Euro receivables both on the open foreign exchange and fuel hedges. . 
Trade and other receivables (current and non-current) increased by €11.0 million as at 31 March 2017 compared 
to 31 March 2016 (see Note 18 to the financial statements). 
Cash and cash equivalents increased by €128.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016. This 
change is explained in detail in the cash flow analysis above. 
Trade and other payables increased by €20.4 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016. This rate 
of increase is broadly consistent with rate of increase for the Group’s business during the year. 
Deferred income (current and non-current) increased by €67.2 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 
31 March 2016 (see Note 26 to the financial statements). This was driven primarily by the increase in unflown 
revenues (€52.3 million), itself primarily due to the increase in offered seat capacity, and to a smaller extent 
by the concessions received from aircraft and component manufacturers during the year. 
Derivative financial liabilities (current and non-current) decreased by €15.8 million as at 31 March 2017 
compared to 31 March 2016 (see Notes 3 and 20 to the financial statements). At the end of 2016 the Group 
had primarily payable positions (and only very small receivables) in relation to its open foreign exchange and 
fuel hedge instruments, but this situation reversed by the end of 2017 (having primarily receivables on both 
foreign exchange and fuel, with only very small fuel-related payables). 
Provisions (current and non-current) increased by €28.8 million as at 31 March 2017 compared to 31 March 2016 
(see Note 29 to the financial statements). The increase relates primarily to new provisions made for future 
heavy maintenance events, particularly engine LLP replacements.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES 
Wizz Air operates in a dynamic, fast-paced and competitive industry. The Company’s success to date reflects 
not only its ability to identify and capitalise upon opportunities, but also its ability to react and deal effectively 
with risks and challenges.  The aviation industry is one where reputations and businesses can be lost quickly if 
a risk is not anticipated and dealt with effectively and the Company is committed to ensuring that it employs 
best practice in order to identify and mitigate risks as best it can. 
This section of the annual report sets out our risk management process, as well as a short description of some of 
the key risks that could, if not properly dealt with, affect Wizz Air’s future success, although it does not by any 
means list all risks that might possibly affect our business. Risk management is itself a dynamic and developing 
area and the Company understands that what was appropriate and adequate in the past may not continue to be 
so as the Company continues to grow. The Directors will therefore continue to review risk management on an 
ongoing basis to ensure that the processes used in the Company remain appropriate and adequate. 
Our risk management process 
The Board oversees the Company’s risk process and has delegated authority for this to the Audit Committee. 
The Company’s Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Each year, a 
risk universe exercise is undertaken by the Head of Internal Audit with the Company’s senior and operational 
management. The results of this exercise are used to produce an Internal Audit plan for the coming year. The 
Internal Audit plan generally always covers internal control risks as well as some other enterprise risks. 
Senior management reports to the Board at each of the scheduled Board meetings and the Board also 
received a report from the Chairman of the Audit Committee at each of the scheduled Board meetings. These 
reports include detailed assessment of, for example, commercial and operational risks which may have arisen 
or been dealt with during the reporting period. In addition, the Board is kept updated by senior management 
as and when specific risk issues arise between Board meetings.  
To date, the Company’s small administrative headcount has ensured that consideration of risk has enjoyed 
close oversight in relation to day-to-day matters by the Company’s senior management. The Board, however, 
recognised that as the Company continues to grow quickly, a more structured process of risk management 
was required. 
Some areas of the Company’s business have always had sophisticated risk analysis and mitigation processes 
in place. For example, the Company’s flight operations are subject to a world-class risk assessment and 
mitigation programme and the Company’s exposure to foreign exchange and fuel price changes is mitigated 
through a Board-approved hedging programme administered by the Audit Committee. Risks and internal 
controls relating to financial reporting were subject to a detailed and comprehensive analysis as part of the 
Company’s preparations for its initial public offering in March 2015.  For other areas, however, a comprehensive 
enterprise risk management (ERM) process appropriate for the Company’s business was developed and 
implemented by management during the course of the 2017 financial year, working with Ernst & Young and 
overseen by the Audit Committee.  
Following the completion and implementation of the ERM process, the Company has a more robust process in 
place to review and monitor both existing and new risks that may arise. In order to ensure that the principles and 
methodology underpinning the ERM process and the ERM manual enjoyed a common understanding throughout 
the Company, a comprehensive and practical training programme was rolled out across the Company from 
senior management down, with the actual training being tailored to each colleague’s position in the risk 
management process. A formal internal Risk Council was established, involving the Company’s senior 
management team and a number of other senior employees on a regular basis, to consider and update the risks 
identified in the risk universe. The new ERM methodology was then used to assess these various risks with the 
relevant risk owners on either a quantitative or qualitative basis, as appropriate. The outcome of the ERM 
methodology employed for each risk leads to a decision as to whether to transfer, avoid, reduce or accept the 
particular risk. The resulting principal risk report was then reviewed with the Audit Committee and presented to 
the Board. The principal risk report will be comprehensively reviewed by the Risk Council at least every quarter 
and will form the basis of regular, specific risk reports to the Audit Committee, with any changes to the principal 
risk report and emerging risks being highlighted. These key risks, many of which were already the subject of 
regular reporting and discussion between senior management and the Board, are detailed below. In addition, and 
as part of the Company’s regular mid-term planning process, management has, where appropriately measurable, 
provided financial models of the possible effects of some of these key risks to the Board. The Board is therefore 
satisfied that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
Our risk management process continued 
The Board also reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Company. 
The following action points were defined and implemented: (i) a more formal communication and reporting line 
between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Head of Internal Audit was set-up; and (ii) in order to 
give more time for the proper review of the outcome of internal audits and to follow-up on any issues raised, 
additional meetings of the Committee are being held during the year focusing on internal audit matters.  
The new ERM system enhances and develops the Company’s risk management activities and internal control 
processes and puts them in a framework appropriate not only for the coming year but the coming decade.  
Risks relating to the Group 
Introduction 
The key risks identified by the Risk Committee fall into six broad groupings: 
 information technology and cyber risk, including website availability, protection of our own and our 
customers’ data and ensuring the availability of operations-critical systems; 
 external factors, such as the default of a partner financial institution, fuel cost, foreign exchange rates, 
competition and geopolitical risk; 
 product development, making sure that we are making the best use of our capacity and ensuring that we 
have access to the right airport infrastructure at the right price so that we can keep on delivering the 
superior Wizz Air service at low fares across an ever wider network; 
 fleet development, to ensure the Company has the right number of aircraft available at the right time to 
take advantage of commercial opportunities and grow in a disciplined way; 
 regulatory risk, ensuring that we remain compliant with regulations affecting our business and operations; 
 operations, including safety events and terrorist incidents; and 
 human resources, ensuring we are able to recruit the right number of colleagues of the right quality to 
continue to grow or, once recruited, that they remain sufficiently engaged and motivated and ensuring 
that the Company has appropriate succession management for key colleagues in place. 
Information technology and cyber risk 
Wizz Air is, primarily, an e-business. During the 2017 financial year, 95 per cent. of bookings were made 
through our website and mobile applications. We are therefore dependent on our information technology 
systems to receive, process and manage ticket reservations, process credit and debit card payments, check in 
passengers, manage our traffic network, perform flight operations and engage in other critical business tasks. 
Our website is our shop window and therefore it is critical that it is secure and reliable. We outsource the 
hosting and operation of these systems to a number of IT suppliers. However, we retain an experienced internal 
team to oversee the operation of these systems and include suitable contractual recovery and other key 
performance standards with each of our key IT suppliers. We have also increased the number of card acquirers 
and payment service providers that we use, with each provider being an effective back-up for the others. We 
will continue to review our business-critical systems to ensure that the appropriate level of back-up is in place. 
The Company has employed business continuity processes since its beginning and our existing processes and 
procedures ensure that key staff can be relocated to an alternative location should our normal offices become 
unusable. As a project for the 2018 financial year, these business continuity processes will be comprehensively 
reviewed and, where necessary, updated to ensure that they remain appropriate and sufficient for the 
Company’s continued growth. 
Cyber risk is a hugely important consideration for a business such as ours and is one of the areas on which 
specific work has been done with the Board over the last year. Our systems could be attacked in a number of 
ways and with varying outcomes – for example, unavailability of our website or operations-critical systems or 
theft of our customers’ data. Quite apart from immediate commercial loss, any loss of customer data is likely 
to result in considerable loss of confidence of our customers. Cyber security is a constantly evolving challenge 
and one of the key issues related to cyber security is our colleagues’ awareness of the risk and of the possible 
ways in which our business could be attacked and, therefore, a comprehensive and compulsory e-learning 
training course for all colleagues has been implemented.  Our in-house IT security department will continue to 
review emerging threats and the Board will be kept up to date on the actions being taken by the Company to 
safeguard its systems.  More generally, protection of both our own and our customers’ data remains a key 
issue.  The Company is preparing itself for the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in 
May 2018 through a cross-functional working group which will review the Company’s existing, comprehensive 
data protection processes and policies. The Board will be kept updated on the Company’s preparations for 
this step change in the Company’s data protection obligations.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
Risks relating to the Group continued 
External risks 
We are a truly international business and, while we report in Euros, we transact in 20 currencies. We also 
have to make a large number of payments in US Dollars. Appreciation of the US Dollar against the Euro may 
impact results and margins. Therefore, to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations in respect of costs 
incurred in US Dollars, we engage in Euro/US Dollar hedging in accordance with a Board-approved hedging 
policy. In addition and recognising the importance of the Pound Sterling as accounting for around 20 per cent. 
of the Company’s total revenues, the Company’s Board-approved hedging policy was amended during the 
course of the 2017 financial year to allow for the possibility of hedging Pound Sterling against the Euro. In all 
cases, hedging transactions are subject to the approval of the Audit Committee.  
Fuel accounted for 28.3 per cent. of our total Group operating cost in the 2017 financial year. A rise in fuel 
prices could significantly affect our operating costs. We therefore hedge our aviation fuel cost in accordance 
with a Board-approved hedging policy. The Audit Committee is involved in and approves each hedging 
decision.  
In the past few years, Wizz Air has seen its cash reserves increase considerably. We believe that a strong cash 
position is a vital foundation for the Company’s continued, aggressive growth and ability to deal with and/or 
take advantage of competitive situations when they arise. However, the security of our cash and the financial 
strength of our hedging counterparties is something that we actively manage. In particular, all of the 
Company’s cash is invested in accordance with a Board-approved counterparty risk policy which assigns 
certain investment limits for each counterparty based upon its credit rating. 
Competition is one of the key risks to our business. The airline industry in Europe is fiercely competitive. We 
have yet to see consolidation on the scale experienced in, for example, the United States and so there are a 
large number of airlines, including ultra-low-cost and low-cost carriers, traditional airlines and charter airlines, 
competing throughout our network. Our competitors may seek to protect or gain market share in markets in 
which we operate, perhaps by offering discounted fares or more attractive schedules. We believe that 
competition is good for the industry – both for consumers, who benefit from lower prices, as well as airlines 
themselves as they must embrace cost discipline – but we must react to a competitive threat. Ultimately, our 
key competitive strength is our commitment to driving our cost ever lower while delivering a superior 
customer service. We firmly believe that, in a tough market, lowest cost ultimately wins and the necessary cost 
discipline is something to which we are committed, day in, day out. Competition can, however, adversely affect 
revenues and so we constantly monitor our competitors’ actions and the performance of our route network 
to ensure that we take both reactive and proactive actions in a timely manner, as required. 
We are exposed to political and economic events and trends in CEE and elsewhere. Our business extends 
beyond the borders of the EU and into countries such as Russia, Turkey and Ukraine and regions including 
the Caucasus, North Africa and the Middle East. These and other countries in the region have experienced, 
and may still be subject to, potential political and economic instability caused by changes in governments, 
political deadlock in the legislative process, contested election results, tension and conflict between federal 
and regional authorities, corruption among governmental officials, social and ethnic unrest and currency 
instability. We maintain close relationships with local authorities and, as an organisation, we are able to react 
quickly to adverse events. 
Like all European airlines, we have prospered in a liberalised regulatory environment which makes the free 
movement of people throughout the European Union a reality. Any event which adversely affects either the 
liberalised operating environment or the free movement of people has the potential to affect our business. As 
with all airlines in Europe, the outcome of the Brexit vote has created significant uncertainty for our business. 
While demand on our routes to and from the United Kingdom has not weakened, the weakness of the Pound 
Sterling following the Brexit vote has adversely affected the Euro value of the revenue. However, the most 
critical issue facing the Company and all European airlines is the lack of clarity on how the Brexit negotiations 
will affect access to the liberalised market between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union. 
Wizz Air firmly believes that the liberalised air market has significant benefits for both the United Kingdom 
and the European Union and urges all parties to settle as a matter of priority on the continuation of access to 
the liberalised market. However, whatever the outcome and while we continue to have a strong United 
Kingdom business, we have always believed that diversification of our network and our customers is a key 
part of a sustainable business. That remains the case and we are confident that there remains a large 
addressable market in CEE which will continue to provide opportunities for profitable growth should our UK 
business be adversely affected.

STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
Risks relating to the Group continued 
Product development 
We do not just compete for customers, we compete for access to infrastructure too. Wizz Air enjoys high 
growth – but as we grow, we need more terminal space, slots and aircraft parking to be able to operate our 
flights. Certain airports to which we operate may already be or become congested, meaning we may not be 
able to secure access to those airports at our preferred times and, therefore, when we have slots we need to 
make sure that we retain them. We mitigate this risk by operating primarily from secondary airports which 
have significant spare capacity and, where we do fly to congested airports, our flights often constitute in-
bound traffic for such airports and take up off-peak capacity. However, we ensure that we maintain close 
working relationships with relevant airport authorities and slot co-ordinators and we are continually improving 
our system to ensure that slot requests and submissions are made in a timely way – and used in a way that 
delivers the maximum benefit for the Company. 
Fleet development 
Our planned growth means we need planned aircraft deliveries. Wizz Air has big plans – we will continue to 
grow and we will continue to be ready to respond to competitive challenges. However, in order to do so, we 
need capacity and that means that we need an appropriate supply contract for new aircraft which 
manufacturers are able to deliver. And the emphasis here is on new aircraft – we currently operate one of the 
youngest fleets in Europe, with an average age of 4.4 years, and that means we have a more efficient fleet 
which is more reliable and therefore able to be utilised for over twelve hours a day. For the business, that 
means lower unit operating costs, and for our customers, lower prices. Our existing order book with Airbus as 
at 31 March 2017 comprised a further 23 Airbus A320ceo-family aircraft, split into eight A320ceo and 15 
A321ceo deliveries, all of which will be delivered before the end of 2018. From 2019 onwards, we will start to 
take delivery of the A321neo aircraft ordered at the Paris Air Show in June 2015. We have selected Pratt & 
Whitney’s geared turbofan engine to power our A321neo deliveries. However, there have been a number of 
operational issues connected with the introduction of the geared turbofan engine. This is always a risk with 
groundbreaking new technology but the advantage is that, once solved, the new technology offers a step 
change in efficiency and the prospect of development and optimisation in the years ahead.  While we remain 
confident in our selection of the geared turbofan engine, we are in constant dialogue with Pratt & Whitney to 
ensure that we have sufficient capacity to deliver our planned growth.    
A large aircraft order is a significant financial commitment and so requires financing. To date, we have 
financed all of our new aircraft deliveries through sale and leaseback arrangements. This will continue to be 
the case for the remaining A320ceo-family deliveries through to the end of 2018, for which we already have in 
place fully committed sale and leaseback financing. We are now starting to consider the best options for 
financing the first A321neo deliveries from 2019 – we are confident that, given the aircraft’s desirability as a 
result of its superior operating economics and Wizz Air’s established strong financial track record, finance will 
be readily available on competitive terms. 
Regulatory risks 
Ensuring compliance. Even in a liberalised air traffic right environment, aviation remains a highly regulated 
industry.  Wizz Air relies on an air operator’s certificate (AOC) and operating licence issued by Hungary in 
order to exercise the right to operate air services both within Europe and to and from countries with which 
Europe has liberalised air traffic agreements. The AOC requires the Company to be majority owned and 
effectively controlled by qualifying nationals, which currently means nationals of the European Economic Area 
and Switzerland. If the Company ceases to be majority owned and effectively controlled by qualifying 
nationals, then its AOC and operating licence – and, so, its right to operate its business – could be at risk. The 
Company therefore closely monitors the nationality of its Shareholders. The Board has set a limit (permitted 
maximum) of 49% of its issued Ordinary Shares for ownership by non-qualifying nationals and the Board has 
the power to take action in relation to non-qualifying Shareholder shareholdings to protect the Company’s 
AOC and operating licence. During the course of the 2017 financial year, the Board exercised some of these 
powers, placing a temporary ban on the further acquisition of Ordinary Shares by non-qualifying Shareholders 
to stop the permitted maximum being exceeded. The Board receives a report at each Board meeting of the 
level of share ownership by non-qualifying nationals. 
Operational risks 
Safety events. An accident or incident, or terrorist attack, can adversely affect an airline’s image and 
customers’ willingness to travel with that airline. 
At Wizz Air, our number one priority is the safety of our aircraft, passengers and crew. Our aircraft fleet is 
young and reliable, we use the services of world-class maintenance organisations and we have a strong safety 
culture. A cross-functional safety council meets twice a year, involving both senior management as well as 
operational staff, and reviews any issues which have arisen in the past six months and the actions taken as a 
consequence. In addition to this, we collect detailed data from all aspects of our operation in order to identify    
Wizz Air Holdings Plc Annual report and accounts 2017 30 
STRATEGIC REPORT 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED 
Risks relating to the Group continued 
Operational risks continued 
trends and relevant personnel from our Operations department meet twice a year to discuss any trends 
identified in their sphere of operation and how they are being dealt with. We also operate an anonymous safety 
reporting system, to allow our flight and cabin crew to report safety issues which are a concern to them. Our 
entry standards for operating crew are high and our own Approved Training Organisation (ATO) ensures that 
all of our pilots are trained to the same exacting standards. In July 2016, Wizz Air achieved registration under 
the International Air Transport Association’s Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). The IOSA programme is the 
worldwide standard in airline safety evaluation and assesses an airline’s safety management and control 
systems and processes. 
Our experienced security team has an ongoing programme to check that the security of our operations and 
the airports which we serve meet high standards. We know that the proper management of risk means that 
we must anticipate and deal with issues in advance. Our security team also maintains close contact with 
relevant authorities in order to assess any potential security or other threats to our operations. Any serious 
threat will be escalated to senior management. We have in the past suspended operations to destinations 
where the safety of our aircraft, passengers and crew cannot be guaranteed. In December 2015, Wizz Air 
Hungary Ltd. was named as a company of strategic importance by the Hungarian Parliament and, as such, the 
Company now enjoys enhanced security information and protection under the auspices of the Hungarian 
Constitution Protection Office.  
Human resources 
Wizz Air is a people business. We know that our people are the backbone of our business and it is their 
dedication, day in, day out, that allows us to deliver our low-cost, quality service. But we know that we cannot 
take our people for granted and that competition for the high quality people who we seek is keen and may 
become even more so. 
 From time to time, pilots and others can be in short supply. We invest a huge amount of time in recruiting 
pilots and also training them to maintain our high standards. In order to ensure the future availability of 
pilots of the right calibre, we have recently announced a five-year training partnership with CTC Aviation 
Training and Central European Flight Academy to provide cadet pilots to Wizz Air. We have also 
introduced an innovative scheme which allows pilots who are currently turboprop captains to transition 
quickly to a position with Wizz Air. 
 We are proud that, to date, we have maintained a good relationship with our employees and we have not 
experienced industrial unrest. We strive to make sure that this will remain the case, but we realise that 
there can be no guarantee. We know that we need to ensure that we continue to motivate our colleagues. 
Feedback is an essential part of this process – both giving and receiving – and we consider direct 
communication between senior management and other employees as the best way of listening to our 
employees’ concerns. Visits by senior management to each of our operating bases are organised at least 
annually.  Following on from last year’s online and in-person employee feedback programme, follow-up 
surveys relating to a number of matters that arose were conducted with our colleagues from Flight 
Operations and Cabin Operations and a number of improvement actions were implemented.  
 Our success to date has also depended on a number of key personnel, including our Chief Executive 
Officer, other senior managers and post holders required by regulation. Our continuing success will 
depend on having the right people in those key positions. While, in the past, we have successfully recruited 
for those positions, we recognise that we have a pool of talent within the Company and have recently 
started a talent assessment and leadership development programme for our staff. Succession of key 
personnel is a matter which we take extremely seriously and we shall continue to develop our succession 
planning processes to ensure that we have colleagues of the right calibre to lead the Company in the 
future.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 
A COMPANY COMMITTED TO HIGH STANDARDS OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Chairman’s statement on corporate governance 
Wizz Air is a company which continues to grow at a market-leading rate. Wizz Air’s Directors recognise the 
trust that investors have placed in the Company’s business and continue to ensure high standards of corporate 
governance. 
Continuing the Board’s development to reflect the Company’s standing as a FTSE 250 company, I was 
delighted to welcome Wioletta Rosołowska as an additional Non-Executive Director shortly before the 
Company’s annual general meeting, with effect from 1 June 2016. Wioletta brings to the Board extremely 
relevant, extensive Central and Eastern European consumer and marketing experience gained during her 
ongoing, successful executive career.  
As I reported in last year’s annual report, the Directors participated in a performance evaluation of the Board, 
its Committees and individual Directors and a number of actions were implemented as a result. For example, 
Directors were given the opportunity to spend a number of days visiting the Company’s office in Budapest as 
well as its base in Warsaw to speak with management and employees, as well as experience a number of areas 
of the Company’s business from crew training to ramp handling. The Board also has a renewed focus on the 
Company’s strategy, essential as the business continues to grow rapidly, with the existing aircraft orders 
projecting an airline of at least 150 aircraft by the end of 2024. The Board will repeat the performance 
evaluation with reference to the financial year ended 31 March 2017 through an internally facilitated process to 
ensure that actions arising from the previous evaluation were implemented appropriately and to ensure that 
processes continue to develop to support the Company’s growth in the future.  
One key example of the continuous review and development of processes is the development of a more 
structured enterprise risk management system, which has now been completed and the results presented to the 
Board. The Company’s Audit Committee and management worked with Ernst & Young to implement this 
enterprise risk management system, with the participation of a newly created Risk Council involving the 
Company’s Chief Executive Officer, all other officers and a number of heads of functions. The enterprise risk 
management system has been embedded in the Company’s culture through comprehensive training at all 
management levels and ongoing training will ensure that the principles continue to be applied in the Company’s 
risk management processes and as the Company encounters and deals with new issues in the future.  
Trading in the Company’s shares over the financial year ended 31 March 2017 resulted in a number of changes 
in the Company’s shareholders.  Following an increase in the shareholdings of a number of shareholders who 
were not Qualifying Nationals, as defined in the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board took certain 
measures to ensure that the aggregate of those shareholdings did not exceed the Permitted Maximum, also 
as defined in the Company’s Articles of Association. Those measures have now been removed, although the 
Company continues to monitor closely such shareholdings on a regular basis. This demonstrates that, where 
required, the Board is prepared to take decisive action to ensure the protection of the Company’s interests 
and ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements.     
The Board thanks each and every one of our investors for the faith they have shown in the Company’s business 
and, also, recognises the trust that the Shareholders have placed in the Board and senior management. Over 
the course of the last year, a large number of meetings with investors were organised by senior management 
and, in addition, I have also spoken to a number of Shareholders myself. Any concerns or comments raised 
were fed back to the Board.   
Once again, I would stress that the trust that both investors and other stakeholders have placed in the Board 
is not taken for granted. We will continue to develop our processes to ensure that our policy of ensuring high 
standards of governance appropriate for the Company is maintained in the future and in a manner which is 
appropriate for the Company’s continued fast rate of growth.

GOVERNANCE 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE 
The Directors support high standards of corporate governance and it is the policy of the Company to comply 
with current best practice in UK corporate governance to the extent appropriate for a company of its size. The 
Board intends that the Company will comply fully with the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code 
(April 2016) during the 2018 financial year, save as set out below: 
a) William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo. However, given the benefits to the 
Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board believes that Mr Franke should 
continue as Chairman. 
b) The underlying principles of the Company’s Remuneration Policy, described in more detail in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 50 to 54, are that: (i) remuneration must be competitive whilst not being 
more than is necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive management of the quality required to 
continue to run the Company successfully; and (ii) a significant proportion of remuneration remains 
performance based. Following a period of consultation with a large number of significant Shareholders, 
the policy was approved by the Company’s Shareholders at the Company’s 2015 annual general meeting 
and will remain in place for a period of three years. The policy does not include provisions allowing the 
Company to recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum as mentioned in paragraph D.1.1. of 
the Corporate Governance Code. The Company believes that the policy as approved by Shareholders 
reflects the Company’s preference to keep all aspects of its business as simple as possible. Nonetheless, 
the Company has been transparent with its Shareholders in this respect and the Remuneration Committee 
will continue to review all aspects of the Remuneration Policy on an ongoing basis to ensure that it 
continues to align with the Company’s and Shareholders’ interests. 
The Board considers that it and the Company have, during the financial year ended 31 March 2017, complied 
with the Corporate Governance Code (September 2014), save as set out above. 
The Corporate Governance Code is issued by the Financial Reporting Council and is available for review on 
the Financial Reporting Council's website: www.frc.org.uk. 
Our key Shareholders

Our relationship with Indigo  
On 31 March 2017, Indigo (Indigo Hungary LP and Indigo Maple Hill LP together) held 18.7 per cent. of the 
Company’s issued Ordinary Shares, as well as 44,830,503 convertible shares of £0.0001 each in the capital of 
the Company (“Convertible Shares”). The Convertible Shares do not have any right to participate in the 
Company’s profits and are, save in very limited circumstances, non-voting. These limited circumstances include 
the consideration of a resolution for the winding-up of the Company or the variation of the rights attaching to 
the Convertible Shares or any variation of the rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares into which the 
Convertible Shares may be converted. 
Each Convertible Share may be converted into one Ordinary Share, as long as the ownership of the Company 
remains compliant with applicable EU ownership and control rules. Indigo also holds a number of convertible 
notes which may be converted into Ordinary Shares, again provided that the Company’s ownership remains 
compliant with EU ownership and control rules. The terms of these convertible notes are governed by a note 
purchase agreement dated 24 February 2015 and entered into between the Company, Wizz Air Hungary Ltd. 
and Indigo. Our Chairman, William A. Franke, is the managing partner of Indigo.

Our relationship with Indigo continued 
According to the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules (the “Listing Rules”), any person who exercises 
or controls the exercise, on their own or together with any person with whom they are acting in concert, of 
30 per cent. or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially all matters at general meetings of a 
company are known as “controlling shareholders”. During its preparation for its initial public offering in 
February 2015, the Company discussed with the UK Listing Authority that, in the circumstances, Indigo would 
be treated as a controlling shareholder of the Company for these purposes. The Listing Rules require 
companies with controlling shareholders to enter into a written and legally binding agreement, which is 
intended to ensure that the controlling shareholder complies with certain independence provisions. The 
agreement must contain undertakings that: 
a) transactions and arrangements with the controlling shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms; 
b) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will take any action that would have the effect 
of preventing the listed company from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and 
c) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates will propose or procure the proposal of a 
Shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application 
of the Listing Rules. 
Wizz Air entered into a relationship agreement with Indigo dated 24 February 2015. The key terms of this 
relationship agreement are set out below. 
Independence 
Indigo has undertaken to exercise its voting powers in relation to the Company to ensure that the Company is 
capable of operating and making decisions for the benefit of the Shareholders of the Company as a whole and 
independently of Indigo at all times. In addition, Indigo has undertaken that it will not, and will procure that 
none of its associates will: (a) take any action that would have the effect of preventing the Company from 
complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and (b) propose or procure the proposal of a 
Shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to circumvent the proper application of 
the Listing Rules. 
Board 
Indigo may nominate: (a) three Directors to the Board if Indigo and its associates hold in excess of 30 per cent. 
of the fully converted share capital of the Company (i.e. assuming the conversion in full of all Convertible 
Shares and Convertible Notes); (b) two Directors to the Board if Indigo and its associates hold in excess of 
20 per cent. of the fully converted share capital; or (c) one Director to the Board if Indigo and its associates 
hold in excess of 10 per cent. of the fully converted share capital (each an “Indigo Director”). If Indigo and/or 
its associates no longer hold at least 30, 20 or 10 per cent., respectively, of the fully converted share capital of 
the Company, then Indigo has agreed to procure, insofar as it is legally able to do so, that the appropriate 
number of Indigo Directors resigns from the Board unless a majority of the independent Directors resolve that 
any Indigo Director should remain on the Board. 
Indigo may not nominate any person to be an Indigo Director whose re-election has been proposed to, but 
not approved by, the holders of Ordinary Shares in general meeting, or who has been removed from office by 
a resolution of the holders of Ordinary Shares. 
Indigo may also nominate one Indigo Director to each of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee until the earlier of: (a) twelve months from admission; or (b) Indigo and its associates ceasing to 
hold at least 10 per cent. of the fully converted share capital of the Company. 
The Board shall manage the Company independently of Indigo in accordance with the articles of association, 
the Listing Rules and applicable law. The parties have also agreed that at least half of the Board (excluding the 
Chairman) shall comprise independent Non-Executive Directors, the Nomination Committee shall consist of a 
majority of independent Directors and, save as set out in the paragraph above, the Remuneration and Audit 
Committees shall consist only of independent Directors. 
Arm’s length transactions 
All transactions and relationships between the Company and Indigo or any of their associates shall be 
conducted at arm’s length, on a normal commercial basis and in accordance with the related party transaction 
rules set out in Chapter 11 of the Listing Rules.

Provision of information and confidentiality 
Indigo shall, subject to the Company’s obligations under all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the 
Listing Rules and the DTRs), be provided with financial, management and/or other information relating to 
any member of the Group as Indigo (or any of its associates) may reasonably require for the purposes 
of any internal or external reporting requirements which the relevant party is required by internal compliance, 
law or regulation to make. Indigo may disclose any such financial, management and/or other information 
to its associates provided that: (a) Indigo will (and will procure that any associate to whom any information 
is passed will) keep confidential any such information; (b) such information does not include information 
relating to any transaction between the Company and Indigo or any of their associates obtained as a result 
of an Indigo Director’s position as a Director; (c) disclosure would not result in the breach by the 
Company of the DTRs or require the Company to make a public announcement; and (d) the name of such 
persons to whom information is disclosed is added to the Company’s insider list.  
Confirmation regarding compliance 
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the relationship agreement, on 24 February 2015, until 
24 May 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this report: 
d) the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the relationship agreement; and 
e) so far as the Company is aware, the independence provisions included in the relationship agreement have 
been complied with by Indigo. 
Engaging with our Shareholders 
Wizz Air recognises the need to engage with its Shareholders.  
Over the course of the past year, the Company’s Investor Relations department has arranged a number of 
roadshows, timed around the release of financial results, as well as other meetings with investors. At the 2016 
annual general meeting, attended by all of the Directors, both the Chairman and the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director, along with the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, were 
available to answer questions from investors. The Chairman, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee will be present at the 2017 annual 
general meeting and, again, will be available to answer questions from investors. 
A report on investor relations is presented by the Chief Financial Officer and, in the absence of the Chief 
Financial Officer, the Head of Investor Relations at each Board meeting, during which feedback from meetings 
held by senior management with investors is provided. The Board is supplied with copies of analysts’ and 
brokers’ briefings as they are received. 
Reflecting the importance that the Company places on being transparent with its Shareholders, key 
Shareholders were consulted on certain aspects of the proposed Remuneration Policy before it was put to a 
Shareholder vote at the 2015 annual general meeting.

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY 
The Board of Directors 
Effective oversight of Wizz Air’s business is the key function of the Board. Key to this oversight is the approval 
of the Company’s long-term strategy and commercial objectives and these matters are reserved to the Board, 
along with the approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and any changes thereto. Other 
key areas also reserved to the Board include financial reporting and controls, internal controls, the review and 
approval of key contracts, Board membership, the remuneration of Directors and senior executive employees, 
corporate governance and the review of safety issues. 
Board membership 
Wizz Air’s Board currently comprises one Executive and nine Non-Executive Directors, which the Directors 
consider to be an appropriate Board structure. The current Directors bring a wealth of experience from both 
the worldwide aviation industry as well as other international industries and so together bring to the Company 
an appropriate breadth, depth and balance of skills, knowledge, experience and expertise. The Directors who

Independence 
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that at least half the members (excluding the chairman) of 
the board of directors of a company with a premium listing should be non-executive directors, determined by 
the board to be independent in character and judgment and free from relationships or circumstances which 
are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgment. 
The Board has considered the independence of the Company’s Non-Executive Directors and has concluded that: 
f) William A. Franke, the Chairman, does not meet the independence criteria set out in the Corporate 
Governance Code, given that he is the managing partner of Indigo (a significant Shareholder). However, 
given the benefits to the Company of his recognised experience in the airline industry, the Board believes 
that it is in the Company’s best interest that Mr Franke should continue as Chairman of Wizz Air. 
g) Stephen L. Johnson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director given his past position 
with Indigo. 
h) John R. Wilson is not considered to be an independent Non-Executive Director as he is a principal of Indigo. 
Other than William A. Franke, John R. Wilson and Stephen L. Johnson, the Company regards all of its 
Non-Executive Directors, namely, Guido Demuynck, Simon Duffy, Thierry de Preux, Susan Hooper, John 
McMahon and Wioletta Rosołowska, as independent Non-Executive Directors within the meaning of 
“independent” as defined in the Corporate Governance Code and free from any business or other relationship 
which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment. Accordingly, as an absolute 
majority of the Directors are independent Non-Executive Directors, the Company complies with the 
requirement of the Corporate Governance Code that at least half of the board (excluding the chairman) of a 
company with a premium listing should comprise independent non-executive directors. 
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
The Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board should appoint one of its independent 
Non-Executive Directors as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. The Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director should be available to Shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer has failed to resolve or where such contact is inappropriate. 
John McMahon has been appointed as the Company’s Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.

Board Committees 
The Directors have established an Audit Committee, a Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee. The 
terms of reference of the Committees have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Corporate 
Governance Code. A summary of the terms of reference of the Committees is set out below. 
Each Committee and each Director has the authority to seek independent professional advice where necessary 
to discharge their respective duties, in each case at the Company’s expense. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee’s duties, as set out in its terms of reference, include: 
a) monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, including its annual and semi-annual 
reports, interim management statements, preliminary results announcements and any other formal 
announcement relating to its financial performance; 
b) reviewing significant financial reporting issues and judgments which they contain having regard to matters 
communicated to it by the auditors;  
c) where requested by the Board, reviewing the content of the annual report and accounts and advising the 
Board on whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy;  
d) keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial controls and 
internal control and risk management systems;  
e) reviewing the adequacy and security of the Company’s arrangements for its employees and contractors 
to raise concerns, in confidence, about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters. The 
Audit Committee shall ensure that these arrangements allow proportionate and independent investigation 
of such matters and appropriate follow-up action;  
f) monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Audit function in the context of the 
Company’s overall risk management system; 
g) considering and approving the remit of the Internal Audit function and ensuring it has adequate resources 
and appropriate access to information to enable it to perform its function effectively and in accordance 
with the relevant professional standards. The Audit Committee shall also ensure the Internal Audit function 
has adequate standing and is free from management or other restrictions; 
h) meeting the Company’s head of the Internal Audit function at least once a year, without management 
being present, to discuss its remit and any issues arising from the internal audits carried out. In addition, 
the Audit Committee shall ensure that the Company’s head of the Internal Audit function has the right of 
direct access to the Chairman, the Audit Committee Chairman and the rest of the Audit Committee, and 
is accountable to the Audit Committee; 
i) considering and making recommendations to the Board, to be put to Shareholders for approval at the 
annual general meeting, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the Company’s 
external auditors. The Audit Committee shall oversee the selection process for new auditors and if auditors 
resign the Audit Committee shall investigate the issues leading to this and decide whether any action is 
required; 
j) overseeing the relationship with the external auditors including (but not limited to): 
I. assessing annually their independence and objectivity taking into account relevant UK 
professional and regulatory requirements and the relationship with the external auditors as a 
whole, including the provision of any non-audit services; and 
II. satisfying itself that there are no relationships (such as family, employment, investment, financial 
or business) between the external auditors and the Company (other than in the ordinary course 
of business) which could adversely affect the auditors’ independence and objectivity;

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY CONTINUED 
Board Committees continued 
Audit Committee continued 
k) meeting regularly with the external auditors, including once at the planning stage before the audit and 
once after the audit at the reporting stage. The Audit Committee shall meet the external auditors at least 
once a year, without management being present, to discuss their remit and any issues arising from the 
audit; 
l) reviewing and approving the annual audit plan and ensuring that it is consistent with the scope of the 
audit engagement having regard to the seniority, expertise and experience of the audit team; and 
m) reviewing the findings of the audit with the external auditors. This shall include but not be limited to 
the following: 
I. a discussion of any major issues which arose during the audit; 
II. any accounting and audit judgments;  
III. levels of errors identified during the audit; and  
IV. the effectiveness of the audit process. 
The Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Audit Committee should comprise at least three 
members, who should all be independent Non-Executive Directors, and that at least one member should have 
recent and relevant financial experience. During the financial year ended 31 March 2017, the membership of 
the Company’s Audit Committee comprised three members, namely Simon Duffy, Susan Hooper and 
John McMahon, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. No members of the Audit Committee 
have links with the Company’s external auditors. Mr Duffy is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and is Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance Code recommendation 
regarding the composition of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee formally meets at least three times per year and otherwise as required. The Chief 
Executive Officer, other Directors and representatives from the Finance function of the Company may attend 
and speak at meetings of the Audit Committee. The Company’s external auditors and the Chief Financial 
Officer are invited to attend meetings of the Audit Committee on a regular basis. The Company’s Head of 
Internal Audit, along with the retained external firm of internal auditors, also attend the Audit Committee’s 
meetings to report on internal audit matters.  Following each meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
reports to the Board on the significant items discussed during the Audit Committee’s meeting. The Audit 
Committee met on ten occasions during the 2017 financial year (including telephonic meetings). In addition to 
the formal meetings, the Audit Committee is in regular contact with relevant management in connection with, 
for example, the implementation of the Group’s hedging strategy. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Remuneration Policy for all Executive Directors and the 
Chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments, and recommending and monitoring the 
remuneration of the senior managers. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the full Board.  
The objective of the Company’s Remuneration Policy is to attract, retain and motivate executive management 
of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary, having regard 
to the views of Shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for making recommendations for the grants of awards under the 
Company’s share option schemes. In accordance with the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference, no Director 
may participate in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of remuneration. 
The Corporate Governance Code provides that the Remuneration Committee should comprise at least three 
members, all of whom should be independent Non-Executive Directors. During the financial year ended 31 
March 2017, the membership of the Company’s Remuneration Committee comprised three members, namely 
Guido Demuynck, Susan Hooper and Thierry de Preux, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee is Mr Demuynck.  
The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance Code recommendations 
regarding the composition of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Remuneration Committee meets formally at least twice each year and otherwise as required. There were 
six meetings of the Remuneration Committee during the 2017 financial year.

Board Committees continued 
Nomination Committee 
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition of 
the Board. The Nomination Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, the size, structure and composition of the Board, and retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors, and will make appropriate recommendations to the Board on such 
matters. While a number of Directors were initially appointed to the Board under investor appointment rights, 
the most recent appointments of Simon Duffy, Guido Demuynck, Susan Hooper and Wioletta Rosołowska 
were conducted through Korn/Ferry, which has no other connections with the Company. 
The Corporate Governance Code provides that a majority of the members of the Nomination Committee 
should be independent Non-Executive Directors. The Company’s Nomination Committee is comprised of three 
members, namely William A. Franke, John McMahon and Simon Duffy. The Chairman of the Nomination 
Committee is Mr Franke. The Company therefore considers that it complies with the Corporate Governance 
Code’s recommendations regarding the composition of the Nomination Committee. 
The Company recognises the importance to the Company of diversity, including gender equality. The 
Company’s Code of Ethics is unequivocal that discriminatory practices will not be tolerated and that people 
will be judged on the basis of their performance and ability to do their jobs and not on any other basis. The 
Nomination Committee will work further to ensure that, when the opportunity presents itself, diversity is 
properly reflected in the Board and in the Company’s senior management. The Company believes that this 
commitment is demonstrated by recent appointments at both Director and senior management level. 
The Nomination Committee is scheduled to meet formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. 
There were six meetings of the Nomination Committee during the 2017 financial year and, in between these 
meetings, members of the Nomination Committee advised senior management on the appointment of an 
additional Non-Executive Director and on various senior management appointments, including the Group’s 
Chief Financial Officer. Interviews of candidates for each of these positions were also conducted by the 
members of the Nomination Committee. Candidates for the Group’s Chief Financial Officer position as well as 
the additional Non-Executive Director were interviewed by the members of the Nomination Committee.

Board procedures 
At least six Board meetings are scheduled during each financial year. At these meetings, the Directors meet 
with Senior Executives to receive detailed updates on Wizz Air’s business and operations and to discuss the 
Company’s strategy. Prior to these meetings, each Director receives an information pack containing a 
comprehensive review of the Company’s business as well as detailed proposals for approval of transactions 
and developments falling within the Board’s remit. The Company believes that this enables each Director 
properly to discharge his or her responsibilities. At each Board meeting, Directors who have a conflict of 
interest in any agenda item declare that interest and are not entitled to vote on that agenda item. 
A number of key strategic and commercial decisions require Board approval and, as and when any such 
decision is needed outside the scheduled meeting cycle, an ad hoc telephone Board meeting may be arranged. 
In general, therefore, it is anticipated that there will be around ten Board meetings in total during each 
financial year. 
Newly appointed Non-Executive Directors meet with the Company’s senior management and visit Wizz Air’s 
operational headquarters to ensure that they have a thorough understanding of the Company’s business. 
Wizz Air maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. This insurance covers any claim that may be 
brought against the Directors in the exercise of their duties. 
The Company has adopted a Share Dealing Policy that reflects and incorporates the provisions of the UK 
Listing Authority’s Model Code. As a consequence, the Directors as well as certain designated employees must 
obtain clearance from the Company’s Chairman before dealing in the Company’s shares and are prohibited 
from dealing at all during certain periods as set out in the Model Code. The Share Dealing Policy was updated 
to reflect the requirements of the EU Market Abuse Regulation which came into effect on 3 July 2016.  
Finally, it is proposed that, in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
all Directors will offer themselves for re-election at the 2017 annual general meeting.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Wizz Air has grown significantly and successfully as a result, in part, of constantly re-examining the way it does 
things and ensuring that its business is run to the best possible standards. The work of the Audit Committee 
during the 2017 financial year reflects this philosophy. As well as the continued engagement on day-to-day 
financial issues, including further discussion on hedging strategy and approval of hedging transactions, the 
Audit Committee has worked closely with the Company’s Internal Audit function together with external 
advisers to run an effective programme of internal audits and to overhaul completely the Company’s system 
for enterprise risk management (ERM), to ensure that the Company’s risk management processes continue to 
provide a strong foundation for its future growth.  
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year 
Risk management 
The Audit Committee is tasked with ensuring that the Board has adequate oversight of risk management and 
that it deems the controls sufficient and effective.  
The Company’s Internal Audit function conducts an annual risk assessment exercise involving senior 
management from the level of heads of function upwards. Following implementation of the new ERM framework, 
the assessment of each risk involves consideration of the inherent risk, existing mitigating measures and residual 
risk, along with a determination of how that risk should be dealt with in accordance with the Company’s risk 
appetite. The resulting risk register is then used to prepare a principal risk report.  A new, internal Risk Council, 
comprising the Company’s senior management team as well as a number of other senior members of 
management, reviews the risk register and the principal risk report at least once a quarter. The Risk Council then 
reports to the Audit Committee on, among other things, changes to be made to the principal risk report. The 
principal risk report, once approved by the Audit Committee, is delivered to the Board.   
The risk register is also used to develop an Internal Audit plan for the upcoming year, which is approved by the Audit 
Committee. Internal audits are performed by Ernst & Young and the Head of Internal Audit, who has direct responsibility 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee as well as a reporting line to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.  
Following completion of an Internal Audit, a report is compiled which sets out the findings, makes 
recommendations for control improvement and presents the improvement actions undertaken by 
management. Internal audit reports are submitted and presented to the Audit Committee for approval. The 
Chairman gives a report of the Internal Audit reports completed in a particular period to the full Board. 
Internal Audit then verifies that actions have been taken and controls implemented and reports back to the 
Audit Committee on the status. The Audit Committee will work to ensure that the Company continues to 
develop effective risk assessment and management processes.  
More information on risk management within the Company is set out on pages 26 to 30 of this annual report.  
Financial information 
The Audit Committee reviews and approves all interim and final financial statements, as well as the content of 
the Company’s annual report. The Company’s external auditors provide the Audit Committee with a briefing 
on any issues arising. The Audit Committee also reviews and approves any regulatory announcements that 
are made in connection with such financial information. It is only after the Audit Committee’s approval that the 
statements are put to the Board for approval. 
Relationship with external auditors 
The Audit Committee has approved the fees to be paid and the external audit plan for the 2017 financial year 
and reviewed the reports of the auditors on the half-year review and the annual audit performed.  
Taking into account the above, and the result of the AQR review (see later), the Audit Committee was satisfied 
with the performance of the external auditors and with the effectiveness of the external audit process. The audit 
of the 2017 financial statements and of this annual report, and the review of the half-year financial report, were 
all completed in time and in good quality, addressing the key issues. 
The Audit Committee will consider the appointment of external auditors for the financial year ending 31 March 
2018 and the Directors will propose a resolution in this respect for the forthcoming annual general meeting of 
the Company. Should the Directors later decide to appoint a firm other than the current auditor 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Directors would ask the shareholders to ratify the appointment of the new 
auditor at the 2018 annual general meeting. 
The Audit Committee ensures the independence of the Company’s external auditors. The Audit Committee 
reviewed the independence letter of the auditors and considered in particular the non-audit fees paid to the external 
auditors during the year (see Note 6 to the financial statements). While fees paid on tax and other advisory services 
were higher in 2017 than the audit fees, the Audit Committee was satisfied that this did not compromise the 
objectivity and independence of the auditors, mainly because: (i) the engagement leaders from the relevant

Significant matters relating to the annual report 
In the course of the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, the following issues were considered 
by the Audit Committee: 
 Maintenance accounting: As part of reviewing the reports from management and the auditor on the half-
year and the year-end accounts, the Audit Committee satisfied itself that the policy and the procedures 
applicable to this complex area were followed in the year consistently, including the regular updates to 
estimates and judgments and the maintenance of the system supporting the calculations.  
 Membership revenues: Until 2016 the Group recognised membership revenues arising from the Wizz 
Discount Club (WDC) customer loyalty program on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period of 
the membership. During the year management presented its analysis showing that the actual pattern of 
customers taking benefit of the program is different from being straight line, and proposed that going 
forward membership revenues would be better recognised based on the actual historic usage pattern. 
The Audit Committee approved this change in estimate for the purposes of accounting for membership 
revenues, on the condition that management should review the applicability of the pattern at least once 
every year (see Note 4 for more information).  
 Segment reporting: The Audit Committee satisfied itself that starting from the 2017 financial year it was 
appropriate to introduce separate presentation for the results of the airline and the online tour operator 
business units of the Group. This applies both for segment reporting disclosures under IFRS 8 and for the 
business analysis of revenues, operating expenses and certain KPIs in the Strategic Report. 
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee also considered whether the annual report taken as a whole 
was fair, balanced and understandable and whether it provided the necessary information for Shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy. The Committee is satisfied that 
the annual report meets these criteria. 
Other matters considered during the year 
 FRC AQR review: During the year the Audit Quality Review (AQR) team of the UK Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC) reviewed the audit of the 2016 financial statements of the Group, that had been performed 
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP UK. The AQR team monitors the quality of the audit work of statutory 
auditors and audit firms in the UK, that audit Public Interest Entities (PIEs) and certain other entities. The 
overall assessment of the audit found that there were no significant areas of concern. The report from the 
AQR was received and reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Committee was satisfied with the good 
result of the review. The recommendations from the review have been incorporated into the audit of the 
2017 financial statements.   
 New accounting standards:  There were important developments during the year in relation to three new 
IFRSs that will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. In order of importance: 
 IFRS 16 Leases: The standard is awaiting endorsement by the EU, that is currently expected by the 
end of 2017.  The Committee has not taken a position whether to adopt the standard early (from 1 
April 2018) or from the date required by the standard (1 April 2019). The Committee has reviewed 
management’s preliminary analysis of the potential impacts of the standard on the financial 
statements of the Group and approved the related disclosure – see Note 2 (Accounting policies) to 
the financial statements. 
 IFRS 9 Financial instruments:  The Committee supported management’s proposal to early adopt IFRS 
9 starting from 1 April 2017.  IFRS 9 enables the Group to eliminate the impact on earnings resulting 
from changes in the time value of hedges. The change in the time value of hedges was the last 
transaction of recurring nature that the Group classified as exceptional item in its financial statements. 
Therefore the adoption of IFRS 9 means that, commencing from the 2018 financial year, it is expected 
that the Group will not have any exceptional items and therefore it can discontinue the presentation 
of underlying earnings which differ from IFRS earnings. 
 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers: The Committee reviewed management’s preliminary 
assessment for the implications of this standard and supported management’s recommendation to 
adopt it from the standard date, that is 1 April 2018.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
CONTINUED 
Main activities of the Audit Committee during the 2017 financial year continued 
Other matters considered during the year continued 
 Hedging Policy update: In January 2017 management proposed and the Committee approved the 
following changes to the Groups’ Hedging Policy: 
 The maximum hedge coverage levels allowed by the Policy were increased by 10 per cent. both on jet 
fuel and on FX hedges. This means moving from 60 to 70 per cent. on a rolling twelve-month basis, 
and moving from 50 to 60 per cent. on a rolling 18-month basis. For the closest quarter the maximum 
level allowed by the Policy was increased from 75 to 85 per cent.. 
 Implement new hedging instruments for short dated exposures, particularly fuel and FX swaps with a 
tenure of 1-3 months. 
 Introduce FX hedging for the GBP/EUR currency pair, with a view to the significant GBP long position 
of the Group and the increased volatility of GBP FX rates following the Brexit vote. 
 Tendering statutory audit services for the Group: The EU Competition and Market Authority’s (“CMA”) 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (the “CMA Order”) defines 
requirements for mandatory tendering of statutory audit services, and the responsibility of audit 
committees in this respect.  It applies to EU-incorporated companies in FTSE 350 companies for financial 
years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. The CMA Order technically does not apply to the Group given 
that its holding entity is incorporated outside the EU. At the same time, while the ‘comply-or-explain’ 
provision in the UK Corporate Governance Code on audit tendering continues to apply to the Company 
for the current year it has been withdrawn in the version of the Corporate Governance Code which applies 
to the 2018 financial year. Nevertheless, the Audit Committee confirms that the Group is willing to 
voluntarily comply with the Order. The Audit Committee also confirms that the Group complied with the 
provisions of the CMA Order in its 2017 financial year. PricewaterhouseCoopers have been the auditors 
since 2007 and audit services were last tendered in 2011. Management proposed and the Committee 
approved the plan that during the 2018 financial year the statutory audit services for the Group will be 
tendered. The tendering process will also ensure that audit and non-audit services will be properly 
separated. The Committee trusts that these measures will overall support the independence, objectivity 
and value for money of the audit process. 
 Tax matters:  The Committee reviewed management’s analysis (i) of the significant developments in the 
international tax environment in the last 1-2 years (including the OECD BEPS measures), and (ii) of the Swiss 
‘Corporate Tax Reform III.’ initiative, which has since then been suspended in its current form as a result of a 
public referendum in Switzerland. The Committee is satisfied that currently there are no explicit impacts of 
these changes on the tax position of the Group and therefore that immediate changes are not required. 
However, together with management the Committee will continue to monitor developments closely.

REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE 
Wizz Air’s Nomination Committee is comprised of three members, namely John McMahon, our Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, Simon Duffy and me.   
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition of 
the Board. The Nomination Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience on the Board, the size, structure and composition of the Board, and retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors, and will make appropriate recommendations to the Board on 
such matters. 
The Company’s success to date has been achieved by ensuring that it appoints people of the highest calibre, 
whether as Directors, management or employees.  While the key selection criterion is to ensure that people 
are appointed on their ability to do their jobs, the Company and the Nomination Committee recognise the 
importance to the Company of diversity, including gender equality, and the appointments on which the 
Nomination Committee has advised during the 2017 financial year demonstrate that the Company is 
committed to this principle in practice as well as theory.   
Main activities of the Nomination Committee during the 2017 financial year 
During the 2017 financial year, the Nomination Committee worked on a number of key appointments for the 
Company.   
Having reviewed its composition, the Board decided that it was an appropriate time to add an additional 
independent non-executive director. The Nomination Committee worked with Korn/Ferry and senior 
management on the search process and members of the Nomination Committee conducted a number of 
interviews with candidates. The final candidate, Ms Wioletta Roso łowska, was recommended to the Board for 
appointment by the Nomination Committee.   
The Nomination Committee, along with other Directors, has also assisted senior management and the Board 
with a review of the structure of the Company’s senior executive management and its succession planning. 
Following the departure of the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, the Nomination Committee is working with 
management on the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer. Reflecting the importance of the Company’s 
Operations function to the ongoing success of the Company, Mr Diederik Pen was promoted, with the support 
of the Nomination Committee, to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer.   
The Nomination Committee’s ongoing work 
The Nomination Committee will continue to work with the Board to ensure that it has the appropriate balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience and that, where the opportunity presents itself, appointments are made 
which reflect not only the Company’s requirement to retain the best people for a particular role but also the 
Company’s values, including ensuring diversity within the Board and the Company’s senior management. 
The Nomination Committee and the Board also recognise the importance of ensuring that succession of 
Directors and senior management is properly managed, to ensure that the Company has the right people 
available as needed. The Nomination Committee will continue to work with the Board and the Company’s 
senior management to develop and refine succession plans, encouraging and facilitating internal talent 
development where necessary.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
Report of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
Wizz Air’s second full financial year as a listed company was more challenging than the first. While demand 
remained strong, the lower fuel price and increased competition fed through to lower fares and, in June 2016, 
the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to withdraw from its membership of the European Union, causing 
a significant fall in the value of the British Pound, which accounts for approximately 20 per cent. of the 
Company’s revenues. The operating environment was equally challenging, with the Company having to deal 
with unusually severe winter weather in Eastern Europe and a massive increase in disruption caused by 
industrial action by various air traffic control and airport organisations throughout the year.  Nonetheless, 
during the 2017 financial year the Company delivered industry-leading passenger growth of 18.9 per cent. and 
increase of total revenue of 9.9 per cent., translating to underlying net profits of €225.3 million. At the same 
time, the Company remained extremely cost-focused, with its operating unit cost falling by 7.8 per cent. The 
relative strength of Wizz Air’s performance against its peers was reflected in a share price which, as at 31 March 
2017, remained some 43 per cent. higher than the offering price in the Company’s initial public offering. Over 
the year, therefore, the Directors and senior management have ensured that the Company’s business has 
continued to deliver results that have significantly increased Shareholder value, despite the challenging 
industry conditions. 
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to ensuring that the Company’s Remuneration Policy 
remains an effective way to align the interests of the Directors and senior management with those of the 
Company’s Shareholders and that it provides appropriate incentivisation to continue to deliver Shareholder 
value. However, the Remuneration Committee also remains focused on the Company’s ultra-low-cost business 
model, and the governing principle that will continue to be applied is that remuneration must be competitive 
whilst not being more than is necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive management of the quality 
required to continue to run the Company successfully, and that a significant proportion of remuneration 
remains performance based. Indeed, this is a principle which is applied consistently throughout the Company 
for almost all employees. 
As a company, we value our Shareholders’ feedback, including on remuneration matters. I was pleased that 
last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration received a vote in favour from our Shareholders of 99.3 per cent. 
As contemplated in the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy, successful Company performance is 
reflected in the remuneration of the Executive Director and senior management. Under our Short-term 
Incentive Plan, performance against the four measures of underlying profit after tax, ex-fuel cost per available 
seat kilometre (CASK), on-time performance and individual performance assessment resulted in an average 
payout equivalent to 84.9 per cent. of the target payout.  
The first award under the approved Long-term Incentive Plan was made during the 2016 financial year (in July 
2015) to officers  and to heads  of function. This award is due to vest in July 2018 with level of vesting for the 
major part of the award based on a combination of relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance 
compared to selected European airlines and fully diluted earnings per share growth. The second award was 
made during the 2017 financial year (in June 2016) with similar performance conditions to that of the 2016 
award. This award is due to vest in June 2019. Further details of the performance conditions attached to these 
awards are provided on page 55. 
Following a review of the Company’s Remuneration Policy during the year, the Remuneration Committee 
agreed that it remains appropriate and is aligned with the overall strategy of the Company and, therefore, no 
changes will be made in the year ahead. We last increased the base salary for the CEO in the 2016 financial 
year following a comprehensive market review. The Committee has determined that the CEO’s base salary 
remains competitive and therefore no changes were proposed for the 2017 financial year and are not proposed 
for the 2018 financial year.  
Whilst the Company is incorporated in Jersey, we have chosen voluntarily to comply in all material respects 
with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 and related regulations in respect of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Remuneration Policy, underlining the Company’s commitment to adopt UK 
corporate governance best practice. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by Shareholders at the 
Company’s annual general meeting in September 2015 with the intention that it should apply for three years. 
Therefore, we will not be asking Shareholders to vote on the policy at this year’s annual general meeting, 
although there will be an advisory vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration. In line with the reporting 
requirements, our Remuneration Policy will be put forward to a binding Shareholder vote at the 2018 AGM 
following a comprehensive review and consultation with Shareholders.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 
Report of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee continued 
In conclusion, I would reiterate that Wizz Air continues to be proud of the strong results delivered in the 2017 
financial year against a challenging industry background. We remain committed to ensuring that our 
Remuneration Policy continues to incentivise delivery of outstanding results in the future, but in a way that 
appropriately aligns the interests of the Directors and senior management with those of the Company’s 
Shareholders. We believe that the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy does this in a way which is 
consistent with the Company’s current growth phase and its desire to bring simplicity to all areas of its 
operation. Simplicity of process and practice reflects the Company’s strategy to focus on achieving the lowest 
possible unit operating cost while improving customers’ experience.  
We look forward to the continued support of our Shareholders and welcome any questions or suggestions 
that you may have to further align our Remuneration Policy with the interests of our investors.

Introduction 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by Shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 29 
September 2015. The intention is that the policy, as approved, will apply until the annual general meeting to 
be held in 2018. This Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration earned for the 2017 financial 
year in accordance with the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy (pages 50 to 54) and the planned 
application of our Remuneration Policy for the 2018 financial year (pages 58 and 59). 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended (the Regulations), which the Company has chosen to 
comply with in all material respects as a matter of best practice. 
For transparency, we have included the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy in full in this report (with 
some minor updates to wording to provide clarification and an updated scenario chart), although there will 
not be a vote on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy at this year’s annual general meeting. The definitive 
Remuneration Policy approved by Shareholders is outlined in the Company’s annual report for the 2015 
financial year and is available to view at corporate.wizzair.com. 
Remuneration Policy 
Introduction  
Our principal consideration when determining the Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our 
company strategy and business objectives, as well as to attract, retain and motivate executive management 
of the quality required to run the Company successfully without paying more than is necessary. 
In the selection of performance measures for both the annual performance bonus and the Long-term Incentive 
Plan the Remuneration Committee takes into account the Group’s strategic objectives and short and long-term 
business priorities. The performance targets are set in accordance with the Group’s annual operating plan and 
are reviewed annually to ensure that they are sufficiently stretching. In selecting the targets the Remuneration 
Committee also takes into account analysts’ forecasts, economic conditions and the Remuneration 
Committee’s expectation of performance over the relevant period. 
The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to: 
 attract, retain and motivate executive management without paying more than is necessary; 
 incentivise the successful execution of the Company’s business strategy; and 
 align the Executive Directors’ long-term interests with those of Shareholders. 
Executive Director remuneration 
The Chief Executive Officer is currently the Company’s sole Executive Director. The Remuneration Committee 
believes that the Company’s Remuneration Policy supports the Company’s ultra-low-cost business model by 
incentivising senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, to continue to strive to increase the 
Company’s cost advantage while improving the customers’ experience. The Chief Executive Officer currently 
receives a base salary and is eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to 200 per cent. of base salary 
and a long-term incentive award of up to 250 per cent. of base salary, with payments being dependent on the 
Company achieving certain financial and operational targets.  
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into account, among other 
things, the levels paid at competitor low-cost carriers.

Discretion, flexibility and judgment of the Remuneration Committee

 the participants of the plan; 
 the performance requirements and maximum percentages of salary to be used for the Short-term 
Incentive Plan and the Long-term Incentive Plan from year to year; 
 the performance conditions, performance periods and vesting periods for awards under the Long-term 
Incentive Plan from year to year; 
 the assessment of whether performance requirements and/or conditions have been met; 
 the treatment to be applied for a change of control or significant restructuring of the Group; 
 the determination of a good/bad leaver for incentive plan purposes and the treatment of awards 
thereof; and 
 the adjustments, if any, required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring, 
corporate events and special dividends).

Remuneration Policy continued 
Legacy arrangements 
In approving this policy, authority is to be given to the Company to honour commitments paid, promised to 
be paid or awarded to (i) current or former Directors prior to the date of this policy being approved or (ii) to 
an individual (who subsequently is appointed as a Director of the Company) at a time when the relevant 
individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, was not in 
consideration of that individual becoming a Director of the Company, even where such commitments are 
inconsistent with the provisions of this policy. 
Outstanding awards under the Company’s previous 2009 international employee share option plan remain 
eligible for vesting and exercise in accordance with their terms. 
Consideration of Shareholder views 
The Remuneration Committee and the Board will consider Shareholder feedback received in relation to the 
annual general meeting each year at a meeting immediately following the annual general meeting and any 
action required will be incorporated into the Remuneration Committee's business plan for the ensuing period. 
This, and any additional feedback received from Shareholders from time to time, will then be considered by 
the Remuneration Committee and as part of the Company's annual review of remuneration arrangements. 
Specific engagement with major Shareholders may be undertaken when a significant change in Remuneration 
Policy is proposed. 
Annual Report on Remuneration 
The members of the Remuneration Committee were Guido Demuynck (Chairman), Thierry de Preux, and Susan 
Hooper.  
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the Remuneration Policy for all Executive Directors 
and the Chairman, including pension rights and any compensation payments, and recommending and 
monitoring the remuneration of the senior managers. Non-Executive Directors’ fees are determined by the full 
Board. A summary of the Remuneration Committee’s terms of reference can be found on our corporate 
website, corporate.wizzair.com. Further details about the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 41 of 
the Corporate Governance Report. 
József Váradi, the Chief Executive Officer, and Owain Jones, the Chief Corporate Officer, attend meetings by 
invitation and assist the Remuneration Committee in its deliberations as appropriate, though they are not 
present when their own compensation is discussed.  
The Remuneration Committee is advised by Willis Towers Watson, which was selected following a competitive 
tender process led by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in 2015. Willis Towers Watson attends 
Committee meetings as and when required. During the 2017 financial year, Willis Towers Watson received fees 
totalling GBP 101,496 for advice related to Remuneration Policy, governance, developments in executive pay, 
benchmarking and performance analysis. 
Willis Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates 
under the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting 
in the UK. The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that Willis Towers Watson offers impartial and objective 
advice and brings a high degree of expertise to the Remuneration Committee’s discussions.

Salary and bonus were paid/are payable in Swiss Francs and were converted into Euros at the average rate 
applicable for the year (salary) or the rate applicable at the end of the financial year (bonus).  
Base salary for the CEO remained unchanged for 2017 at CHF 682,000.  
There were no benefits provided to the Chief Executive Officer other than six free return tickets usable on the 
route network of the Group, the value of which is estimated to be €800 altogether. 
Bonus is linked to three important financial and operational KPIs of the Company and to individual 
performance. The measures, target performance and actual performance for 2017 were the following:

* There is no payment if the performance is worse than the “Threshold”. At “Threshold” there is 50 per cent. payment of the 
target 
** At “Target” there is 100 per cent. payment (being equal to twelve months’ salary in the case of the CEO). 
*** If the “Maximum” is reached or exceeded then there is 200 per cent. payment of the target. 
As outlined earlier, the first award under the LTIP (of 250 per cent. of base salary) was made to the Chief 
Executive Officer during the 2016 financial year (July 2015). The award included 73,805 Performance Options, 
valued at GBP 15.72 per option share, that was the market price of the Company’s shares at the date of grant. 
The exercise price of the options is nil. 
Vesting is due in July 2018 subject to meeting the following performance criteria: 
a) relative total shareholder return (TSR) growth versus selected European airlines (50 per cent. weighting); and 
b) absolute fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth of the Company (50 per cent. weighting).  
The TSR group consists of the following entities: Ryanair and EasyJet (50 per cent. weighting); AirFrance-KLM, 
Air Berlin, Deutsche Lufthansa, Finnair, Flybe, IAG and SAS (50 per cent. weighting). Aer Lingus has been 
removed from the group following acquisition by IAG and subsequent delisting in September 2015. 
25 per cent. of the award will vest for median performance and 100 per cent. of the award will vest for 
performance equal to or exceeding the upper quartile. There will be no vesting for performance below median 
and linear interpolation will apply for performance between the median and upper quartile. 
With respect to the EPS growth measure, 25 per cent. of the award will vest for threshold average annual 
growth of 14 per cent., 50 per cent. will vest for target average annual growth of 17 per cent. and 100 per cent. 
will vest for maximum average annual growth of 20 per cent. Linear interpolation will apply for performance 
between threshold and target and target and maximum.  
A second award under the LTIP (of 250 per cent. of base salary) was made to the Chief Executive Officer 
during the 2017 financial year (June 2016). This award included 85,270 Performance Options, valued at GBP 
14.80 per option share at date of grant.  Vesting is due in June 2019 and is subject to the same performance 
criteria as the first award. However, the EPS threshold, target and maximum average annual growth rates were 
revised slightly versus the July 2015 grant to 14.2 per cent., 17.2 per cent. and 20.2 per cent. respectively.  
No remuneration is shown for LTIP options in the table above for “single total figure of remuneration”, because 
– as explained above – final vesting of these options is not determined as a result of achievement of 
performance targets relating to the 2016 financial year or 2017 financial year.

Executive Director’s remuneration continued 
Change in the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer compared to that of all other employees 
continued 
In 2017 the lower level of payout on the bonus (Short-term Incentive Plan) caused the decrease in the total 
remuneration both for the Chief Executive Officer and for other employees. This impact was stronger for other 
employees than for the Chief Executive Officer because (i) two Officer positions were unfilled at the end of 
the year hence no bonus was payable for these; and (ii) not only the aggregate amount of the bonus got lower 
but also the total number of employees increased during the year, most of whom are not entitled for bonus.  
Total employee remuneration changed from €68.6 million in the 2016 financial year to €77.9 million in the 2017 
financial year (see Note 7 to the financial statements), being a 13.5 per cent. increase year-on-year. This was 
driven also by the 21.1 per cent. increase in employee numbers (excluding rented pilots). 
There were no dividends or share buybacks either in the 2017 financial year or the 2016 financial year, and 
therefore disclosure of ‘relative importance of spend on pay’ has not been included.

Total Directors’ remuneration (Executive and Non-Executive) (audited) 
Total remuneration of Directors for the period was €1,655,395 (2016: €2,232,861). This is the sum of the two 
single figure tables set out above.  
Our Conflict of Interest policy prohibits any other employment (for all employees) on top of the employment 
at Wizz. Therefore in case of the Chief Executive Officer any additional directorship would require specific 
permission of the Chairman of the Board. The Chief Executive Officer is not a member of any other board.

Directors’ shareholdings 
The Chief Executive Officer holds a significant shareholding in the Company through a family trust and is also 
eligible to participate in the Company’s Long-term Incentive Plan. 
Each of the Non-Executive Directors, other than Susan Hooper and Wioletta Roso łowska, is also a Shareholder 
in the Company, following awards made under a historic non-executive share scheme and/or the purchase of 
shares with the relevant Director’s own cash. No new share plan awards have been made since July 2013 or 
will be made in the future under this historic share scheme. 
The Company therefore believes that the interests of the Directors are well aligned with those of the 
Shareholders. Full details of the Directors’ and their connected persons’ interests in the Company’s shares as 
at 31 March 2017 are set out below:

Application of the Remuneration Policy in the 2018 financial year 
a) Chief Executive Officer’s base salary 
The Committee has determined that the CEO’s base salary remains competitive and, therefore, no changes 
are proposed for the 2018 financial year.  
b) Short-term Incentive Plan 
The Chief Executive Officer is eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 200 per cent. of base salary in respect 
of the 2018 financial year. The actual cash bonus received will depend on the achievement of certain 
performance criteria including underlying profit after tax (67 per cent.), on-time performance (11 per cent.), ex-
fuel cost per available seat kilometre (11 per cent.) and personal evaluation (11 per cent.). 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the specified performance criteria are sufficiently challenging 
compared to the Company’s business plan. The annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore 
will be disclosed in the 2018 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year provided that 
they are no longer commercially sensitive.  
c) Long-term Incentive Plan 
An award of performance shares of up to 250 per cent. of base salary will be made to the Chief Executive 
Officer around June 2017 and after the date of this report. Awards will vest following a three-year performance 
period and be subject to the same type of performance criteria as the 2016 award, and details will be confirmed 
after the date of grant.

As outlined in the 2015 financial year annual report, the Non-Executive Directors receive a fee of €25,000 per 
annum, plus €2,500 for each full Board meeting attended. Simon Duffy, as Chairman of the Audit Committee, receives 
an additional fee of €18,750 per annum for taking on that role. Guido Demuynck, as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, receives an additional fee of €12,500 per annum for taking on that role. William A. Franke, as Chairman, 
receives an additional fee of €25,000 per annum for taking on that role. The Non-Executive Directors will also be 
reimbursed for all proper and reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties. 
Other disclosures 
Directors’ service agreement and letters of appointment 
Executive Director 
The Chief Executive Officer entered into a new service agreement with the Geneva branch of Wizz Air Hungary 
Ltd. (WAHL) on 15 December 2015, for a period of five years, subject to earlier termination upon six months’ 
notice by either party. WAHL also has the right to terminate Mr Váradi’s employment with immediate effect 
by payment in lieu of notice. The service agreement contains post-termination restrictive covenants 
preventing Mr Váradi from competing with WAHL or any of its business partners in the EU as well as those 
non-EU countries where WAHL operates, for a period of one year following the termination of his employment. 
Mr Váradi will be paid a sum equal to six months’ base salary if WAHL chooses to enforce these restrictive 
covenants. Upon termination of employment other than for cause, Mr Váradi is entitled to a severance payment 
equal to six months’ salary in addition to any notice pay or payment in lieu of notice. 
Non-Executive Directors 
The Company entered into letters of appointment with each of its Non-Executive Directors on 4 June 2014, which 
became effective on completion of the IPO for a term of three years. Each Non-Executive Director’s appointment 
may be terminated by the Company or the Non-Executive Director with one month’s written notice. Continuation 
of the appointment is contingent on continued satisfactory performance and re-election at the Company’s annual 
general meetings and the appointment will terminate automatically on the termination of the appointment by 
the Shareholders or, where Shareholder approval is required for the appointment to continue, the withholding of 
approval by the Shareholders. Re-appointment will be reviewed annually.  
In accordance with the terms of the letters of appointment, each of the Non-Executive Directors is required to 
allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Each letter of appointment contains 
obligations of confidentiality which have effect both during the appointment and after termination.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 
OUR APPROACH 
 
Wizz Air is the largest low-cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe. That means that we play a large part in 
the lives of many people – whether our customers or our colleagues – as well as being important to the 
communities which we serve. We appreciate and value that position, but that means that we appreciate that 
we must ensure that our business approach not only provides the opportunity to travel to more and more 
people but also takes account of economic, environmental and social developments affecting our communities 
and our people. 
Responsibility for the environment  
Wizz Air believes that our industry has to be responsible for the environments in which we operate. We also 
believe that there are many things that we can do that are not only good for business, but also good for the 
environment. That’s why we are always looking at opportunities to use the latest, innovative technologies that 
not only deliver operational efficiencies but also reduce our environmental footprint. 
Operating the most modern, most efficient aircraft 
One of the cornerstones of Wizz Air business model has always been the operation of the latest technology, 
most efficient aircraft. We currently, as at 31st March 2017, operate a fleet of 79 Airbus A320 and Airbus 
A321ceo aircraft, with an average age of just 4.4 years – one of the youngest in Europe. The Airbus A321ceo, a 
type of which we currently operate 16 with a further 15 to be delivered before the end of 2018, is already today’s 
most efficient single-aisle aircraft. All of our new-delivery aircraft are equipped with sharklets, which deliver an 
average 3.9% in-flight fuel saving compared to standard wing-fence aircraft. However, in 2019, we will receive 
the first of the 110 Airbus A321neo aircraft which we have on order, equipped with next- generation Pratt & 
Whitney PW1100G geared turbofan engines. The technology in these engines is new and disruptive to the 
market and according to manufacturer’s estimates, should deliver the lowest specific fuel consumption in its 
category and a reduction of 15 percent in fuel burn compared to today’s single aisle aircraft, as well as lower 
CO2 emissions and lower noise levels. 
Fuel saving initiatives 
Wizz Air currently has over 60 fuel saving initiatives which are either in the research and development phase 
or are already embedded in our operations, such as cost index optimisation or the use of thrust reversers. 
What’s good for business is good for the environment – less fuel consumed means fewer emissions. 
Contributing to the economy  
Wizz brings the opportunity to travel at the lowest fares to its millions of passengers. Giving affordable access 
to our customers to explore the wider world, or to travel quickly and cheaply to see friends and relatives or to 
develop their careers abroad, improves lives. But more than this, Wizz Air is often the first airline at an airport 
to offer international flights connecting cities throughout Europe. And that, in turn, means more visitors, 
boosting both local tourism as well as business links.  
As a result, Wizz Air does not only provide job opportunities to each of the more than 3,000 aviation 
professionals already working in the Wizz team, but through our continuously developing network and 
operations we support numerous workplaces at our 141 destinations.  
Indeed, based on the research of ACI Europe, every 1 million carried passengers per year supports 750 local 
jobs, meaning that the 24 million passengers we carried in the 2017 financial year Wizz supported over 18,000 
jobs. 
Responsibility for our colleagues and our community  
It may sound a cliché, but we know that at Wizz Air it’s true: our people are the most important element of 
Wizz Air’s success. We support our colleagues with new, outstanding career opportunities in this exciting 
industry. We are immensely proud of the diverse Wizz team and ensure that we engage with and take 
feedback from our colleagues, to increase our already high employee satisfaction rate. For our customers, we 
are continuously developing our services to enhance the WIZZ customer experience.

Responsibility for our colleagues and our community continued 
Wizz promotes an active lifestyle 
Wizz Air, as the largest low-cost airline in Central and Eastern Europe, is proud to promote an active lifestyle. 
Since our very first flight in 2004, Wizz Air has been democratising air travel. Our motto back in 2004 was 
that “Now We Can All Fly” – and we believe that, just as with air travel, an active lifestyle should also be 
available for everyone. That’s why Wizz announced its title sponsorship of the Budapest Half Marathon, Skopje 
Marathon and Kyiv Marathon in 2014 and added the Cluj-Napoca Marathon to its sponsored sports events in 
2016. In April 2017, we announced that we would be sponsoring the Sofia Marathon. The number of participants 
in the events has been continuously increasing, with more and more runners coming from all over the world – 
including an ever increasing number of Wizz colleagues. 
Wizz supports communities 
Wizz knows that the opportunity for more and more people to afford to fly is changing the world for the 
better. But we also know that we can do more to support the communities that we serve! That’s why we 
support charity activities, initiated by our cabin crew, to support their local communities. These activities range 
from helping struggling families in Poland, supporting children’s medical services in Hungary, creating better 
educational conditions in Romania and Latvia or giving presents to orphans in Macedonia.  
The care and attention of our cabin crews is making life better – not just above the clouds!   
Diversity and equal opportunities 
Wizz Air is an equal opportunity employer.  We are committed to treating our potential and current employees fairly, 
regardless of race, gender, age, marital status and anything else not related to our employees’ ability to do their jobs. 
This principle is enshrined in our code of ethics, The Wizz Way. Compliance with The Wizz Way is expected of all 
colleagues in the Wizz team. By way of example, we value diversity and employ more than 3,000 colleagues of 
39 nationalities. 
The male to female ratio is balanced. We currently have 1,838 women and 1,495 men working at Wizz.

Employee relations 
Wizz feedback survey 
Wizz Air is a people business. We know that our people are the backbone of our business and it is their 
dedication, day in, day out, that allows us to deliver our low-cost, quality service. But we know that we cannot 
take our people for granted and that competition for the high quality people whom we seek is keen and may 
become even more so. 
Wizz Air has always valued genuine engagement with employees.  We believe that this engagement is self-
evident in the commitment shown by colleagues day-in, day-out – whether it’s office colleagues going the 
extra mile or the passion for outstanding service of our cabin crew. In May 2016 Wizz Air conducted the Wizz 
Feedback Survey to measure the satisfaction level of its employees and ask for their feedback on the major 
employment topics. The survey confirmed that our colleagues are highly engaged and consider Wizz as an 
employer of choice. 
The general satisfaction of the Wizz team is 85 percent, which is 25 percent higher than the average 
engagement rate measured in Europe and 20 percent higher compared to the global results.

Recruitment and career 
As a fast-growing company Wizz Air is continuously recruiting to find new colleagues passionate about the 
aviation industry, whether they are talents early in their career or experienced professionals with significant 
expertise and successful track records. 
The Company recruits an average of 500 new employees each year. We also pride ourselves on the possibility for 
internal career development for colleagues and the number of promotions within the Company last year once again 
demonstrated that commitment, dedication and hard work are recognised in the best ways possible – career and 
personal development.

Company events 
Wizz Air believes that the engagement of its employees is key to keep on achieving outstanding business 
results. Thus, besides providing motivating tasks and professional challenges daily, the airline puts a great 
emphasis on building a community.  
Some events recently enjoyed by the Wizz team include:  
 A Wizz Christmas party, which was attended by over 1,000 colleagues. 
 Visits by senior management to each of our operating bases, with an opportunity for feedback to be given 
by colleagues. 
 Team building events to develop co-operation within departments and between different functions. 
Running events  
It is an old saying that a healthy body helps a healthy mind, but it’s something that we certainly believe at 
Wizz.  That’s why we encourage our employees to lead a healthy lifestyle – including participating in a number 
of running events sponsored by WIZZ.  These include the Budapest Half Marathon, Kyiv City Marathon and 
Skopje Marathon, and they are also provided with the opportunity of taking part in the Budapest Runway Run 
and Kosice Runway Run, two of the most unusual running events for aviation enthusiasts. 
Representing the Wizz brand 
At Wizz we believe that all of our employees represent the Company, every day. 
That’s why we are delighted that Wizz Air has a strong brand which all members of the Wizz team can be proud 
of. 
However, we also need a team of people who represent the very best of the Wizz spirit. These people are the 
WIZZ Ambassadors. The Wizz Ambassador programme programme was launched in 2011 and currently, 24 
colleagues from cabin operations elected through a public Facebook vote represent Wizz at schools, events, 
press conferences, recruiting trips and more. They represent their base, their country and the Company as the 
face of Wizz.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
The Directors present their report and the audited consolidated financial statements for Wizz Air Holdings plc 
(“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
Results and dividend 
The results for the year are shown on page 76.  
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2016: nil). 
Directors 
The Directors of the Company who were in office during the year and up to the date of signing the financial 
statements are listed below: 
 József Váradi 
 William A. Franke 
 John R. Wilson 
 Stephen L. Johnson 
 John McMahon 
 Thierry de Preux

 Wioletta Rosolowska (appointed with effect from 1 June 2016) 
Going concern 
Wizz Air’s business activities, financial performance and financial position, together with factors likely to affect 
its future development and performance, are described in the Strategic Report on pages 4 to 25. Principal 
risks and uncertainties facing the Group are described on pages 27 to 30. Note 3 to the accounts sets out the 
Group’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and provides details of the risks related 
to financial instruments held by the Group. 
At 31 March 2017, the Group held cash and cash equivalents of €774.0 million while net current assets were 
€434.5 million. Other than convertible debt with a balance of €27.1 million the Group has no significant 
external borrowings. 
The Directors have reviewed financial forecasts including plans to finance future aircraft deliveries. After 
making enquiries, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group is expected to be able to meet its 
commitments and obligations for at least the next twelve months from the date of signing this report. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.  
Viability 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2014), the Directors have assessed 
the prospects and the viability of the Group over a three-year period to March 2020.  The Directors have 
determined that the three-year period was the appropriate period because (i) Wizz Air has a fast expanding 
business which gives less certainty of certain key forecasting assumptions over a longer period; and (ii)  the 
Group’s strategic planning process traditionally covers three years. 
Assessment of prospects 
The Group’s prospects are assessed by management and the Board primarily through the strategic planning 
process. This three-year plan takes into account the current position of the Group, includes the fully detailed 
annual operating plan for the financial year starting (in this case for the year ending March 2018) and then, 
building on it, a sufficiently detailed bottom-up forecast for further two financial years. The Board participates 
fully in the process by aligning the key assumptions and the topline financial targets, reviewing and approving 
the annual operating plan, and reviewing and acknowledging the three-year plan. 
The plan takes into account the existing aircraft order book of the Group that defines a programmed growth 
for several years ahead. Financing of future aircraft deliveries is already secured with lease contracts until the 
end of 2018. The Directors believe that the growth assumptions are justified also from the demand side, as the 
Group continues to execute its core strategy, that is to have lower cost than any of its competitors, and with 
low prices stimulate further demand for its services both in existing and new markets.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED 
Viability continued 
Assessment of viability 
Although the strategic plan reflects management and the Directors’ best estimate of the future prospects of 
the business, they have also tested the resilience of the business to unfavorable deviations of certain key 
variables from the base case scenario.  In defining these scenarios the Directors took into account the principal 
risks that could prevent the Group from delivering on its strategy and financial targets, as summarised on 
pages 27 to 30 in the Strategic Report. 
As part of this assessment, the Directors made the following key assumptions / caveats: 
 there will not be a prolonged grounding of a substantial portion of the aircraft fleet; and 
 with regards to the expected departure of the UK from the European Union, the terms of exit will be such 
that will allow the Group to continue to operate broadly the same network to/from the UK as at present. 
The Directors assessed the potential financial impacts of severe but plausible scenarios that the Group could 
experience. The scenarios included significant increase in jet fuel prices, significant strengthening of the 
US Dollar and weakening of the British Pound to the Euro, decreasing unit revenues, increasing crew costs, 
potential delays in the supply of the new A320neo aircraft family from Airbus, and a combination of these 
factors. While several risks can impact revenues, increased competition in key markets was considered the 
most important risk both in terms of likelihood and potential impact.  
The results of the testing showed that, due to the strong competitive position, operating cash flows and 
existing reserves of the Group, it would be able to withstand the impact of these scenarios over the period of 
the financial forecasts. 
Viability statement 
Based on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2020.  
Disclosure of information to auditors 
The Directors at the date of approval of the financial statements confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and they have taken all the 
steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.  
Independent auditors 
A resolution for the appointment of the auditors of the Company for the financial year ending 31 March 2018 
is to be proposed by the Directors at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Indemnities 
Wizz Air maintains directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. This insurance covers any claim that may be 
brought against the Directors in the exercise of their duties. Wizz Air has also provided customary third-party 
indemnities to its Directors, to the extent permitted under Jersey law. 
Political donation and expenditure 
Wizz Air works constructively with all levels of government across its network, regardless of political affiliation. 
Wizz Air believes in the right of individuals to engage in the democratic process; however, Wizz Air itself does 
not make any political donations and does not incur any political expenditure.  
Capital structure 
As at 31 March 2016, the Company had 57,404,971 Ordinary Shares of £0.0001 each in issue, each with one vote, 
and 44,830,503 Convertible Shares, which do not entitle the holder to voting rights save in very limited 
circumstances. There were no shares held in treasury at that date. The rights and obligations attaching to the 
Company’s shares are set out in the articles of association. Holders of Ordinary Shares have the following rights: 
a) subject to any rights or restrictions as to voting attached to any Ordinary Shares, on a show of hands, each 
Shareholder present in person shall have one vote, and on a poll each Shareholder present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every Ordinary Share of which he is the holder;

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report complies with the Companies Act 2006. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in 
Jersey and the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 36 to 38 confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge: 
 the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and 
 the Strategic Report contained in the annual report includes a fair, balanced and understandable review 
of the position and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF WIZZ 
AIR HOLDINGS PLC 
Report on the group financial statements 
Our opinion 
In our opinion, Wizz Air Holdings plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”): 
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of its profit and cash 
flows for the year then ended; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. 
What we have audited 
The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual Report”), comprise: 
 the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 31 March 2017; 
 the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended; 
 the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended; 
 the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended; and 
 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information. 
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the 
financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law. 
Our audit approach 
Overview 
   
  
  
Materiality 
 Overall group materiality: €12.7 million which represents 5% of profit before 
income tax. 
Audit scope 
 The group financial statements are a consolidation of Wizz Air Holdings plc, 
the trading subsidiaries Wizz Air Hungary Kft, Wizz Tours and a number of 
insignificant intermediate holding, small trading, dormant and ceased 
operation companies. 
 The accounting for these entities and the group consolidation is largely 
centralised in Hungary where the majority of our audit work was performed. 
 Our audit scope comprised an audit of Wizz Air Holdings plc and the complete 
financial information of Wizz Air Hungary Kft, being the significant component. 
Areas of focus 
 Aircraft maintenance provisioning. 
 Hedge and derivative accounting. 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK 
& Ireland)”). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example 
in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events 
that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our 
resources and effort, are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored 
our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, 
and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus continued 
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Aircraft maintenance provisioning 
The group operates aircraft, which are held under 
operating lease arrangements, and incurs liabilities 
for maintenance during the term of the lease. 
Provisions arise from legal and contractual 
obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft 
when it is returned to the lessor. The risk is that with 
the inherent level of management judgement 
required in calculating the amount of provision 
together with the complexity of the calculation of a 
number of variable factors and assumptions, the 
provision may be understated. 
Maintenance provisions of €111.8 million for aircraft 
maintenance costs in respect of operating leased 
aircraft are recorded in the financial statements at 
31 March 2017 (refer to note 29 to the financial 
statements). 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, 
the group is contractually committed to either return 
the aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate 
the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft 
and its major components upon return. 
Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable 
costs of specific future obligations created by the 
lease at the time when such obligation becomes 
certain. This is when the respective aircraft 
component no longer meets the lease re-delivery 
conditions. Commonly there is a warranty period for 
components at the start, during which no obligation 
arises; provisioning only commences after this 
warranty period. 
At each balance sheet date, the calculation of the 
maintenance provision, derived from the maintenance 
provision system (MPS), includes a number of variable 
factors and assumptions including: likely utilisation of 
the aircraft; the expected cost of the heavy 
maintenance check and the time it is expected to 
occur; the condition of the aircraft; and the lifespan of 
life-limited parts. 
The provision booked by Management was 
considered appropriate in the Directors’ view. 
 
We evaluated the integrity of the maintenance 
provision system (MPS) and tested the calculations 
therein. This included assessing the process by 
which the variable factors within the provision were 
estimated, evaluating the reasonableness of the 
assumptions, testing the input data and re-
performing calculations. We found no significant 
issues in the MPS input data or the calculated 
maintenance assets and provisions. The basis for 
these calculations was found to be consistent with 
prior periods and in line with the detailed accounting 
policy set out in Note 2. 
We compared the cost assumptions in the MPS to 
recent invoices, inspected future flight schedules 
and approved maintenance plans as well as 
validated current flight hours and flight cycles to 
non-financial data sources. We found no material 
exceptions from these procedures and estimates. 
We read new or amended aircraft lease contracts and 
validated the updated MPS input data. We found no 
material exceptions from these procedures.

Hedge and derivative accounting 
The group uses derivative financial instruments 
(options) to hedge transaction currency (comprising 
fuel, leasing and maintenance US dollar payments) 
and jet fuel price risks. The risk is that because of their 
materiality to the financial position of the Group and 
the level of manual input in monitoring open, closed 
and settled derivatives and the complexity of the 
requirements in order to apply hedge accounting 
(e.g. timely tailored documentation, including details 
of how hedge effectiveness is monitored both 
prospectively and retrospectively), an error could 
result in a material misstatement to the financial 
statements. 
At 31 March 2017, derivative financial assets 
amounted to €10.1 million and derivative financial 
liabilities were €1.8 million. Further details are set out 
in notes 2, 3 and 20 to the financial statements. 
The Directors’ review concluded that the amounts 
booked at 31 March 2017 are not materially misstated. 
 
 
We evaluated the processes, procedures and 
controls in respect of the group’s treasury and other 
management functions which directly impact the 
relevant account balances and transactions. We 
tested management’s year-end account 
reconciliation process, including cut-off procedures. 
The results of this work allowed us to focus on 
substantiating the year-end positions recorded in the 
financial statements. We independently obtained 
direct confirmations from each of the counterparties 
to test the cut-off at the year end. We found no 
material exceptions from these confirmations. 
We assessed the appropriateness of hedge 
accounting for the derivative financial instruments 
and adequate hedge documentation and 
effectiveness testing was found to be in place. We 
tested, using independent data-feeds, the fair values 
being ascribed to those instruments at the year end 
and noted no significant exceptions. 
We also assessed the appropriateness of the 
disclosures in the financial statements in respect of 
derivative financial instruments. We did not identify 
any significant issues with the measurement or 
presentation of the group’s derivative financial 
instruments. 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.  
The Group has two reporting segments which comprise the airline and tour operator businesses. The airline 
segment consists of  Wizz Air Holdings plc and its trading subsidiary Wizz Air Hungary Kft, which includes 
branch operations in base countries. The Tour reporting segment consists of the Wizz Tours operations which 
sells travel packages to external customers. The airline segment contributes over 98% of profit before income 
tax. Therefore, our audit scope comprised an audit of Wizz Air Holdings plc and the complete financial 
information of Wizz Air Hungary Kft, being the only significant components. The accounting for these entities 
and the group consolidation is centralised in Hungary. 
The audit is performed by a single engagement team comprising individuals based in the UK and in Hungary. 
The operations are audited by applying their collective knowledge and understanding of the Group and its 
financial reporting processes and controls. 
In addition to the standard audit work performed by the engagement team based in Hungary, the UK team 
members visited the Budapest’s management team three times during the audit cycle. These visits involved 
discussing the audit approach, areas of focus and issues arising from our work. The UK team members also 
attended the local clearance meeting in Hungary and all Audit Committee meetings in Switzerland, either in 
person or via telephone call. This gave us the evidence we required for our opinion on the group financial 
statements as a whole.

Our audit approach continued 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds 
for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit 
and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and 
disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as 
a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as 
follows: 
Overall group materiality €12.7 million (2016: €10.1 million). 
How we determined it 5% of profit before income tax. 
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before income tax is the primary measure used 
by shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit 
above €0.6 million (2016: €0.4 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern  
The Directors have complied with provision C.1.3 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) and 
provided a statement in relation to going concern, set out in the Directors’ report. The Directors have 
requested that we review the statement on going concern as if the Company were a UK registered company. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw 
attention to in relation to the directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to.  
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group has 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from 
the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use 
of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
Other required and voluntary reporting 
Consistency of other information  
Opinion on Strategic report and Directors’ report 
The Directors voluntarily prepare a Strategic report and Directors’ report in accordance with the provisions of 
the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The Directors have requested that we express an opinion on the 
consistency of that information with the financial statements in accordance with the United Kingdom 
Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.

The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that 
would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group continued 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability 
of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with 
the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Adequacy of information and explanations received 
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising 
from this responsibility.  
Directors’ remuneration 
The Directors voluntarily prepare a Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of the 
United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. The Directors have requested that we audit the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report specified by the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006. 
Corporate governance statement 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
ten further provisions of the Code. We have nothing to report having performed our review.  
The Corporate Governance Statement includes the information with respect to internal control and risk 
management systems and about share capital structures required by the Disclosure Guidance and 
Transparency Rules sourcebook of the Financial Conduct Authority. The directors have requested that we 
report on the consistency of that information with the financial statements. 
 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 67, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed;  
 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and  
 the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

What an audit of financial statements involves continued 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider 
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing 
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

ACCOUNTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 
NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. General information 
Wizz Air Holdings plc (“the Company”) is a public company incorporated in Jersey under the address 
44 The Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey JE4 9WG. The Company is managed from Switzerland. The Company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group” or “Wizz Air”) provide low-cost, low-fare passenger air 
transportation services on scheduled short-haul and medium-haul point-to-point routes across Europe and 
the Middle East. 
2. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the presentation of these consolidated financial statements are set 
out below.  
Basis of preparation 
These consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries. The consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs” and IFRS IC interpretations). 
Based on the exemption provided in Article 105 (11) of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 the Company does 
not present its individual financial statements and related notes. 
The financial statements are presented in Euros, which is the functional currency of all companies in the Group 
(other than two dormant entities).  
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified 
by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including 
derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.  
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS legislates the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise judgments in the process of applying the 
Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of judgment or complexity or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4. 
New standards and interpretations 
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective and adopted by the Group 
The following new IFRSs and amendments are mandatory for financial periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016 and have therefore been adopted by the Group as of 1 April 2016. 
 Amendment to IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements – accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations.  
 Amendment to IAS 16 and IAS 38, Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets – clarifications 
of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation.  
 Annual improvements to IFRS 2012–2014 cycle – requires disclosure of the judgments made by 
management in aggregating operating segments and clarifies that a reconciliation of segment assets must 
only be disclosed if segment assets are reported. 
 Amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements – disclosure initiative. 
 Amendment to IAS 7, Statement of Cash Flows – disclosure initiative.

2. Accounting policies continued 
New standards and interpretations continued 
b) Standards early adopted by the Group 
There are no standards early adopted by the Group. 
c) Interpretations and standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group 
 IFRS 9, Financial Instruments – addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial 
assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the 
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 
retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement 
categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or expense 
and fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 allows changes in the time value of options to be recognised 
in other comprehensive income, as opposed to the statement of comprehensive income under IAS 39. For 
financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of 
changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through 
profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge 
effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument 
and for the “hedged ratio” to be the same as the one management actually uses for risk management 
purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared 
under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with 
early adoption permitted.  
The Group is adopting IFRS 9 from 1 April 2017. The key impact of the adoption will be that changes in the 
time value of hedges will be recognised in other comprehensive income as opposed to the statement of 
comprehensive income. Changes in the time value of hedges were material in last two financial years and, 
given the volume of hedging activity of the Group, are expected to be material also in the future. However, 
the size and the direction of these changes will depend on changes in market prices; therefore, it is not 
possible to make an estimate for the expected impact. 
 IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers – deals with revenue recognition and establishes 
principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing 
and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is 
recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use 
and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18, Revenue and IAS 11, 
Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted.  
The Group will adopt IFRS 15 from 1 April 2018. Based on the preliminary assessment of management, 
under IFRS 15 some ancillary revenue types will need to be recognised on the date of flight rather than the 
date of sale, as currently, which will result in a one-off reduction of revenues in the range of €6–7 million 
in the year of adoption. 
 IFRS 16, Leases (effective for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019) – addresses 
the classification, measurement and recognition of leases with the objective of ensuring that lessees and 
lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions. The standard supersedes 
IAS 17, Leases and is subject to EU endorsement. 
The Group currently leases all of its aircraft under operating leases; therefore, IFRS 16 brings a very 
significant change for the Group. The standard is not yet endorsed by the EU and therefore only a 
preliminary modelling assessment has been performed by management.

Whether early adoption (from 1 April 2018) will be an option available for the Group will depend on the timing 
of the EU endorsement. In the current modelling, early adoption was not assumed. The assumed date of 
application is 1 April 2019. That is the date required by the standard. 
Existing leases:   
The Group expects that all of its operating leases that will exist at the date of initial application would need to 
be reclassified under the new rules. Considering all variations, the standard allows three methods for 
implementing the new rules for existing leases: 
 a full retrospective approach, as per paragraph C5(a) of the standard; and 
 modified retrospective approaches, as per paragraph C5(b) of the standard, with further variations 
permitted for the determination of the initial amount of the right-of-use asset, as per paragraphs C8(b)(i) 
and C8(b)(ii), respectively.  
These three methods were each modelled, assuming a consistent application to all leases existing at the date 
of initial application (1 April 2019).  
Future aircraft: 
New aircraft scheduled to arrive from the beginning of 2019 are not yet financed. For the purposes of this 
modelling it was assumed that aircraft deliveries in 2019 and beyond will also be financed in the form of 
operating leases and under terms similar to those that the Group most recently entered into. 
Foreign exchange: 
Calculations were performed assuming an EUR/USD FX rate of 1.08 for the date of initial application and not 
assuming any change to this rate during the year of initial application (ending 31 March 2020). 
Incremental rate of borrowing: 
The current incremental rate of borrowing of the Group for aircraft financing is estimated to be 4 per cent, and 
this rate was assumed also in these calculations (in the second and third scenarios) for the date of initial 
application. 
The impact in the year of initial application can be summarised as follows: 
 right-of-use assets would be recognised in the amount of €1.2–1.4 billion at the date of initial application, 
depending on the transition method used. By the end of the year of initial application (31 March 2020) the 
balance would increase to €1.4–1.6 billion; 
 lease liabilities would be recognised in the amount of €1.4–1.5 billion at the date of initial application, 
depending on the transition method used. By the end of the year of initial application the balance would 
increase to €1.7–1.8 billion; 
 retained earnings would be decreased by the range of €100 million maximum – this applies both at the 
date of initial application and at the end of the year of initial application; and 
 the impact on profits for the year of initial application will be a loss ranging between €5-30 million, 
depending on the transition method used. In 2019–2020 the average age of the Group’s fleet 
(approximately five years) will be around half of the average lease tenure of the fleet (approximately ten 
years), which makes the earnings impact for the year of initial application relatively limited (€10 million or 
below) in two of the three transition scenarios.

Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly 
or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken 
into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
The results of all the subsidiaries are consolidated up to 31 March, which is the financial year end of 
the Company. 
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.  
Going concern  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group will 
continue in business for the foreseeable future. This assumption is based on the Directors’ assessment of the 
Group’s financial performance and position to date, together with a review of its forecasts, in light of the risks 
to which the Group is exposed.  
Foreign currency 
The Group’s presentational currency is the Euro. The functional currency of all the Group entities with the 
exception of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Euro. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are translated into functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the statement of financial position date 
are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are recognised at their 
historical cost are translated into Euros at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and which are stated at fair value are translated into 
Euros at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. 
The functional currency of Dnieper Aviation LLC and Wizz Air Ukraine Airlines LLC is the Ukrainian Hryvnia 
(UAH). The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from 
the presentational currency are translated into the presentational currency as follows: 
 assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at 
the date of that statement of financial position; 
 income and expenses for each statement of comprehensive income are translated at monthly average 
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the 
dates of the transactions); and 
 all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity (cumulative 
translation adjustments).  
The below exchange rates were used for the translation of UAH into Euros in the respective financial years: 
   
2017 
  
2016 
Closing rate 28.96 29.69 
Average rate for the year 28.42 29.26

Fair value through profit or loss 
The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management 
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. 
a) Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is 
classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Assets in this 
category are classified as current assets. Derivatives (assets or liabilities) are also categorised as held for 
trading unless they are designated as hedges.  
b) Loans and receivables  
These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the 
statement of financial position date, which are classified as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and 
receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the 
statement of financial position. 
c) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not 
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to 
dispose of the investment within twelve months of the statement of financial position date. Available-for-sale 
financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value. 
d) Other financial liabilities measured at amortised costs  
Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. They are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve 
months after the statement of financial position date that are classified as non-current liabilities. The Group’s 
other financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
(including convertible debt) in the statement of financial position. 
The Group invests excess cash in a conservative way, primarily in short-term time deposits and money market 
funds. Management does not, in the short term, plan to have held-to-maturity investments. The recognition 
and measurement criteria are described in the relevant accounting policy section.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair 
value is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within financial income or 
expenses. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss 
depends on the nature of the item being hedged (see below). The Group enters into foreign exchange and jet 
fuel price hedging transactions to minimise the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fuel price 
on the Group. Both types of hedging transactions are cash flow hedges under IAS 39. 
Cash flow hedges 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised 
asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any unrealised gain or loss on 
the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve within other comprehensive 
income. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive 
income as financial income or expenses. 
The associated cumulative gain or loss on the effective part is removed from other comprehensive income 
and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the respective operating expense line(s) in the 
same period or periods as the hedged forecast transaction. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast 
transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in other comprehensive 
income and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the hedged transaction is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the 
cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income immediately, net of tax, within the cash flow hedging reserve. 
Before expiry, the fair value of an option comprises: i) its intrinsic value, being a function of the difference 
between contracted and market (or spot) prices; and ii) its time value, being the difference between the fair 
value and the intrinsic value at any point in time. Subject to hedge effectiveness, any increase or decrease in 
the intrinsic value of the hedging instrument is taken to equity within other comprehensive income or expense. 
However, any increase or decrease in the time value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in 
the statement of comprehensive income as financial income or expense. This reflects the fact that variations 
in the time value of an option are required to be excluded from the hedge relationship in accordance with IAS 
39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. 
Accordingly:  
 Initial recognition: the open position on the derivative hedging instrument is recorded as an asset or 
liability in the statement of financial position at fair value.  
 Subsequent remeasurement of unexpired options: (i) the effective portion of changes in the intrinsic 
element of the fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income, (ii) changes in the time value element 
of the fair value, or the ineffective portion, if any, are recorded as financial income or expense in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 The realised gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recorded against the respective operating 
expense line(s) in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The ineffective portion is determined in line with IAS 39, applying the 80–125 per cent. rule. The ineffective 
part of changes in fair value, if any, is recorded as financial income or expense in the statement of 
comprehensive income.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued 
Hedging with non-derivatives 
The Group uses its selected financial assets denominated in US Dollars to hedge highly probable future 
expenses in US Dollar. The Group applies hedge accounting to part of its non-derivate financial assets, in the 
interest of reducing the amount of unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the periodic 
revaluation of these assets.  
The accounting treatment of non-derivatives designated as hedging instruments is identical to cash flow 
hedges with derivatives, that is: 
 the unrealised gains or losses on hedging instruments are recorded as an asset or liability in the statement 
of financial position at fair value, and the effective portion of changes in the fair value is recorded in other 
comprehensive income; and 
 the realised gains or losses on the hedging instruments are recorded against the respective expense line(s) 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less 
impairment losses. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the trade and other receivables account, and the amount 
of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within other expenses. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against other expenses in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Other receivables also comprise insurance claims related to events that are covered by insurance contracts. 
The Group recognises the income in the financial statements only from those insurance claims which, based 
on management’s judgment, are virtually certain to be received by the Group. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits repayable on demand or which mature 
within three months of inception, less any overdrafts repayable on demand. Cash held in money market funds 
is also included in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents do not include restricted cash. Cash 
and cash equivalents are netted only when right of offset has been obtained. 
Restricted cash 
Restricted cash represents cash deposits held by the banks that cover letters of credit, issued by the same 
bank, to certain suppliers. Restricted cash is split between non-current and current assets depending on the 
maturity period of the underlying letters of credit. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Trade and 
other payables comprise balances payable to suppliers, authorities and employees. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference 
between cost and redemption value being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a financial 
expense over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Financial expenses also include 
withholding tax paid on the interest if according to the loan agreement the payment of withholding tax is the 
liability of the Group. 
Convertible debt 
Convertible debt instruments that can be converted to share capital at the option of the holder, where the 
number of shares issued does not vary with changes in their fair value, are accounted for as compound 
instruments. Transaction costs that relate to the issue of a compound instrument are allocated to the liability 
and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds. The liability component is recognised 
initially at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option. The equity 
component of the compound instrument is calculated as the excess of the issue proceeds over the value of 
the liability component.

Classification of compound instruments issued by the Group 
Compound instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of Shareholders’ funds) 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash 
or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under 
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and  
b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a 
non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity 
instruments or it is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or 
other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where 
the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these 
financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to 
those shares.  
Where a compound instrument that contains both equity and financial liability components exists these 
components are separated by recognising the liability at fair value and accounted for individually under the 
above policy. The finance cost on the financial liability component is correspondingly higher over the life of 
the instrument. 
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance 
payments associated with compound instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded 
directly in equity. 
Impairment of financial assets 
Impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective 
evidence that a loss has been incurred. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective 
interest rate. 
If, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event that occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed. 
Both impairment losses and reversals are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as 
components of financial income or expenses, except in the case of impairment of available-for-sale financial 
assets where the impairment and its reversal may be charged to other comprehensive income under 
certain circumstances. 
Current trade and other receivables are discounted where the effect is material.  
Non-financial assets and liabilities 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write off cost to 
residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of each part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment. In the case of certain aircraft maintenance assets, the useful economic life of the asset can be 
defined in terms of flight hours or flight cycles, and in this case the depreciation charge is determined based 
on the actual number of flight hours or flight cycles. The estimated useful lives of the relevant asset categories 
are as follows: 
Land and buildings three to five years, being the shorter of useful economic life  
and the lease term 
Aircraft maintenance assets two to seven years, being the shorter of useful economic life  
and the lease term 
Aircraft parts seven years 
Fixtures and fittings three years 
The residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually.

Assets received free of charge 
In certain cases the Group receives assets free of charge. These are treated as non-cash items in the statement 
of cash flows. 
Advances paid for aircraft – pre-delivery payments (PDP) 
Pre-delivery payments (PDP) are paid by the Group to aircraft and engine manufacturers for financing the 
production of the ordered aircraft or spare engine as determined by the contractual terms. Such advance 
payments for aircraft or spare engines are recognised at cost and classified as property, plant and equipment 
in the statement of financial position. The amount is not depreciated.  
The Group may enter into sale and leaseback arrangements with lessors to finance future aircraft or spare 
engine deliveries. These arrangements are structured such that the right and the commitment to purchase the 
aircraft or spare engine are assigned to the lessor only on the date of delivery (a “delivery date assignment”); 
as such, the recognition and classification of the PDP balance does not change when the sale and leaseback 
contracts are signed. On the delivery of the aircraft or spare engine the lessor pays the full purchase price of 
the asset to the manufacturer and the Group receives from the manufacturer a refund of the PDPs paid. At 
this moment the fixed asset is de-recognised from the statement of financial position and any gain or loss 
arising is transferred to the statement of comprehensive income as an operating income or expense. 
In some instances PDPs are paid – in the name of the Group – by the lessors directly to the aircraft 
manufacturer. These PDPs are also recognised by the Group in the statement of financial position as advances 
paid for aircraft and as received loans until the delivery of the aircraft. In the statement of cash flows these 
PDPs and loans are treated as non-cash items and are eliminated both from advances paid for aircrafts/refunds 
of advances paid for aircraft and commercial loan lines. 
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets – engine fleet our agreements (FHA) 
Advances paid for aircraft maintenance assets represent advance payments made in relation to heavy 
maintenance scheduled to be performed in the future (for the definition of heavy maintenance see the 
accounting policy section on maintenance). Such advance payments are made by the Group particularly to the 
engine maintenance service provider under fleet hour agreements (FHA). The balance of such assets is 
re-categorised into aircraft maintenance assets at the time when the aircraft maintenance asset is recognised 
in respect of the same component and the same heavy maintenance event. This is when the component no 
longer meets the conditions set out in the lease agreement. Advances paid for aircraft maintenance are 
not depreciated. 
In the statement of cash flows the FHA payments are shown under the purchase of maintenance assets line 
together with other aircraft maintenance asset purchases.  
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.  
Web development costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to generate future economic benefits 
and meet the other criteria described in IAS 38, Intangible Assets. 
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future 
economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed 
as incurred. 
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful economic lives of intangible assets. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for 
use. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Software licences     three to eight years  
Web and other software development costs  three to five years 
Inventories 
Inventories (mainly spares) are purchased for internal use and are stated at cost unless impaired or at net 
realisable value if any items are to be sold or scrapped. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of the business less the estimated selling expense. Cost is based on the average price method 
and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and 
condition.

Emissions Trading Scheme 
As of 1 January 2012 the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2008/101/EC (EU ETS) covers airlines. 
The Group is required to formally report its annual emissions to the relevant authorities and surrender emission 
allowances (EUAs) equivalent to the emissions made during the year. Surrendered allowances are a 
combination of the free allowances granted by the authorities and allowances purchased by the Group from 
other parties. The Group follows the “cost method” of booking the allowances: the free allowances have nil-
cost value so therefore are not recognised as an asset; and allowances purchased in the market are recorded 
at the purchase price in inventory. The Group is given free allowances by the competent authorities, and the 
net economic impact to the Group is therefore represented by the shortfall between the actual carbon emitted 
and the free allowances given to the Group for that period. The shortfall is recorded at forward prices as a cost. 
Application of this accounting treatment means that the statement of comprehensive income and the 
statement of financial position reflect the net economic impact and are not grossed up to reflect the 
full obligation.  
Deferred interest 
The Group enters into sale and leaseback agreements to finance future aircraft or spare engine deliveries. In 
some cases it also enters into arrangements to finance the PDPs of such deliveries. Interest accrued on loans 
to finance the PDPs on aircraft or spare engines is initially recognised under property plant and equipment 
(advances paid for aircraft). When the leased aircraft or spare engine is delivered, the PDP interest balance is 
reclassified within the statement of financial position from property, plant and equipment into deferred 
interest. From this point forward the interest is amortised to the statement of comprehensive income during 
the term of the respective lease contract.  
The Group recognises in the deferred interest line also the effect of the discounting adjustment of 
non-current receivables.  
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and 
value in use. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating 
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
Employee benefits 
Share based payment transactions 
The Group operates an equity-settled share option programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares 
in the Company. The options are granted by the Company. The fair value of options granted is recognised as 
an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair 
value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and 
conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted at any 
measurement date so that the cumulative expense to date reflects the actual number of share options that are 
expected to vest.  
The share award programme allows the Directors of the Company to acquire shares in the Company at nominal 
value. The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding 
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which there are 
restrictions in place in respect of the transfer of the award shares by the Directors. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will 
be required to settle the obligation.  
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks 
specific to the liability (please see further details of aircraft maintenance provisions in the accounting policy 
section on maintenance).

Revenue 
Revenue comprises the invoiced value of flight seats and ancillary revenues.  
Passenger ticket revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and is recognised net of government taxes in the 
period in which the service is provided, that being when the airplane has departed. Where charges levied by 
airports or government authorities on a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance, 
then such amounts are presented on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income (netted between 
revenue and airport, handling and en-route charges lines). Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not 
yet flown and is included in deferred income. Refunds made to passengers are recorded as reductions in revenue.  
Ancillary revenue arises from the sale of other services made by the Group and from commissions earned in 
relation to services sold on behalf of other parties. Revenues from other services comprise mainly baggage 
charges, booking/payment handling fees, airport check-in fees, fees for various convenience services (priority 
boarding, extended legroom and reserved seats), loyalty programme membership fees, and hotel and other 
services sold by the tour operator unit of the Group. Commission revenue arises in relation to the sale of on-
board catering, accommodation, car rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded 
credit cards. Ancillary revenues are recognised as revenue on the date that the right to receive consideration 
occurs, which is the date when the underlying service was provided. This, depending on the type of service, 
might be either the date of sale, the date of flight or (in the case of membership fees) over the period when 
customers take benefit of a paid membership. 
Leases 
Finance leases 
If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are substantially transferred to Wizz Air then it is 
accounted for as a finance lease. The following five criteria can indicate such situation: 
 there is transfer of ownership of the asset at the end of lease term;  
 there is option to purchase the asset at sufficiently below fair value; therefore, it is reasonably certain that 
the option will be exercised;  
 the lessee holds the assets for the major part of the assets' economic life;  
 the asset is so special that it can be used only by the lessee; and 
 the present value of minimum lease payments is substantially all of the fair value of the asset. 
Management uses the above criteria as guidelines for its analyses; however, the substance of a transaction is 
always considered during the assessment. 
Management assesses each leasing contract individually at initial recognition based on the above discussed criteria.  
Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset 
and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Operating leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an integral part of the total lease expense.  
Sale and leaseback transactions 
The Group enters into transactions whereby it assigns to a third party the right to acquire new aircraft or spare 
engines. On delivery of the aircraft or spare engine, the Group will lease the aircraft or spare engine back 
through an operating lease from the same party. Any gain arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft 
is sold for is above fair value, is recognised initially in deferred income and then amortised on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term of the asset. 
Maintenance 
Aircraft maintenance provisions 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, the Group is contractually committed to either return the 
aircraft in a certain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the aircraft and its major 
components upon return. Provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of specific future obligations 
created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain. This is when the respective aircraft 
component no longer meets the lease re-delivery conditions. The provision is used through the completion of a 
maintenance event such that the component again meets the re-delivery conditions.

Maintenance continued 
Aircraft maintenance assets 
Heavy maintenance relates to the overhaul of engines and associated components, the replacement of life 
limited parts, the replacement of landing gears and the non-routine airframe inspection and rectification works. 
Under normal operating conditions heavy maintenance relates to work expected to be performed no more 
frequently than every two to four years.  
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset (and classified as “aircraft 
maintenance assets”) at the earlier of: (a) the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met (see above 
under aircraft maintenance provisions); or (b) when maintenance, including enhancement, is carried out. Other 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  
Such maintenance assets are depreciated over the period the Group benefits from the asset which is the 
shorter of: (a) the estimated period until the next date when the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met; 
or (b) the end of the asset’s operational life; or (c) the end of the lease.  
For engines and associated components, depreciation is charged on the basis of flight hours or cycles, while 
for other aircraft maintenance assets depreciation is charged evenly over the period the Group expects to 
derive benefit from the asset.  
Components of newly leased aircraft such as life limited parts and engines are not accounted for as separate 
assets, and the inherent benefit of these assets which are utilised in the period from inception of the lease until 
the time the assets no longer meet the lease re-delivery condition is reflected in the payments made to the 
lessor over the life of the lease.  
Aircraft maintenance assets are non-monetary items. Non-Euro amounts are translated on inception to Euro 
and are not retranslated. 
The recognition of aircraft maintenance assets against provisions for other liabilities and charges in the 
statement of financial position is a transaction not involving cash flows. In the statement of cash flows the 
spending on these assets is presented as “purchase of aircraft maintenance assets” in the period when cash 
actually flows out of the Group. This can happen either before or after the recognition of the asset, depending 
on the exact facts and circumstances associated with the relevant asset or assets. 
Please refer also to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies. 
Other receivables from lessors – maintenance reserve 
Payments for aircraft and engine maintenance, as stipulated in the respective operating lease agreements, are 
made to the lessors as a security for the performance of future heavy maintenance works. The payments are 
recorded as receivables from the lessors until the respective maintenance event occurs and the reimbursement 
with the lessor is finalised. Any payment that is not expected to be reimbursed by the lessor is recognised 
within operating expenses (aircraft rentals) in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Other 
The Group enters into agreements with maintenance service providers that guarantee the maintenance of 
major components at a rate defined in the contract, the prime example being fleet hour agreements (FHAs) 
for aircraft engines. Such FHAs cover the cost of both scheduled and unscheduled engine overhauls. FHA 
payments are accounted for as follows: 
 Payments for scheduled maintenance work are recognised as advances paid for aircraft maintenance 
assets until the maintenance asset for the respective engine overhaul is created. After this point any further 
FHA payments are either used to settle previously established aircraft maintenance provisions (to the 
extent a provision for the respective FHA contract exists) or, in the absence of a provision, are added to 
the amount previously capitalised within property, plant and equipment as advances paid for aircraft 
maintenance assets. 
 Payments that are made to provide guaranteed coverage for the performance of unscheduled 
maintenance events are considered as insurance payments and are expensed as incurred.  
Please refer to the property, plant and equipment section of accounting policies.

Supplier credits 
The Group receives certain assets (cash contributions or aircraft spares) for nil consideration in connection 
with its acquisition of aircraft and of major aircraft parts.  
Cash contributions or aircraft spares received are recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. 
The corresponding credits are recognised as income, spread equally across the shorter of useful economic life 
and the lease term of the respective aircraft.  
In certain cases the concessions receivable from a component manufacturer are linked to the Group’s 
commitment to purchase a number of new aircraft with the manufacturer’s components installed on those. In 
such case, in substance, the right to the concessions is earned by the Group through the delivery of the 
respective aircraft. In certain cases the concessions might be delivered by the component manufacturer later 
than the date when the respective aircraft is taken by the Group. If so, then the right earned for the concession 
is recognised at the date of the aircraft delivery as part of trade and other receivables, with a corresponding 
credit to deferred income. Following this, the credits are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
of the respective asset, decreasing aircraft rental expenses. 
Net financing costs 
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, interest receivable on funds 
invested and foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the 
effective interest method. 
Non-cash elements of financial income and expenses are eliminated from the statement of cash flows as an 
adjusting item whereas cash elements, e.g. realised foreign exchange gains and losses, are included in the 
statement of cash flows. 
Share capital 
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Qualifying transaction costs directly attributable to the issuing of new 
shares are debited to equity, reducing the share premium arising on the issue of shares.  
Taxation 
Taxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the 
statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised.

Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense 
that are shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.  
Underlying profit after tax is a non-statutory profit measure introduced by the Company to help investors 
better understand the trading performance of the Group. It is a measure used by the Company also in 
determining the variable remuneration of senior management (see Short-term Incentive Plan or annual bonus 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report). Underlying profit excludes the effect of exceptional items and of 
unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses. These items, for various reasons, had significant impact 
particularly during the 2015-2017 financial years. Going forward the Company expects that it will not incur 
exceptional items of recurring nature so there would be no difference between IFRS and underlying earnings. 
Segment reporting 
Operating and reportable segments 
The Group has two reportable segments: the airline and the tour operator business units, marketed under the 
Wizz Air and Wizz Tours brand names, respectively. Wizz Air sells flight tickets and related services to external 
customers and, to a smaller extent, to Wizz Tours. Wizz Tours sells travel packages to external customers 
covering the network of Wizz Air. 
Management information is provided to the senior management team, which (in the context of IFRS 8 
‘Operating segments’) is the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). Resource allocation decisions 
are made by the CODM for the benefit of the route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within 
the network. The performance of the network is assessed primarily based on the operating profit or loss for 
the period. 
3. Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors 
The Group is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency 
exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Wizz Air is to minimise the impact of commodity 
price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's earnings, cash flows and equity. To 
manage commodity and foreign exchange risks, Wizz Air uses various derivative financial instruments, 
including foreign currency and commodity zero-cost collar contracts.  
Risk management is carried out by the treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific 
areas, such as foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, 
adherence to hedge accounting, and hedge coverage levels. The Board has mandated the Audit Committee 
of the Board to supervise the hedging activity of the Group and the compliance with the policies approved by 
the Board. 
Risk analysis 
Market risks 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and commitments that are denominated in 
a currency other than the Euro. The foreign currency exposure of the Group is significant for two reasons: (i) 
only a small portion of the Group’s revenues are denominated in or linked to the US Dollar while a significant 
portion of the Group’s expenses are US Dollar denominated, including fuel, aircraft leases, maintenance 
reserves and aviation insurance; and (ii) there are various currencies in which the Group has significantly more 
revenues than expenses, primarily the British Pound (GBP) and – to a smaller extent - the Polish Zloty (PLN). 
The Group chooses the Euro/USD foreign currency rate as the major underlying foreign currency pair in its 
foreign currency rate hedging strategies. The main objective is to cover the Group’s ongoing US Dollar cash flow 
requirements. The Group’s maximum hedge coverage level is 85 per cent. of the total anticipated US Dollar 
purchases hedged by the time the respective quarter on a monthly rolling forward basis is reached. This 
maximum target hedge coverage level was 75 per cent. until January 2017 when it was increased to 85 per cent. 
as a result of the revision of the Group’s Hedging Policy in January 2017. These levels were not always reached 
during the current or prior years. 
The new Hedging Policy defines also the hedging of the GBP/Euro foreign currency rate exposure, as a new 
measure of risk management. The Group’s maximum target coverage on this currency pair is 60% on a rolling 
twelve-month basis, but no transaction was made until 31 March 2017.

As explained in the paragraph on foreign currency in the accounting policy, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies (that is currencies other than the Euro) are translated into Euros at the 
statement of financial position date at the exchange rates ruling at that date, and foreign exchange differences 
arising on the translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as financial income of 
expense. If the net balance of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies is high then 
this translation process can result in material volatility to financial income and expense, and thus to earnings.  
Historically the Group had a high balance of net monetary assets denominated in US Dollars and this resulted 
in significant unrealised foreign exchange gains (as in 2015) and losses (as in 2016). By the end of the 2016 
financial year the US Dollar monetary asset-liability position of the Group became materially balanced; 
therefore, starting from financial year 2017 there are no material foreign exchange gains or losses incurred by 
the Group. This balanced position is not visible from the table above that shows a net asset balance of US 
Dollar denominated financial instruments of €111.9 million in 2017. The two positions can be reconciled as 
follows: 
 the 2017 balance of trade and other receivables denominated in US Dollars includes €22.1 million that has 
been designated for hedge accounting and therefore its foreign currency revaluation is not impacting 
financial income or expenses – see under ‘foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives’ later in this Note 
3; and 
 at 31 March 2017 the Group had provisions of €84.5 million denominated in US Dollars (as part of the total 
€113.7 million balance reported in Note 29). Provisions are not financial instruments and therefore their 
balance is not included in the table above but are subject to foreign currency revaluation.

Risk analysis continued 
Market risks continued 
Interest rate risk 
The Group has future commitments under certain operating lease contracts that are based on floating interest 
rates. The floating nature of the interest charges on the operating leases exposes the Group to interest rate risk. 
Interest rates charged on convertible debt liabilities and on short and long-term loans to finance the deposits of 
aircraft are not sensitive to interest rate movements as they are fixed until maturity. See Notes 23 and 24.  
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the valuation of financial instruments as they are 
carried at fair value.  
The Group has not used financial derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk during the year. The Directors may 
in the future consider hedging interest rate risk to reduce the potential Group earnings volatility arising from 
fluctuations in interest rates. 
Commodity risks 
One of the most significant costs for the Group is jet fuel. The price of jet fuel can be volatile and can directly impact 
the Group’s financial performance. The Group’s maximum hedge coverage is 70 per cent. on a rolling twelve-month 
basis and 60 per cent. on a rolling 18-month basis.  These represent 10 percentage point increase versus earlier levels 
as a result of the revision of the Group’s Hedging Policy in January 2017. The average hedge coverage in F17 was 51 
per cent. and 38 per cent. respectively. 
Hedge transactions during the periods 
The Group uses non-derivatives and zero-cost collar instruments to hedge its foreign exchange exposures and uses 
zero-cost collar and outright cap instruments to hedge its jet fuel exposures. The time horizon of the hedging 
programme with derivatives is usually up to a maximum of 18 months; however, this horizon can be exceeded at the 
Board’s discretion. The volume of hedge transactions that expired during the periods was as follows: 
a) Foreign exchange hedge (USD versus EUR): 
US$333.5 million (2016: US$339.0 million).  
b) Fuel hedge: 
475,000 metric tons (2016: 439,500 metric tons). 
Hedge year-end open positions 
At the end of the year and the prior year the Group had the following open hedge positions: 
a) Foreign exchange hedge with derivatives: 
The fair value of the open positions was a €5.8 million gain (2016: €4.8 million) recognised within other 
comprehensive income, current assets or current liabilities, respectively.  
The notional amount of the open positions was US$297 million (2016: US$313.5 million). 
b) Foreign exchange hedge with non-derivatives: 
The notional amount of the open positions was US$238.5 million (2016: US$190.5 million). 
Non-derivatives are existing financial assets that hedge highly probable foreign currency cash flows in the 
future and therefore act as a natural hedge. At the end of the year out of its non-derivative financial assets 
position the Group had US$23.6 million designated for hedge accounting (2016: US$34.5 million). The rest 
of the open positions relate to expected PDP refunds (2017: US$214.9 million; 2016: US$156.0 million) for 
which no hedge accounting is applied. 
c) Fuel hedge: 
The fair value of the open positions was a €2.5 million gain (2016: €11.4 million loss) recognised within 
other comprehensive income and current assets or liabilities, respectively.  
The notional amount of the open positions was 598,000 metric tons (2016: 449,000 metric tons). 
In relation to these open hedge positions the cash flows will occur and the hedge relationships will impact the 
statement of comprehensive income during the year ending 31 March 2018. 
Hedge effectiveness 
During the year covered by these financial statements, based on the evaluation of the Group, the hedging 
transactions did not give rise to material ineffectiveness under IAS 39. As explained below in the credit risk 
section, in the opinion of the management none of the hedge counterparties had a material change in their 
credit status that would have influenced the effectiveness of the hedging transactions.

The interest rate sensitivity calculation considers the effects of varying interest rates on the interest income 
on bank deposits and on the expense from floating lease rentals. 
The impact of these macro-economic variables on equity is the same as the impact on profit after tax, except 
for the fuel price and for the USD/EUR FX rate variables where the equity impact would also include the 
change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are open at the year end. The fair value of 
these instruments was provided by the hedge counterparties and management has not calculated the 
theoretical value of these instruments for other scenarios. 
Liquidity risks 
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding. The Group has an 
adequate liquidity position. In previous years, the Group invested excess cash (EUR) in a conservative way, primarily 
in AAA-rated money market funds and also in short-term time deposits with high quality bank counterparties. In F17, 
as EUR yields went deeper into negative territory, management – supported by the Board – decided to withdraw all 
funds from money market funds and placed it in plain vanilla deposit structures with various counterparties.  
The table below analyses the Group’s financial assets and liabilities (receivable or payable either on cash base 
or net-settled derivative financial assets and liabilities) into relevant maturity groupings based on the 
remaining period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. 
The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows except for derivatives 
where fair values are presented. Therefore, for certain asset and liability categories the amounts presented in 
this table can be different from the respective amounts presented in the statement of financial position.

The Group has obligations under financial guarantee contracts as detailed in Note 31.  
The Company provided guarantees to third parties to guarantee the performance of its airline subsidiary in 
relation to aircraft lease contracts on a regular basis, and from 2017 also in relation to a contract for the 
provision of public services in Hungary. These possible obligations are disclosed in the table above, with the 
shortest maturity under the financial guarantees line. Management does not expect that any payment under 
these guarantee contracts will be required by the Company.  
Other financial guarantee contracts relate to hedging, and convertible notes. The respective liabilities are 
reflected under the appropriate line of the financial liabilities part of the table above. Since the liability itself is 
already reflected in the table, it would not be appropriate to include also the financial guarantee provided by 
another Group entity for the same obligation. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk from individual customers is limited as the large majority of the payments 
for flight tickets are collected before the service is provided.  
However, the Group has significant banking, hedging, aircraft manufacturer and card acquiring relationships 
that represent counterparty credit risk. The Group analysed the creditworthiness of the relevant business 
partners in order to assess the likelihood of non-performance of liabilities due to the Group. The credit quality 
of the Group’s financial assets is assessed by reference to external credit ratings (published by Standard & 
Poor’s or similar institutions) of the counterparties as follows:

The “Other” column in 2017 includes €52.2 million balance (out of which €50.0 million is bank deposit) with 
one of the banking partners of the Group, that has BBB rating.  
The analysis demonstrates the shift in the Group’s cash management strategy from money-market funds 
(MMF) towards bank deposits during the 2017 financial year. While at the beginning of the year most of Group’s 
free cash was held in AAA-rated MMFs, by the end of the year due to pressures in the yield-environment these 
funds were fully moved into bank deposits, most of these being A-rated.  
From the unrated category within trade and other receivables the Group has €110.3 million (2016: €97.3 million) 
receivables from different aircraft lessors in respect of maintenance reserves and lease security deposits paid 
(see also Note 18). However, given that the Group physically possesses the aircraft owned by the lessors and 
that the Group has significant future lease payment obligations towards the same lessors (see Note 32), 
management does not consider the credit risk on maintenance reserve receivables to be material. 
Based on the information above management does not consider the counterparty risk of either party being 
material and therefore no fair value adjustment was applied to the respective cash or receivable balances. 
Fair value estimation 
The Group classifies its financial instruments based on the technique used for determining fair value into the 
following categories: 
Level 1: Fair value is determined based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities. 
Level 2: Fair value is determined based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Level 3: Fair value is determined based on inputs that are not based on observable market data (that is, on 
unobservable inputs).  
The following table presents the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 
31 March 2017. 
 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total

Financial assets available for sale represents a unit-linked insurance invested in government bonds by the 
insurer. These government bonds are traded in an active market; therefore, it falls into the Level 1 category. 
The Group measures its derivative financial instruments at fair value, calculated with a technique by the banks 
involved in the hedging transactions that falls into the Level 2 category. 
All the other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. 
Capital risk management  
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for Shareholders, to provide benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain 
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.  
The capital structure of the Group consists of financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and equity. Financial 
liabilities primarily consist of commercial loans relating to aircraft financing and convertible debt as disclosed 
in Notes 23 and 24 respectively. Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed 
in the statement of changes in equity. Since the financial year beginning on 1 April 2007, the Group’s growth 
has been financed entirely out of cash from operations and commercial debt with financial institutions. The 
overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from prior years.  
Management reviews the Group’s cost of capital on an ongoing basis as well as the risks associated with each 
capital instrument and makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

4. Critical accounting estimates and judgments made in applying the Group’s accounting policies  
a) Maintenance policy 
For aircraft held under operating lease agreements, provision is made for the minimum unavoidable costs of 
specific future obligations created by the lease at the time when such obligation becomes certain. The amount 
of the provision involves making estimates of the cost of the heavy maintenance work that is required to 
discharge the obligation, including any end of lease costs.  
The cost of heavy maintenance is capitalised and recognised as a tangible fixed asset (and classified as an 
“aircraft maintenance asset”) at the earlier of: (a) the time the lease re-delivery condition is no longer met; or 
(b) when maintenance, including enhancement, is carried out. The calculation of the depreciation charge on 
such assets involves making estimates for the future utilisation of the aircraft and in the case of engines also 
of the future operating conditions of the engine. 
b) Hedge and derivative accounting 
Fair value of derivatives (namely the open position of cash flow hedges) is determined by the contracting 
financial institutions as per their industry practice. As required, the fair values ascribed to those instruments are 
verified also by management using high-level models. Further, the effectiveness of hedges is tested both 
prospectively and retrospectively to determine the appropriate accounting treatment of hedge gains and losses. 
c) Net presentation of government taxes and other similar levies 
The Group’s accounting policy stipulates that where charges levied by airports or government authorities on 
a per passenger basis represent a government tax in fact or in substance, then such amounts are presented 
on a net basis in the statement of comprehensive income (netted between the revenue and the airport, 
handling and en-route charges lines).  
Management reviews all passenger-based charges levied by airports and government authorities to ensure 
that any amounts recovered from passengers in respect of these charges are appropriately classified within 
the statement of comprehensive income. Given the variability of these charges and the number of airports and 
jurisdictions within which the Group operates, the assessment of whether these items constitute taxes in nature 
is an inherently complex area, requiring a level of judgment. 
d) Accounting for membership fees 
The Group operates the Wizz Discount Club (WDC) loyalty program for its customers. Under this program 
customers can pay an annual membership fee, with the key benefit that during most of the twelve-month 
membership period they get access to special fares that are lower than the standard ticket prices.   
The Group recognises the revenue from the membership fees following the pattern of customers taking 
benefits from the program. This pattern is determined by management once a year, on the basis of the actual 
distribution of member flights in the preceding twelve months, and then applied prospectively. It is unlikely 
that there would be a material change in the pattern within one year, because the underlying fact patterns (for 
customers to buy membership, to buy tickets and then to fly those tickets) are reasonably stable. 
The WDC program was introduced by the Group in 2012 and had insignificant impact initially. Management 
used to recognise membership revenues on a straight-line basis in the twelve-month membership period. In 
the last few years the number of members and thus also the level of membership revenues picked up, and it 
also became visible that the actual pattern how customers take the membership benefits is significantly 
different from the straight-line method. Therefore, starting from 2017 management started to apply a revenue 
recognition pattern matching the historic pattern of how customers were taking the benefits of the program. 
This change in estimates, combined with some other changes related to this area, resulted in €7.9 million 
additional revenue for 2017.

5. Segment information 
Reportable segment information 
The ‘chief operating decision maker’ (CODM) of the Group, as defined in IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ is the 
senior management team of the Group. 
The Group has two reportable segments: the airline and the tour operator business units, marketed under the 
Wizz Air and Wizz Tours brand names, respectively. Wizz Air sells flight tickets and related services to external 
customers and, to a smaller extent, to Wizz Tours. Wizz Tours sells travel packages to external customers 
covering the network of Wizz Air.  
The Group classified the tour operator business as a separate reportable segment starting from 1 April 2016. 
The Wizz Tours brand was launched already in 2013 but initially the travel packages were sold by a third-party 
tour operator partner. During this period the financial impact of the tour operator activity was insignificant. 
The Group started its own tour operator activity in October 2015. Therefore, no comparative information is 
reported for the prior period.

Financial income, financial expenses, depreciation and amortisation, and income tax expenses reported for the 
Group in the period are all related to the airline business, except for an aggregate of €54,000 of financial 
expenses and income tax expense incurred by the tour operator business, which explains the €0.1 million 
difference between operating loss and loss after tax in the table. There were no material non-cash items in the 
period for the tour operator business. 
Entity-wide disclosures 
Products and services 
Revenue from external customers can be analysed by groups of similar services as follows: 
  2017 2016 
 € million € million 
Airline passenger ticket revenue 909.3 894.9 
Airline ancillary revenue 643.9 534.2 
Tour operator package revenue 18.1 - 
Total revenue from external customers 1,571.2 1,429.1 
Airline ancillary revenues arise mainly from baggage charges, booking/payment handling fees, airport check-
in fees, fees for various convenience services (priority boarding, extended legroom and reserved seats), loyalty 
programme membership fees, and from commission on the sale of on-board catering, accommodation, car 
rental, travel insurance, bus transfers, premium calls and co-branded cards, all directly attributable to the low-
fare business. 
Geographic areas 
Revenue from external customers can be analysed by geographic area as follows: 
  2017 2016 
 € million € million 
Jersey (country of domicile) - - 
EU 1,421.3 1,322.9 
Other (non-EU) 149.9 106.2 
Total revenue from external customers 1,571.2 1,429.1 
Revenue was allocated to geographic areas based on the location of the first departure airport on each ticket 
booking. 
Major customers 
The Group derives the vast majority of its revenues from its passengers and sells most of its tickets directly to 
the passengers as final customers rather than through corporate intermediaries (tour operators, travel agents 
or similar). Therefore, the Group does not have any major corporate customers.

9. Exceptional items and underlying profit 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense 
that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount. In the 2017 and 2016 
financial years all items classified by the Group as exceptional related to financial income or expenses. 
In the 2017 financial year the Group had a net exceptional income of €18.8 million, consisting of: (i) exceptional gain 
of €14.3 million relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions, particularly on fuel caps; and (ii) 
exceptional income of €4.5 million relating to closing of fuel cap deals. According to the contracts the fuel caps had 
their expiry dates in the second half of the financial year (October 2016 to February 2017) however they were sold 
in order to enable the Group to enter into new deals (zero cost collars) at more favourable rates, without breaching 
the fuel hedge coverage limits set in the Hedging Policy of the Group. The net €4.5 million gain consisted of time 
value gain of €16.8 million (coming from the reversal of time value losses previously accumulated on these 
instruments), the writing off of option fee costs of €12.4 million, and sale proceeds of €0.2 million. 
In the 2016 financial year the Group had an exceptional expense of €16.3 million, consisting of: (i) exceptional 
expense of €25.0 million relating to the change in time value of open hedge positions, particularly on fuel caps; 
and (ii) exceptional income of €8.7 million relating to a realised foreign exchange gain arising on a one-off 
replacement of US$75.6 million bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits.  
These items were used by management in the determination of the non-GAAP underlying profit measure for 
the Group – see below.  
Underlying profit

 € million € million 
Profit for the period 246.0 192.9 
Adjustments (exclusions):

Exceptional items net (gain)/loss (18.8) 16.3 
Sum of adjustments  (20.7) 31.0 
Underlying profit after tax  225.3 223.9 
On top of the exceptional items explained above, unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses are also excluded 
from the calculation of underlying profit. These are non-cash translation differences that arise primarily on the 
revaluation of the net US Dollar monetary asset position of the Group, that used to be material until 2016. 
The unrealised loss of €14.7 million in 2016 related primarily to the conversion of US$75.6 million collaterals into Euros. 
This transaction alone resulted in an €8.7 million realised foreign exchange gain on one hand (explained above among 
exceptional items) and a €12.4 million unrealised foreign exchange loss on the other hand (the latter being the reversal 
of the unrealised gains recognised on these assets since their initial recognition). That is, the net foreign exchange 
impact of this conversion in 2016 was a €3.7 million loss – all included in the adjustments in the table above.  
By the end of the 2016 financial year the US Dollar monetary asset-liability position of the Group became 
materially balanced; therefore, starting from financial year 2017 there are no material movements in this area. 
The tax effects of the adjustments made above are insignificant.

10. Net financing income and expense continued 
Interest income and expense contain interest on financial instruments and, under the ‘Other’ category the 
effect of the initial discounting of long-term deposits and the later unwinding of such discounting.  
The fuel caps premium of €9.0 million in 2017 and €5.3 million in 2016 relate to the option fees for fuel caps 
expired in the periods – these were paid in the 2015 financial year. 
Out of the unrealised foreign exchange loss of €14.7 million in 2016 €12.4 million was caused by the 
replacement of US Dollar bank deposits behind collaterals with Euro deposits. This is because the unrealised 
foreign exchange gain recognised on these assets until March 2015 had to be reversed due to their de-
recognition – see also in Note 9.

The Company has a tax rate of 7.8 per cent. (2016: 7.8 per cent.). The tax rate relates to Switzerland, where 
the Company is tax resident. 
The current tax charge for the year is different to the standard rate of corporation tax of 7.8 per cent.

The Company had no taxable income. Substantially all the profits of the Group in 2017 and 2016 were made 
by Wizz Air Hungary Kft, the airline subsidiary of the Group, and substantially all the tax charges presented in 
this Note were incurred by this entity.  
Other income based foreign tax represents the “innovation contribution” and the local business tax payable in 
Hungary in 2017 and 2016 by the Hungarian subsidiaries of the Group, primarily Wizz Air Hungary Kft. 
Hungarian local business tax and innovation contribution are levied on an adjusted profit basis.

12. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by 
the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during each period. 
  2017 2016 
Profit from the year, € million 246.0 192.9 
Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue  57,254,581 53,344,145 
Basic earnings per share, EUR 4.30 3.62 
There were also 44,830,503 Convertible Shares in issue at 31 March 2017 (see Note 28). These shares are 
non-participating, i.e. the profit attributable to them is €nil. Therefore, these shares are not included in the 
basic earnings per share calculation above. 
Diluted earnings per share 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
with the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that could have been issued in the respective year 
as a result of the conversion of the following convertible instruments of the Group: 
 Convertible Shares (see Note 28); 
 Convertible Notes (see Note 24); and 
 employee share options (see Note 27) (vested share options are included in the calculation).  
The profit for the year has been adjusted for the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share in respect 
of the interest charge relating to the debt which could have been converted into shares.

Proforma earnings per share, EUR 1.79 1.78 
(1) Interest expense on convertible debt is lower in 2016 because of the refund of interest withholding tax incurred in earlier periods. 
(2) The issued share number includes also the 44.8 million Convertible Shares in issue at 31 March 2017 (2016: 44.8 million). See Note 28 for 
share capital. 
(3) Interest outstanding on Convertible Notes in issue at year end is not taken into account for conversion because it is more likely to be paid 
in cash than converted into shares (as it was the case also in the past).

12. Earnings per share continued 
Proforma earnings per share continued 
The calculation of the proforma underlying EPS is different from the calculation of the IFRS-diluted EPS 
measure in the following: 
 for earnings, the underlying profit for the year was used (see Note 9), as opposed to the statutory (IFRS) 
profit for the year; and 
 for the fully diluted number of shares the year-end position was taken rather than the weighted average 
for the year. 
The proforma EPS measure was introduced by the Company to better reflect the underlying earnings and the 
underlying equity structure, particularly to remove the distortion caused by the special conversion restrictions 
existing for convertible debt until the IPO in March 2015. The latter issue was relevant last in 2015. Since the 
2016 financial year the same instruments were in place both during the year and at the end of the year; 
therefore, the fully diluted share number was materially the same in the diluted and proforma EPS calculations.

Additions to aircraft parts were €37.3 million (2016: €16.2 million). Most of this increase was related to the 
delivery of various spare engines from IAE.  
Additions to aircraft maintenance assets were €69.9 million (2016: 41.1 million). The increase is due to the fact 
that there were significantly more engine-related new assets created in 2017 because: (i) there were more 
engines becoming out of condition for LLP replacement than in 2016; (ii) in 2016 the Company revised its 
engine maintenance plan combined with a new IAE FHA agreement (see the 2016 report for details) and as a 
result only a few engines became out of condition for shop visit in that period – instead most of these became 
out of condition in 2017; and (iii) the Group has a few engines that require second shop visit and these all 
became out of condition (and partly already went through the shop visit) in 2017.

15. Tax assets and liabilities continued 
Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
Until 31 March 2010 Wizz Air Hungary was Hungarian tax resident and up to this date had accumulated a €30.0 million 
tax loss in Hungary. This balance remained unchanged at 31 March 2017. This loss can be utilised only to offset profits 
generated under Hungarian tax residency. The Group does not expect to have profit generated under Hungarian tax 
residency in the foreseeable future and therefore no deferred tax asset is recognised in this respect.

The derivative financial instruments represent cash flow hedges (see also Note 3). The full value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a current asset or current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less 
than twelve months. 
The cash flow hedges expiring in 2017 had an ineffective portion of €0.3 million (2016: €1.0 million). 
The net position of assets and liabilities does match the cash flow hedging reserve in the statement of financial 
position because: (i) the hedging reserve does not include the time value of open options, only the intrinsic 
value; and (ii) hedging with non-derivatives has an impact on the hedging reserve.

Deferred interest expense represents the deferred initial discount adjustments calculated for 
non-current receivables. 
Deferred PDP interest is the deferred part of PDP interest expenses incurred on leased aircraft or spare 
engines. Such interest relates to aircraft or spare engine PDP payments financed by third parties, and is initially 
recognised under property, plant and equipment (advances paid for aircraft). When the leased aircraft or spare 
engine is delivered, PDP interest is reclassified to deferred interest expense. It is then amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term of the respective asset and the amortisation charge is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income as aircraft rental expense.

Restricted cash comprises cash in bank, against which there are letters of credit issued or other restrictions in 
place governing the use of that cash, resulting from agreements with aircraft lessors or other business partners. 
Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement. The increase versus 2016 
was related to letters of credit issued to lessors for maintenance reserves and lease security deposits.  
Restricted cash during the 2017 financial year was held mainly on current account in Euros, earning no interest.

Holdings Plc at conversion factors in the range of €1.0–1.5 for one share. Such Ordinary Shares issued as a 
result of conversion in certain cases might be subject to restrictions on voting and dividend rights. Until the 
notes are converted, interest on the notes is payable in cash with a coupon rate of interest of 8 per cent. per 
annum, twice a year in February and in August. 
Convertible Notes are guaranteed by Wizz Air Hungary Kft – see Note 31.

Non-current deferred income represents the value of benefit for the Group coming from concessions (cash 
credits and free aircraft components) received from aircraft and certain component suppliers, that will be 
recognised as a credit (an aircraft rentals expenses decreasing item) on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term of the respective asset. 
Current deferred income represents the value of tickets paid by passengers for which the flight service is yet 
to be performed and the current part of the value of supplier credits received. 
27. Employee benefits  
Share based payments 
The share based payment charge in the financial statements for the year relates to three types of instruments 
that are in issue at 31 March 2017: share awards issued to Directors of the Board during 2006-2013, and employee 
share options issued (i) during 2005-2015 under the 2005 International Employee Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’) 
and (ii) in July 2015 and 2016 under the 2014 Employee Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) of the Group. 
The awards and options are classified as equity-settled share based payments. The Company issues new 
shares for any options exercised, irrespective of the method of exercise. The fair value of the awards and 
options is recognised as staff cost over the estimated vesting period with a corresponding charge to equity.

There are no individual performance conditions set for the employees to exercise their options after the three-
year vesting period other than that the employee must be in employment with one of the Group entities until 
and on the date of exercise of the options. 
For the Performance Options the performance conditions are set as follows, with 50 per cent. weighting for each:  
 total shareholder return (TSR) of the Group relative to the TSR of certain selected European airlines over 
the three-year period following the award; and 
 absolute growth in underlying, fully diluted earnings per share of the Group, measured over the period 
from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019.  
The percentage of Performance Options that will vest will be determined on a pro-rata basis (“payout rate”) 
to the extent that the target levels for these performance conditions will be met by the Group. 
The fair value of options granted was determined by using the Black-Scholes model, resulting in €17.89 per 
share. The total cost of the grant was determined based on: (i) the fair value of options; (ii) the number of 
options expected to vest; and (iii) the estimated payout rate for Performance Options.

At the end of the financial year, the outstanding options had a weighted average outstanding contractual life 
of two years and eight months (2016: four years and seven months). 
Non-Executive Director share award programme 
371,832 shares were awarded to Directors during 2006–2013. Of these shares 174,082 were granted to persons 
who were no longer a Director of the Company at 31 March 2017. 
The shares were awarded subject to restrictions such as the Directors may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, 
exchange, encumber or dispose of any of the award shares for a period of three years or until an IPO, whichever 
is later. These restrictions expired for all award shares by July 2016. 
Taxation 
Under the terms of each of the three programmes all taxes payable on share options and awards are the 
liability of the recipients of these benefits. However, in certain cases the Company or one of its subsidiaries has 
a legal obligation to pay the employer social security on the income realised by the recipients. To the extent 
the additional social security obligations can be estimated, the Group makes a provision for these already 
during the vesting period of the instruments.

28. Capital and reserves continued 
Ordinary Shares 
The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per 
share at meetings of the Company.  
Convertible Shares 
In March 2015, linked to the listing of the Company’s shares on the London Stock Exchange, certain convertible 
loans and notes (including accrued interest) were converted into non-voting non-participating Convertible 
Shares of the Company. There were 44,830,503 Convertible Shares in issue at 31 March 2017, all fully paid 
(2016: 44,830,503). The Convertible Shares are held by Indigo and can be converted into Ordinary Shares of 
the Company by Indigo on the condition of meeting certain criteria post-conversion regarding the overall 
shareholding structure of the Company. 
Capital reserves 
Share premium 
Share premium has two main components. €207.2 million was recognised as a result of the Group 
reorganisation in October 2009. It represents the estimated fair value of the Group at the date of the 
transaction. The remaining €171.0 million (as at 31 March 2017) was recognised as a result of new share issues 
made since October 2009. These new share issues comprised the primary offering on the initial public offering 
of the Company’s shares on the London Stock Exchange in March 2015, the conversion of some of the 
convertible debt instruments into shares and the conversion of certain employee share options into shares. 
Within this, during the 2017 financial year €1.2 million increase was recorded in the share premium, all related 
to conversion of employee share options. 
Reorganisation reserve 
Reorganisation reserve of €193.0 million was recognised as a result of the Group reorganisation in October 
2009. It is equal to the difference between the fair value of the Group at the date of reorganisation 
(€209.0 million) and the share capital of the Group at the same date (€16.0 million). 
Equity part of convertible debt 
The equity part of convertible debt in equity comprises the equity component of compound instruments 
issued by the Company. The amount of the convertible debts classified as equity of €8.3 million 
(2016: €8.3 million) is net of attributable transaction costs of €0.5 million. 
Share based payment charge 
The share based payment balance of €3.9 million credit (2016: €2.9 million) corresponds to the recognised 
cumulative charge of share options and share awards provided to the employees and Directors under long-
term incentive schemes. This balance is recognised directly in retained earnings. 
Cash flow hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative unrealised net change in the intrinsic 
part of the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not 
yet occurred.

29. Provisions for other liabilities and charges continued 
Non-current provisions relate to future aircraft maintenance obligations of the Group on leased aircraft and 
spare engines, falling due beyond one year from the balance sheet date. Current aircraft maintenance 
provisions relate to heavy maintenance obligations expected to be fulfilled in the coming financial year. The 
amount of provision reflects management’s estimates of the cost of heavy maintenance work that will be 
required in the future to discharge obligations under the Group’s operating lease agreements (see Note 4). 
Maintenance provisions in relation to engines covered by FHA agreements are netted off with the FHA 
prepayments made to the engine maintenance service provider in respect of the same group of engines. 
The increase in current maintenance provisions from 2016 to 2017 relates primarily to new provisions made for 
engine Life Limited Part (LLP) replacements. 
Other provisions relate to future liabilities under the Group’s customer loyalty programme, all within one year.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as long-term deposits 
among the non-current other receivables) is determined by estimated discounted cash flows. 
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate 
their fair values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables and payables. Long-term financial assets and 
liabilities which are classified as fair value through profit and loss are recognised on fair value. 
Trade and other receivables due after more than one year are almost exclusively maintenance reserves, with 
an average term of approximately four years. The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting at a 
rate of interest of four-years’ US Dollar swap rate prevailing on the last day of the financial year. 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on their actual mark-to-market evaluation of the 
financial institutions. 
During the year a €24.5 million loss (2016: €71.0 million) was realised on derivative financial assets and liabilities 
in the income statement. 
During the year a €16,000 gain (2016: €48,000 loss) was realised on financial assets available for sale.

31. Financial guarantees 
The Company has provided parent guarantees to certain lessors of its aircraft fleet, to guarantee the 
performance of its airline subsidiaries under the respective lease contracts. 
The Company has provided parent guarantee to the Hungarian Government, to guarantee the performance 
of its airline subsidiary in relation to a public services contract for the scheduled transport of passengers 
between Hungary and five West-Balkan countries. 
The Company has provided parent guarantees to certain hedging counterparties, to guarantee the 
performance of Wizz Air Hungary Kft, under the respective hedge contracts. 
The note purchase agreement (for Convertible Notes) contains a guarantee and indemnity, pursuant to which 
Wizz Air Hungary Kft, inter alia, guarantees to Indigo Hungary LP and Indigo Maple Hill LP the punctual 
performance by the Company of its obligations under the note purchase agreement. 
32. Lease commitments 
The total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease rentals are as follows: 
 2017 2016  
 € million € million 
Payments due:   
Within one year 309.7 244.8 
Between one and five years 1,269.5 950.1 
More than five years 831.1 563.5 
Total operating lease commitments 2,410.3 1,758.3 
The majority (99 per cent.) of the commitments relate to aircraft operating lease contracts. The above table 
includes also the lease costs of those aircraft that are not yet delivered but for which the lease contract was 
already signed before the statement of financial position date. 
The lease payments are not subject to future escalation, but nine of the aircraft lease contracts are on a floating 
rate and thus the lease payments for these vary with the US Dollar market rates of interest.

33. Capital commitments 
At 31 March 2017 the Group had the following capital commitments: 
 a commitment to purchase 133 Airbus aircraft of the A320 family in the period 2017–2024. Of the 133 
aircraft 23 relate to the “ceo” version of the A320 family (from purchase orders placed prior to 2015) while 
the remaining 110 relate to the “neo” version (from the purchase order placed in June 2015). The total 
commitment is valued at US$16.5 billion (€15.4 billion) at list prices in 2017 US Dollar terms (as at 31 March 
2016: US$17.5 billion (€15.5 billion), valued at 2016 list prices). As at the date of approval of this document 
23 of the 133 aircraft are covered by a sale and leaseback agreement; and 
 a commitment to purchase 18 IAE spare aircraft engines in the period 2017–2024. Of the 18 engines 
two relate to the “ceo” version of the IAE engines (from purchase orders placed prior to 2015) while 
the remaining 16 to the “neo” version. With regards to the “neo” engines, the Group in July 2016 
entered into an engine selection agreement with Pratt & Whitney that, among other matters, included 
a commitment for the Group to purchase 16 spare engines starting from 2019. The total commitment 
is valued at US$146.4 million (€136.9 million) at list prices in 2017 US Dollar terms (as at March 2016: 
US$63.8 million (€56.2 million), valued at 2016 list prices, related to six engines at the time). As at the 
date of approval of this document the 18 engines are not yet financed.

Legal disputes 
European Commission state aid investigations 
Six of the European Commission’s ongoing state aid investigations which are in their formal phase concern 
arrangements between Wizz Air and certain airports to which it flies, namely, Timişoara, Cluj-Napoca, 
Târgu Mureş, Beauvais and Girona. Wizz Air has submitted its legal observations and supporting economic 
analyses of these arrangements to the European Commission. Ultimately, an adverse decision by the European 
Commission could result in a repayment order for the recovery from Wizz Air of any amount determined by 
the European Commission to be illegal state aid. None of these ongoing investigations are expected to lead 
to exposure that is material to the Group. 
The European Commission has given notice that the state aid investigations involving Wizz Air will be assessed 
on the basis of new “EU Guidelines on State aid to airports and airlines” which were adopted by the European 
Commission on 20 February 2014. Where relevant, Wizz Air has made further submissions to the European 
Commission in connection with this notification. 
Claims by Carpatair 
Carpatair, a regional airline based in Romania, started a number of cases in the Romanian courts during 2012 
and 2013 which relate to Carpatair’s allegations that Timişoara airport granted unlawful state aid to Wizz Air 
pursuant to an agreement between the parties or by virtue of the publicly available scheme of charges 
published by Timişoara airport. Wizz Air is intervening in the defence of these claims, either in its own right or 
in support of Timişoara airport. One of these cases determined that state aid existed in the 2010 scheme of 
charges, but failed to substantiate that decision or to quantify the amount involved. Following this decision, 
Carpatair began a case in which both Timişoara airport and Wizz Air are named as defendants and, pursuant 
to which, Carpatair aims to have the alleged state aid under the 2010 scheme of charges quantified and a 
repayment order issued. Wizz Air understands that the Romanian Chamber of Accounts has issued a decision 
requiring Timişoara airport to recover from Wizz Air an amount of approximately €3 million in respect of the 
state aid attributable to the 2010 and 2011 scheme of charges despite there having been no expert 
quantification of the amount and the airport has now started proceedings which Wizz Air is defending. 
In January 2016 Carpatair filed a new legal action – registered with the Bucharest Tribunal – against Timişoara 
airport, the Romanian Ministry of Transports, the Ministry of Public Finances representing the Romanian State 
and Wizz Air. By the said legal action Carpatair asked the court to order the four defendants to pay, jointly, to 
Carpatair damages preliminarily estimated to amount to €92 million and interest related to the said amount, 
resulting from alleged state aid granted by Timişoara airport to Wizz Air, from the existence of a marketing 
agreement between Timişoara airport and Wizz Air and from an abuse of dominant position on the part of 
Timişoara airport.

34. Contingent liabilities continued 
Legal disputes continued 
Claims by Carpatair continued 
The court’s decision delivered on 20 December 2016 upheld the objection raised by the Company that the 
Bucharest Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the case should be heard by the Administrative 
Litigation Section of the Bucharest Court of Appeals. The case was therefore forwarded to the Bucharest Court 
of Appeals – Administrative and Fiscal Litigation Section where a hearing is scheduled on 18 May 2017. 
Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure for these cases could be in the region of 
€113 million (including the €3 million and the €92 million specifically mentioned above). No provision has been 
made by the Group in relation to these issues because there is currently no reason to believe that the Group 
will incur charges from these cases. 
35. Subsequent events 
There were no matters arising, between the statement of financial position date and the date on which these 
financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors, requiring adjustment or disclosure in 
accordance with IAS 10, Events after the reporting period. 
36. Related parties 
Identity of related parties 
Related parties are:  
 Indigo Hungary LP and Indigo Maple Hill LP (collectively referred to as “Indigo” here), because it appointed 
three Directors to the Board of Directors (all in service at 31 March 2017);  
 key management personnel (Directors and Officers); and 
 Éden Rent Kft., one of the logistics suppliers of the Group, because one of the Officers of the Group due 
to equity investment has joint control over this entity. 
Indigo, Directors and Officers altogether held 23.3 per cent. of the voting shares of the Company at 31 March 2017 
(2016: 24.7 per cent.).  
Transactions with related parties 
There were no transactions with related parties during the fiscal year except as indicated below.  
Transactions with Indigo 
At 31 March 2017 Indigo held 10,740,633 Ordinary Shares (equal to 18.7 per cent. of the Company’s issued 
share capital) and 44,830,503 Convertible Shares of the Company (2016: 10,740,633 Ordinary Shares and 
44,830,503 Convertible Shares). 
Indigo has interest in convertible debt instruments issued by the Company (see Note 24). The Company’s liability 
to Indigo, including principal and accrued interest, was €27.1 million at 31 March 2017 (2016: €27.2 million). 
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the Company entered into transactions with Indigo as follows: 
 the Company recognised interest expense on convertible debt instruments held by Indigo in the amount 
of €2.0 million (2016: €2.0 million); and 
 fees of €0.1 million (2016: €0.1 million) were paid to Indigo in respect of the remuneration of two of the 
Directors who were delegated by Indigo to the Board of Directors of the Company.

Transactions with related parties continued 
Transactions with key management personnel 
Officers (members of executive management) and Directors of the Board are considered to be key 
management personnel. The compensation of key management personnel, including Non-Executive Directors, 
is as follows: 
 2017 2016 
 € million € million 
Salaries and other short-term employee benefits  4.3 6.6 
Social security costs 0.7 1.3 
Share based payments 0.6 0.9 
Amounts paid to third parties in respect of Directors’ service 0.2 0.2 
Total key management compensation expense 5.7 9.1 
The total key management compensation expense was lower than in 2016 primarily because under the Short-
term Incentive Plan there was significantly lower payout to Officers in 2017 than in 2016.  
Transactions with Éden Rent Kft. 
During the year ended 31 March 2017 the Group recognised operating expenses in the amount of €3.0 million 
in relation to services provided by Éden Rent Kft. (2016: €2.4 million). 
The Group had trade liabilities towards Éden Rent Kft. in the amount of €0.2 million at 31 March 2017 
(2016: €0.1 million). 
The contract with Éden Rent Kft. for transportation services has six months termination notice. Assuming normal 
operations of the Group, this is equivalent to approximately €1.5 million purchase commitment existing at 31 
March 2017 (2016: €1.2m). 
The relationship with Éden Rent Kft. is subject to the Group’s Conflict of Interest policy and, in accordance with 
that policy, the relevant Officer is excluded from all discussions and decisions related to this supplier. 
37. Ultimate controlling party 
In the opinion of the Directors there is no individual controlling party in relation to the Company's issued 
Ordinary Shares. 
As at 28 April 2017 approximately 51.6 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in the Company were owned by 
Qualifying Nationals. Shareholders and potential investors are reminded that the Group’s Hungarian operating 
licence depends, inter alia, on Qualifying Nationals owning more than 50 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares. The 
Company’s articles of association enable the Directors to take action to ensure that the amount of Ordinary 
Shares held by Non-Qualifying Nationals does not reach a level that could jeopardise the Group’s entitlement 
to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any operating licence that benefits the Group.  
Qualifying Nationals include: (i) EEA nationals, (ii) nationals of Switzerland and (iii) in respect of any 
undertaking, an undertaking that satisfies the conditions as to nationality of ownership and control of 
undertakings granted an operating licence contained in Article 4(f) of the Air Services Regulation, as such 
conditions may be amended, varied, supplemented or replaced from time to time, or as provided for in any 
agreement between the EU and any third country (whether or not such undertaking is itself granted an 
operating licence). 
A Non-Qualifying National is any person who is not a Qualifying National in accordance with the 
definition above.
