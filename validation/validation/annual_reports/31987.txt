CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Ian Gilham, Ph.D.
Chairman
genedrive plc is well 
positioned for growth  
in the rapidly growing  
point of need molecular 
testing market.
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that 2016/17 has seen us make further 
progress on our journey to refocus the Company on the 
highly attractive opportunities which the Genedrive® 
diagnostics platform offers in the rapidly growing market for 
decentralised, near patient diagnostic tests.
Key Achievements
A major focus for the year was the development of our 
Genedrive® HCV ID Kit. With the advent of new ‘curative’ 
direct acting antiviral treatments for Hepatitis C (HCV), there 
is a major opportunity to tackle the global burden of the 
disease if accurate, decentralised diagnostics can be used 
to identify those living with HCV and give them access to 
therapy.
Our Genedrive® HCV ID Kit was submitted for CE 
registration in April 2017 based on excellent performance 
data from clinical validation studies. Post year end, I am 
delighted that we obtained CE marking, a vital first step to 
commercialization.
We are also delighted to have entered into a distribution 
agreement with Sysmex Europe to target the commercial 
HCV opportunity in Africa. The agreement covers the EMEA 
region with an initial focus on multiple countries in Africa. 
Working together the two companies will focus on securing 
the required regulatory approvals and we anticipate 
commercial traction during the 2017/18 financial year.

Other Activities
The pathogen detection programme with the US DoD 
contributed significantly to the current year revenues and 
included shipments of Genedrive® units and assays for field 
use testing. Post year end we also received confirmation 
that following successful evaluations, the programme will be 
entering its next phase, worth $1.4m in development income 
and $0.5m in product sales to be recognised in the year to 
30 June 2018. 
As previously announced, we encountered a specific 
sample preparation problem relating to a supplier 
component in the MTB/RIF test. An alternative solution had 
been successfully tested in Indian laboratories however we 
have had difficulty assessing the impact of this through our 
commercial partner. In the light of these challenges, we are 
considering how best to address the Indian MTB/RIF market 
and the broader potential of Genedrive® in this area. As 
stated in the trading statement of 13 July 2017, no additional 
short term revenues were expected from MTB/RIF in India. 
However, the TB market is large and there is significant 
potential for Genedrive®.
Away from our core human healthcare focus, we enjoyed 
success with funded field trials of Genedrive® for white-spot 
disease detection in farmed shrimp. The results validated 
Genedrive®’s potential as a rapid cost effective system for 
disease detection in animals. The Company however 
remains focused on the human health market and will only 
pursue this opportunity further if a commercial partner can 
be identified.
With modest investment the Services division continued to 
contribute to the Group. Revenues and operating margin 
were up on the same period last year. The Board wishes to 
see the division divested and discussions are ongoing in 
order to pursue that as a strategic aim and thereby secure 
additional investment capital for Genedrive®. While we 
remain optimistic that an appropriate divestment can be 
secured, we believe the division can continue to contribute 
to the Group should a sale not be secured. 
Governance and People
Strong governance and values are vitally important to the 
success of the Company and the Board remains focused on 
ensuring its own effectiveness and that of the governance 
processes throughout the Company. The Board has recently 
gone through some changes. John Rylands, stepped down 
from the Board in November 2016 and we thank him for his 
excellent contribution to the Company and wish him well for 
the future. Matthew Fowler joined the Board on 
13 December 2016 in his role as Chief Financial Officer. 
Matthew brings to the role strong business skills and 
extensive experience in listed businesses, which are already 
proving of great benefit to the Company.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our staff and 
extend this thanks to our investors and customers for their 
commitment and support. We look forward to updating 
investors during the year on further progress and delivery 
against our strategic objectives.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
Overview
Our transition to a commercial stage diagnostics business is 
well underway. genedrive plc now has a clear strategic 
direction and the efforts of the Company are focused 
towards advancing our offerings as a disease detection 
business built around the Genedrive® platform. I am pleased 
with the progress made in the year but we are aware there 
are still challenges ahead of us for the Company to fully 
realise the considerable potential of Genedrive®.
David Budd
Chief Executive Officer
We continue to make strong 
progress with a disciplined 
approach to executing our 
strategy.
Our Performance 
Revenue for the period was £5.8m, up 13.7% from the £5.1m 
on the prior period. This year-over-year growth in revenue 
was driven by the Diagnostics division that saw revenue 
growth of 36.8% to £2.6m (2016: £1.9m). Our pathogen 
detection programme with the DoD was central to this 
growth with revenue of £2.2m, up £0.5m from 2016. Services 
revenue was £3.2m (2016: £3.1m), up 3.2%. We closed the 
year with £5.1m of cash (2016: £1.1m). Targeted investment of 
our cash resources remains vital as we assess and prioritise 
the various commercial and development opportunities 
before us.
The Genedrive® Platform – Strategic Progress
During the year we announced the successful studies on our 
HCV ID kit conducted at the Institut Pasteur, Paris and 
Queens University Nottingham. Following these successful 
studies that showed overall sensitivity of greater than 99% 
and specificity of 100%, the product was submitted for CE 
marking in April 2017. I am pleased that in September 2017 
the product obtained its CE registration. With the HCV ID kit 
now CE registered we are in a position to begin 
commercialisation efforts. We have signed a distribution 
agreement with Sysmex Europe, a world leader in clinical 
laboratory systemization and solutions, for the EMEA with an 
initial focus on Africa. Working together, the companies will 
now focus on securing the required regulatory approvals in 
individual territories of Africa and we anticipate commercial 
traction during the 2017/2018 financial year. This agreement 
is an important step to providing access to Genedrive® 
across target countries in Africa and we are delighted to be 
working with Sysmex Europe who have the experience and 
networks needed to market and commercialise the product.
Our Genedrive® HCV ID kit will initially be launched and sold 
into decentralised laboratories; being facilities outside of 
large hospitals. Our test is performed from plasma, which is 
currently isolated from whole blood using a centrifuge. As 
direct acting antiviral use increases in the future, we 
anticipate an increased demand for diagnostics in even 
smaller, point-of-need facilities. To support future positioning 
in this user segment, the Company has secured a £0.6m 
conditional offer of development funding from Innovate UK.  
When confirmed the grant will be used to further our 
Centrifuge Free Plasma Separation device concept, so that 
Page Title at start: Content Section at start:
Chief Executive’s Review Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
 genedrive plc Annual Report 2017
 7
smaller facilities without centrifuges can also use 
Genedrive® HCV ID.  We also intend to refine, improve  
and simplify other aspects of the HCV test to make it even 
more suitable for point of need testing to maximize its 
commercial potential.
Commercialisation of our MTB test in India has continued to 
be challenging in the past year, primarily owing to a 
component issue in the sample preparation process specific 
to that test, but also compounded by commercial issues. We 
believe we have resolved the problem but, until validated in 
the field, revenues are not expected in the short term. The 
market dynamics of MTB have not changed since genedrive 
plc identified the opportunity, the market is large and well 
defined and there is significant potential in smaller 
laboratories. However with the benefit of experience 
acquired in the field, we are considering how best to 
address the Indian market and the broader potential of 
Genedrive® MTB/RIF in this area. It is possible that to fully 
exploit the potential of MTB we may need to more fully 
refine our sample preparation processes before re-
engaging the market.
The programme with the DoD has seen continued success. 
This work involves collaboration with the DoD to develop 
biohazard tests for Genedrive® in the context of a small 
portable diagnostics device capable of deployment in the 
field. The work not only validates Genedrive® as a flexible 
and accurate diagnostics device, it has helped to fund 
important developments such as Bluetooth connectivity and 
uninterruptible power supply that will benefit customer 
adoption. The DoD has not indicated the intended future 
sustained use of Genedrive® and as such it is not possible 
for us to predict future commercial revenues. However, post 
year end an additional funding award was made to support 
the continuation of the project and an award was made to 
support ongoing validation work. This additional funding is 
expected to generate approximately $1.4m in development 
and commercial income of $0.5m for the financial year to 
30 June 2018.
Services Operations
As previously stated, we have been seeking strategic 
alternatives for our Services business including considering 
divestment. We have yet to secure a disposal although 
discussions are ongoing but should a divestment on 
acceptable terms not be possible, we remain flexible to the 
division being retained within the Company.  We do believe 
that focusing our efforts on Genedrive® should remain a 
core strategic priority.
Revenues from our larger US based programmes were 
slightly down in the year, 8.8%, but the decline is owing to 
the life-cycle of the projects as opposed to underlying 
trends in the market. Conversely European business 
enjoyed a good period of growth, 17.8% year over year. The 
growth was delivered from a growing number of 
programmes with smaller customers, and was aided by 
improvements to our marketing, contacts and relationship 
management.
Outlook
We are now entering a defining period for genedrive plc. 
The CE marked Genedrive® HCV ID kit positions the 
Company as first to market with an affordable and cost 
effective HCV test. In the current financial year, we will be 
working with our distribution partner(s) to begin 
commercialisation efforts and secure requisite regulatory 
approvals. While we have challenges with MTB our 
experience in the market and successes with the DoD and 
CEFAS projects underline the potential of the Genedrive® as 
a flexible, portable and cost effective platform for 
decentralised molecular diagnostics. To more fully realise 
that potential, particularly outside decentralised laboratories 
at point of care, we intend to focus some development work 
on refining, improving and simplifying product workflow. This 
will maximise the commercial potential in HCV and in other 
infectious diseases including MTB. The Board is encouraged 
by the growing momentum in the business and the outlook 
for genedrive plc.

Commercial traction in the first half of the year was impaired 
by a sample preparation component problem. During the 
second half of the year we identified the issue, isolated the 
component and sourced a replacement. Commercial and 
contractual issues during this time have slowed our ability to 
subsequently re-engage the market. Currently the Company 
has the option to continue with the product, or return to the 
market in the medium term with further refined sample 
preparation approach that could allow us to target market

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Results for the year delivered revenue and other income of 
£5.8m (2016: £5.1m). Research and development costs were 
£5.1m (2016: £4.8m) reflecting the continued investment in our 
Genedrive® technology. Contract and administration costs 
were £5.6m (2016: £5.7m) and gave a trading loss for the year 
of £4.9m (2016: £5.4m).
During the year, the Group reviewed the useful economic life of 
its intangible assets. The conclusion from this review was that 
the assumed useful economic lives were too long given the 
rapid advances of technology in the market. The Group has 
therefore shortened the remaining lives of the assets and 
impaired the assets down to their fair value. This £2.4m 
non-cash charge (2016: £nil) has been separated out on the 
face of the income statement to give readers a better 
understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Financing costs of £0.2m (2016: £1.1m) relate to the dollar 
denominated Global Health Investment Fund (GHIF) 
convertible bond. The terms of the bond were amended in the 
year to 30 June 2016 but had an effective date for accounting 
period to 30 June 2017. The total charge comprised £0.1m 
related to foreign exchange losses and £0.1m of fair value 
movements. The fair value movements include both the IFRS 
financing charge for the year and a fair value gain on the 
amendment signed in the year. The financing costs are all 
non-cash following an election under the signed amendment 
to defer interest payable into the principal. After financing costs 
and the impairment of intangibles, the loss before taxation was 
£7.5m (2016: £6.5m). This reduces to £6.4m (2016: £5.9m) after 
the Research and development taxation credit for the year.  
The basic loss per share was 34.9p (2016: 56.2p).
Cash Resources
Operating cash outflows were £7.3m (2016: £5.4m). Working 
capital contributed £1.3m (2016: £nil) to give a net cash outflow 
from operations of £2.6m (2016: £4.2m). Working capital 
movements were mainly owing to debtors as the Company 
benefitted from a movement to monthly invoicing on the DoD 
contract and the successful management of long overdue 
items. Interest inflows were £nil (2016: £0.3m outflow).
Tax received was £0.8m (2016: £0.7m) and relates to cash 
received under the Corporation Tax Research and 
Development tax relief scheme operated in the UK.
In July 2016 the Company raised £6.0m after costs, from the 
placement of 8,125,000 new ordinary shares. The Group 
closed the year with cash of £5.1m (30 June 2016: £1.1m).
Balance Sheet
At the year end, the convertible bond was £5.2m up from 
£5.0m in 2016. The fair value gains from the amendment in 
July 2016 were offset by foreign exchange losses and the 
annual finance cost on the bond. Genedrive® related revenue 
was key to the growth in revenue for the year. Given this 
growth we are approaching the criteria for triggering the  
£1.3m (2016: £1.3m) deferred consideration payable in shares, 
however the Directors still consider it appropriate to classify 
the liability as non-current.
Balance sheet net assets at 30 June 2017 totaled £3.4m 
(30 June 2016: £3.8m). The increase in share capital of £6.0m  
is directly from the shares issue in July 2016. Offsetting this 
increase was the consolidated loss for the year £6.4m  
(2016: £5.9m loss).

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
For the year ended 30 June 2017
The Board meets regularly to review operations and to discuss 
risk areas. Details of the financial risks are disclosed in note 20 
to the financial statements. The Directors regularly assess and 
monitor the business risks faced by the Group. Risk is an 
inherent feature of business and set out below are some key 
risks, together with associated mitigating factors. This list does 
not purport to be exhaustive.
Development Risk
The Group undertakes significant activity with the aim of 
launching new products, therapies and services. There can 
be no guarantee that the development activity will enable 
the programmes to meet the technical and intellectual 
property hurdles required for a commercial launch to be 
undertaken. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by 
ensuring that development programmes are planned and 
undertaken by staff with the requisite skills. The Group 
monitors industry trends and customer needs to ensure that 
its development targets remain relevant. The Group’s 
services to clients relate to projects which are also subject 
to development risk. The Board regularly monitors the client 
profile and seeks to broaden the client base where possible. 
Further information on significant clients is detailed in note 2 
the financial statements.
Financing Risk
In the forthcoming period, the Board anticipates that the 
Group’s investment in its development activities described 
above is likely to require additional equity investment into 
the Group. The Board maintains close dialogue with the 
Group’s advisers to monitor shareholder support for its 
investment programme and the Board is satisfied that it may 
reasonably expect to raise appropriate equity finance. 
However, there remains a risk that further equity fundraising 
will not be possible and, in this event, the Board will review 
the funding options available to the Group and the scope of 
its investment activities.
Quality Assurance and Regulatory Risk
The Group operates in a regulated industry and maintains 
significant investment in its Quality Assurance systems. In 
respect of its services the Group is accredited with GcLP 
Certification. In respect of its products, the Group is 
registered to ISO 13485 Certification. There can be no 
guarantee that the Group’s products or services will be able 
to obtain or maintain the necessary approval for the orderly 
conduct of its business. Approvals can require evaluation of 
data relating to safety, quality and efficacy standards. The 
Group seeks to mitigate regulatory risk by conducting its 
operations within recognised quality assurance standards 
and by undergoing external assessment.
Manufacturing Risk
On commencement of the supply of products (Genedrive® 
units and assays), the Group will be dependent on two key 
suppliers for the timely delivery of product at consistent 
quality and prices. One key supplier is based in the Far East 
and one key supplier is based in the UK. It is unlikely that 
dual sourcing of supply will be achievable in the short term.
Management and Employees
The Group’s future success is dependent on its management 
team and staff. There is an on-going risk that staff will leave to 
join competitor companies. The Group seeks to mitigate this 
risk by establishing effective management organisation and 
leading staff incentive schemes.
Economic Risk
The Group’s programmes are targeted to meet the commercial 
requirements of its clients. In the current economic climate, 
clients’ plans may be subject to changes which may adversely 
affect the financial performance of the Group. The Group seeks 
to mitigate this risk by operating a diversified business model 
across various technologies and territories.

financial statements on pages 32 to 60 of this report. No dividend is proposed. 
Going Concern
After due consideration, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have access to adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. Whilst mindful of the Financing Risk detailed 
on page 62, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In arriving at this conclusion the 
Directors have reviewed detailed forecast models for the Company and the Group. These models are based on best estimates of future 
performance and have been adjusted to reflect various downside scenarios and outcomes that could potentially impact the forecasts.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held on 29 November 2017 at Grafton Street. Details of the business to be considered at the 
Annual General Meeting and the Notice of Meeting are included in a separate document.

for loss of office on a change of control.

bond holder has various options to convert its bond into shares over the term of the bond as detailed in note 18 on pages 52 to 53.

European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a

select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

 •
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will 
continue in business.

Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ

information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in Board of Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 •
the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;
 •
the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; and
 •
the Financial Review includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and 
Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Provision of Information to Auditors
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on pages 16 and 17.  
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the Group’s auditors, each of these Directors confirms that:
 •
to the best of each Director’s knowledge and belief, there is no information (that is, information needed by the Group’s auditors in 
connection with preparing their report) of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
 •
each Director has taken all the steps that a Director might reasonably be expected to be taken to be aware of relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Independent Auditors
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated their willingness to continue in office and a resolution that they be 
re-appointed will be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the special provisions relating to small companies within Part 15 of the

Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 2 Pt1 to the Companies Act 2006 (‘the Schedule’) 
and also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ Remuneration. 
Section 497 of the Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable part’ of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Part 
3 of the Schedule. This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information
Remuneration Policy
The Executive Directors have written terms of engagement with no fixed expiry date.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the necessary calibre and to 
reward them for enhancing value to shareholders. The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of 
senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.
Executive Directors’ service contracts are subject to six months’ notice of termination.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company provided the Board’s permission is sought.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association. 
Non-Executive Directors’ Terms of Engagement
The Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement. Their remuneration is determined by the Board. In the event that a 
Non-Executive undertakes additional assignments for the Company, the Non-Executive’s fee will be agreed by the Company in 
respect of each assignment.

There are no performance criteria associated with the options. The exercise price of the awards was the share price at the date of grant.
The options above were issued under the Company’s enterprise management incentive share option plan dated November 2007 
which expired shortly after the year end. The Company has recently replaced this scheme with the genedrive plc 2017 Enterprise 
Management Incentive plan and will issue future grants under the new scheme. The new scheme is broadly aligned to the old scheme 
and has the following key features:
 •
Executives may be awarded up to 100% of salary per annum in the form of options, with allowance for up to 200% in exceptional 
circumstances
 •
The exercise price of options granted will not be below market price
 •
Awards will vest over a three year period, subject to performance criteria being met
 •
The Board retains the right to scale back or reduce to zero the size of vesting awards if they are not satisfied that the status and 
performance of the business is sufficient or the individual has not met an acceptable level of personal performance

Although not members of the Committees, the Executive Directors attend meetings of the Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Nominations Committee as invited as attendees when appropriate.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for reviewing and determining the scale and structure of the Executive Directors’, and 
senior management’s, remuneration and the terms of their service contracts. The remuneration and terms of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board. The Remuneration Committee also approves the issue of share options under schemes 
approved by the Board.
None of the Committee members have any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in the running of the business. No Director plays a part in any final decision about his or 
her own remuneration.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has responsibility for receiving accounts and reviewing reports from the management and the Company’s 
auditors, relating to Annual and Interim Accounts and the accounting and internal controls in place throughout the Group. At this stage 
of the Group’s size and development the Committee has decided that an internal audit function is not required as the Group’s internal 
controls system in place is appropriate for its size. The Audit Committee has met twice during the year.

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for reviewing the size, structure and composition of the Board, as well as retirements 
and appointments of replacement and additional Directors, and for making appropriate recommendations to the Board.
Matthew Fowler (Chief Financial Officer) was appointed to the Board on 13 December 2016. His appointment will be subject to formal 
approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 29 November 2017.
Operation of the Board
The Board held eight formal meetings during the year to 30 June 2017. In addition there were two telephone update calls. Reports 
from the Executive Directors, which focus on major operational matters, are circulated in advance of board meetings. To ensure that 
the Board are kept fully informed on the status of the business, reports and presentations are also produced by key senior 
management. 
Relations with Shareholders
The Group recognises the importance of communications with its shareholders to ensure that its strategy and performance is 
understood and that it remains accountable to shareholders. The Board as a whole is responsible for ensuring that a satisfactory 
dialogue with shareholders takes place, while the Chairman and Chief Executive ensure that the views of the shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. The Board ensures that the Group’s strategic plans have been carefully reviewed in terms of 
their ability to deliver long-term shareholder value.
Internal Controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls and will continue to 
ensure that management keeps these processes under regular review and improves them where appropriate. The system of internal 
controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement of loss.
Social, Environmental and Ethical Matters
The Board recognises the growing awareness of social, environmental and ethical matters and its endeavours to take into account the 
interests of the Group’s stakeholders, including the investors, employees, suppliers and business partners, when operating the 
business.
Employment
At a subsidiary level the individual Company has established policies which address key corporate objectives in the management of 
employee relations, communications and employee involvement, training and personal development and equal opportunities.
Health, Safety and Environmental Issues
The Board recognises its legal responsibilities to ensure the well-being, safety and welfare of its employees and to maintain a safe 
and healthy working environment for them and for its visitors and sub-contractors, Health and Safety is on the agenda for regularly 
scheduled Board meetings.
By their nature, the Group’s regular operations are judged to have a low environmental impact and are not expected to give rise to any 
significant, inherent environmental risks over the next 12 months.
The Group is committed to maintaining high standards in implementing appropriate health, safety and environmental protection 
policies. Waste materials are recycled where possible, and hazardous waste is catalogued and handled by licensed specialist disposal 
companies.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GENEDRIVE PLC
Report on the audit of the group financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, genedrive plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 •
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of its loss and cash flows for the year then ended;
 •
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 •
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated statement of profit or 
loss and comprehensive income, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and the 
consolidated cash flow statement; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting 
policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting treatment related to convertible bond
Refer to note 18.
During the year, the Group entered into a Deed of Amendment 
with the Global Health Investment Fund (‘GHIF’) that modified 
the terms of the USD 8m convertible bond issued in 2014.
The modification has been treated as an extinguishment of the 
previous financial liability which has been de-recognised and 
a new financial liability recognised in its place. The difference 
between these two liabilities of £380k has been recorded as a 
gain in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and 
comprehensive income.
The new financial liability has been measured at amortised 
cost using management’s estimate of a market interest rate for 
a similar instrument excluding the conversion option.
We read the Deed of Amendment and considered management’s 
proposed accounting treatment. Our testing focussed on the key 
judgements and estimates as follows:
 •
In concluding that the modification should be treated as an 
extinguishment of the previous financial liability, management 
calculated the impact on the future cash flows of the change in 
terms. We reviewed this analysis and found it to be appropriate.
 •
We assessed the interest rate used in valuing the new financial 
liability and consider this to be within a reasonable range.
Valuation of intangible assets
Refer to note 10. 
The Group’s intangible assets are amortised over their useful 
economic lives and assessed annually for indicators of 
impairment. At the year end the net book value of intangible 
assets was £3,038k (2016: £6,273k).
Due to the loss made in the current year, management has 
performed a full impairment review to compare the carrying 
value of the intangible assets to their recoverable value.  
An impairment charge of £2,379k has been recognised to 
reduce the carrying value of intangible assets to their 
recoverable value.
The determination of recoverable value was based on value in 
use which required management to make a number of 
judgements and assumptions, of which the following are 
considered to be key:
 •
The period over which the current technology is expected 
to be commercially viable and hence the length of the 
forecast period. Given the relatively limited expected life of 
the technology, the impact of one year’s cash flows to the 
value in use is significant.
 •
The forecast volumes of units sold which show increases 
on actual units sold to date. The genedrive unit is forecast 
to be sold in relatively low quantities and therefore the 
value in use is sensitive to changes in sales volumes.
 •
The discount rate used, as a small change in this could 
have a large impact on value in use.
We evaluated and challenged the Group’s future cash flow 
forecasts, the process by which they were drawn up and the 
underlying value in use calculations. We compared the Group’s 
forecasts to the latest Board approved budget and found them to be 
consistent.
Our testing was focused on the key judgements and assumptions as 
follows:
 •
In determining the forecast period of the value in use model, 
management has assessed similar products being developed by 
competitors and the impact these would have on the genedrive 
product. Whilst development of the genedrive product is 
expected to continue, this has not been considered in 
management’s value in use model which correctly considers the 
technology in its current state.
 •
We have applied sensitivity analyses to the volumes of sales 
included in the value in use model. Whilst the value in use 
calculation is sensitive to changes in forecast sales volumes, we 
found management’s forecasts to be reasonable.
 •
We challenged the discount rate used by assessing the cost of 
capital for the Group and comparing against similar 
organisations. We performed a sensitivity analysis of the 
discount rate applied to ascertain the magnitude of change 
required for a material misstatement to occur. We determined 
that a change arising of this extent was unlikely.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Going concern 
Refer to note 1.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on the 
going concern basis, meaning that the Directors believe that 
the Group will have the cash resources it requires to settle its 
liabilities for the period extending 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
In concluding on this basis of preparation, the Directors have 
prepared a cash flow forecast extending to October 2018 
which is based on their best estimate of the expected financial 
performance of the Group.
In addition, the Directors have also prepared a sensitised cash 
flow forecast, covering the same period, that takes into 
account the financial impacts of a number of risks that the 
Directors believe have a reasonable likelihood of occurrence.
The Group recorded a net cash inflow during the year of 
£4,129k and ended the year with a cash balance of £5,129k. 
This net cash inflow was due to £6,023k of proceeds from the 
Group’s share issue during July 2016 and is offset by an 
operating cash outflow of £1,837k and an investing cash 
outflow of £56k.
The Directors have stated that the Group’s strategic focus is 
on the molecular diagnostic business and this is supported by 
investment in research and development included in the 
Group’s cash flow forecasts. Due to the fact that the 
Genedrive has not yet been commercialised, there is inherent 
uncertainty over the future profitability of the business and 
therefore the cash resources of the Group are forecast to 
reduce to a relatively low level during the forecast period, 
whilst remaining positive throughout.
We evaluated and challenged the Group’s future cash flow forecasts 
and the process by which they were drawn up. We compared the 
Group’s forecasts to the latest Board approved budget and found 
them to be consistent.
Our testing was focused on the key judgements and assumptions as 
follows:
 •
We have compared significant forecast revenue streams to 
supporting information including correspondence confirming 
funding and purchase orders and found these to be consistent. 
Where significant revenue streams have been forecast with 
reference to previous performance, we have compared these 
forecasts to equivalent amounts recognised in previous years 
and discussed with management the reasons for any significant 
variances.
 •
We have compared forecast costs to equivalent amounts 
incurred in previous years and discussed with management the 
reasons for any significant variances.
 •
We have challenged management’s sensitivity analysis in light of 
our understanding of the business and its environment, including 
matters that have arisen subsequent to the preparation of 
management’s forecasts. In particular we have focussed on 
forecast revenue that is not yet secured and management’s 
ability to control costs if necessary. We have found the sensitivity 
analysis performed to be sufficiently robust.
 •
We have performed additional sensitivity analysis to ascertain 
the magnitude of change in key estimates required for the cash 
headroom to be eliminated. When considered along with the 
mitigating actions that management could execute to reduce 
cash outflows, we determined that adverse variances of this 
extent were unlikely.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.
The Group comprises the following entities: genedrive plc, parent company of the Group; Epistem Limited; Epistem Inc; and Epistem 
SIP Trustee Limited.
The Group audit team in the UK performed an audit of the complete financial information of genedrive plc and Epistem Limited, which 
we regarded as financially significant components of the Group. These components accounted for 100% of the Group’s revenue and 
loss before tax, adjusted for the impairment of intangible assets.
Page Title at start: Content Section at start: genedrive plc Annual Report 2017
30
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent  
of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £255,400 (2016: £48,600).
How we determined it 5% of loss before tax, adjusted for the impairment of intangible assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, loss before tax, adjusted for the impairment 
of intangible assets, is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality.  
The range of materiality allocated across components was between £80,000 and £245,000.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £12,770 
(2016: £2,430) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:
 •
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 •
the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the 
date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report 
thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify 
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the company financial statements of genedrive plc for the year ended 30 June 2017.

General Information
genedrive plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the UK which changed its name from Epistem Holdings Plc on  
22 July 2016. 
genedrive plc is a public limited company, whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market.
genedrive plc and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) is a molecular diagnostics business developing and commercialising a low 
cost, rapid, versatile, simple to use and robust point of need or point of care diagnostics platform for the diagnosis of infectious 
diseases and for use in patient stratification (genotyping), pathogen detection and other indications. The Genedrive® platform and 
MTB/RIF test have been launched in India and a Genedrive® HCV test has been successfully assessed by the Institut Pasteur, Paris. 
The Group also provides contract research services to drug development companies under the Epistem brand name.
1. Significant accounting policies
This note provides a list of the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.  
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods represented in these 
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of accounting
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as 
adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, International Financial Reporting 
Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).  
They are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest one thousand (£k) except where otherwise indicated. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher 
degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements 
are disclosed below:
 •
Determining the value of Intangible Assets requires a judgement about the extent to which the relevant asset will be brought into 
economic use by the Company. R&D expenditure will generally be expensed unless associated income can be identified.
 •
Determining the market value of the Debt Component of the Convertible Bond requires the Board to make a judgement about the 
market rate of interest to apply to instrument of this nature.
 •
Determining the value of deferred income and expenditure requires an assessment of the duration of the contract to which the 
deferred income and expenditure relates, and informs decisions as to when to recognise revenue and whether to carry forward 
costs.
 •
Determining what components of expenditure fit the definitions of the R&D tax credit regime requires an estimation and 
interpretation of tax rules on research and development costs.
 •
Determining the value of a Derivative requires a judgement as to the most appropriate valuation model to be used.  
The Board seeks the opinion of experts in making this judgement.
 •
Determining the fair value of share options requires a judgment as to the most appropriate valuation model to be used. In applying 
the model requires a judgement as to the most appropriate interest rate and volatility level of the market value of the Company’s 
shares.

Notes to the Financial 
Statements  genedrive plc Annual Report 2017

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 12 months from the balance sheet date. Thus they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. In arriving at this conclusion the Directors have reviewed 
detailed forecast models for the Company and the Group. These models are based on best estimates of future performance and have 
been adjusted to reflect various scenarios and outcomes that could potentially impact the forecasts. The model outputs support the 
Directors' conclusion. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the 
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, 
balances and unrealised gains on transaction between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Where 
necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.
On 16 March 2007 genedrive plc (formerly Epistem Holdings Plc) merged with Epistem Ltd, and on that date the shareholders of 
Epistem Ltd exchanged their shares for equivalent shares in Epistem Holdings Plc. As Epistem Holdings Plc was newly incorporated at 
the time of the transaction under the terms of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse 
acquisition, on the basis that the shareholders of Epistem Ltd gained a controlling interest in the Group. The financial statements 
therefore represent a continuation of the financial statements of Epistem Ltd.
Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and net of discounts and sales-related taxes.
Revenue recognition
a. Contract revenue
Contract revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the related transaction at the end of the reporting period. 
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured; when it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the entity; and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below.
b. Collaboration & licensing revenue
Contractually agreed upfront payments and similar non-refundable payments in respect of collaboration or licence agreements which 
are not directly related to on-going research activity are recorded as deferred income and recognised as revenue over the anticipated 
duration of the agreement. Where the anticipated duration of the agreement is modified, the period over which revenue is recognised 
is also modified.
Non-refundable milestone and other payments that are linked to the achievement of significant and substantive technological or 
regulatory hurdles in the research and development process are recognised as revenue upon the achievement of the specified 
milestone. 
Income which is related to on-going research activity is recognised as the research activity is undertaken, in accordance with the 
contract.

c. Other income – development grant funding
Income receivable in the form of Government grants to fund product development is recognised as development grant funding over 
the periods in which the Group recognises, as expenses, the related eligible costs which the grants are intended to compensate and 
when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the income will be 
received. Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase or otherwise acquire non-current assets are 
recognised as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a 
systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets. 
Segment reporting
A segment is a group of assets, liabilities and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and 
returns that are different from those of other parts of the business. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Research and development
Research expenditure is written off as it is incurred. Development expenditure is written off as it is incurred up to the point of technical 
and commercial validation. Thereafter, costs that are measurable and attributable to the project are carried forward as intangible 
assets, subject to having met the following criteria:
 •
demonstration that the product will generate profitable future economic benefit and of an intention and ability to sell the product;
 •
assessment of technical feasibility;
 •
confirmation of the availability of technical, financial and other resources to complete the development;
 •
management intends to complete the development so the product will be available for use; and
 •
the expenditure attributable to the development can be reliably measured.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated 
so as to write off the cost of an intangible asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset, as follows:
 •
Acquired intellectual property – the shorter of 5% straight line basis or their estimated useful life
 •
Developed intellectual property – the shorter of 10% straight line basis or their estimated useful life
 •
Patents – over the shorter of 17 years or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis
No amortisation is charged on those assets which are not yet available for use.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is 
calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, over the useful economic life of that asset as follows:
Lab equipment – 25% reducing balance basis
Fixtures & fittings – straight line over 48 months
Other equipment – straight line over 48 months
Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are 
charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life or intangible assets not ready to use are not subject to amortisation and are tested 
annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which 
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
largely independent cash inflows (Cash Generating Units). Prior impairments of non-financial assets are reviewed for possible reversal 
at each reporting date.
Foreign currencies
(a) Functional and presentation currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling 
which is the group’s presentation currency. 
(b) Transactions and balances 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year 
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Income Statement, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges. Non-monetary items carried at fair value and denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when fair value is determined. The foreign currency risks relating 
to assets and liabilities are detailed in note 20.
Share based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees (including Directors). The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the options is calculated using appropriate valuation models and is recognised as an 
expense over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted. Fair value 
is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, experience and behavioural considerations.
At each Balance Sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. 
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to 
equity, over the remaining vesting period. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. 
The issuance by the Company of share options to employees of its subsidiary represents additional capital contributions and the fair 
value of such options and awards is therefore recognised as an increase in the Company’s investment in Group undertakings with a 
corresponding increase in total equity shareholders’ funds.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 June 2017

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The Company operates a SIP scheme and has a policy not to issue new shares to settle the liability, but rather offer the cash equivalent to 
employees. The liability to settle the shares accrued under the SIP scheme is thus treated as a cash settled liability on the Balance Sheet 
with the cost of the liability being expensed to the income statement. The Balance Sheet liability is adjusted periodically to reflect the 
change in the share price over the life of the scheme with the movement taken to the income statement. Any shares bought in 
anticipation of settling the SIP scheme are held as a debit in reserves. Where a leaver requests to take shares instead of cash, as 
permitted under the SIP scheme, the historic cost of shares acquired is moved from reserves to the balance sheet liability.
Pension Contributions
Contributions to personal pension plans of employees on a defined contributions basis are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they are payable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a first in and first out basis and includes 
bought in cost and, where appropriate, other direct costs. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less applicable 
selling costs. Where applicable, provision is made for slow-moving and obsolete inventory.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other debtors are recognised and carried forward at invoiced amounts less provisions for any doubtful debts. Bad debts 
are written off when identified. After initial recognition, these are carried forward at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are included in the Balance Sheet at cost. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand 
and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are recognised initially at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs 
associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated income account when liabilities are derecognised or 
impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment. An impairment is recognised when the recoverable 
amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or 
substantively enacted, by the Balance Sheet date.
Taxation credits which fall under the category of Above the Line Research & Development Credits (ATL Research Credit) as detailed in 
the Finance Act 2013 are offset against the expenditure to which they relate and, in the Statement of Profit and Loss, are disclosed 
within Contract and Discovery and development costs, as appropriate.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences identified at the Balance Sheet date, except to the extent that the 
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of the Group’s 
assets and liabilities and their tax base.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the 
deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where an entity has a legally 
enforceable right to offset and either intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except where the 
timing of reversal of the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the average tax 
rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax 
consequence expected to fall from the manner in which the asset or liability is recovered or settled.
Financial instruments (including Convertible Bond)
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for, according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as either financial 
assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of 
the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
As disclosed in note 18, the Company has in issue a convertible bond which is a compound instrument comprising a liability 
component, or debt host, and an equity derivative component. 
On initial recognition, convertible bonds are recorded at fair value net of issue costs. The initial fair value of the debt host is 
determined using the market interest rate applied by a market participant for an equivalent non-convertible debt instrument. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the debt host is recorded using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion or 
maturity of the bonds. The amortisation of the debt host and the interest payable in each accounting period is expensed as a finance 
cost.
Equity derivatives embedded in the convertible instruments which are required to be recorded as financial liabilities are initially 
recognised at fair value. At each reporting date, the fair values of the derivative are reassessed by management. Where there is no 
market for such derivatives, the Company uses option pricing models to measure the fair value.
The amortisation of the debt host, interest payable in the period and gains or losses on the fair value of the derivative are disclosed 
with Finance income and costs detailed in note 6.
Parent Company assets
The assets of the parent Company are subject to impairment review in each financial period.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The Group has not early adopted any standards in the current or prior year. The following amendments have been adopted in the year:
 •
IFRS 1 “Clarification of the meaning of ‘effective IFRSs’” 
 •
IFRS 3 “Clarification of the scope exclusion for joint ventures” 
 •
IFRS 13 “Clarification of the scope of the portfolio exemption”
 •
IAS 40 “Clarification of the relationship between IFRS 3 and IAS 40” 
 •
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 cycle (Dec 2014) 
 •
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 cycle (Dec 2013) 
The above interpretations and revised standard have not had any material impact on the amounts reported in these financial 
statements or the disclosures required.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 30 June 2017

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
 •
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
 •
IFRS 14 Regulatory deferral accounts 
 •
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers
 •
IFRS 16 Leases 
 •
IRFIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 
 •
Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure initiative 
 •
Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 The application of the investment entities exemptions 
 •
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture 
 •
Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for acquisitions of interest in joint operations
 •
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation 
 •
Amendments to IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements 
 •
Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses
 •
Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure initiative 
 •
Amendment to IAS16 and 41 Agriculture: Bearer plants
 •
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 cycle (Sep 2014) 
 •
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 cycle (Dec 2016) 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of 
the Group in future periods, except as follows: 
IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments; IFRS 15 may have an impact on revenue disclosures 
but is unlikely to impact significantly the financial statements; and IFRS 16 will impact the recognition, measurement and disclosure of 
operating leases. It is considered that the amount of lease assets and liabilities requiring recognition on the Group Balance Sheet 
as the lessee recognises a ‘right-of-use’ asset for all leases will not be material. It is anticipated that finance charges will require 
reclassification in the Group income statement. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial 
estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
2. Segment information
For internal reporting and decision making, the Group is organised into three operating divisions – Preclinical Research Services, 
Pharmacogenomic Services and Diagnostics. Preclinical Research Services provides pre-clinical testing services. Pharmacogenomic 
Services specialises in molecular measures of biological effect. Diagnostics is commercialising the Genedrive® Point of Need 
molecular testing platform.
The chief operating decision maker primarily relies on turnover and operating profit to assess the performance of the Group and make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment. Geographical factors are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, 
but as substantially all operating activities are undertaken from the UK, geography is not a significant factor for the Group.  
Accordingly, only sales have been analysed into geographical statements.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
No deferred tax assets are recognised at 30 June 2017 (2016: £nil). Having reviewed future profitability in the context of trading losses 
carried, it is not probable that there will be sufficient profits available to set against brought forward losses.
The Group had losses, as computed for tax purposes, of approximately £9,455k (2016: £8,513k) available to carry forward to future 
periods.
A change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellor’s Budget on 16 March 2016. The change announced is to 
reduce the main tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020. Changes to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 19% from 19% from 1 April 2017 and 
to 18% from 1 April 2020 had already been substantially enacted on 26 October 2015.
As the change to 17% had not been substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date, its effects are not included in these financial 
statements. If the change had applied to the deferred tax balance at the Balance Sheet date, the overall effect on both the deferred 
tax balance and tax credit for the year is not material. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act 2000 in respect of research and development allowances, the Group is entitled 
to claim tax credits for certain research and development expenditure. These credits are disclosed partly as Above The Line Research 
& Development Credits (ATL Research Credits) within Research and Development Costs and partly as Research and Development tax 
credits within Taxation on ordinary activities. The total amount included in the financial statements in respect of the year ended 
30 June 2017 is £1,220k (2016: £763k) which includes £162k (2016: £151k) disclosed as ATL Research Credit deducted from Research 
and Development Costs with the balance of £1,051k (2016: £582k) disclosed within Taxation on ordinary activities as detailed above.
8. Profit attributable to members of the Parent Company
The loss dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company was £24,812k (2016: loss of £1,378k).

The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
As the Company is loss making, no potentially dilutive options have been added into the EPS calculation. Had the Company made a 
profit in the period: there would be no potentially dilutive share options because as shown in note 19, all share options in issue are 
underwater and there would be 90,175 of dilutive SIP shares, (as described in note 19, the total accrued shares under the SIP is 217,967 
and the Company holds 127,801 to meet the SIP commitments).

The net book value of Intangible assets all relates to the Genedrive® unit and assays (2016: £6,273k). The charges for amortisation are 
included in the Contract and Research and Development expense headings. During the year to 30 June 2017, the cost of the 
Company’s Patents assessed as not being available for economic use amounted to £nil (2016: £nil). 
During the year the Intangible assets have been assessed for impairment in accordance with the Company’s Accounting Policies. The 
recoverable amount was determined on a value in use basis using the management approved 12 month forecasts. The base 12 month 
projection was inflated for years two and three and then deflated down to zero in year four – as the estimated useful economic life of 
the assets in their current state without further investment is three and a half years. These projected cash flows were discounted at a 
pre-tax discount rate of 12.5%. As a result of this analysis the carrying value of the intangible assets at 30 June 2017 was reduced to 
£3,038k (2016: £6,273k) and an impairment charge of £2,379k (2016: £nil) was booked during the period. The Group has conducted 
sensitivity analysis on the impairment test. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 16.5% would still support the carrying value of 
the intangible assets of £3,038k. A reduction in the year two and year three growth rate of 7.5% would still support the carrying value 
of the intangible assets of £3,038k.

The deferred consideration relates to the acquisition of Visible Genomics Ltd in July 2010. Under the terms of the acquisition £1,250k 
becomes payable in the form of shares in genedrive plc to the former owner of Visible Genomics Ltd. The liability becomes payable 
on the achievement of certain milestones. At 30 June 2017, the Directors reviewed the terms of the earn-out milestones and consider 
that the criteria will be met during a period greater than twelve months but less than five years following the Balance Sheet date.  
The liability is therefore classified as non-current.

Collaboration and Convertible Bond Purchase Agreement
On 21 July 2014, the Company entered into a Collaboration and Convertible Bond Purchase Agreement (‘Agreement’) with the Global 
Health Investment Fund 1 LLC (‘GHIF’ or the ‘bond holder’). The purpose of the Agreement was to fund the Company’s development, 
production and commercialisation of Genedrive® to address Global Health Challenges and achieve Global Health Objectives. Under 
the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued to GHIF a five-year Convertible Bond, with a 5% coupon payable half yearly, totalling 
$8.0m. Further, as part of the Agreement, GHIF and the Company entered into a Global Access Commitment. Under the Global 
Access Commitment, the Company will undertake appropriate regulatory strategic steps and registrations to secure access for 
Genedrive® in developing countries in tuberculosis, malaria or other infectious diseases as agreed between the parties. In addition 
the Company will establish a tiered pricing framework that is commercially reasonable and reflects the needs of poor patients in 
developing countries. The Company will, taking into account its profitability and other commercial interests, allocate sufficient capacity 
and product distribution to make Genedrive® and its assays accessible to people most in need in developing countries. In return GHIF 
will use commercially reasonable efforts through its global access network to ensure support for the Company in placing Genedrive® 
and its assays in global territories to reflect the needs and price sensitivity of poor patients in the developing world. Notwithstanding 
any early Conversion, Redemption or Termination of the agreement, the Global Access Commitment shall endure for five years from 
22 July 2014.
During the period of the Agreement, the Company has entered into undertakings commensurate with a Convertible Bond
Agreement. These include: undertakings relating to incurring financial indebtedness and financial default; undertakings relating to 
maintenance of appropriate records; undertakings relating to standards of social responsibility and ethical behaviour.
Deed of Amendment to Convertible Bond Purchase Agreement
On 23 June 2016, the Company and GHIF entered into a Deed of Amendment & Restatement of the Agreement, which came into 
effect on 11 July 2016. The principal effects of the Deed of Amendment were:
 •
To extended the maturity of the GHIF Bond by two years to 21 July 2021. 
 •
To split the GHIF Bond into two tranches: the first tranche of US$2m has a Conversion Price of £1.50 per Ordinary Share and the 
second tranche of US$6m has a Conversion Price remaining at £4.89 per Ordinary Share. 
 •
To change the Company conversion option, on the first tranche of US$2m into new Ordinary Shares in circumstances where the 
average closing price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares is greater than or equal to £2.50 per ordinary Share for a period of 20 
consecutive days.
 •
To allow, for interest periods ending on or before (but not after) 21 January 2019, the Company to elect to pay none or a portion of 
the 5% interest payable semi-annually on the accrued and outstanding principal amount of the GHIF Bond and instead capitalise 
and compound some or all of such outstanding interest due until the earlier of the date on which the GHIF Bond is repaid if 
converted into Ordinary Shares.

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
Accounting
Due to the Convertible Bond being denominated in a different currency to the Company’s functional currency, IFRS requires the 
Convertible Bond to be accounted for as a compound instrument, comprising a Debt Host (liability component) and a Derivative 
(equity component). The Debt host is required to be recorded initially at fair value. Whilst the coupon is 5%, IFRS requires that the fair 
value is calculated based on the rate of interest which a market participant would lend to the Company. Given the nature of the 
Company’s activities, the Company has used a rate of 10.0% in calculating this liability. The Derivative has been valued using a Quanto 
Option Valuation model which takes account of the multicurrency aspects of the Convertible Bond. The variables used in running the 
model are as follows: volatility of the Company’s Share Price 24%, expected life of the Derivative 4.4 years, risk free interest rate 
0.58% and a dividend yield of 0%.

(B) Share Investment Plan
The Company operates a share investment plan, SIP, (The Epistem Share Investment Plan) which is open to Directors and employees 
in accordance with Inland Revenue approved rules. Under the terms of the SIP, Directors and employees may invest up to £150 per 
month to be invested in ordinary shares (“Partnership Shares”) in the Company at the prevailing market price. Participants, may 
withdraw their Matching Shares once their associated Partnership Shares have been held for three years. At the same time as each 
monthly subscription, a maximum of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share is accrued by the Company on behalf of the SIP’s 
participants. The Matching shares vest after three years, if an employee leave the Company, unvested shares lapse. The monthly cost 
of the Matching Shares is expensed to the income statement. 
At 30 June 2017 the number of partnership shares earnt by employees was 73,350. The total number of potential Matching Shares 
provided for employees at 30 June should all the employees meet the three year vesting rule was 144,626. Of the 144,626 shares 
27,540 have vested under the three years service rule.
In order to satisfy the shares accumulated as both Partnership and the Matching Shares, Epistem SIP Trustee Ltd, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the Company, periodically purchases shares on behalf of the scheme’s participants. At the balance sheet date Epistem 
SIP Trustee Ltd owned 127,801 (2016: 134,046) shares in the Company. The historic cost of the purchased shares is recorded as a debit 
in reserves and the movement over the period is record below.

20. Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group holds or issues financial instruments in order to achieve two main objectives, being:
(a) to finance its operations;
(b)  to manage its exposure to interest and currency risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments (e.g. trade receivables, trade payables, accruals and prepayments) arise directly from the 
Group’s and the Company’s operations.
Transactions in financial instruments result in the Group assuming or transferring to another party one or more of the financial risks 
described below.
Interest rate risk
The Group currently finances its operations through reserves of cash and liquid resources. In addition to equity, the Group’s capital 
structure includes $8m Convertible Bond detailed at note 18. The coupon on the Convertible Bond is fixed at 5%. Surplus cash at bank 
is placed on deposits at variable rates. The Board monitors the financial markets and the Group’s own requirements to ensure that the 
policies are exercised in the Group’s best interests. 
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a possible change in interest rates on the Group’s profit before tax through the 
impact of floating rate cash balances.

An increase in 25 basis points would have a similar opposite effect.
Capital management
The Group’s objective in managing its capital is to ensure that the Group has adequate capital to fund is trading operations and 
ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. In achieving this objective, the Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce its cost of capital and provide returns for shareholders.
In managing its capital, the Group may from time to time issue new shares, sell assets or issue other capital instruments to optimise its 
capital structure. In July 2016 the Company issued 8,125,000 new shares as described in note 23.

Credit risk
The Group monitors credit risk closely and considers that its current policies of credit checks meet its objectives of managing 
exposure to credit risk.

which are not invoiced in sterling and foreign denominated cash held in UK banks . There are no significant costs incurred that involve 
payments in foreign currency. The Group has no forward contracts at the year end (2016: £nil) to manage foreign currency risk.

At the Balance Sheet date there are two potentially convertible arrangements that could result in the issue of additional shares:
1. Note 17 details the contingent consideration paid to acquire Visible Genomics Ltd. At the satisfaction of certain milestones 
£1,250,000 becomes payable in the form of shares in genedrive plc to the former owner of Visible Genomics Ltd. At a 30 June 
2017 share price of 42.5p the number of shares required to satisfy this consideration would be 2,941,176.
2. Note 18 details the terms of the Convertible Bond Agreement entered into on 21 July 2014. The Agreement was amended by a 
Deed of Amendment and Restatement on 23 June 2016 which came into force on 11 July 2016. Under the terms of the amended 
Agreement, if a conversion occurs in respect of $2.0m at an initial conversion price of £1.50 per share at the fixed exchange rate of 
$1.6913:£1 together with $6.0m at an initial conversion price of £4.89 per share at the fixed exchange rate of $1.6913:£1, this would 
result in the issue of 1,513,821 shares (2016: 1,513,821). 
24. Reserves
The reverse acquisition reserve arises as a difference on consolidation under merger accounting principles and is solely in respect of 
the merger of the Company and Epistem Ltd, during the year ended 30 June 2007.
The employee share incentive plan reserve represents 127, 801 shares in Epistem Holdings Plc (2016: 134,046 shares) all of which are 
held by Epistem SIP Trustee Ltd. These shares are listed on the Alternative Investment Market and their market value at 30 June 2017 
was £54,315 (2016: £120,641). The nominal value held at 30 June 2017 was £1,917 (2016: £2,011).
The separate financial statements of genedrive plc are presented on pages 65 to 70.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclose Framework 
(FRS101) and in accordance with applicable accounting standards. They are therefore presented separately to the Group consolidated 
financial statements which have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards.

Opinion
In our opinion, genedrive plc’s company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 •
give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of its cash flows for the year then ended;
 •
have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 •
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the company balance sheet, the 
company statement of changes in equity, and the company statement of cash flows; and the notes to the financial statements, which 
include a description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Report (Company) genedrive plc Annual Report 2017

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting treatment related to convertible bond
Refer to note 18.
During the year, the company entered into a Deed of Amendment 
with the Global Health Investment Fund (‘GHIF’) that modified the 
terms of the USD 8m convertible bond issued in 2014.
The modification has been treated as an extinguishment of the 
previous financial liability which has been de-recognised and a new 
financial liability recognised in its place. The difference between 
these two liabilities of £380k has been recorded as a gain.
The new financial liability has been measured at amortised cost 
using management’s estimate of a market interest rate for a 
similar instrument excluding the conversion option.
We read the Deed of Amendment and considered management’s 
proposed accounting treatment. Our testing focussed on the key 
judgements and estimates as follows:
 •
In concluding that the modification should be treated as an 
extinguishment of the previous financial liability, management 
calculated the impact on the future cash flows of the change 
in terms. We reviewed this analysis and found it to be 
appropriate.
 •
We assessed the interest rate used in valuing the new 
financial liability and consider this to be within a reasonable 
range.
Going concern
Refer to Basis of accounting note.
The company financial statements have been prepared on the 
going concern basis, meaning that the Directors believe that the 
company will have the cash resources it requires to settle its 
liabilities for the period extending 12 months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements.
In concluding on this basis of preparation, the Directors have 
prepared a cash flow forecast extending to October 2018 which 
is based on their best estimate of the expected financial 
performance of the company.
In addition, the Directors have also prepared a sensitised cash 
flow forecast, covering the same period, that takes into account 
the financial impacts of a number of risks that the Directors 
believe have a reasonable likelihood of occurrence.
The company recorded a net cash inflow during the year of 
£3,781k and ended the year with a cash balance of £4,105k. This 
net cash inflow was due to £6,023k of proceeds from the 
company’s share issue during July 2016 and is offset by an 
operating cash outflow of £2,242k.
The Directors have stated that the company’s strategic focus is 
on the molecular diagnostic business and this is supported by 
investment in research and development included in the 
company’s cash flow forecasts. Due to the fact that the 
Genedrive has not yet been commercialised, there is inherent 
uncertainty over the future profitability of the business and 
therefore the cash resources of the company are forecast to 
reduce to a relatively low level during the forecast period, whilst 
remaining positive throughout.
We evaluated and challenged the company’s future cash flow 
forecasts and the process by which they were drawn up. We 
compared the company’s forecasts to the latest Board approved 
budget and found them to be consistent.
Our testing was focused on the key judgements and assumptions 
as follows:
 •
We have compared significant forecast revenue streams to 
supporting information including correspondence confirming 
funding and purchase orders and found these to be 
consistent. Where significant revenue streams have been 
forecast with reference to previous performance, we have 
compared these forecasts to equivalent amounts recognised 
in previous years and discussed with management the 
reasons for any significant variances.
 •
We have compared forecast costs to equivalent amounts 
incurred in previous years and discussed with management 
the reasons for any significant variances.
 •
We have challenged management’s sensitivity analysis in light 
of our understanding of the business and its environment, 
including matters that have arisen subsequent to the 
preparation of management’s forecasts. In particular we have 
focussed on forecast revenue that is not yet secured and 
management’s ability to control costs if necessary. We have 
found the sensitivity analysis performed to be sufficiently 
robust.
 •
We have performed additional sensitivity analysis to ascertain 
the magnitude of change in key estimates required for the 
cash headroom to be eliminated. When considered along with 
the mitigating actions that management could execute to 
reduce cash outflows, we determined that adverse variances 
of this extent were unlikely.

Report on the audit of the company financial statements

Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the structure of the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which it operates.
All material financial statement line items were audited.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality £89,900 (2016: £46,170).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that total assets is the primary measure used by the shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the entity, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £4,495 (2016: £2,430) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
 •
the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
 •
the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report certain 
opinions and matters as described below.
Page Title at start: Content Section at start: genedrive plc Annual Report 2017

Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not 
identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are 
also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either 
intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 •
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 •
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
 •
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 •
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation, International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations 
Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial 
liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements have been disclosed in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group above.
The Company is wholly owned subsidiary of genedrive plc and is included in the consolidated financial statements of genedrive plc 
which are publically available. 
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 12 months from the balance sheet date. Thus they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. In arriving at this conclusion the Directors have reviewed detailed forecast 
models for the Company and the Group. These models are based on best estimates of future performance and have been adjusted to 
reflect various scenarios and outcomes that could potentially impact the forecasts. The model outputs support the Directors' conclusion. 
a. Investments
The Company is the holding company of the Group. The Company owns 100% of the issued share capital of Epistem Ltd, Epistem SIP 
Trustees Ltd and Epistem Inc. incorporated in the United States of America. The principal activities of the subsidiary companies are:
 •
Epistem Ltd - the provision of services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries; incorporated in England1
 •
Epistem Inc. - the provision of services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries; Incorporated in the USA
2
 •
Epistem SIP Trustees Ltd - to act as trustee to the Epistem Share Incentive Plan; incorporated in England

On 28 July 2010, Epistem Holdings Plc acquired 100% of the share capital of Visible Genomics Ltd, whose
1 The Incubator Building, Grafton Street, Manchester, M13 9XX
2 One Broadway, 14th Floor, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA
Principal activity had been the development of diagnostic assays and equipment. The assets and liabilities of Visible Genomics were 
hived into Epistem Ltd and Visible Genomics Ltd ceased to trade. Following a variation of Purchase and Sales agreement agreed with 
the vendor of Visible Genomics Ltd on 5 March, 2015, the following ‘earn-out’ of deferred consideration payable to the vendors of 
Visible Genomics Ltd remained outstanding:
Group
2017
£’000
2016
£’000
Deferred consideration payable in shares
·  Achievement of commercial milestones relating to Genedrive sales 1,250 1,250
The commercial milestones referred to above and outstanding at 30 June 2017 £1,250k (2016:£1,250k) relate to the recognition of £5m 
of Genedrive® related income or contractual commitments from any of a list of 16 IVD companies which provide a minimum combined 
value of £5m.
The deferred consideration above is payable in shares. The value at which shares are to be issued is to be calculated by reference to 
LSE daily share price over a five day period commencing 30 days after the date that the achievement of the milestone(s) is 
announced. The Consideration shares are subject to a “lock-in” provision, under which the Vendor covenants not to sell consideration 
shares for a period of up to 24 months without the consent of the Company, except in the event that an offer for the whole of the 
issued share capital of the Company is received and which is either recommended by the Board or becomes unconditional as to 
acceptances. In the event that an offer for the whole of the issued share capital of the Company or for the Genedrive® business is 
received and which is either recommended by the Board or is declared unconditional as to acceptances, then, the Vendor will 
become entitled to be allotted shares in the Company up to a maximum value of £2.65m, save to the extent that consideration shares, 
as detailed above, have already been issued. The value at which these shares are issued will be the relevant offer price.

The Board is of the opinion that, as at 30 June 2017, the value of further consideration of £1,250k (2016: £1.25m) was capable of 
assessment and provision for this liability has been made in these accounts. Based on the share price of 42.5p at 30 June 2017, this 
would result in the issue of 2,941,177 shares.

Additions in the year ended 30 June 2017 comprised the fair value of the share options issued to employees of the subsidiary 
undertaking during the period of £101k (2016: £217k). Full details of the share options issued are set out in note 19 to the consolidated 
financial statements. Following an impairment review, the carrying value of the investments were impaired by £2,615k (2016: £nil).
During the year the carrying value of Investments and the recoverability of amounts receivable from Group undertakings were 
assessed for impairment in accordance with the Company’s Accounting Policies. The recoverable amount was determined on a value 
in use basis using the management approved 12 month forecasts. The base 12 month projection was inflated for years two to five at a 
growth rate of 5% in each year. For years five to ten there was no growth assumed. These projected cash flows were discounted at a 
pre-tax discount rate of 12.5%. As a result of this analysis the carrying value of the investments at 30 June 2017 was reduced to £4,101k 
(2016: £6,273k) and an impairment charge of £2,615k (2016: £nil) was booked during the period. In addition the carrying value of 
receivables from Group undertakings was reduced to £784k (2016: £20,542k) and an impairment charge of £22,000k (2016: £nil) was 
booked during the period.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 15.5% or a reduction 
in the year two to five growth rate to 0% would still support the carrying value of investments and receivables in the Balance Sheet.

an impairment provision of £22,000k was required at the Balance Sheet date (2016: £nil), and the receivable was forgiven down to

Cash and cash equivalents comprise current accounts held by the Company with immediate access and short term bank deposits with 
a maturity of three months or less. Market rates of interest are earned on such deposits. The credit risk on such funds is limited 
because the counter parties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

restated on 11 July 2016. Full details of the bond and the amendment can be found under note 18 of the main Company accounts.
