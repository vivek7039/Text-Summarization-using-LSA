I
hope that after studying this report 
you will be pleased – as I am – at the 
way the business and the reputation 
of the Group has moved forward 
through 2014, positioning ourselves to 
take full advantage of the recovery in 
the economy .
Overview of 2014 activity
In the course of the year under review , we 
acquired two top UK shopping centres, 
intu Merry Hill and intu Derby . This takes 
our ownership to nine of the top 20 
shopping centres in the UK. Both of these 
centres have enormous potential and we 
are already seeing the benefits of our asset 
management as rental values and market 
values have increased significantly in our 
eight months of ownership.
And in Spain, we announced the acquisition 
of a top shopping centre, Puerto Venecia 
in Zaragoza, which completed in January 
2015. This demonstrates the seriousness 
of our intent to grow our business there. 
The centre will be a model for creating 
high-quality shopping resorts at our 
Spanish development options.
We have completed a two-year 
programme for refinancing the majority 
of the Group’s debt. Throughout this 
period we have increased the tenor and 
reduced the average cost of our debt. 
This strengthening of our financial position 
means that we are well placed to advance 
our development pipeline.
2014 also saw us complete the food court 
redevelopment at intu Lakeside and the 
transformation of the malls at intu Eldon 
Square. In addition, we commenced two 
major catering and leisure projects at intu 
Victoria Centre and intu Potteries and we 
have moved the major extension at intu 
W atford forward to the point where we 
intend to commence the development 
in 2015.
Our branding, now two years old, is gaining 
significant traction, the result of a fruitful 
combination of the customer service in 
our centres and our digital platform. In our 
centres we introduced T ell intu allowing us 
to meet customers’ changing requirements 
faster . Customer satisfaction has improved 
measurably since its introduction. Digitally , 
we now have the majority of our major 
retailers on our website, intu.co.uk, with 
the likes of John Lewis, Next and T opshop 
added this year . As well as half of the UK’s 
population visiting an intu centre at some 
point in the year , we now have nearly two 
million individuals on our online database.
Through all these actions, as well as the 
groundwork in previous years, we have 
delivered a total shareholder return of 
24 per cent in 2014.
May I refer you to the interview with our 
Chief Executive on pages 16 and 17 where 
David Fischel answers a number of key 
questions about the business and to the 
financial review presented by our Chief 
Financial Officer , Matthew Roberts, on 
pages 40 to 46, where you will find a more 
detailed assessment of our achievements, 
our challenges and our strategy .

Dividends
Y our Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 9.1 pence per share, bringing 
the amount paid and payable in respect 
of 2014 to 13.7 pence, unchanged from 
the bonus factor adjusted 2013 dividend. 
A scrip dividend alternative will be offered.
Looking forward
Over the last few years we have positioned 
ourselves for the upturn in the economy . 
I believe we are now beginning to see 
sustained, though small, improvements in 
disposable income, generally responding to 
wage increases running ahead of inflation 
and lower fuel prices. Uncertainties and 
fragility remain, and this is not confined 
just to the economic sphere: some 
measure of caution is still therefore 
desirable. Retailers have also had a good 
end to 2014, which along with improved 
consumer confidence should see them 
growing their businesses.
Through the enhancements we have been 
making to our centres, in terms of the retail 
and leisure mix, our world class customer 
service and our digital platform, we are 
well placed to deliver a favourable trading 
environment for retailers.
We will continue to build our business in 
Spain, driving our developments there 
forward to replicate our successful 
UK model. 
We remain focused on delivering strong 
returns over the medium term through 
rental growth in our existing assets, 
superior returns from our development 
pipeline and the increasing strength of 
our brand.

Corporate responsibility
Our centres make an important 
contribution to their local neighbourhood 
both because of their location and our 
close and necessary engagement with the 
communities around us. Responding to our 
corporate responsibility is an integral part 
of our commercial life through community , 
environmental and stakeholder initiatives.
Our success in this field has been 
validated by the achievement of several 
high-profile awards. We once again 
achieved the Business in the Community 
CommunityMark award, one of only 52 
companies to be accredited. This year 
we were awarded the ‘Best in continuing 
Carbon Reduction’ at the Carbon T rust 
Standard Bearers Awards, for decreasing 
our carbon emissions by 30 per cent in 
three years. Y ou can read more about this 
amazing achievement on page 51.
Throughout the year we have run projects 
encouraging and supporting employee 
mentoring and volunteering. 
Our people
I would like to record my thanks to the 
Board and, with my fellow Directors, our 
thanks to all our staff for their commitment 
and dedication to intu’s values and vision in 
the year .
The creation of intu Retail Services in 
2013 has led to a greater sense of unity 
within the Group and in 2014 we have not 
neglected to ensure that all our staff have 
the right skills and training for their roles. 
Through these endeavours we have seen a 
more motivated and committed workforce, 
with a dramatic reduction in staff who 
leave within their first year of service.
I am glad to report that our approach was 
recognised when we received the Premises 
& Facilities Management Partner in Retail 
Facilities award this year . We are the only 
shopping centre business to be accredited 
by the Institute of Customer Service.

Creating compelling experiences
The value we add
We provide customers with a shopping 
experience that attracts people for longer , 
more often
We use insights from our in-depth customer research to 
understand what customers want from their shopping experience. 
T o satisfy this expectation, our centres need to provide not only 
the right mix of retail, leisure and catering, but also a distinctive 
events programme, digital connectivity and moments of surprise 
and delight.
T oday , our focus is on actively managing and developing our 
centres which are in some of the best locations across the country . 
2
Establishing enduring  
relationships with retailers
The value we add
We help retailers flourish
By creating great experiences for customers, we generate 
powerful footfall that attracts and retains the right mix  
of retailers and catering and leisure operators for our centres.
Our high footfall locations, along with the quality of the intu 
brand, give tenants the confidence that they can roll out nationally 
with intu. 
We maintain effective relationships and engage our tenants 
in the plans for and developments of our centres. 
3
Delivering long-term growth
The value we add
Sustainable value to our shareholders  
and the communities in which we operate
Through our brand, we create uniquely compelling experiences 
that surprise and delight our customers. This, coupled with our 
scale and flexibility , attracts retailers. 
We have nine of the UK’s top 20 centres and more than half of 
the UK’s population visit our centres each year . This ensures that 
occupancy remains strong. 
And this drives rental income over the long term.

Generating value 
for shareholders
The value we add
A trusted and recognisable name  
for both shoppers and retailers
Our thriving centres are sought-after investments, creating 
sustainable value for shareholders and supporting access 
to capital for reinvestment.
We invest in achieving our strategic aims (see page 14) by creating 
the perfect shopping experience and distinguishing Intu from 
our competitors.
Beyond financial value, great shopping centres create a vibrant 
hub for the community and make a significant economic 
contribution to the region. 
Putting our customers first ultimately creates value for 
our shareholders.

Our approach
Our corporate responsibility approach is 
based on three pillars of communities and 
economic contribution, environmental 
efficiency and relationships with 
our stakeholders.
In 2014 we reached the target of reducing 
our carbon emissions by 30 per cent 
compared with 2011 (like-for-like portfolio 
adjusted for occupancy). We also diverted 
over 97 per cent of waste away from 
landfill, recycled 69 per cent of waste and 
reduced water use by 2 per cent compared 
with 2011.
Our outstanding and sustained 
performance in energy efficiency was 
recognised by the Carbon T rust, which 
awarded us the ‘Best in continuing 
carbon reduction’ award at the Standard 
Bearers Awards. The award recognises the 
challenging 30 per cent reduction target 
we set ourselves and the work we have 
done to achieve this since 2011.
Once again in 2014 we were accredited 
with the BitC CommunityMark, one of only 
52 UK companies to receive the award. 
The CommunityMark is a national standard 
that publicly recognises leadership and 
excellence in the community .
In our joint community projects we work 
with local partners to help disadvantaged 
young people into work. During 2014, we 
worked with nine community partners 
delivering 21 projects at our centres. 
These projects have directly reached over 
1,200 people.
We continue to be included in FTSE4Good 
and the Dow Jones Sustainability Global 
Index and we were awarded the Green Star 
by GRESB. We have also received a gold 
ranking in the Mayor of London’s Business 
Energy Challenge for our two centres in 
Greater London and our head office.

At Intu we believe that

of the Company and be subject 
to the same quality of 
governance controls as other 
areas of the business. We want 
Intu to be a long-term and 
sustainable business – and we 
can only ensure that if we care

Our shopping centres are integral to 
the communities they serve. They build 
social togetherness by providing places 
for people to come together to meet, 
eat, drink and socialise. We also make 
an important contribution to the 
economic life within and beyond these 
communities, providing jobs for local 
people. Our centres support charities 
and community organisations that 
address fundamental issues in modern 
society which are important to the  
long-term success of our business, 
including youth, education and the 
prevention of anti-social behaviour .

Achieving Retail Gold
Since 2005, intu has supported the 
Retail Gold initiative to prepare young 
people for a career in retail, placing over 
300 students with retailers. This year 
we launched a tailored intu World Class 
Service module for students preparing for 
their retail placement. With intu Braehead 
we are also providing employability 
support to people attending classes 
at the Kirklandneuk Community Centre. 
We have a responsibility not just to 
manage and minimise our day-to-day 
environmental impacts but also to 
share good practices and influence our 
delivery partners, retailers and visitors 
towards more sustainable behaviour . 
Ultimately , we want to create a more 
sustainable operating environment.
We focus our efforts on the common 
areas of our shopping centres, where 
we have the biggest ability to drive 
change. Bringing facilities management 
under our control has further increased 
our oversight of the environmental 
efficiencies we can achieve. We target 
reductions in energy usage, increase 
in recycling levels, and decrease in 
water consumption.

Zero Waste Award
intu Chapelfield is the first shopping 
centre ever to win a Gold Zero Waste 
Award for its commitment to reducing 
waste to landfill. All staff and retailers are 
trained in recycling, sorting waste and 
reducing contamination and understand 
why the centre takes waste management 
so seriously. By the end of 2014 intu 
Chapelfield and nine other intu centres 
sent zero waste to landfill.
We need to understand the needs 
and expectations of a wide range of 
stakeholders in order to provide a 
business that offers a great shopping 
experience with informed investors, 
passionate employees and well-
supported communities. A key part of 
our corporate responsibility is managing 
and developing relationships with 
key stakeholders and engaging 
on relevant issues.
The main groups of stakeholders we 
engage with are:
 — C ommunities 
 — Customers
 — In v es t ors
 — Local and national government
 — Our peopl e
 — Retailers
 — Suppliers

T
he investment market is the 
strongest it has been for some 
years and we are seeing an 
upturn in the occupier market, 
but we are constantly aware of the 
evolving demands of the retail market. 
Investment market
The weight of money in the retail property 
market has remained strong and, with 
the increased availability of debt, has 
heightened demand and resulted in 
downward pressure on yields. The value 
of UK shopping centre investment 
transactions in 2014 was the highest for 
eight years and well above the long-term 
yearly average.
Shopping centre development is at 
low levels offering limited new supply . 
The majority of activity is focused 
on extensions and reconfigurations. 
The UK supply of new space in the year 
has declined by 75 per cent, from the peak 
in 2008, setting the stage for increased 
occupancy and robust rental growth.
Occupier market
The UK economy showed signs of 
continued improvement in 2014, with two 
full years of quarterly GDP growth and 
consumer confidence increasing through 
the year . This has been supported by an 
increase in the UK average household 
disposable income with the Asda 
benchmark index showing a rise of  
9 per cent over the year . The economy is 
starting to see year-on-year wage growth 
outpacing inflation and a lower oil price, 
which should give consumers a greater 
level of disposable income going into 2015.
Consumer spending has also continued 
to increase with higher like-for-like non-
food retail sales reported by the BRC 
throughout 2014, aggregating to 2.7 per 
cent for the year .
Retailer administrations in 2014 were at 
the lowest levels since 2010, according 
to the Centre for Retail Research, with 
Phones 4U and La Senza being the largest. 
They both closed all stores and accounted 
for approximately 1 per cent of Intu’s rent 
roll. Since the year end, two multibrand 
fashion retailers, Bank and USC, have 
entered administration, but continue to 
trade and account for approximately 1 per 
cent of the rent roll. 
Changing face of UK retail
Online sales continue to grow , with the 
Office of National Statistics estimating 
that, on average, 11.2 per cent of sales 
were conducted online in 2014, an increase 
from 10.4 per cent in 2013. Retailers need 
to offer a multichannel approach with 
shoppers now expecting consistent pricing 
and service across the physical store 
and online.
The UK’s most successful brands have 
generally developed a multichannel

offer and understand the power of the 
physical store in their strategy . As well as 
a profitable location in its own right, the 
store can also function as a showroom for 
the product or a distribution location for 
their online sales. More and more, retailers 
note that online customers are opting 
to click and collect, allowing the retailer 
to minimise their distribution costs and 
enhance sales through further purchases 
once in store.
As well as established physical retailers 
reviewing their portfolios to have space 
in the best retail locations, several online 
retailers are now seeing the need for a 
physical presence to improve their sales 
and marketing, with the likes of Simply 
Be building up a store network in key 
locations. Retailers need fewer stores to 
cover the UK population than 20 years 
ago but increasingly need to focus on 
prime destinations. 
Our focus has been to further enhance 
our centres as day-out family-friendly 
destinations offering unrivalled shopping, 
leisure and catering, supported by  
intu.co.uk and other digital and marketing 
opportunities. This has positioned us well 
to benefit from these changes.
Outlook
The retail sector has been changing at a 
rapid pace and change is likely to continue 
in 2015 as the UK economy continues to 
strengthen. The outlook for retail spending 
in 2015 is positive due to a combination of 
low inflation, reviving growth in earnings 
and resilience in the labour market, 
indicating that households’ real disposable 
incomes should increase over the course 
of the year .
We are strongly positioned to take 
advantage of increased demand from 
retailers. The supply of new space is limited. 
In 2008, a record year , over 8 million sq.  ft. 
of new shopping centre space was built 
in the UK. Levels fell with an all-time low 
in 2014 and even by 2019 the supply is 
only expected to have reached around 
3 million sq. ft.
The UK’ s most successful high 
street brands are, on the whole, 
those that have developed 
their multichannel offer as the 
e-commerce sector has grown, 
but their physical stores are 
still crucial. Shopping centres 
will remain at the forefront of 
the retail market but they must 
continually evolve to maintain 
their relevance in the modern 
retail environment

Across the sector we are expecting to see 
a focus in 2015 on improving the customer 
experience, with seamless multichannel 
engagement and an increasing sense 
of personalisation, showrooming and 
convenience. We believe that our active 
asset management and unique focus 
on creating the best possible customer 
experience will enable us to emerge as the 
leader of this trend among retail landlords. 
We recognise that the influence of digital 
technology will continue to dominate 
tactical and strategic decision-making 
across the industry . At Intu, we see the rise 
of multichannel retail – online, in-store, click 
and collect – as an opportunity rather than 
a threat. We have always striven to be at 
the forefront of technological advances 
and 2015 will be no different as we begin 
to develop further ways to utilise data 
gathered from our digital network. Intu Properties plc  –  Annual Report 2014

Q
    Y ou have a £1.3 billion pipeline 
of developments in the UK. 
How fast can we expect to see these 
developments and how will you 
fund them? 
A
   The development pipeline can be split 
into active management projects and 
major extensions. We have several 
ongoing active management projects, 
such as the leisure extension at intu 
Potteries and the refurbishment and 
restaurant quarter at intu Victoria 
Centre, both of which will be completed 
in the second half of 2015. We will also 
be commencing three other restaurant 
projects in the next few months. All  
these projects can be funded from our 
existing facilities.
  intu W atford is our most advanced 
major extension with planning 
approved, the anchor cinema let and 
over 50 per cent of the expected rent 
under offer . We anticipate beginning 
construction this year . The catalyst for 
our other extensions, the majority of 
which have planning approved, will be 
the required level of tenant interest. 
  We should not need additional equity to 
finance these projects. We can finance 
the extensions from existing available 
facilities, raising debt against the value 
created from completed developments 
and recycling capital from other 
assets to reinvest into these growth 
opportunities, including introducing 
partners into existing assets. The major 
developments are likely to be spread 
over a number of years so the proceeds 
from financing a completed project can 
be used to help finance the next one.
Q
  Y ou have recently acquired a second 
centre in Spain. Why is Spain such 
an attractive market for you and why 
do you think you can replicate your 
strategy there? 
A
   Spain has very attractive market 
dynamics with an economy moving 
out of recession and a sophisticated 
consumer and retail market, but a 
retail sector where ownership of the 
regional shopping centre market 
remains highly fragmented and without 
a large committed pipeline of new 
centres. It is a country where we see 
major opportunities for us to broaden 
our presence and further strengthen 
our position in the market. We believe 
such expansion will be beneficial to our 
overall brand and digital positioning.
    The country holds huge potential for 
the creation of genuinely regional 
destination centres in which we 
specialise. Eighty per cent of Spain’s 
retail expenditure comes from 10 
key catchments and we aim to be the 
leading owner , developer and manager 
of regionally pre-eminent shopping 
centre destinations for a significant 
number of those key areas. 
  The acquisition of Puerto Venecia 
in early 2015, after the successful 
acquisition of Parque Principado in 2013, 
substantially accelerates our activities 
in Spain.
  We also have development options 
on sites in Málaga, Palma, V alencia 
and Vigo. It is our intention, subject to 
shareholder approval, to exercise the 
Málaga option in March 2015. We are 
advancing the other sites to the point 
where we can consider exercising 
the options. 
Q
   Y ou have had a year of negative 
like-for-like net rental income. 
What specific actions are you taking 
to address this and when can we 
expect to see a turnaround? 
A
   Over the last three years we have 
successfully repositioned the Group 
so that we are now well placed to 
benefit from the improved confidence 
of shoppers and retailers. Rather than 
chasing a target level of occupancy 
throughout this period, we have instead 
concentrated on being selective and 
ensuring that we have the right tenants 
in the right space. This means we have 
not compromised on the quality of the 
tenant mix and have maintained or 
improved the tone of the rents in our 
prime centres. 
  While our results still reflect a lingering 
impact from the administrations of late 
2012 and early 2013, it is clear that this 
active asset management strategy is 
starting to pay off . For example, in the 
case of Republic, we took back all the 
units rather than let them at potentially 
lower rents to tenants who did not fit our 
desired retail mix. It took a year , but all of 
these units are now relet to top-quality 
brands, such as Hugo Boss, White Stuff , 
Superdry and Footasylum, at rents in line 
with the previous passing rent.

Intu’ s improved 2014 results 
demonstrate we are well 
positioned to benefit further 
from rising consumer confidence 
and strengthening demand 
from retailers for quality space. 
We welcome over 400 million

outstanding customer

  The remaining elements of the like-for-
like net rental income shortfall in 2014 
can be split into two areas. First, with our 
ongoing active management projects, 
in particular at intu Victoria Centre, we 
had to remove units from generating 
income while we reconfigured the 
centre to maximise rental potential on 
completion of the project. Secondly , 
there was a concentration of lease 
expiries at intu Braehead and intu 
Potteries this year . We repositioned key 
tenants, as we illustrated last year , and 
have now addressed the majority of the 
expiries but have operated with a higher 
vacancy level in these centres as a result. 
  Like-for-like net rental income is an 
important measure, but total property 
return, the combined income and capital 
returns, encompasses everything we 
do and is the overall measure on which 
we focus. Over the past five years, our 
annualised total property return of 9.9 
per cent per annum outperformed the 
IPD UK quarterly retail benchmark of 
9.2 per cent.
Q
   intu is the only national shopping 
centre brand. What value does this

brand was launched?
A
  Intu is one of the UK’s biggest retail 
landlords, and focused on providing 
a great experience for millions of 
UK shoppers with, according to 
our estimates, over half of the UK’s 
population visiting an intu centre 
every year .

  Our shoppers are at the heart of 
everything we do and providing 
them with compelling experiences 
also ensures that we establish 
enduring relationships with our 
retailers.  Our brand enables us to offer 
scalability to retailers and the size of 
the Group also helps to support the 
brand. Our national brand enables us 
to deliver experiences and events for 
the customer that ownership of a single 
centre could not, such as the Everyone’s 
Invited family friendly weekend of events 
in all our centres which increased footfall 
for the weekend year-on-year by around 
13 per cent.
  Our staff offer an unparalleled service 
and our digital platform gives customers 
access to brands in our centres 24 hours 
a day . Our online presence is growing 
rapidly with nearly three million visits 
to intu.co.uk in December 2014, a year-
on-year increase of almost 40 per cent. 
Our active marketing database is almost 
two million strong and in 2015 we will 
focus on developing opportunities 
for more regular engagement and, 
importantly , increased monetisation.
  Our scale as owner of nearly half of 
the top 20 shopping centres in the UK 
means that we have a strong presence 
offering key entry points in the areas 
where retailers need to be. We recognise 
that we are competing with other 
attractions, not just shopping, for our 
customers’ time and money and need 
to offer an attractive product on a 
national basis.
Q
   What are your strategic 
priorities for 2015?
A
  Our focus in 2015 will be on four 
main goals which we believe will 
result in strong total returns over the 
medium term:
 — optimising performance of existing 
assets with the delivery of like-for-like 
net rental income growth in 2015 
and attractive total property returns
 — driving forward the £1.3 billion 
investment programme in UK assets
 — making the brand count and 
demonstrating the benefits of scale
 — seizing the growth opportunity in 
Spain, building on progress in the last 
three years

Delivering 
improved returns
T otal property return has increased in 2014 
as yields compressed and rental values 
started to improve.
Valuation
The aggregate like-for-like market value 
of our investment property increased by 
8.2 per cent in the year , outperforming the 
IPD monthly retail index (up 7.3 per cent) 
as we have in each of the last five years. 
This contributed to a total property return 
of 13.1 per cent.
The weighted average nominal equivalent 
yield at 31 December 2014 was 5.32 per 
cent, a reduction of 47 basis points in the 
year , reflecting market conditions and our 
ongoing asset management initiatives 
maintaining the prime and resilient nature

In general the super-regional centres 
continue to outperform with stronger 
valuation surpluses from yield compression 
and improvement in rental values. In the 
case of Intu, yield compression was mostly 
seen in the first six months of 2014 based 
on transactional evidence. The larger 
city centre locations have seen smaller 
positive movements, but there has been 
limited read-across to date in the smaller 
centres. Notable changes in individual

A great advantage of intu’s 
strong brand is that it enables  
us to think strategically 
and nationally, rather 
than tactically and locally
O
ur national scale means we can 
pilot ideas and quickly adopt 
those that work across all our 
centres. This provides economies 
of scale, ensures we learn from best 
practice within the Group and embeds 
our values consistently within our centres. 
We are able to make national 
improvements in many areas of the 
business including customer service, 
building management systems, technical 
procurement and car park payments, 
because our size gives us the means 
to test and review on a small scale first.
Our signature customer experience 
programme is one example of how we 
are able to use this process to strengthen 
our brand so that people know what intu 
stands for . 
As part of this programme we wanted 
to create engagement tools to give our 
staff opportunities to interact more often 
with customers and make our customers’ 
shopping trips easier and more pleasant.
By testing several tools at different centres, 
we could see which ones resonated with 
customers and were natural for intu staff 
to deliver . The successful tools include 
intugrams (envelopes containing vouchers 
for free services or products, distributed 
as random acts of kindness), joy jars (jars 
containing small engaging toys to keep 
toddlers happy on the family shopping trip) 
and free ponchos when it rains. 
Using T ell intu, our Net Promoter Score 
(NPS) measurement programme, we 
identified the tools that work best, trained 
staff to use the tools and then rolled out 
the programme to all our intu-branded 
centres. We then reviewed again to find 
our NPS has increased by 30 per cent 
since the engagement programme began 
in March 2014.
Supported by our national training 
programme, and reinforced by the 
evidence from T ell intu, we are able to only 
roll out those ideas that we know make 
a demonstrable difference.

Occupancy remains firm at the 95 per cent 
level at which we have operated for most 
of the year and compares favourably to 
PMA ’s vacancy measure for ‘big shopping 
centres’ of 11 per cent.
 Like-for-like net rental income was 3.2 
per cent lower in 2014 than 2013, with 
a narrower 2.8 per cent decrease in the 
second half . Income interruption from 
centre redevelopments accounted for 
approximately one percentage point 
of the shortfall, in particular at intu 
Victoria Centre and intu Eldon Square. 
T enants failing in late 2012 and early 
2013 still impacted the first half of 2014, 
their total impact in 2014 being around 
one percentage point. The balance of 
the shortfall was around concentrations 
of lease expiries at intu Braehead and 
intu Potteries.
We agreed 210 new long-term leases in 
the year , amounting to £34 million new 
annual rent, at an average of 5 per cent 
above previous passing rent (like-for-like 
units) and in line with valuers’ assumptions, 
excluding one strategic leisure letting. 
Significant activity in the year includes:
 — 58 catering lettings, including Five Guys 
at intu T rafford Centre, intu Lakeside 
and intu Metrocentre, Chiquito at 
intu Metrocentre, intu Potteries and 
intu Uxbridge, Coast to Coast at intu 
T rafford Centre, intu Metrocentre and 
intu Victoria Centre and Carluccio’s in 
newly converted space at intu Bromley . 
Catering and leisure account for 11 per 
cent of the rent roll, with a significant 
increase in the development pipeline
 — new brands to individual centres include 
Superdry and a full-line River Island 
at intu Victoria Centre, one of Dutch 
retailer Hema’s first UK stores at intu 
Bromley , MAC at intu Lakeside, intu 
Bromley and St David’s, Fat Face at 
intu W atford and intu T rafford Centre, 
and Jack Wills at intu T rafford Centre
 — previously online only brands creating 
a physical presence, including a first 
store for an intu.co.uk retailer , W atch 
W arehouse, at intu W atford, a pop-up 
for Ratchet at intu Lakeside and two 
new Simply Be stores at intu Chapelfield 
and intu Merry Hill
The difference between annual property 
income (see Glossary) of £436 million and 
ERV of £515 million represents £42 million 
from vacant units and reversion of 
£37 million, 8 per cent, from rent reviews 
and lease expiry . Of the £37 million, 
£5 million relates to reversions only 
realisable on expiry of leases with over 10 
years remaining (for example anchor units), 
leaving £32 million, 7 per cent, from other 
lease expiries and rent reviews.
The lease expiry cycle can bring risk to 
short-term earnings depending on the 
volume in a specific centre and when 
the expiries fall in the economic cycle, 
but it also provides the opportunity to 
introduce, reposition and right-size tenants, 
improving the tenant mix. This year we 
have seen a significant concentration at 
intu Braehead and intu Potteries. The chart 
below shows the pattern of lease expiries 
across the portfolio, with a weighted 
average unexpired lease term of 7.4 years 
(31 December 2013 – 7.5 years).
Significant 
corporate activity
We have undertaken significant corporate 
activity in 2014 and we believe that our 
scale and focus is key to our successful 
development and operation of prime 
regional shopping centres. This year we 
have further consolidated our position 
in the UK, acquiring two top 20 centres. 
In Spain, with the completion of the Puerto 
Venecia acquisition in January 2015, we 
now own two top 10 centres which along 
with the sites we have under option in 
other key locations position us well to 
build scale there along similar lines to 
our approach in the UK. 
 — 275 new shops opened or refitted in our 
centres in 2014, around 9 per cent of 
our 3,100 units. T enants have invested 
around £90 million in these stores, 
a significant demonstration of their 
commitment to our centres. As well 
as major flagship store investments, 
like River Island at intu Metrocentre, 
JD Sports introduced their new concept 
shopfit at intu T rafford Centre, intu 
W atford and intu Chapelfield
  At the property level, the total return from 
Intu’s portfolio was 13.1 per cent (2013 – 
7.3 per cent). The combination of capital 
value increases and broadly stable income 
demonstrates the strength of Intu’s assets 
over the medium and long term.
 The number of visitors to our centres 
has increased marginally year-on-year in 
2014, representing an outperformance of 
Experian’s measure of UK national retail 
footfall which declined 1 per cent. 
Estimated retailer sales in our centres were 
up 3.1 per cent in the second half of 2014 
giving a year-on-year increase of 2.5 per 
cent. The ratio of rents to estimated sales 
for standard units reduced in the year to 
12.5 per cent, continuing the trend of the 
previous few years.

New joint venture
In June we entered into a partnership in 
respect of intu Uxbridge with Kumpulan 
W ang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KW AP), 
the £19 billion Malaysian pension fund. 
This transaction established a relationship 
with another significant overseas investor 
and demonstrated the investment 
demand for prime UK shopping centres 
under the management of a specialist 
operator such as Intu. 
KW AP acquired an 80 per cent interest 
in intu Uxbridge for £175 million, 
representing a 2 per cent premium 
to its 31 December 2013 valuation 
of £214 million (100 per cent basis). 
We retain a 20 per cent interest and 
continue to manage the centre under the 
intu brand on behalf of the joint venture. 
The transaction is a useful step in recycling 
capital into our substantial development 
pipeline while retaining the scale of our 
operations and has a deal structure which 
could be applicable to other assets.
Spanish acquisitions
In December we exchanged contracts 
to acquire the Puerto Venecia shopping 
centre and retail park in Zaragoza, Spain for 
€451 million. Eurofund, our development 
partner in Spain, was closely involved in 
the original development of this 200,000 
sq. m. shopping resort. The centre, which 
opened in 2012, offers a mix of retail, 
leisure and restaurants and was recognised 
by MAPIC in 2013, winning the best 
worldwide retail and leisure development. 
UK acquisitions
In May we completed our purchase of 
interests in two prime UK shopping 
centres, intu Merry Hill and intu Derby , 
and Sprucefield retail park, Northern 
Ireland, funded by a two for seven rights 
issue raising £500 million (gross) and 
£424 million of new debt facilities secured 
on the properties. The final consideration 
was £855 million. We have identified 
multiple growth opportunities which 
reinforce our investment case.  
The acquisition was in line with our strategy 
to focus on the UK’s most successful 
destinations. Such assets are rarely traded, 
so it is important to move decisively where 
opportunities arise to acquire interests, 
particularly where our operator skills 
can be applied through our specialist 
asset and property management teams. 
The transaction also established a joint 
venture with QIC, a major global investor , 
at intu Merry Hill. It strengthened Intu’s 
position as the leading owner , developer 
and manager of prime UK shopping 
centres, filled a gap in our national 
coverage and extended the footprint of 
our nationwide consumer facing brand.
Bulevar de los Manzanos,

This is the template for our shopping 
resort developments in Spain. 
The acquisition, which completed in 
January 2015, is funded by a 50 per cent 
loan to value bridging loan which we 
can exchange for a five-year term loan 
secured on the asset. The balance of the 
consideration has been met from our 
existing resources. In 2015 we will be 
looking to introduce an investment partner 
into Puerto Venecia. 
The acquisition is expected to be earnings 
accretive and, following last year’s 
successful acquisition of Parque Principado, 
Oviedo, is another high-quality addition for 
the Group, taking our ownership to two 
of the top 10 shopping centres in Spain. 
The transaction substantially accelerates 
our activities in Spain, which is a country 
where we see major opportunities for the 
type of genuinely regional destination 
centre in which Intu specialises.
As we highlighted in October 2013, 
when we acquired Parque Principado, 
the Spanish shopping centre market 
offers opportunities to create a quality 
business of scale which has the potential 
to generate superior total returns over 
the medium term. 
Similar to our approach in the UK, our 
aim is to be the leading owner , developer 
and manager of regionally pre-eminent 
shopping centre destinations for the major 
trade areas of Spain. Eighty per cent of the 
country’s retail expenditure comes from 
10 key catchment areas. 
Ownership of the largest Spanish shopping 
centres is fragmented and many regions 
do not have a pre-eminent retail and 
leisure destination. The committed pipeline 
of prime shopping centre developments 
across Spain is at a low level and we believe 
the opportunity exists to develop and build 
new schemes in a number of key regions 
of Spain. 
We also have development options on 
sites in Málaga, Palma, V alencia and Vigo. 
It is our intention, subject to shareholder 
approval, to exercise the Málaga option 
in March 2015. We are working to bring 
the other developments forward to the 
point where we can consider exercising the 
options. We believe such expansion will be 
beneficial to the Group’s overall brand and 
digital positioning.
Refinancing activity
Throughout 2014 we have continued to 
take advantage of the favourable debt 
markets to refinance the Group’s near-
term debt. Through a mix of term loans 
and long-dated bonds, financed in the last 
two years, we have, since 2012, increased 
the tenor of the debt by two years to eight 
years whilst reducing the cost of debt to 
4.7 per cent. With debt to assets at 44 per 
cent and available facilities of £671 million 
we are well positioned to continue 
with our strategy in Spain and our UK 
development pipeline.
See Financial review on pages 40 to 46, 
for more details.
Making the brand count
Scale is important and the establishment 
of the intu brand further enhances our 
competitive advantage. Our customers 
are at the heart of everything we do 
and providing them with compelling 
experiences that surprise and delight drives 
loyalty and in turn dwell time and spend. 
This customer focus also ensures that 
we establish enduring relationships with 
our retailers. 
Brand
When we rebranded in early 2013 we 
orientated every aspect of our business 
around the customer experience in our 
centres. Since then we have brought more 
services in-house to ensure we manage 
every step of the customer experience. 
A customer visit may start by looking on 
intu.co.uk, followed by visiting the centre 
which offers top-quality retail, with all 
the major brands present in our centres, 
dining and leisure options and national 
promotional activities. All our staff are 
trained to the same high standards in 
customer service, with the commitment 
of the intu brand ensuring equivalent 
standards across all of our centres.
Over half of the UK’s population visit an 
intu centre at some point through the year 
on or offline.
We have seen an increase in brand 
recognition which allows us to deliver 
events and promotions on a national basis. 
Events in 2014 included Elephant Parade, 
Everyone’s Invited and Student Night. 
Elephant Parade’s national tour visited 
all intu centres and raised awareness for 
The Asian Elephant Foundation as well

as entertaining shoppers. Everyone’s 
Invited brought a festival of family 
fun to the centres, increasing footfall 
by 13 per cent year-on-year for that 
weekend. Promotional partners and 
commercialisation clients now recognise 
our national proposition combined with 
a multichannel approach and we are 
seeing a growth in multicentre campaigns 
including the use of our intu.co.uk website.
All staff continue to take part in our World 
Class Service training which is the only 
national shopping centre programme 
accredited by the Institute of Customer 
Service. T o measure the impact of our 
brand approach we launched T ell intu this 
year which provides the Net Promoter 
Score of centres monthly . The average 
score has increased from 46 when we 
launched it in March to 60 over the 
Christmas period. Our research, which 
confirms that happy customers stay longer 
and spend more, has given considerable 
impetus to delivering a number of 
service improvements.
On the digital side, we have now 
introduced free Wi-Fi into nearly all of our 
centres, investing in our own infrastructure 
rather than outsourcing. Over 1.5 million 
people have registered with around 60 
per cent opting in to receive marketing 
information. Along with registrants on 
the website, our marketing database 
now has almost two million active users. 
Owning the infrastructure allows us to 
control this marketing and manage the 
customer experience.
We enhanced intu.co.uk in September 
2014. It is now fully mobile responsive 
with improved content and an expanded 
shopping proposition. Through our 
affiliates programme most of our major 
retailers are now on our transactional 
website, including for example, John Lewis, 
Next and T opshop, allowing us to offer 
shoppers their centre online 24 hours a 
day . The benefits of these changes can 
be seen in the website traffic, with a year-
on-year increase of almost 40 per cent in 
website visits in December 2014, to nearly 
3 million.
Scale 
As we discuss in the Market review , the 
face of retail continues to change with 
retailers needing to be in the best shopping 
locations. Our scale positions us as a 
key landlord to retailers with nine of the 
top 20 shopping centres in the UK.
Over the past four years we have expanded 
significantly with the portfolio now valued 
at £9.0 billion, almost doubling over the 
period through the addition of some of 
the top centres in the UK as well as value 
creation in our existing centres.
Our scale allows us to benefit from a 
wealth of experience and knowledge and 
apply best practice across all the centres. 
With one website, intu.co.uk, we can 
market all the centres more efficiently to 
a national audience and attract customers 
to stay for longer and visit more often. 
All of our 18 UK centres exceed 10 million 
visits each year and the busiest exceeds 
40 million. 
Over the last few years we have 
demonstrated that we will not compromise 
on quality for the sake of improvements in

flexibility in 2014 by refinancing much 
of the debt which was due to mature in 
the next few years. At the end of 2014 
we had cash and available facilities of 
£0.7 billion
 — the major developments are likely 
to be spread over a number of years. 
We intend to raise development finance 
where appropriate and additional 
finance from the value created by 
completed developments to reinvest 
in the next project
 — recycling capital from other assets to 
reinvest into these growth opportunities 
at the point where they will deliver 
superior returns. This may include 
introducing partners as we did at intu 
Uxbridge in 2014
In the case of major extensions and 
creation of significant new or reconfigured 
space, we aim to have agreed terms with 
a sufficient level of tenants including 
strategic pre-lets before proceeding 
with construction.
For expansionary projects which 
create additional space for which direct 
incremental rent can be identified, we 
would expect most projects to generate 
a stabilised initial yield on cost in the range 
of 6 to 10 per cent and a minimum of 
7 per cent for major projects. Where no 
significant additional space is created, 
we assess project return in the context 
of an internal rate of return based on 
the anticipated overall impact of the 
expenditure on centre performance 
through enhancing the ambience, 
the tenant mix and the rental tone.
 
the short-term occupancy level. This gives 
retailers confidence in the long-term 
attractiveness of the centres. We aim to 
ensure that our mix of tenants is what 
the customer wants and that the retailers 
are appropriately located to maximise 
their returns. 
Development momentum
We have made significant progress 
in the year with our pipeline of 
development opportunities:
 — completed the active management 
projects at intu Lakeside (food court), 
intu Eldon Square (mall upgrade) and 
intu Metrocentre (Platinum Mall)
 — on site at intu Victoria Centre (mall

financial performance measures
Key performance  
indicators
Footfall 
4 3 1
2013 2012 2014 Experian
–2% –1% +0% –1%
Why is this important?
Footfall is an important measure of a centre’s popularity with 
customers. Retailers use this measure as a key part of their  
decision-making process on where to locate their stores.
How is this measured?
Footfall numbers across Intu’s centres, including those managed  
by our partners, are captured using a combination of person or 
car counting cameras located at specific entrance and exit points 
within the centre.
How have we performed?
Footfall was unchanged in 2014, ahead of the 1 per cent reduction in 
the national benchmark as measured by Experian.
Like-for -like net rental income 
4 3 1
2012 2013 2014
–2.7% –1.9% –3.2%
Why is this important?
Measures the organic growth in income generated from  
the Group’s properties  in the year .
How is this measured?
Removes from the year-on-year movement in net rental income  
the impact of acquisitions, developments and disposals.
How have we performed?
The reduction in like-for-like net rental income reflects units held 
to facilitate future development plans and the impact of tenant 
administrations and lease expiries.
Occupancy

IPD (retail)
Why is this important?
We aim to optimise the occupancy of our centres as attracting and 
retaining the right mix of retailers and catering and leisure operators 
will enhance our centres’ trading environment.
How is this measured?
The passing rent of let and under-offer units expressed as a 
percentage of the passing rent of let and under-offer units plus 
the ERV of un-let units.
How have we performed?
Occupancy remains at the same level as 2013 and remains above 
the IPD benchmark figure. Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

Why is this important?
Measures the capital return on the Group’s property assets and  
compares this with the IPD index, a recognised industry benchmark.
How is this measured?
Includes the capital growth on a like-for-like basis from  
the Group’s properties.
How have we performed?
The Group recorded a significant valuation surplus in the year 
which again outperformed the IPD monthly index, retail.
T otal financial return

2014
Why is this important?
This is a measure of the movement in the underlying value of assets 
and liabilities underpinning the value of a share plus the dividend 
paid to shareholders.
How is this measured?
Uses the movement in adjusted net asset value per share  
plus the impact of dividends paid in the year . The 2014 return is 
assessed using the opening NAV of 346 pence per share as adjusted 
for the bonus factor to reflect the rights issue. Using the pro forma 
opening NAV of 335 pence, gives a return of 17 per cent.
How have we performed?
The strong total financial return performance reflects the 8.2 per 
cent like-for-like property valuation gain, the Group’s earnings and 
the impact of the Group’s capital structure.
Income performance 
4 3 1
2012 2013 2014

Why is this important?
Underlying earnings per share is based on the underlying income 
generated in the year which gives an indication of the Group’s ability 
to pay dividends.
How is this measured?
Underlying earnings exclude property and derivative valuation 
movements and exceptional income or charges. The 2012 and 2013 
figures have been adjusted for the rights issue bonus factor .
How have we performed?
Underlying earnings per share fell during the year due to the 
impact of the fall in like-for-like net rental income.

Our employees are fundamental 
to the success of our business and 
the delivery of our brand promise 
to all our customers
People who work at Intu are passionate 
about what they do and proud of our 
reputation as the market leader of the 
UK shopping centre industry . 
We expect the best from our employees, 
and in return we are committed to offering 
a stimulating and rewarding working 
environment where they can achieve their 
personal and professional goals as they 
accomplish challenging business targets.
We appoint the best people, and develop 
their talent, promoting internally and 
rewarding commitment and innovation 
whenever we see it.
And it works – 83 per cent of our staff 
declared themselves proud to work for 
intu,  up 2 per cent on last year .
Our HR strategy is built around five key 
themes to complement our corporate 
strategy . We focus on three of these 
in this year’s report.
Talent development
In 2014, we appointed a talent manager 
to help us achieve our aim to provide the 
same access to learning and development 
opportunities for all intu employees 
regardless of location role or level.
We also:
 — implemented a structured leadership 
programme to support succession 
planning, identifying a group of senior 
managers to work with internal and 
external talent development specialists. 
Two senior managers have now been 
promoted to the Executive Committee
 — created a comprehensive and consistent 
induction programme for centre staff
 — extended performance appraisal 
systems to staff at all levels
Our values
Creative
We look at the familiar and we 
see something different; we are 
insightful and imaginative, but 
not for their own sake, for we 
never lose sight of what is 
important and relevant
Bold
We act confidently and decisively , 
always knowingly , perhaps at times 
controversially , but never rashly 
or without consideration
Genuine
We are true to ourselves, act fairly 
and communicate clearly; we say 
what we mean and we mean what 
we say . We recognise our obligations 
to our stakeholders and the wider 
society , and commit to put our 
utmost into everything we do

consolidate the succession plan to staff 
at all levels
 — develop assessment techniques to 
better evaluate skills and resources 
throughout the organisation
 — encourage staff to gain cross-functional 
experience through project-  working

Service through a series of development 
sessions focusing on delivering 
a compelling experience
 — introduce a national apprenticeship  
scheme
 — work towards achieving the Investors

branded centres
Employee engagement
Engaging with our staff , taking them 
with us on intu’s journey to achieve its 
ambitious targets, is crucial to our progress. 
They need to understand our business and 
know how they can contribute to feel part 
of the team. 
For the third year in a row our employee 
survey records a rise in employee 
engagement, from 701 in 2011 to 747 
in 2014.
Employee survey 2014
Eighty four per cent of staff took 
part in the annual employee survey 
in November (2,032 out of 2,427 
eligible employees).
Scores were up again in 42 of the 
questions measured in previous 
surveys, and in over half the questions 
at least 70 per cent of respondents 
agreed or strongly agreed with the 
proposition. The overall engagement 
score now stands at 747 (2013 – 732) 
with favourable movement in all five 
domains that make up the engagement 
index: work environment, reward, 
development, operating culture and  
line of sight.

Reward and recognition
Our competitive remuneration structure 
helps to retain and motivate the best with 
base salaries benchmarked against our 
peers in the industry . Many employees 
are eligible for an annual bonus based 
on corporate measures that reflect 
the executive remuneration policy and 
are related to individual performance. 
A proportion of the annual bonus is 
awarded in deferred shares to encourage 
focus on the Company’s growth. 
Managers may also be rewarded with 
longer-term share options and many staff 
can join a Share Incentive Plan subject to 
a qualification period.

Career development at Intu: Gavin Prior
Left: When teenage night school student 
Gavin Prior responded to a newspaper 
advert for the role of Administration 
Assistant at The Harlequin – now intu 
Watford – in 1996 he probably didn’t 
think that within 16 years he would be at 
the helm of a super-regional destination. 
From Services Manager to Operations 
Manager at intu Metrocentre, he became 
one of Intu’s youngest general managers 
at intu Metrocentre in 2012. He has 
recently been seconded to intu Merry 
Hill, one of intu’s newest editions to 
the portfolio
Human rights
At Intu we respect the dignity , liberty 
and equality of everyone we work 
with. Our policies and procedures are 
consistent with the United Nations’ 
universal declaration of human rights, 
which sets “a common standard 
of achievement for all peoples and 
all nations” . 
We are committed to implementing the 
UN guiding principles on business and 
human rights.
We only work with people who choose 
to work freely and we respect their 
rights to equal opportunities and 
freedom of association. We work with 
our suppliers, retailers and associated 
companies to ensure they meet 
acceptable standards of human dignity 
in their own sourcing policies.
We will continue to evaluate the pay 
and conditions of all our employees, 
in particular new staff on or near to 
minimum wage, to bring them into 
line with the rest of our staff in terms 
of wages and benefits and ensure fair 
working conditions.
Fair treatment of people who work 
for Intu or our suppliers is a key 
focus of our corporate responsibility 
approach. As appropriate our Board 
CR Committee and CR Management 
Committee consider the potential 
human rights risks faced by Intu 
and assess approaches to mitigate 
those risks. 
In 2014 we: 
 — made a voluntary defined contribution 
pension plan available to all intu Retail 
Services staff for the first time
 — introduced intu’s first national 
recognition and reward scheme called 
‘Win Y our Dream’ , which allows staff 
at all levels to nominate colleagues 
for outstanding achievement linked 
to our values 
Next year we will:
 — complete a comprehensive 
remuneration review across all parts 
of the business
 — ask the Remuneration Committee to 
review proposals and approve Senior 
Manager and Executive Director salary 
levels and bonus awards
 — promote share ownership opportunities 
to all staff to enhance engagement
Recruitment
In line with our policy of developing our 
talent we have filled many of our new roles 
from internal applicants. Five shopping 
centres have new general managers, 
four of whom are internal promotions 
or transfers. 
Most of our large scale recruitment is due 
to expansion – as well as the transfer of 
staff when we acquired intu Derby and intu 
Merry Hill, we recruited 468 new people 
into the Group during 2014.

W 
e know from Tell intu that 
when our customers have 
a great experience at one of 
our centres, they are more 
likely to stay longer, spend more, come 
back sooner and tell their friends.
The perfect intu customer experience 
depends on our people and the positive 
interactions they have with our customers. 
So in 2013 we created intu Retail Services 
to bring all frontline staff working in our 
centres in-house. We wanted to ensure 
every member of staff feels part of the 
intu team and has a strong connection to 
Intu as a wider Group. It also allows us to 
train all our staff in our World Class Service 
programme so that every member of the 
intu Retail Services staff understands the 
need to continually improve the experience 
of customers and retailers and to provide 
great standards and great service. 
Our focus this year has been on 
recruitment, induction and training to 
ensure staff have the right skills. A great 
by-product has been a more motivated 
and committed workforce with a dramatic 
reduction in staff who leave within their 
first year of service, down from 35 per cent 
to 19 per cent. T urnover is down by 18 per 
cent overall and absence levels are down 
by 15 per cent.
The success of our approach has been 
independently recognised. At this year’s 
industry awards we won the PFM Partners 
in Retail Facilities award and intu is the only 
shopping centre business to be accredited 
by the Institute of Customer Service.
T ell intu continues to highlight how 
much our customers value staff who are 
knowledgeable and always looking to 
provide the best experience.

Successful risk management 
underpins Intu’s ability to 
achieve its strategic objectives
Key risks and uncertainties
Intu’s Board has responsibility for establishing the Group’s appetite 
for risk based on the balance of potential risks and returns, and 
has overall responsibility for managing risks. Risk management 
is embedded in Intu’s culture so that all employees play a part. 
This may be cleaners making sure that the centres are free of 
hazards or the construction team ensuring the right contractors 
are selected for developments.
Risks are considered in the day-to-day decisions made by the 
business and this assessment of risk is underpinned by a formal 
risk review process conducted by each centre, each department 
and the Executive team. These reviews identify risks and assess 
them for controllability and stability .
Risks are measured for impact and likelihood; gross risk being 
the worst case scenario if there were no controls in place; net 
risk being the risk as it stands today; and target risk being after 
any further planned risk reducing measures are implemented. 
An assessment is also made of how quickly the risks would 
impact the business. Impact and likelihood change as businesses 
and external factors evolve. Intu’s ongoing risk management 
ensures that changes in impact and likelihood are identified 
and managed appropriately .

Overview
Strong growth in property valuations 
has resulted in a substantial increase 
in the profit for the year . This valuation 
increase has not yet been reflected in net 
rental income as the Group holds units 
to facilitate future development plans 
and completes reletting units from 2013 
administrations and lease expiries:
 — underlying earnings of £162 million, 
up 15 per cent on 2013 reflecting the 
acquisitions in the year , with earnings 
per share of 13.3 pence, down 3 per cent 
on 2013, impacted by the reduction in 
like-for-like net rental income
 — NA V per share at 379 pence; total 
financial return for the year of 14 per 
cent based on the bonus factor adjusted 
opening NA V per share of 346 pence 
and 17 per cent based on the pro forma 
opening NA V of 335 pence
Financing metrics improved due 
to higher property valuations and 
refinancing activity: 
 — debt to assets ratio at 44.2 per cent 
(2013 – 48.5 per cent), below the 
Group’s target maximum level of 
50 per cent 
Presentation of information
Joint ventures
The Group has adopted IFRS 11 Joint 
Arrangements in 2014. This new 
standard requires that all joint ventures, 
which the Group previously chose 
to account for on a proportional 
consolidation basis, are equity accounted. 
This means that the income statement 
and the balance sheet now include 
single lines with the Group’s total 
share of post-tax profit and the net 
investment in joint ventures respectively . 
The Group’s profit for the year and total 
equity are unaffected by these changes. 
Further details of the impact of adopting 
this accounting policy are given in 
note 48. 
The new standard has a greater impact 
following the transactions in the year 
which created joint ventures in respect 
of intu Merry Hill, Parque Principado 
and intu Uxbridge. Further details of 
these transactions are given in notes 
40 and 41. 
Management both review and monitor 
the business, including the Group’s 
share of joint ventures, on an individual 
line basis not on a post-tax profit or 
net investment basis and therefore the 
figures and commentary presented 
are consistent with this management 
approach. Note 48 and the Other 
information section give reconciliations 
between the two bases.
Rights issue
In April 2014 the Company issued 
278.2 million shares by way of a rights 
issue. Further details are included in note 
37. Following a rights issue accounting 
standards require an adjustment to be 
made to the number of shares previously 
used to calculate earnings per share and 
in the Group’s case, to be consistent, an 
adjustment is also made to the number 
of shares used to calculate the dividend 
and net asset value per share. A bonus 
adjustment factor of 1.098 has been 
used to adjust the comparative figures 
in these results using the Company’s 
closing ex-div share price on 28 March 
2014 of 301 pence per share and the 
theoretical ex-rights price of 274 pence 
per share. 
Financial review
 — interest cover ratio at 1.82x (2013 
– 1.71x), above the Group’s target 
minimum level of 1.60x
 — cash and available facilities increased 
to £671 million (2013 – £325 million)
Major transactions: 
 — in May the Group completed 
the acquisition of intu Merry Hill, 
intu Derby and Sprucefield for 
£855 million. Exceptional costs related 
to the acquisition totalled £12 million. 
The acquisition contributed £27 million 
to the underlying earnings of the Group
 — in June 2014 the Group sold 80 per 
cent of its interest in intu Uxbridge for 
consideration of £175 million, before 
expenses. The Group retains a 20 per 
cent interest which has been accounted 
for as a joint venture from 20 June 2014
 — in December the Group exchanged 
contracts to acquire Puerto Venecia, 
Zaragoza with the acquisition 
completing in January 2015. 
The 31 December 2014 balance 
sheet includes the deposit paid of 
€22.5 million within restricted cash. 
The acquisition will be consolidated 
from the date of completion.

The principal components of the change 
in underlying earnings are as follows: 
 — net rental income increases due 
to acquisitions totalled £43 million 
reflecting the acquisitions of intu Merry 
Hill and intu Derby in 2014 and a full 
year contribution of intu Milton Keynes 
and Parque Principado acquired part 
way through 2013. This is offset by 
a £5 million reduction due to the sale 
of 80 per cent of intu Uxbridge
 — like-for-like net rental income reduced 
by £11 million, 3.2 per cent (see 
Strategic review)
 — underlying net finance costs increased 
by £3 million with the cost of debt 
drawn in the year to part-fund the 
acquisitions of intu Merry Hill and intu 
Derby partially offset by the favourable 
impact of lower interest rates following 
debt refinancings, in particular on 
the intu Metrocentre facility that was 
concluded at the end of 2013
 — ongoing administration expenses 
increased by £3 million, largely due to 
costs related to management of recent 
acquisitions, including new employees 
and professional fees
 — our partner’s share of the reduction 
in finance costs following the intu 
Metrocentre debt refinancing has been 
the main factor reducing the non-
controlling interest credit by £3 million 
compared to 2013
 The Group recorded a profit for the year of 
£600 million, a substantial increase on the 
£364 million reported for the year ended 
31 December 2013. This increase was 
primarily due to:
 — an increase in the revaluation gain on 
property valuations to £648 million 
including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures (2013 – £126 million)
 — lower exceptional finance costs of 
£51 million (2013 – £158 million), largely 
due to the lower level of interest rate 
swap terminations in connection with 
debt refinancing
These positive factors were partially 
offset by:
 — negative movement of £431 million in 
the change in fair value of the Group’s 
financial instruments. 2014’s results 
include a charge of £157 million 
including the Group’s share of joint 
ventures whereas 2013 benefited from 
a £274 million credit
Underlying earnings increased by 
£22 million to £162 million with underlying 
earnings per share, which takes into 
account the shares issued to part-fund 
the acquisition of intu Merry Hill and 
intu Derby , decreasing by 3 per cent to 
13.3 pence. Underlying earnings exclude 
valuation movements, exceptional 
items and related tax and are presented 
as they are considered to be a key 
measure of the Group’s performance 
and an indication of the extent to which 
dividend payments are supported by 
underlying earnings. The underlying profit

which has been classified as an exceptional 
finance cost as it relates to the termination 
of swaps (£17 million) or payments in 
respect of unallocated swaps (£27 million). 
The balance of the payments has been 
included as underlying finance costs as 
they relate to ongoing interest rate swaps 
used to hedge debt.
As previously detailed, the Group has a 
number of interest rate swaps, entered into 
some years ago, which are unallocated as, 
due to a change in lenders’ practice, they 
cannot be used for hedging the Group’s 
borrowings. At 31 December 2014 these 
swaps have a market value liability of 
£242 million (2013 – £143 million). It is 
estimated the Group will be required to 
make cash payments on these swaps of 
£25 million in 2015 in line with the level 
of payments made in 2014. The balance 
sheet shows £73 million of these as current 
liabilities reflecting mutual options to break 
during 2015. Since the year end we have 
confirmed that no cash outflows will be 
required in respect of these breaks.
Non-controlling interests at 31 December 
2014 relate to our partner’s 40 per cent 
stake in intu Metrocentre and increased 
during the year due to its share of profit 
and additional investment in capital 
projects. The net reduction in the overall 
non-controlling interest balance reflects 
Parque Principado moving from being 
a subsidiary with a non-controlling 
As detailed in the table above, the 
Group’s net rental income margin 
including share of joint ventures is in line 
with 2013 at 87 per cent with higher 
void costs offset by lower bad debts. 
Property operating expense in the year 
ended 31 December 2014 includes 
£11 million (2013 – £10 million) in respect 
of car park operating costs and the 
Group’s contribution to shopping centre 
marketing of £8 million (2013 – £8 million). 
The Group’s ratio of total costs to income, 
as calculated in accordance with EPRA 
guidelines, remains low at 19 per cent.
Balance sheet
The Group’s net assets attributable to 
shareholders have increased by £1.0 billion 
to £4.5 billion at the end of 2014 due 
to equity raised in the year to fund the 
acquisition of the intu Merry Hill and 
intu Derby shopping centres and the 
retained profit for the year including the 
£648 million gain on the revaluation 
of the Group’s properties. 
As detailed in the table, net assets (diluted, 
adjusted) have increased by £1,165 million 
from 31 December 2013 to £4,969 million 
as at 31 December 2014. 
Investment and development property 
has increased by £1,338 million primarily 
due to the acquisition of intu Merry 
Hill, intu Derby and Sprucefield, valued 
at £866 million on acquisition, and the 
£648 million valuation gain in the year . 
Investments of £228 million as at

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange 
movements on its overseas investments 
in Spain, the US and India. The Group’s 
policy is to ensure that the net exposure to 
foreign currency is less than 10 per cent of 
the Group’s equity attributable to owners 
of the Company . At 31 December 2014 
the exposure was 6 per cent, lower than 
at 31 December 2013, because during

at 31 December 2013. T aking into account 
the full impact of the rights issue, the pro 
forma opening position for 2014 was 335 
pence per share. The increase from the pro 
forma figure to the 31 December 2014 
value of 379 pence per share was driven 
by the property valuation gain of 50 pence 
per share.

Financing 
Debt structure 
A large proportion of the Group’s debt has 
been refinanced in the last two years, as a 
result of which the Group has significantly 
diversified its sources of funding. The range 
of debt instruments now includes CMBS 
and other secured bonds plus syndicated 
bank debt secured on individual or pools 
of assets, with limited or non-recourse 
from the borrowing entities to other Group 
companies outside of these arrangements. 
Corporate-level debt remains limited 
to the revolving credit facility and the 
£300 million convertible bond.
During the year there was a significant 
amount of financing activity , including: 
 — in February the Group raised 
£110 million through the issuance of 
further notes under the intu T rafford 
Centre CMBS. The bonds had an 
average maturity of nine years and 
an all-in cost of 4.6 per cent
 — in April the Group’s partnership with 
CPPIB signed a €95 million, five-year term 
loan secured on Parque Principado, Spain
 — in May debt was raised to part-fund 
the acquisition of intu Merry Hill, intu 
Derby and Sprucefield. This involved 
three new two and a half year debt 
facilities secured on the intu Derby 
and Sprucefield properties and 
the equity interest in intu Merry 
Hill (£203 million, £30 million and 
£191 million respectively). The debt 
secured on intu Derby was refinanced 
later in 2014 (see below). At intu Merry 
During 2014 the Group has recorded an 
increase in cash of £61 million. Cash flow 
from operating activities of £56 million 
is £91 million better than 2013, primarily 
due to the lower level of exceptional swap 
termination costs compared to 2013.
Cash flow from investing activities reflects 
the cash outflows for the acquisition of 
intu Merry Hill, intu Derby and Sprucefield 
of £855 million, net of £175 million cash 
received on disposal of 80 per cent of 
intu Uxbridge. 
Cash flow from financing activities 
includes an inflow of £492 million from 
the rights issue undertaken to part-fund 
the acquisitions in May and an inflow from 
net borrowings drawn of £314 million. 
This includes £424 million of facilities to 
part-fund the acquisitions in the year and 
the repayment of £146 million as part of 
the disposal of 80 per cent of the Group’s 
interest in intu Uxbridge. Dividends paid in 
cash during the year were £90 million.
Net external debt (including Group’s 
share of joint ventures) has increased by 
£265 million. Cash including the Group’s 
share of joint ventures has increased by 
£94 million, which includes the Group’s 
share of the proceeds from raising new 
finance on Parque Principado in August. 
Debt has increased by £290 million 
reflecting the key transactions above.

Hill, the intention is that the Group and 
our partner QIC will jointly refinance 
at the asset level when the QIC CMBS 
matures in 2016
 — in June the debt secured on intu 
Uxbridge of £146 million was repaid 
as part of the disposal process
 — in August the facility in our St David’s, 
Cardiff , joint venture was repaid and 
a new term loan of £120 million plus 
a revolving credit facility of £41 million 
was put in place, secured against the 
Group’s interest in the joint venture
 — in October the Group’s revolving credit 
facility was extended from £375 million 
to £600 million bringing in a further 
two banks and extending the maturity 
to 2019 with the ability to extend this 
by a further two years. The margin has 
reduced by between 25 and 50 basis 
points. The combination of this and a 
lower commitment fee means that we 
expect to pay a lower all-in cost based 
on planned utilisation levels despite 
the larger facility size
 — in November the debt on intu Derby 
and intu Chapelfield was refinanced 
and these assets were added into the 
Group’s Secured Group Structure which 
issued £350 million 4.25 per cent bonds 
with maturity in 2030 Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

Following the refinancing activity in the 
year the above chart illustrates that there is 
a minimal refinancing requirement in 2015 
and no major refinancing due in 2016.
The table below summarises the Group’s 
main debt measures, all including the 
Group’s share of joint ventures.
The debt to assets has reduced 
significantly from 2013 largely due to 
the property valuation gain in the year 
and remains below the Group’s target 
maximum level of 50 per cent.
Interest cover of 1.82x has increased 
partly due to the favourable impact of 
lower interest rates following recent debt 
refinancing and remains above the Group’s 
targeted minimum level of 1.60x. 
The weighted average maturity has 
increased to 8.4 years with the benefit 
from the £350 million bonds issued in 
November , which mature in 2030, being 
partly offset by the shorter term debt 
related to the acquisition of intu Merry Hill.
The weighted average cost of gross debt 
has reduced to 4.7 per cent reflecting the 
lower rates achieved on refinancing activity 
in the year .
The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix 
interest obligations, reducing cash flow 
volatility caused by changes in interest 
rates. The proportion of debt with interest 
rate protection has reduced slightly in 
the year to 88 per cent within the Group’s 
policy range of between 75 per cent and 
100 per cent. The reduction is due to the 
impact of the floating rate debt secured 
against intu Merry Hill and Sprucefield 
which has not been hedged as it is short-
term, partly offset by a lower level of 
borrowing against the Group’s revolving 
credit facility .
Cash and available facilities have increased 
to £671 million at 31 December 2014. 
This comprises cash of £260 million 
in addition to undrawn facilities of 
£411 million. The increase on 2013 
primarily reflects the increase in the 
Group’s revolving credit facility from 
£375 million to £600 million.
Covenants
Full details of the loan financial covenants 
are included in the Financial covenants 
section of this report. The Group is in 
compliance with all of its covenants. 
Headroom over the minimum levels of 
L TV covenants has generally increased 
in the year reflecting the strong 
valuation increases.
Capital commitments
The Group has an aggregate cash 
commitment to capital projects of 
£81 million at 31 December 2014 
(including the Group’s share of 
joint ventures). 
In addition to the committed expenditure, 
the Group has an identified uncommitted 
pipeline of active management projects 
and major extensions that may become 
committed over the next five years 
(see Strategic review).

Tax policy position 
As a Real Estate Investment T rust (REIT), 
tax on property operating profits is paid at 
shareholder level to the UK government 
rather than by Intu itself . REIT status brings 
with it the requirement to operate within 
the rules of the REIT regime (for further 
information see Glossary).
As a good corporate citizen we believe that 
paying and collecting taxes is an important 
part of our role as a business and our wider 
contribution to society . 
Intu does not employ tax avoidance 
strategies, or undertake transactions 
whose sole purpose is to abuse the tax 
system. We are committed to acting 
with integrity and transparency in all 
tax matters and have an open, up front 
and no surprises policy in dealing with 
HMRC. The Group seeks pre-clearance 
from HMRC in complex areas and actively 
engages in discussions on potential or 
proposed changes in the taxation system 
that might affect property tax and 
REIT legislation.
The Group pays tax directly on overseas 
earnings, any UK non-property income 
under the REIT rules, business rates, and 
transaction taxes such as stamp duty 
land tax. In the year ended 31 December 
2014 the total of such payments to tax 
authorities was £26 million, of which 
£25 million was in the UK, £0.5 million 
in the US and £0.5 million in Spain. 
In addition, the Group also collects V A T , 
employment taxes and withholding tax 
on dividends for HMRC and the Spanish 
tax authorities. Business rates, principally 
paid by tenants, in respect of the Group’s 
UK properties amounted to around 
£297 million in 2014.
Dividends
The Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 9.1 pence per share bringing 
the amount paid and payable in respect of 
2014 to 13.7 pence, unchanged from 2013 
as adjusted to reflect the 2014 rights issue 
(see note 17). A scrip dividend alternative 
will continue to be offered. Details of the 
apportionment between the PID and non-
PID elements per share will be confirmed 
in due course.

O
ur brand means we look at 
development differently . 
When we invest in our centres 
our perspective is all about 
our customers – how we can create a 
compelling shopping experience that 
delivers on our brand promise and will 
encourage customers to stay longer and 
visit more frequently .
For the 2013-14 redevelopment of the 
food court at intu Lakeside our vision was 
to create a setting that would bring in 
aspirational food operators and make the 
centre a more attractive leisure destination 
for a wider range and reach of customer .
With a £9 million investment we have 
transformed the food court, recreating 
the space from floor to ceiling: converting 
underused areas into stylish lounges and 
other spaces for a new type of retailer and 
a new type of customer . 
It has been a great success, winning the 
British Council of Shopping Centres Gold 
Award for Catering and Leisure Destination 
of 2014, and seeing new contemporary 
retailers lining up to take space, including 
Five Guys, T ortilla, Patisserie V alerie, 
Nando’s, W asabi, Harper’s, Thai Express, 
Rhythm Kitchen, Olive Oil & Oregano and 
Gino’s My Pasta Bar .
The result is a more clearly defined 
and repositioned catering offer , 
which has elevated the overall food 
service proposition and provided new 
income streams. 
It has contributed substantially to 
the overall customer experience and 
‘personality’ of intu Lakeside, offering a 
dynamic dining experience that changes 
through the day and into the evening. 
Footfall, dwell time and spend have all 
increased and the development is forecast 
to generate a stabilised net rental uplift 
of approximately £1 million per annum.

Better together 
Why CR matters
Corporate responsibility matters. We want 
intu to be a long-term and sustainable 
business – and we can only ensure that if 
we care for the communities where our 
shopping centres are located and look 
after the environment that we all share.
Our corporate responsibility approach, 
set out on page 10, is fundamental to 
the way we run our business, securing 
our licence to operate, helping to 
manage risk, contributing to cost 
management, protecting stakeholder 
value and safeguarding and enhancing 
our reputation.
But corporate responsibility is more than 
a business driver . It is the right thing to do. 
Intu owns some of the biggest and 
best shopping centres in the country . 
So it is right that we make sure our 
impact as a business is as beneficial 
to local communities and the national 
economy as possible. It is right that we give 
opportunities to the young people who live 
near our centres. It is right to do as much 
as we can to negate the environmental 
effects of our business. And it is right 
that we listen when our stakeholders – 
employees, retailers, community partners 
and local authorities – tell us what 
they need. It is right – and it is good for 
our business.
CR governance
The Intu Board takes responsibility for 
determining policy and strategic direction 
on CR topics. The strategic direction of 
our CR programme is led by the CR Board 
Committee while the CR Management 
Committee takes responsibility for 
progress against our operational objectives. 
Both committees met three times in 2014. 
 
External recognition
We measure our sustainability 
performance against our peers 
through indices such as the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices and CDP . This ensures 
that we remain focused on best practice 
and allows us to identify areas of strength 
and weakness. We monitor the actions of 
our UK REIT competitors and work with 
them on important industry issues through 
membership of organisations such as the 
British Council of Shopping Centres (BCSC) 
and the Better Buildings Partnership.
Understanding our stakeholders’ views
We believe it is important to engage 
with our stakeholders around our CR 
reporting. In the autumn of 2014 we 
conducted our second stakeholder review 
to better understand the corporate 
responsibility issues that internal and 
external stakeholders believe are key to our 
business. Further details can be found in 
the 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report.
Improvements and targets
We work with our stakeholders to improve 
all areas of our CR performance and set 
relevant goals and targets that let us 
critically monitor progress. For example, 
our centres continue to roll out leading 
technology and energy management 
plans to optimise efficient energy use and 
explore new ways to bear down on our 
energy demands, costs and our corporate 
carbon footprint.
Corporate responsibility
 
We take our responsibilities seriously across all areas of our business and  
we are committed to being a responsible and sustainable Group

What we’re doing
In our joint community projects we work with 
local partners to help disadvantaged young 
people int o work. During 2014, we work ed 
with nine community partners delivering 
21 projects at our centres. These projects 
have directly reached over 1,200 people.
In 2014 we launched our volunteering 
policy which means all of our employees 
can take 15 hours out of working 
time to volunteer in the community . 
While we’ve had a long-running tradition 
of volunteering on the community 
projects close to our centres we hope 
this new policy will boost our employees’ 
involvement in their communities and 
help them to develop both personally 
and professionally . 
Once again in 2014 we were accredited 
with the BitC CommunityMark, one  
of only 52 UK companies to receive  
the award. The CommunityMark is  
a national standard that publicly  
recognises leadership and  
excellence in the community . 
Communities and 
economic contribution
Why it matters
Our shopping centres are integral to the 
communities they serve, providing places 
for people to come together to meet, eat, 
drink and socialise as well as shop. 
We rely on these communities as 
customers and as employees as well as 
for their acceptance of our business. So, as 
investors, it’s important that we show our 
support for local communities and develop 
partnerships that give us opportunities 
to make a real impact in the local area. 
As a major local player in every community 
we operate in we can make a substantial 
difference to people living nearby – and 
we believe it is our responsibility to do so. 
That’s why one of our main focuses is on 
training and supporting young people and 
helping them into work.
Our focus on local issues means the 
community activities our centres 
undertake can make a real difference to 
local people; our scale means we make 
a significant economic contribution to 
communities across the country .
 £ 1 . 3m
Our community activities during 2014  
were supported by total donations of  
£1.3m cash equivalent, including  
facilitated donations
 
What we plan to do
 — incr ease empl o y ee v ol un t eering 
across intu
 — further our use of the London 
Benchmarking Group framework 
and introduce this approach to our 
community partners
 — expand our education programmes  
for young people
Each year since 2011 we’ve commissioned 
Nathaniel Lichfield & Partners to analyse 
the economic contribution of our shopping 
centres. We believe that recognising these 
impacts and outputs will enable us to 
better understand, and respond to, our 
community footprint. Doing this will help 
to underpin our planning applications 
and give us the evidence we need to 
demonstrate to investors the strength 
of our position. According to the report 
in 2014, Intu and its retailers nationally 
directly employed almost 89,000 people 
and indirectly supported over 25,000 jobs. Intu Properties plc  –  Annual Report 2014

Environmental 
efficiency
Why it matters
As long-term investors in our shopping 
centres it is important we demonstrate 
a sustainable approach to managing 
our operations. Given the scale and 
nature of our business we recognise our 
responsibility to manage and minimise  
our environmental impact. 
Saving energy and water and managing 
waste effectively minimises our impact 
on the environment, reduces costs and 
mitigates against environmental risks – 
all of which makes us a more attractive 
landlord for our retailers. We are also 
committed to creating a sustainable built 
environment and consider environmental 
issues as part of all of our development 
work. We share our good practice and 
learning with our retailers, suppliers  
and visitors to our centres.
What we’re doing
Our environmental initiatives typically 
focus on the areas of our shopping centres 
where we are most able to implement 
changes – mainly in the common parts that 
we manage, including car parks. In 2011 we 
set ourselves challenging targets to reduce 
our carbon emissions (CO
2 ) by 30 per 
cent, to divert 95 per cent of waste from 
landfill, to recycle 75 per cent of waste 
and to reduce our water consumption by 
10 per cent all by the end of 2014. By the 
end of 2014, we had reduced our carbon 
emissions by 30 per cent compared with 
2011 (like-for-like portfolio adjusted for 
occupancy), diverted over 97 per cent of 
waste away from landfill, recycled 69 per 
cent of waste and had reduced water use 
by two per cent compared with 2011. 
Further details of our progress against 
our targets can be found in the separate 
2014 Corporate Responsibility Report.
Our efforts have been publicly recognised – 
as well as the 2014 Carbon T rust Standard 
award for carbon reduction (see opposite) 
we have held the Carbon T rust Standard 
certification since 2011. We have also 
received a gold ranking in the Mayor of 
London’s Business Energy Challenge for 
our two centres in Greater London and 
our head office. 
Sustainable transport remains a key 
concern for our business given the reliance 
of customers and centre employees on 
public transport and private vehicles to 
reach our centres. We have appointed 
transport champions with responsibility 
for creating and updating sustainable 
travel plans which we make available 
to all interested stakeholders. 
What we plan to do
 — reduce carbon emissions intensity 
by 50 per cent between 2010 and 2020
 — reduce water consumption intensity 
by 10 per cent between 2010 and 2020
 — divert 99 per cent of waste away from 
landfill by 2020
 — continue to update travel plans  
for all centres

e haven’t made a big thing 
about our work on carbon 
reduction because it’ s just 
the way we do business – but 
in 2014 our outstanding and sustained 
performance in energy efficiency was 
recognised by the Carbon Trust, which 
awarded us the ‘Best in continuing 
carbon reduction’ award at the Standard 
Bearers Awards. The award recognises the 
challenging 30 per cent reduction target 
we set ourselves and the work we have 
done to achieve this since 2011. 
As part of our ambitious carbon reduction 
programme we installed 60,000 energy 
efficient LED light bulbs across our centres, 
resulting in £2 million in electricity savings 
each year as well as significantly reduced 
lamp replacement costs. This minimises 
our environmental impact and helps 
mitigate the risk of increasing energy costs 
for ourselves and our retailers. 
We appointed an energy champion in 
every centre to focus on innovative and 
deliverable ways to reduce energy use at 
their centre and share best practice with 
other centre champions. Our scale and
single management means champions 
can ensure the best energy-saving ideas 
are replicated across intu centres. 
These ideas include savings that can be 
made without capital outlay , such as 
carefully scheduling lighting for night-time 
cleaning and managing the lighting of car 
park areas more efficiently . 
As a result of these changes and more, Intu 
has reduced its carbon emissions (CO
2) 
by 30 per cent since 2011 on a like-for-like 
basis – equivalent to taking 7,000 cars off 
the road for a year .

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce Intu’s Corporate 
Governance report for 2014.
I would like to highlight the following key 
areas of focus during 2014:
Risk management – As a result of the 
rapid changes to the business including 
especially the increased focus on digital 
services and the expansion of operations 
into Spain, the Audit Committee has 
overseen an evolution of the Group’s risk 
management methodology to ensure 
all risks are identified and prioritised 
appropriately . A comprehensive formal 
appraisal of risk appetite, introduced last 
year , was repeated in 2014. All existing 
and new risks were analysed, discussed 
and reviewed with the Board and 
Senior Management. Each risk was 
assessed as to potential impact and 
probability and categorised accordingly . 
Further information on the Group’s risks 
can be found on pages 38 and 39.
UK Corporate Governance Code 
Compliance – The Audit Committee has 
confirmed to the Board that in its opinion, 
the Annual Report and Accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2014, taken as a 
whole, is fair , balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders.
Please see page 64 of the Audit 
Committee Report where we discuss the 
external auditor and their tenure.
Our approach to good governance 
continues to be robust and, we believe, 
highly effective. Our governance 
procedures are kept under close scrutiny 
by the Board, and we react quickly , where 
appropriate, to match best practice and 
regulation. I am confident that our attitude 
and approach to good governance is 
embedded throughout the business 
and remains of the highest standard. 
An amended version of the UK 
Governance Code was issued in September 
2014 which is applicable to companies 
with a UK premium listing with financial 
years beginning on or after 1 October 
2014; Intu will report on its compliance 
with the 2014 version of the Code in its 
2015 Annual Report.

The Board
Led by the Chairman, the Board’s overarching objective is to 
provide effective leadership to the Group underpinning the 
business model described on pages 8 and 9 to ultimately deliver 
long-term growth and generate sustainable returns for its 
shareholders. It does this by setting and implementing strategy , 
ensuring that its employees are professional, motivated and 
focused, and establishing a balanced approach to risk within 
the framework of established controls.
Appropriate and effective corporate governance is taken 
extremely seriously and is intrinsic to all aspects of the Board’s 
activities. The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
and other stakeholders for the good conduct of the Company’s 
affairs. It has therefore established a governance framework which 
underpins the culture of the Group. This framework consists of 
committees with specific delegated responsibilities (as shown 
in the diagram above), and internal policies, procedures and 
controls (including delegated authority limits) which are regularly 
reported on, reviewed and updated by the Board and the relevant 
Board Committees. The internal processes are communicated 
to all staff and are available at all times on the Group’s intranet. 
Delegated authority limits apply at all levels of the business and 
their application is incorporated into the standard procedures for 
the execution of all leases, licences, contracts and other relevant 
documentation by the Group. The Board considers that the way in 
which both the Board and the Group function meets the highest 
standards of accountability and probity .

Matters reserved for the Board
Responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of the Group is delegated 
to certain Board Committees, the 
Executive Directors (with the support of 
the Chief Operating Officer) and senior 
management. These delegated powers 
are supported by delegated authority 
limits which are documented and kept 
under review by the Board.
Certain matters have been reserved 
for decision by the whole Board and 
a schedule setting out a list of these is 
reviewed regularly . These include, but 
are not limited to:
 — strategy
 — the application of the Board protocol 
for dealing with related-party matters
 — dividend policy
 — major acquisitions and disposals, other 
capital expenditure and controls
 — risk management
 — shareholder circulars and other 
documents required by the listing rules
The Board also receives regular reports 
on the proceedings of its Committees 
and considers their recommendations. 
It has been the Board’s custom over many 
years to ensure that major decisions are 
taken after a reiterative process which 
involves examination and review at several 
levels. In part, this examination and review 
process is dealt with by the Board and 
other Committees mentioned below .
The Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman, Patrick Burgess, 
and of the Chief Executive, David Fischel, 
are separate and have been defined by 
the Board. In summary , the Chairman’s 
responsibilities include leading the Board, 
setting its agenda, achieving clarity 
of decision-making and ensuring its 
effectiveness on all aspects of its role. 
He also ensures that the Board maintains 
effective two-way communication 
with shareholders and management. 
The Chief Executive’s key responsibilities 
include day-to-day management of 
the Group’s operations in the most 
effective way possible, implementing the 
policies and strategies developed by the 
Board and developing the abilities and 
skills of the Group’s personnel to their 
maximum potential.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring an 
external and independent view to the 
Board’s discussions, providing constructive 
challenge to executive management 
when appropriate.
Biographical details of each Director 
are set out on pages 54 and 55.
The Senior Independent Director
Andrew Huntley was appointed as Senior 
Independent Director in August 2013. 
In this role, Andrew provides advice and 
additional support and experience to the 
Chairman as required, and is available 
to act as an intermediary for the other 
Directors if necessary . Andrew also 
leads the appraisal of the Chairman’s 
performance annually in discussion with 
the other Non-Executive Directors, and is 
available as an additional point of contact 
for shareholders should they feel that 
communication through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive, 
Secretariat or Investor Relations team has 
failed or is otherwise inappropriate.
Alternate Directors
John Whittaker and Richard Gordon 
have appointed Steven Underwood 
and Raymond Fine respectively as 
their alternates under the terms of 
the Company’s Articles of Association. 
The Board has generally invited 
the alternate Directors to attend 
Board meetings.
The Company’s approach to corporate 
responsibility is a key element of its 
overall governance culture. We have 
consistently demonstrated a strong 
commitment to high standards of 
corporate responsibility , particularly 
focused on the local communities 
surrounding our shopping centres and 
details of our CR activities are set out in 
the CR report on pages 48 to 53, which 
we strongly recommend shareholders 
to read, and on the Company’s website.

Communication between 
Board meetings
Directors are kept fully informed of 
progress on matters between formal 
meetings, in particular by way of scheduled 
conference calls or less formal update 
meetings in every month when there is not 
a formal Board meeting, ad hoc meetings, 
working visits to centres and pursuing 
a policy of open communication. 
The chairmen of the Audit Committee and 
Remuneration Committee communicate 
regularly with relevant staff and advisers 
including the Head of Risk and Internal 
Audit, the Company Secretary and the 
Remuneration Consultants.
Effectiveness
Balance, composition and culture
The Nomination and Review Committee 
regularly reviews the balance (including 
skills and experience) and composition 
of the Board to ensure that it operates 
efficiently . The Board has therefore 
determined that candidates for the role 
of Non-Executive Director should have 
relevant qualifications and experience 
notably in property , retail, and finance, 
areas that are well represented by 
the current Non-Executive Directors 
(see biographies on page 55).

The Board reviews the independence of 
its Non-Executive Directors on an annual 
basis. With the exception of John Whittaker 
and Richard Gordon, both representatives 
of major shareholders, the Board has 
concluded that all other Non-Executive 
Directors continue to demonstrate their 
independence. The balance of the Board 
is illustrated on page 59.
Time commitment, external activities 
and conflicts of interest
Non-Executive Directors are generally 
appointed for a three-year period and their 
continuing service thereafter is subject 
to review by the Board. Their annual time 
commitment will vary according to their 
membership of Board Committees and the 
activities of the business in any given year . 
The terms of appointment of the Non-
Executive Directors set out the minimum 
expectation of preparation for and 
attendance at all Board meetings, Board 
Committee meetings where appropriate, 
ad-hoc meetings and the annual Board 
away day . Non-Executive Directors are 
required to confirm on accepting their 
appointment, and annually following each 
accounting year end, that they are able 
to allocate sufficient time to meet the 
expectations of the role.
The terms of appointment for each of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered 
office, or on written request from the 
Company Secretary .
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid 
situations in which they have or may 
have interests that conflict with those of 
Intu, including when a Director takes up a 
position with another company , unless that 
conflict is first authorised by the Board. 
The Board has adopted a formal procedure 
for the identification of conflicts under 
which Directors must notify the Chairman 
of any potential conflicts. The Chairman 
then decides whether a conflict exists 
and recommends its authorisation by 
the Board where appropriate. In certain 
circumstances, the conflicted Director may 
be required to recuse himself from the 
Board’s discussions on a matter in which 
he or she is conflicted.
Directors must also notify the Chairman 
when they take on any additional 
responsibilities or external appointments, 
and it is their responsibility to ensure that 
such appointments will not prevent them 
from meeting the time commitments 
discussed above.
In addition, the Board has implemented 
a ‘Related Party Protocol’ for situations 
where a proposed transaction could be 
captured by the related party provisions 
of the Listing Rules or by the Companies 
Act 2006.
 
The appropriate balance of skills, 
independence, experience and knowledge 
does not in itself ensure the efficient 
operation of a Board. T o this end, the role 
of the Chairman is essential in creating an 
environment where the Non-Executive 
Directors are able to draw on their own 
experience to constructively challenge 
the views of the executive management. 
The Chairman works closely with the 
Company Secretary to ensure that all 
Directors are provided with fully accurate 
and timely information to facilitate 
informed discussion at Board meetings. 
The Chairman is particularly mindful that 
the views of all Directors should be taken 
into consideration and that the range of 
experience of our Non-Executive Directors 
must be drawn upon to provide insight and 
alternative perspectives to aid the Board’s 
decisions on key strategic matters.

Key components of the investor 
relations programme
 — One - on- one mee tings with 
principal shareholders: The 
Chairman is available to meet 
with key investors to answer their 
questions and to better understand 
their views, particularly with regard 
to governance matters
 — R esul ts-r ela t ed mee tings: 
Institutional shareholders are invited 
to a presentation with a question 
and answer session by the executive 
team on the day of announcement 
of final and interim results. They can 
choose to attend in person, by phone 
or join the webcast. The Chairman 
and a number of the Non-Executives 
also attend these presentations
 — R oa d sho w s: In the few weeks 
following results announcements, 
executive management conduct 
a series of one-to-one and group 
meetings with institutional 
shareholders in the UK, South 
Africa, Europe and the US, giving 
the opportunity to meet other 
fund managers as well as the 
sector specialist of each institution. 
Unattributable feedback from these 
meetings collected by our brokers 
is provided to the Board
 — Investor and analyst property visits: 
Institutional shareholders are invited 
to attend at least one property 
visit each year with presentations 
on Intu’s business. This gives an 
opportunity for formal and informal 
interaction with the executive team 
and the ‘next tier’ of operational 
management. In 2014, investors 
visited intu Merry Hill, intu Derby , intu 
Victoria Centre, intu Broadmarsh, 
intu W atford and intu T rafford Centre 
to see recent changes and to hear 
about significant planned projects. 
Such presentations are available for 
download from the Investors section 
of our website intugroup.co.uk
 — In v es t or c on f er enc es: Several 
investment banks hold conferences 
for investors and companies in the 
real estate sector . They are a good 
opportunity for the executive team 
to meet a large number of current 
and potential investors in a mixture 
of group and one-to-one meetings 
and informally . Intu attended nine 
such conferences in 2014 in the UK, 
Europe and the US
 — Gener a l mee tings: The Annual 
General Meeting (AGM), usually 
held in May , gives the opportunity 
for all shareholders (private and 
institutional) to ask questions of the 
Board, including the Chairmen of 
both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. The entire Board is 
also available to talk to shareholders 
before and after the meeting. 
The results of all shareholder 
votes are announced via the 
London and Johannesburg stock 
exchanges and are available on the 
Company’s website
 — Interaction with ‘sell side’ analysts: 
Many investors develop their 
understanding of the Company 
partly through discussions with 
independent analysts. Intu engages 
with analysts from around 20 
institutions in order to improve the 
accuracy and insight of their research. 
The Board is kept informed of analyst 
commentary and recommendations. 
A list of the analysts publishing 
material on Intu can be found 
at intugroup.co.uk/investors/
shareholders-bondholders/analysts/
 — Debt investors: Representatives 
of Intu’s key relationship banks 
are invited to the bi-annual results 
presentations by the executive 
team and meet periodically 
with the Chief Financial Officer . 
Institutional investors in certain 
of the Group’s listed debt are 
invited to periodic updates on the 
Group’s business and performance. 
We welcome the moves by some 
credit side institutional investors 
towards more openness regarding 
holdings of debt instruments 
and ‘road show’-style one-to-
one meetings
Overall approach
Intu places considerable emphasis on 
maintaining an open and frank dialogue 
with investors. Our programme of investor 
relations activities is based around the 
financial reporting calendar and seeks to:
 — develop existing and potential investors’ 
understanding of Intu’s business 
strategy , operations, performance 
and investment case
 — provide to the Board and executive 
team an insight into the differing 
views of Intu’s shareholders
With these objectives in mind, the 
executive team (including, on occasion, 
the Chairman) met with representatives 
of 180 investment institutions during 2014 
to keep them informed of our performance 
and plans, to answer their specific 
questions and to understand their views. 
In addition our website provides to all 
shareholders a great deal of immediate as 
well as general information and a feedback 
facility . Regular visits to our properties 
enable investors to see our operations 
close up.

Dear Shareholder
As the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
it is my role to present to you the Audit 
Committee report for 2014. 
In addition to its core activities, the 
Committee has this year continued to 
focus on risk management, particularly 
in relation to the expanding digital 
environment and our entry into Spain. 
For the second consecutive year , the 
Committee carried out a comprehensive 
risk review and assessment of risk appetite 
across the Group. The results of the risk 
review were discussed by the full Board 
at its annual away day . The Group’s risk 
management framework is described 
in detail on pages 38 and 39.
The Board again asked the Audit 
Committee to advise it on whether 
the annual report is fair , balanced and 
understandable and allows shareholders 
to make an assessment of the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy . 
The annual report preparation process 
is set out on page 65 and, together 
with opinions of key executives and the 
external auditor , has been designed to 
assist the Committee in reaching its view . 
The Committee is satisfied that, taken 
as a whole, this Annual Report is fair , 
balanced and understandable and has 
recommended as such to the Board.
Following our annual review of auditor 
quality and independence, we have 
determined that it is not necessary 
to tender the audit contract for the 
time being, and have recommended 
that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) 
be reappointed for the 2015 audit. 
Although we are awaiting final guidance on 
audit tendering, we anticipate that a tender 
exercise will, at the latest, be carried out 
at the end of the current audit partner’s 
five year tenure, i.e. in respect of the year 
ending 31 December 2018.
In 2015 we will continue to focus on 
the key risk areas of the Group. This will 
include in-depth reviews of the Group’s 
developments, international operations 
and the approach to our partners and 
joint ventures.

Audit Committee
continued
Responsibilities
The Audit Committee’s key responsibilities 
are to monitor and review:
 — the integrity of the financial statements, 
including a review of the significant 
financial reporting judgements and 
accounting policies
 — the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management
 — the effectiveness of the internal audit 
function, including the work programme 
undertaken by the function
 — the Group’s policy on whistleblowing
 — the Group’s overall approach to 
monitoring areas of risk
 — the Company’s relationship with 
the external auditor , including 
its independence
External auditor
The Audit Committee has assessed 
the effectiveness of the external auditor , 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), by 
a combination of direct meetings and 
review of independent reports:
 — Senior finance staff reviewed the 
detailed execution of the 2013 audit 
plan with the engagement team and 
identified specific improvements for 
the 2014 plan
 — The report of the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC)’s May 2014 Audit Quality 
Inspection review of PwC was reviewed 
and found to be supportive of the firm’s 
overall systems of quality control
 — The Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and the Chief Financial Officer each 
met privately with a senior partner of 
PwC unrelated to the engagement 
shortly after the publication of the 
Group’s Annual Report to review the 
performance of the firm
 — The FRC’s Audit Quality Review team 
undertook a review of PwC’s 2013 audit 
of the Company , reporting in November 
2014. The Audit Committee discussed 
the findings with the lead audit partner 
and was satisfied with the actions to 
be taken. No significant changes to the 
audit approach were identified
The EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) and 
Audit Directive (2014/56/EU) become 
applicable from 17 June 2016 and must 
be implemented in the UK by the same 
date. These limit the length of tenure 
an audit firm can serve and put in place 
requirements for the audit tender process. 
PwC have been Intu’s audit firm for more 
than 20 years and it is anticipated that 
a tender process will, at the latest, be 
carried out at the end of the current audit 
partner’s five year tenure, i.e. in respect of 
the year ending 31 December 2018.
A resolution to reappoint PwC for the 2015 
audit will be proposed at the 2015 AGM.
The Committee will continue to review the 
effectiveness and independence of PwC 
each year .
Main activities during the year
The Audit Committee considered the 
following key matters in 2014:
 — the Group’s investment property 
valuation process
 — accounting treatment of the most 
significant transactions in the year 
including the acquisitions of interests 
in intu Merry Hill, intu Derby and 
Sprucefield from Westfield and 
the associated rights issue, along 
with the sale of 80 per cent of 
intu Uxbridge
 — financial integration and control 
of acquisitions in the year
 — changes to accounting standards 
and their potential impact on the 
Group including the adoption of 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
 — the 2014 Internal Audit Plan and 
Audit Charter
 — discussion on the appropriateness of 
those items classified as ‘exceptional’ 
in the year and therefore excluded 
from underlying earnings
 — the results of a review of the carrying 
value of the Group’s investment in 
Prozone due to the market value of 
the shares trading at a discount to 
the Group’s carrying value based 
on share of net assets. This included 
further enquiries by management 
to supplement their understanding 
of the Indian market including 
discussions with an independent 
expert. The review concluded that no 
adjustment was required at this time

Key financial reporting and 
significant judgements
During the year the Committee discussed 
the planning, progress and final conclusions 
of the external audit process. The audit plan 
was reviewed and approved at the July 
2014 Committee meeting. The significant 
risk areas identified were: investment 
property valuations; revenue recognition; 
and management override of controls. 
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) identify these latter two risks 
as significant for all companies. These 
issues were discussed by the Committee 
following finalisation of the audit.
The Committee takes into account the views 
of the external auditor in understanding 
and assessing whether suitable accounting 
policies have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements, and whether 
disclosures are balanced and fair . The main 
issues discussed by the Committee in the 
current year were:
Valuation of investment properties
For the interim results at 30 June the 
Audit Committee carried out a review 
of the investment property valuations. 
The full Board carried out a review 
of the 31 December valuations included 
in this report.
Due to the overall importance of the 
valuations to the Group’s results, DTZ, who 
undertake the largest proportion of the 
Group’s valuations, were invited to both the 
Audit Committee and the Board meetings 
to participate in the consideration of 
the valuations.
The Audit Committee review included 
discussion with management and the 
auditor of the key assumptions and results 
of the valuation process undertaken by the 
independent third party valuers. 
This review also included understanding 
which general factors had influenced the 
valuers in concluding on appropriate yields 
to use in the valuations. This involved 
factors affecting both the investment and 
occupier markets and recent comparable 
market transactions.
Particular emphasis was given to 
understanding the factors that had 
resulted in individual property valuations 
being either significantly above or 
below the average movement in the 
Group’s valuations. 
Presentation of information
The Group has adopted IFRS 11 Joint 
Arrangements in 2014. This new standard 
requires that all joint ventures, which the 
Group previously chose to account for 
on a proportional consolidated basis, are 
equity accounted.
Operating through joint ventures is a core 
part of Intu’s strategy . Management both 
review and monitor the business, including 
the Group’s share of joint ventures, 
on an individual line basis not on a 
post-tax profit or net investment basis. 
The figures and commentary presented 
in the Strategic report have therefore 
been presented consistently with this 
management approach. Reconciliations to 
the presentation under IFRS 11 have 
been provided in note 48 to the financial 
statements and in the Other information 
section on pages 155 and 156.
The Committee has reviewed the 
prominence given to both statutory 
information and information on a 
management basis, and concluded that 
the approach adopted provides the most 
useful analysis of the results for the year .
Going concern
The Company’s ‘going concern’ review 
which is based on an 18-month cash 
flow projection, with particular focus on 
the next 12 months, was discussed with 
management. The projections cover the 
major trading cash flows, being rental 
income, interest expense and capital 
expenditure plans in the context of the 
latest debt maturity profile.
Stress tests of the projections were 
considered, covering reductions in net 
rental income levels and the value of 
the Group’s properties and what impact 
such changes may have on both the 
Group’s liquidity and its ability to meet the 
financial covenants on its debt facilities. 
The discussion also considered what 
actions were available to the Group to 
mitigate the impact of such reductions 
on the cash flow projections.
Fair , balanced and understandable
At the request of the Board, the 
Committee considered whether the 
2014 Annual Report was fair , balanced 
and understandable and whether it 
provided the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess Intu’s 
performance, business model and 
strategy . As part of its considerations 
the Committee took into account the 
preparation process detailed below 
which, together with opinions of key 
executives and the external auditor , 
has been designed to assist the Audit 
Committee in reaching its view:
 — at an early stage, a matrix is produced 
identifying key themes and the 
sections in which those themes 
should be reflected
 — individual sections of the 
Annual Report are drafted by 
appropriate senior management 
with regular review meetings to 
ensure consistency across the 
whole document
 — a verification process is undertaken 
to ensure that information contained 
is appropriately supported and 
factually accurate
 — detailed reviews of drafts 
of the Annual Report are 
undertaken by members of the 
Executive Committee and other 
senior management
 — drafts are discussed with the Group’s 
legal advisors and brokers
 — a final draft is reviewed by the Audit 
Committee and discussed with senior 
management prior to consideration 
by the Board
As a result of its considerations the 
Committee is satisfied that, taken 
as a whole, the Annual Report is fair , 
balanced and understandable and has 
recommended as such to the Board.
Following discussions with 
management, the Committee agreed 
with the conclusions reached and the 
treatments relating to the above issues 
adopted in these financial statements. Intu Properties plc  –  Annual Report 2014

Audit Committee
continued
Details of the amounts paid to the external 
auditor for audit and non-audit services 
are included in note 9 on page 107 to 
the financial statements. The Company 
engaged PwC to carry out certain non-
audit work in 2014 including assurance 
services in respect of the Group’s 2014 
interim report, reporting accountant work 
in respect of the rights issue to part-fund 
the acquisition of intu Merry Hill, intu Derby 
and Sprucefield, and the debt issues for the 
Secured Group Structure and intu T rafford 
Centre, and financial due diligence on the 
acquisition of intu Merry Hill, intu Derby 
and Sprucefield.
The above safeguards were adhered 
to when awarding this non-audit work 
and PwC were chosen for the reporting 
accountant work as it was considered to 
be sensible for the external auditor to be 
used and more efficient in terms of time 
and cost. PwC were chosen to undertake 
the due diligence work on efficiency 
grounds given the overall assignment. 
Fees paid to PwC in respect of non-audit 
work represented 65 per cent of the total 
fees paid. During 2014 the Group used 
accounting firms other than PwC for 
a number of assignments.
The EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) 
and Audit Directive (2014/56/EU), which 
come into force on 17 June 2016, impose 
restrictions on certain non-audit services. 
A number of non-audit services will be 
prohibited and others will require approval 
by the Audit Committee. There will be 
an overall fee limit of 70 per cent of the 
average of audit fees charged in the 
past three years for permitted non-audit 
services. The UK regulator is currently 
consulting on the definition of non-audit 
services and hence which services would 
be affected. Although these restrictions 
do not come into force until 2016, the FRC 
has already imposed a ban on tax services 
by auditors where fees are payable on a 
contingent basis. Intu’s current policy on 
non-audit services set out above continues 
in force for the time being. As soon as there 
is more clarity on the new regulations, and 
in particular which services are impacted, 
Intu will review its policy and make any 
necessary amendments to comply with 
the new rules.
Risk management and internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to 
oversee the Group’s system of internal 
control and to keep its effectiveness under 
review , as well as to determine the nature 
and extent of the risks it is willing to take 
in achieving its strategic objectives based 
on the balance of potential risks and 
reward. The ongoing risk management 
process is described in detail on page 38 
and is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only a 
reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Key elements of the Group’s internal 
control system relating to financial 
reporting are as follows:
 — the Group has a comprehensive 
system for reporting financial results 
to the Board; detailed regular financial 
reports with comparisons to historic 
performance and against budget and 
forecasts are provided to the Board. 
The Board reviews these for the 
Group as a whole and takes action 
when appropriate
 — the Group undertakes a detailed 
financial reporting process on a 
quarterly basis. This process is carried 
out using the policies and practices that 
apply to the control environment on an 
ongoing basis, and is largely undertaken 
by the Group’s financial reporting team, 
which comprises appropriately qualified 
finance professionals. Detailed planning 
is undertaken prior to the period end. 
As part of this process, significant 
business risks and their potential impact 
on the financial reporting process and 
results are considered, including the 
effect of any changes in the business 
activities or accounting standards and 
matters arising from the underlying 
information systems
Non-audit services
The Group has a policy to ensure that 
the provision of any non-audit services by 
the incumbent external auditor does not 
impair the external auditor’s independence 
or objectivity . 
The Audit Committee has considered the 
option of putting material non-audit work 
out to tender . While recognising that the 
circumstances of a particular transaction 
may make it most sensible to use the 
incumbent external auditor for such work 
(for example where the nature of the 
transaction would not allow a new firm 
sufficient time to assimilate the requisite 
knowledge of the Group’s operations in 
order to carry out the non-audit work), the 
Audit Committee has recommended that 
non-audit work should be undertaken by 
someone other than the external auditor 
wherever practical.
The Audit Committee has delegated to 
the Executive Directors the authority to 
contract for non-audit services with the 
external auditor subject to observing 
certain guidelines including:
(a)  Executive Directors have the authority 
to commission the external auditor 
to undertake non-audit work up to 
a specified value;
(b)  the Executive Directors must consider 
whether the proposed arrangements 
will maintain audit independence; and
(c)  the external auditor must 
satisfy the Company that it is 
acting independently . Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

The most significant areas reviewed in 
2014 were: shopping centre healthchecks 
(or follow up reviews) at six centres, 
corporate responsibility reviews at four 
centres, integration of the major assets 
acquired in the year (intu Merry Hill and 
intu Derby), a review of the transactional 
services operation (including accounts 
payable, expenses, accounts receivable 
and cashiers), review of intu Experiences’ 
commercialisation processes, a review of 
cash exposures, centre demise reviews, 
data identification, service charges, payroll 
outsourced service provider review and a 
review of self-certification at the centres 
and head office. Additionally , annual 
assurance activities were performed, 
including a review of gifts and hospitality 
and Executive expenses. 
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
effectiveness of the risk and internal audit 
function and in particular ensures that the 
function remains sufficiently independent 
of the wider business to ensure it can carry 
out its work effectively . An independent 
review of the risk and internal audit 
function is carried out every five years and 
was last performed at the end of 2013.
Whistleblowing policy
The Audit Committee reviews the 
Group’s arrangements by which staff 
can confidentially raise concerns 
about possible improprieties (whether 
financial or otherwise) within the 
Group. Any whistleblowing incidents 
are reported to the Audit Committee, 
and fully investigated with procedures 
reviewed and improved where appropriate. 
During 2014 we:
 — revised the existing whistleblowing 
policy to make it more user friendly , 
communicate the role of the Audit 
Committee and emphasise the 
protection afforded to informants
 — publicised the revised policy and 
process throughout the Group and 
improved accessibility to whistleblowing 
information and advice via the 
Group’s intranet
 — created an online process to 
register concerns
There was one whistleblowing incident 
during 2014. This was a non-financial 
matter which was fully investigated and 
found to be unsubstantiated. The outcome 
was accepted by the complainant.
Audit Committee effectiveness
As part of the Board evaluation process, 
the Audit Committee reviewed its own 
effectiveness and the results were positive. 
The Committee took the opportunity 
to streamline the agenda and papers 
submitted for its meetings to improve 
efficiency and decision making.

 — the preparation of the consolidated 
financial results involves a number 
of review stages. One of these stages 
includes a technical accounting review 
by an internal technical specialist, 
who has primary responsibility for 
ensuring that financial accounting 
developments are appropriately dealt 
with in the Group’s financial reporting 
process. After various internal review 
stages, draft financial reports, with 
narrative commentary on new technical 
requirements or issues requiring a 
significant level of judgement, are 
prepared for review and approval by 
the Audit Committee. This review stage 
involves the Audit Committee discussing 
the consolidated financial results and 
significant judgements with senior 
management and, where appropriate, 
the external auditor
The Board has conducted a review of the 
effectiveness, on the basis of criteria set out 
in the 2005 Financial Reporting Council’s 
internal control guidance for Directors, 
of systems of internal financial control 
and risk management for the year ended 
31 December 2014 and has confirmed 
that there have been no material 
developments affecting their review which 
have taken place since the year end.
Internal audit
The Group has a risk and internal audit 
function which reports to the Audit 
Committee. The risk and internal audit 
function reviews internal controls and 
reports to the Audit Committee on 
whether such controls are in place and are 
being operated effectively . The function 
covers Intu Properties plc, subsidiaries 
(including intu Retail Services) and

Dear Shareholder
As the Chairman of the Committee it is 
my task to present to you the report of 
the Nomination and Review Committee 
for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The Committee is pleased with the 
progress of the newly implemented 
comprehensive succession planning and 
leadership development programme 
across the Group, identifying appropriate 
internal succession paths and establishing 
a programme for talent development. 
The Committee carried out a formal 
Board performance evaluation process the 
outcome of which is summarised opposite.
We continue to have 20 per cent female 
representation on the Board and will keep 
the target of 25 per cent in mind when 
an opportunity next arises for a Board 
appointment to be made. Our statement 
on our diversity policy is set out below .
Responsibilities and how they were 
discharged in 2014
The principal role of the Nomination and 
Review Committee is to evaluate the skills 
available on the Board and to determine 
when appointments and retirements 
are appropriate.
In addition to its key responsibilities set out 
above, the Committee is also responsible 
for carrying out the annual performance 
evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors, as well as making 
recommendations to the Board on 
appointments to the Board, including the 
induction programme for newly appointed 
Directors, and on succession planning.
The Committee met twice in 2014 with 
its main focus on the composition of the 
Board and succession planning.
Statement on diversity policy
The Nomination and Review Committee, 
and the Board, recognises the importance 
of boardroom diversity , not just gender 
specific, and the Committee’s policy is to 
seek to ensure that all available suitable 
candidates are taken into account when 
drawing up shortlists of candidates for 
possible appointments to the Board. 
However , the priority of the Committee 
and the Board is to ensure that the Group 
continues to have the strongest and most 
effective Board possible, and therefore 
all appointments to the Board are 
made on merit against objective criteria. 
The Board is supportive of the Davies 
Report recommendations in relation 
to board diversity .
Board composition
The Committee’s discussions regarding 
the composition of the Board continued 
to be framed by the Company’s previously 
stated goal of reducing the overall size 
of the Board. The Committee is satisfied 
that the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board and its 
Committees is appropriate and no further 
appointments are currently planned or 
envisaged. The Committee has discussed 
the scheduled retirements of the SID and 
the Remuneration Committee Chairman, 
due at the 2016 AGM. The Committee is 
in the early stages of the search for two 
new Non-Executive Directors following the 
2015 AGM.

duties under the Companies Act 2006 
and on legal, regulatory and governance 
matters with which the Company , Board 
and individual Directors must comply .
Education and development
The Chairman, with the assistance of 
the Nomination and Review Committee, 
regularly considers the need for Directors 
to update and expand their skills and 
knowledge. T raining is provided for 
Non-Executive Directors in the form 
of presentations at Board meetings, as 
well as attendance at relevant seminars 
and courses. 
The Board also recognises the need 
for Directors to keep up to date with 
relevant legislative and regulatory 
developments as well as changes to 
corporate governance best practice and 
investor expectations. The Company 
Secretary reports to each Board meeting 
on these matters, drawing attention to any 
issues of particular relevance. In addition, 
the Company Secretary maintains an 
up-to-date comprehensive schedule 
summarising legislative and regulatory 
developments relevant to the Company 
and rated according to risk/impact on the 
Group, which is available to the Board and 
Senior Management.

Succession planning
Succession planning and the development 
of talent in the business was a major 
preoccupation of the Committee during 
the year , and a comprehensive talent and 
leadership development programme, 
including succession planning, has been 
implemented across the entire Group 
from the Board down. The Committee has 
monitored the progress of the programme 
at every meeting and is pleased with the 
progress made to date.
Renewal of Non-Executive 
appointments
All Directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting in May 2015.
Induction for new Directors
There is a comprehensive induction 
programme for new Directors which is 
tailored by the Chairman, in consultation 
with the Chief Executive and Company 
Secretary , depending on the type of 
Performance evaluation
Every year , the Board conducts an evaluation of its own performance and of the performance of the Chairman and each of the Board 
Committees. In addition, the Chairman reviews the performance of each individual Director and the Senior Independent Director 
oversees the review of the Chairman’s performance. The evaluation process conducted during 2013 generated three areas requiring 
attention during 2014 and progress against those areas is shown in the table below:
2014 performance evaluation
The 2014 performance evaluation was conducted by way of an internal questionnaire with external facilitation.
*
 The key points 
identified formed the basis for recommendations which the Board used to establish an action plan for 2015. The main areas covered 
by the action plan for attention in 2015 are:
 — Suc c ession planning – identification of appropriate profiles for candidates, followed by the appointment of two new  
Non-Executive Directors to replace Andrew Huntley and Neil Sachdev , both to retire at 2016 AGM
 — Board Communication – Board members encouraged to attend Board update session in person rather than by conference 
call where possible, and create more opportunities for the Board to make working visits to our centres
 — Risk – add as standard agenda item to Audit Committee agenda. Incorporate a section on ‘risk’ into Board presentations 
and capex proposals
Area identified for attention in 2014 Action taken
 — Revisions to Board and Committee 
timetable and sequencing of meetings
 — Committee meetings held one week prior to Board meetings
 — Committee meetings held sequentially on one day
 — Additional meetings of Remuneration 
Committee to develop the new format 
Directors’ remuneration report
 — Remuneration Committee met on two occasions, in addition to scheduled meetings,  
to develop the new format Directors’ remuneration report
 — More exposure to senior management 
across the Group on topics of 
particular relevance
 — Attendance at Board meetings by senior managers to present on specific topics
 — Audit Committee agenda amended to allow for ‘deep dives’ into particular topics 
at least twice per year

O
ur Spanish strategy has come a 
long way since we first started 
thinking about Spain in 2012. 
We chose Spain because it 
offers a great investment opportunity 
with possibilities for growth: good 
infrastructure, an economy moving out 
of recession, sophisticated retailers and 
consumers. Most of all, its prime regional 
shopping centre market has fragmented 
ownership and offers great opportunities 
for an imaginative owner to shake it up.
In 2013 a rare opportunity to acquire a 
quality asset came up – the 75,000 sq.  m. 
Parque Principado shopping centre in 
Oviedo, Asturias in northern Spain. It is 
one of Spain’s top 10 shopping centres, 
strategically located with over 9 million 
visitors a year .
In a bold move – six months earlier the 
Spanish economy looked fragile – Intu 
teamed up with the major property 
investor , Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board (CPPIB), to acquire the centre in 
October 2013.
At the end of 2014 we are already seeing 
the rewards for our boldness, which gives 
us confidence that we’re on the right path. 
The centre was purchased for €162 million 
but is now valued at €212 million, an 
increase in value of 28 per cent since 
acquisition. It is 99 per cent occupied and 
new leases signed in 2014 averaged 18 per 
cent above ERV . Sales and footfall are both 
significantly ahead of nationwide indices.
Parque Principado, which will undergo 
a full intu rebrand as well as change its 
name to intu Asturias in 2015, was our 
first Spanish acquisition. In December 
2014 we announced the acquisition 
Spain’s shopping  
centre market has 
fragmented ownership 
and offers great 
opportunities for 
an imaginative  
new owner 
Focus on: Spain
Our Spanish enterprise 
of Puerto Venecia, an award-winning 
retail and leisure centre in Zaragoza, 
which has substantially strengthened 
our market position in Spain. With our 
partners Eurofund we have options on 
four development sites in Málaga, V alencia, 
Palma and Vigo and are likely to embark 
on the Málaga site, to be intu Costa del 
Sol,  in 2015. 
Our timing has been good – Spain is out 
of recession, with workplace reforms in 
place, unemployment falling, consumer 
confidence strengthening and household 
debt reducing.
The top 10 Spanish retail locations account 
for 80 per cent of retail expenditure. Intu  
now owns or has options in six of these.  
Creating this leading platform in three 
years demonstrates our agility in 
executing new strategies. Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

Alignment with long-term success
The Committee believes that our 
remuneration philosophy and incentive 
policy is aligned with the long-term success 
of the Company . Our long-term incentive 
plan has time horizons extending to five 
years, and 50 per cent of our annual bonus 
is deferred into shares. Performance pay 
is linked to:
 — outperformance of T otal Shareholder 
Return against our peers
 — delivering absolute total return for 
our shareholders
 — annual EPS performance
 — achievement of our strategic initiatives 
that will build value for the longer term
Key areas of focus and decisions in 2014 
and for 2015
The Chief Executive’s salary will be 
increased by 3.6 per cent from £545,480 
per annum to £565,000 per annum 
with effect from 1 April 2015. The Chief 
Financial Officer’s salary will be increased 
by 3.6 per cent from £430,090 per annum 
to £445,500 per annum with effect from 
1 April 2015.

Directors’ remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present Intu’s 2014 
Directors’ remuneration report to 
you, which has been prepared by the 
Remuneration Committee and approved 
by the Board.
Results and context of remuneration
2014 was another year of significant 
activity at Intu, as described in the 
Chairman’s statement on page 6. 
Intu delivered a total shareholder return 
of nearly 25 per cent for the year . The key 
strategic objectives achieved in the year 
included the performance of the Group’s 
existing assets, strong KPI outcomes, 
broadening of the intu Digital offering, 
strong performance in Spain and excellent 
progress on augmentation of financial 
headroom through successful refinancing 
of bank facilities, bond issue and rights 
issue in the year . In addition three top 
shopping centres were acquired, intu Merry 
Hill and intu Derby in the UK and Puerto 
Venecia in Spain.
Remuneration Policy
Last year we put our Directors’ 
remuneration policy to binding shareholder 
vote for the first time. It was approved 
at the 2014 AGM with 99.77 per cent 
of votes cast in favour . The Committee 
was delighted with the level of support 
shown by shareholders and we continue 
to welcome feedback. 
We are not proposing to make any 
changes to our Directors’ remuneration 
policy this year . In the interests of succinct 
reporting we have not reproduced the full 
policy report. A summary table, setting out 
an overview of remuneration elements 
and policy for 2015 is included in the body 
of the report. The approved policy table is 
included at the end of this report for ease 
of reference. The full policy report can be 
found on our website.

The 2012 Executive Share Option Scheme 
(ESOS) awards did not meet the threshold

long-term share award will vest in respect 
of 2014.
No changes have been made to the 
performance measures for the annual 
bonus and performance share plan.
Performance share plan awards of 250 per 
cent of salary were made to each of the 
Executive Directors. These will only vest 
subject to the achievement of stretching 
T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) and 
Absolute T otal Return (TR) performance 
conditions, over three, four and five years.
For incentive awards in respect of 2015 
onwards, we are introducing a clawback 
provision under which incentive amounts 
delivered to the Executive Directors may 
be reclaimed in certain circumstances.

The Directors’ remuneration report will be 
put to the shareholder vote at our 2015

of £200,000 per annum was paid to Peel Management Limited for the provision by Peel of management and advisory services, as further described on page 81.
The figures have been calculated as follows:
 — Base salary: amount earned for the year

of the company car cash allowance is £18,000

Performance out-turns and incentives
Annual bonus §
The maximum award for both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in 2014 was 120 per cent of salary , of which 50 per cent 
is deferred for two and three years. This will remain unchanged for 2015.
Annual bonus payments are based on pre-determined performance measures. Two thirds is based on adjusted EPS performance in the 
year , split evenly between performance versus budget and prior year figures.
The remaining third is based on achievement of strategic and operational objectives against a scorecard of measures. The Remuneration 
Committee considers the objectives carefully each year to align with Intu’s strategic objectives, and include quantitatively assessed 
financial and operational measures and milestones. Each objective relates directly to the strategic plan. Under the scorecard approach, 
the weightings of each objective vary between Executive Directors to reflect their roles and responsibilities. For 2015, the scorecard will 
include objectives in the following key areas:
 — Optimising performance of assets
 — Key capital expenditure projects
 — Building the Intu brand and delivering customer experience
 — Maximising the growth opportunities internationally
 — Financia l fl e xibility
 — T alent development and staff engagement

The strategic objectives in the annual bonus are a key part of the remuneration framework for incentivising and rewarding the 
achievements and milestones which are the foundation for value creation in the future. The Committee follows a rigorous process in the 
setting and monitoring of scorecard objectives. This includes determination of objectives by reference to the approved board strategy , 
quarterly reviews of quantitative and qualitative data, and an end of year full review with supporting evidence, to ensure a robust 
assessment of performance against the objectives. Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

50 per cent of the 2014 short-term incentive for both David Fischel and Matthew Roberts was deferred into shares of the Company .

Long-term incentives §
Awards with performance periods ending in the year – Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)
The L TIP awards shown in the single figure relate to 2012 ESOS awards which were due to vest in March 2015.
The performance condition was as follows:
 — Vesting based on three-year EPS growth ranging from 4 per cent p.a. to 6 per cent p.a. 100 per cent vests for growth of 6 per cent p.a. 
or higher; 33 per cent vests for growth of 4 per cent p.a.; awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels. 
Awards lapse for growth of less than 4 per cent p.a.
 — Actual adjusted EPS growth over the period to 31 December 2014 was below the threshold level. As the performance condition has 
not been met, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2012 ESOS awards will lapse in March 2015
The ESOS does not form part of the forward looking policy for Executive Directors, and in 2013 the Company adopted the Performance 
Share Plan. Intu Properties plc  –  Annual Report 2014

** Vesting of awards is based 50 per cent on relative TSR and 50 per cent on Absolute Total Return (NAV growth per share plus dividends) performance, with targets equivalent to the 
2015 award.
Awards for 2015 – Performance Share Plan
Awards for 2015 will be 250 per cent of salary .
Awards under the plan vest one third after each of three, four and five years. 
A summary of the applicable targets are as follows:
Individual

(NA V growth per share plus dividends) 
(50% of award) 
T otal shareholder return relative  
to top-five UK-listed REITS  
(50% of award)
Minimum vesting (25% of element vesting) 6 per cent per annum TSR in line with the third-ranked company
Full vesting (100% of element vesting) 10 per cent per annum TSR in line with the top-ranked company
Straight line vesting between points Straight line vesting between points.  
Subject to a Committee-operated 
discretionary assessment of underlying 
financial performance
The combination of absolute return and relative return measures ensures a balanced assessment of Company performance and 
alignment to shareholders. In particular , both relative and absolute outperformance would be required for full vesting to be achieved.
Malus and clawback
Shares awarded under the Deferred Bonus Plan and the Performance Share Plan are subject to malus provisions. The Committee may 
apply malus at its discretion in circumstances including (but not limited to):
 — a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results
 — a material failure of risk management by the Company , any Group company or business unit
 — a material breach of any applicable health and safety or environmental regulations by the Company , any Group company 
or business unit
 — serious reputational damage to the Company , any Group company or business unit
 — serious misconduct of the individual
The annual bonus and the Performance Share Plan are also subject to clawback provisions. The Committee may at its discretion seek 
to apply clawback in circumstances of:
 — a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results where the individual is responsible or accountable (and where 
Executive Directors would always be deemed to have management responsibility)
 — serious misconduct of the individual
Clawback provisions may be applied up to two years following the determination of the annual incentive and up to one further year 
following vesting for awards under the Performance Share Plan. T aking into account the three, four and five year vesting timescales, 
this means that Performance Share Plan awards may be reclaimed for up to four , five and six years, respectively , from the date of award. Strategic report Governance Accounts Other information

Other share schemes
The Company operates an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) which has in the past used funds provided to purchase shares 
required under the annual bonus scheme.
The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) for all eligible employees, including Executive Directors, who may receive up 
to £3,600 worth of shares as part of their annual bonus arrangements. As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company offers eligible 
employees the opportunity to participate in a ‘Partnership’ share scheme, the terms of which are governed by HM Revenue & 
Customs regulations.
Season ticket loan
All employees of the Group are entitled to an interest-free travel season ticket loan which is repaid over the year via deductions from 
salary . Neither David Fischel nor Matthew Roberts received a season ticket or other loan from the Group during 2014.

UK real estate is a cyclical sector . Since 2009, a key driver for growth in value within the UK real estate market has been exposure to 
central London properties. As a result of the demerger of Capital & Counties from Liberty International (now intu Properties plc) in 2010, 
Intu’s portfolio does not include properties in central London and Intu has therefore not benefited from the recent uplift experienced by 
those property companies with exposure to London. However , given the cyclical nature of the property sector , we would not expect this 
trend to endure over the long-term cycle.

of benefits remains proportionate.
None.
Short-term incentive
T o align annual reward with annual 
performance and to support 
retention and alignment with 
shareholders’ interests through 
significant deferral of bonus into 
shares.
Intu operates a short-term incentive 
arrangement with a maximum 
individual opportunity .
A proportion of any earned 
bonus is normally deferred in Intu 
shares, vesting over two years and 
three years, subject to continued 
employment.
The Committee awards dividend 
equivalents in respect of dividends 
over the deferral period which 
may assume reinvestment on 
a cumulative basis.
The Committee has discretion 
to apply malus to unvested

measured relative to targets in key 
financial, operational and strategic 
objectives in the year .

Long-term incentives
T o reward good long-term decisions 
which help grow the value of Intu 
over a three to five-year horizon 
and support the retention of key 
executives
Intu operates a Performance Share 
Plan (PSP), which was approved by 
shareholders at the 2013 AGM.
Grants are made to eligible 
employees at the discretion of 
the Committee.
Awards can be made as 
performance shares, nil-cost options 
or jointly owned equity , and vest one 
third, one-third, one third after three, 
four and five years respectively .
The Committee awards dividend 
equivalents in respect of dividends 
over the vesting period, which 
may assume reinvestment on 
a cumulative basis.
The Committee has discretion to 
apply malus to unvested awards in 
certain circumstances including if 
there is a material misstatement in 
the annual financial statements or a 
material failure of risk management 
by the Company .
Normal maximum grant size of 250 
per cent of salary per annum.
In exceptional circumstances 
opportunity of up to 375 per cent 
of salary . T o ensure that participants 
were not unduly disadvantaged as 
a result of the move towards longer 
time horizons, the first award under 
the plan had an opportunity of 375 
per cent.
Long-term incentive performance 
conditions are reviewed on an 
annual basis, and are chosen to be 
aligned with the long-term success 
of the business.
The intention is that measures will 
be one or more of TSR, total return/
NA V growth, EPS growth, relative 
total property return or return on 
capital.
For 2014, awards will be based 
 — 50 per cent on relative TSR
 — 50 per cent on total return  
(NA V growth plus dividends)
If the Committee considers that 
the level of vesting based on the 
extent to which the performance 
conditions have been satisfied is 
not a fair reflection of underlying 
financial performance, the 
Committee may adjust the level 
of vesting (upwards or downwards) 
accordingly . For the current 
performance measures this applies 
to the TSR portion only .
Entry vesting is 25 per cent 
of maximum.
All employee share plans
T o align interests of employees with

Executive Directors may participate 
in the HMRC approved Share 
Incentive Plan on the same basis as 
all employees.
Participants can contribute up to

market levels and the skills and experience required.
Non-Executive Directors normally receive a basic fee and an additional fee 
for specific Board responsibilities, including membership and chairmanship 
of committees.
The Chairman is entitled to receive certain benefits in addition to fees.
Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive Directors on a per diem basis 
to reflect increased time commitment in certain limited circumstances.
Expenses incurred in the performance of non-executive duties for the 
Company may be reimbursed or paid for directly by the Company , as

The Directors present their 
Annual Report and the audited 
financial statements of the 
Group and Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2014. 
Pages 2 to 86 inclusive of this Annual 
Report comprise the Directors’ report 
that has been drawn up and presented

The Financial review on pages 40 to 
46, accounting policies on pages 102 
to 105 and note 35 on pages 127 to 
132 contain information on the use of 
financial instruments. 
Dividends 
The Directors declared an interim ordinary 
dividend of 4.6 pence (2013 – 4.6 pence 
as adjusted for the rights issue bonus 
factor) per share on 31 July 2014, which 
was paid on 25 November 2014, and have 
recommended a final ordinary dividend of 
9.1 pence per share (2013 – 9.1 pence as 
adjusted for the rights issue bonus factor). 
Share capital and control of the 
Company 
Details of the Company’s share capital 
including changes during the year in the 
issued share capital and details of the 
rights attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in note 37 on pages 133 
and 134. No shareholder holds securities 
carrying special rights with regards to 
control of the Company . Shares held by the

rights and rights of acceptance of any 
offer relating to the shares rest with the 
Plan’s T rustee and are not exercisable by 
the employees. 
There are no restrictions on voting rights 
or any arrangements by which, with the

shareholders known to the Company 
which may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of shares or on voting rights. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. 
Shareholders’ attention is drawn to the 
going concern disclosure contained in the 
notes to the accounts on page 101.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year . Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group and Company financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group and Company for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements 
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the financial and corporate governance information as 
provided on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair , balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s and the Group’s performance, business model 
and strategy .
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section on pages 54 and 55 confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge: 
(a)  the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group 
(b)  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces

Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality — Overall Group materiality: £96 million which represents 1% of total assets. 
Audit scope — The Group and Company financial statements are produced by the Group’s central finance department 
using a single, consolidated general ledger , and the whole business was subject to the same audit scope.
Areas of focus — Valuation of Investment Properties
 — Business combinations entered into during the year
 — Application of new accounting standards
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular , we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we 
also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
Directors that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order 
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of Investment Properties
Refer to page 65 (Audit Committee report), page 103 
(Accounting policies), page 101 (Critical accounting estimates 
and assumptions) and note 19 to the financial statements.
The existence of significant estimation uncertainty, coupled with 
the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual 
property valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material 
change, warrants specific audit focus in this area. 
The Group’s Investment Properties are all shopping centres and 
comprise the majority of the assets in the Consolidated balance 
sheet, their carrying value amounting to £8.0bn. 
The valuation of the Group’s property portfolio is inherently 
subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature 
of each property, its location and the expected future rental 
revenues for that particular property. 
The valuations were carried out by third party valuers, CBRE, 
DTZ, Knight Frank, Jones Lang LaSalle and Cushman & Wakefield 
(the “Valuers”). The Valuers were engaged by the Directors, and 
performed their work in accordance with the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation – Professional 
Standards. The Valuers used by the Group are well-known 
firms, with considerable experience of the market in which the 
Group operates. 
In determining a property’s valuation the Valuers take into 
account property specific current information such as the 
current tenancy agreements and rental income attached to 
the asset. They then apply assumptions as regards yield and 
current market rent, which are influenced by prevailing market 
yields and comparable market transactions, to arrive at the final 
valuation. Due to the unique nature of each shopping centre, 
the assumptions to be applied are determined having regard to 
the individual property characteristics at a granular , unit by unit 
level, as well as considering the qualities of the shopping centre 
as a whole.
During 2014 significant transactions took place in the market 
involving shopping centres. The prices paid indicated that the 
value of the shopping centres which make up the Group’s 
portfolio had increased compared to the valuation reflected in 
the Group’s 31 December 201 3 balance sheet. 
We read the valuation reports for all properties and attended 
meetings with each of the Valuers. We confirmed that the 
valuation approach for each was in accordance with RICS 
and suitable for use in determining the carrying value in the 
Consolidated balance sheet. 
We assessed the Valuers’ qualifications and expertise and read 
their terms of engagement with the Group to determine whether 
there were any matters that might have affected their objectivity 
or may have imposed scope limitations upon their work. We also 
considered other engagements which might exist between 
the Group and the Valuers. We found no evidence to suggest 
that the objectivity of any Valuer in their performance of the 
valuations was compromised.
We carried out procedures, on a sample basis, to test whether 
property specific current information supplied to the Valuers by 
management reflected the underlying property records held by 
the Group and which had been tested during our audit. We found 
them to be consistent.
Our work focused on the largest properties in the portfolio 
and those properties where the assumptions used and / or 
year on year capital value movement suggested a possible 
outlier versus market data for the shopping centre sector . 
We compared the investment yields used by the Valuers to an 
estimated range of expected yields, determined via reference to 
published benchmarks. We also considered the reasonableness 
of other assumptions that are not so readily comparable to 
published benchmarks, such as Estimated Rental Value, void 
rates and rent free periods. Finally, we evaluated year on 
year movements in capital value with reference to published 
benchmarks. Where assumptions were outside the expected 
range or otherwise deemed unusual, and/or valuations appeared 
to experience unexpected movements, we undertook further 
investigations and, when necessary, held further discussions with 
the Valuers. In this way professional scepticism was exercised in 
our evaluation of whether assumptions were appropriate in light 
of the evidence provided by significant transactions which had 
taken place in the market during the year . 
It was evident from our interaction with management and 
the Valuers and our review of the valuation reports that 
close attention had been paid to each property’s individual 
characteristics at a granular , unit by unit level, as well as 
considering the overall quality, geographic location and 
desirability of the asset as a whole. The evaluation of what 
were the right assumptions to apply to any given property 
included determining the level of impact that recent significant 
market transactions should have on each individual property’s 
valuation, given its unique characteristics. We saw evidence that 
alternative assumptions had been considered and evaluated 
by management and the Valuers, before determining the final 
valuation. We concluded that the assumptions used in the 
valuations were supportable in light of available and comparable 
market evidence.  Accounts

Business combinations entered into during the year
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee report), page 105 
(Accounting policies), and note 40 to the financial statements.
On 1 May 2014 the Group acquired 100% interests in shopping 
centres at Derby and Sprucefield, and a 50% joint venture 
interest in the Merry Hill shopping centre, from Westfield. 
The consideration paid was £854.9m.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a single business 
combination, with a gain on acquisition of £1.6m, calculated by 
reference to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. 
The consolidated financial statements include disclosures 
relating to the business combination, required by IFRS 3 
Business combinations.
Following acquisition, the tenancy details and general ledger 
balances for each of the entities acquired were migrated onto the 
Group’s systems. Prior to migration, balances were mapped to 
the Group’s own general ledger account lines, with adjustments 
made as required to ensure that the balances entering the 
system were in line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
Due to the volume of data being integrated onto the Group’s 
systems, the adjustments required and the level of manual 
processing, there exists a risk that the financial information in 
relation to entities acquired during the year may not have been 
migrated on to the Group accounting systems accurately and 
completely, resulting in a risk of material misstatement. As a 
result the migration of financial data relating to the entities 
acquired onto the Group’s systems, as well as the accounting for 
the business combination, was an area of focus in our audit.
We inspected the purchase agreements and assessed 
management’s determination of the fair value of assets and 
liabilities acquired. We focused on the fair value of the acquired 
properties, including the valuation methodology applied and the 
assumptions within the acquisition date valuation. We considered 
the reasons for the movements in the valuation between the 
acquisition date and the 30 June 2014 valuation point, in order 
to assess whether there was information which came to light 
within the two month period which should have impacted on 
the 1 May 2014 valuations. We also reviewed the disclosures in 
respect of the acquisitions from Westfield which were included 
in the 31 December 2014 financial statements. Our assessment 
included consideration of whether the acquisition of the 
50% share in Merry Hill formed part of the single business 
acquired. We noted that the acquisitions were acquired from 
one vendor and announced as one transaction on the same 
day. We concluded that the accounting and disclosures were in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The 31 December 2014 year end is the first for which we have 
been required to audit the Merry Hill joint venture, intu Derby 
and Sprucefield, both for the purposes of the Group audit, and 
for the purposes of the audits of the individual subsidiary entities 
which were acquired. We therefore performed first year audit 
procedures which focused on:
 — Evaluation and testing of the controls over the transfer of 
accounting records onto the Group’s general ledger and lease 
data onto the Group’s lease system; and
 — Assessment of adjustments posted during the transfer 
process in order to bring the numbers in line with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
There were no concerns arising from our work over the migration 
of data onto the Group’s systems. Accounts

Application of new accounting standards
Refer to page 64 (Audit Committee report), page 101 (Accounting 
convention and basis of preparation), and notes 22 and 48 to the 
financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 201 4 are the first to be prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of new standards on accounting for joint 
ventures and joint operations (IFRS 10, 1 1 , 1 2 and the revised IAS 
27 and 28). As a result, the Group’s investments in joint ventures 
are subject to equity accounting for the first time, as opposed to 
being proportionally accounted for in the income statement and 
balance sheet of the Group.
The adoption of the new standards involves the re-presentation 
of prior period amounts for balances related to joint ventures. 
Joint ventures entered into during the year ended 31 December 
201 4 are also required to be equity accounted for . The standard 
requires disclosure of how the 201 4 Group financial statements 
would have been presented, prior to the re-presentation as a result 
of IFRS 1 1.
The comparatives have been re-presented for the changes 
in classification and further details are provided in note 48. 
An additional balance sheet showing the re-presented 1 January 
201 3 position has also been given.
Due to the judgement involved in determining the appropriate 
classification of an investments (as a joint venture or joint 
operation) and due to the size and number of balances being re-
presented, the application of the new accounting standards was an 
area of focus in our audit.
We performed an assessment as to whether the requirements of 
IFRS 10, 1 1, 1 2 and the revised IAS 27 , 28 had been appropriately 
reflected in the consolidated financial statements. This included 
assessing whether balances related to joint ventures which have 
moved from proportional consolidation to the equity method of 
accounting, had been correctly re-presented in accordance with 
IFRS 1 2. We also assessed whether the numbers which show how 
the 2014 Group financial statements would have been presented, 
prior to the re-presentation were in line with the requirements 
of the accounting standard. Our procedures covered all joint 
ventures as at 31 December 2014, including the intu Uxbridge, 
Parque Principado, and intu Merry Hill joint ventures entered into 
during the year . We concluded that the accounting treatment 
adopted and disclosures included in the financial statements are 
in accordance with the new standards. 
For those joint ventures entered into during the year we assessed 
the classification as a joint venture, with a particular focus on intu 
Uxbridge, where the Group’s share is 20%. We concluded that 
the classification in each case is supported by the Group’s ability 
to exercise joint control.
How we tailored the audit scope
In establishing the overall approach to our audit, we assessed the risk of material misstatement, taking into account the nature, 
likelihood and potential magnitude of any misstatement. Following this assessment, we applied professional judgement to determine 
the extent of testing required over each balance in the financial statements. 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in 
which the Group operates. 
Although the Group has some interests in shopping centre operations outside the UK, the Group is structured as a single reporting 
unit with a centralised accounting function, therefore the whole business was subject to the same audit scope. The Group and 
Company financial statements are produced using numbers which are maintained on a single, consolidated trial balance, by the 
Group’s finance department. The majority of the underlying accounting records are maintained on the Group’s single general ledger . 
The intu Derby, intu Merry Hill and Sprucefield centres were in scope for the first time this year , having been purchased during 2014. 
For Manchester Arndale, Cribbs Causeway, Centaurus Retail Park, Parque Principado and St David’s, Cardiff rental income and 
property expense numbers are submitted quarterly by external property managers to the Group’s finance department, who then 
review and enter the numbers onto the Group’s general ledger . We performed auditing procedures over the numbers within those 
quarterly submissions, and on the process by which they are entered onto the Group’s general ledger . The quarterly submissions for 
Parque Principado were in scope for the first time this year .
Materiality
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  Accounts

continued
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £96 million (201 3: £82 million).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied In arriving at this judgement we have had regard to the carrying value of the Group’s 
assets, acknowledging that the primary measurement attribute of the Group is the 
carrying value of investment property. This represents a consistent year-on-year basis for 
determining materiality.
In addition, we set a specific materiality level of £8 million (201 3: £7 million) for rental income and expenses. In arriving at this 
judgement we have had regard to underlying operating profit acknowledging that this is a secondary measurement attribute of the 
Group. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £8 million 
(201 3: £8 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 101, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using 
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However , because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other in formation
Companies Act 2006 opinions
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial

Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to 
be fair , balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for members to assess 
the Group’s and company’s performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with 
our knowledge of the Group and company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report arising from 
this responsibility.
 — the section of the Annual Report on pages 63 to 67 , as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code,

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 86, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error . 
This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the Directors; and
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming 
our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the 
financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

1 Accounting convention and basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations 
and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRS. The Directors have taken 
advantage of the exemption offered by Section 408 of the 
Companies Act not to present a separate income statement 
or statement of comprehensive income for the Company.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation 
of property, available-for-sale investments, and certain other 
financial assets and liabilities. A summary of the more important 
Group accounting policies is set out in note 2.
The accounting policies used are consistent with those applied in 
the last annual financial statements, as amended to reflect the 
adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations 
which became effective in the year . During 2014, the following 
relevant standards, amendments and interpretations endorsed 
by the EU became effective for the first time for the Group’s 
31 December 2014 financial statements:
 — IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements;
 — IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements;
 — IFRS 1 2 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities;
 — IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements (revised);
 — IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (revised); 
 — IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (amendment);
 — IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (amendment); and
 — Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 1 1 and IFRS 1 2 
(transition guidance).
IFRS 1 1 removes the choice of accounting treatments previously 
available under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures. This has 
impacted the Group’s accounting policy in respect of joint 
ventures but has had no impact for joint operations. The Group’s 
interests in joint ventures are now accounted for using the equity 
method with the income statement and balance sheet showing a 
single line for the Group’s share of profit and the net investment 
in joint ventures respectively, rather than proportionally 
consolidating the Group’s share of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses on a line-by-line basis. The Group’s interest in 
joint operations is accounted for by including its interest in 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis. 
This change in accounting policy has had no impact on net assets 
or profit for the year ended 31 December 201 3. The comparatives 
have been re-presented for the changes in classification and 
further details are provided in note 48. An additional balance 
sheet showing the re-presented 31 December 201 2 position 
which also reflects the position at 1 January 201 3 has also 
been given. 
Other pronouncements have not had a material impact on 
the financial statements, but have resulted in changes to 
presentation or disclosure.
A number of standards have been issued but are not yet adopted 
by the EU and so are not available for early adoption. The most 
significant of these are IFRS 9 Financial Instruments along with 
related amendments to other IFRSs, and IFRS 1 5 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers. Based on the Group’s current 
circumstances, these standards are not expected to have a 
material impact on the financial statements. 
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on 
management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, 
actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. 
In particular , significant judgement is required in the use of 
estimates and assumptions in the valuation and accounting for 
investment and development property and derivative financial 
instruments. Additional detail on these two areas is provided 
in the relevant accounting policy in note 2 and in other notes 
to the financial statements, such as investment properties 
and derivatives.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic review on pages 18 to 25. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial review on 
pages 40 to 46. In addition, note 35 includes the Group’s risk 
management objectives, details of its financial instruments and 
hedging activities, its exposures to liquidity risk and details of its 
capital structure.
The Group prepares regular forecasts and projections which 
include sensitivity analysis taking into account a number of 
downside risks to the forecast including reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance and asset values and assesses 
the potential impact of these on the Group’s liquidity position and 
available resources.
In preparing the most recent projections, factors taken into 
account include £260 million of cash (including the Group’s 
share of cash in joint ventures of £30 million) and £4 1 1 million 
of undrawn facilities at 31 December 2014. The refinancing of 
debt completed in the year , extending the Group’s debt maturity 
profile to 8.4 years, along with the relatively long-term and stable 
nature of the cash flows receivable under tenant leases were also 
factored into the forecasts.
After reviewing the most recent projections and the sensitivity 
analysis, the Directors have concluded that there is a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus we 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the Group’s financial statements.

2 Accounting policies – Group and Company 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information includes the Company 
and its subsidiaries and their interests in joint arrangements 
and associates.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains 
on transactions between Group companies are eliminated 
on consolidation.
– subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity which the Company controls, that is 
when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Company’s investment in Group companies is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. 
– joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which two or more 
parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed 
sharing of control of an arrangement where decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties 
sharing joint control.
A joint operation is a joint arrangement where the parties that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, 
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
The Group’s interest in a joint operation is accounted for by 
consolidating the Group’s share of the assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses on a line-by-line basis.
A joint venture is a joint arrangement where the parties that have 
joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of 
the arrangement.
The Group’s interest in a joint venture is accounted for using the 
equity method as described below.
– associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company, either directly 
or indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant influence. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policies of the entity but is not control or joint 
control of those policies. The Group’s interest in an associate is 
accounted for using the equity method as described below.
– the equity method
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint 
ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the 
post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other 
comprehensive income. Loan balances relating to long-term 
funding from Group companies to joint ventures and associates 
are presented on the face of the balance sheet as part of 
the investment.
– non-controlling interest
A non-controlling interest is the equity in a subsidiary not 
attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company. Non-
controlling interests are presented within equity, separately from 
the amounts attributable to owners of the Company. Profit or 
loss and each component of other comprehensive income is 
attributed to owners of the Company and to non-controlling 
interests in the appropriate proportions.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which it operates. The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is 
the Group’s presentation currency.
The assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into 
pounds sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the reporting 
date and their income statement and cash flows are translated at 
the average rate for the period. Exchange differences arising are 
dealt with in other comprehensive income.
At entity level, transactions in currencies other than an entity’s 
functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing 
at the transaction dates. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from settlement of these transactions and from 
retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement 
except where these relate to loans to foreign subsidiary entities 
considered to be part of the net investment in those entities 
in which case these amounts as recorded through other 
comprehensive income. 
Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can 
be reliably measured and it is probable that future economic 
benefits will flow to the Group.
– property revenue
Rental income receivable is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Directly attributable lease incentives 
are recognised within rental income on the same basis. 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not 
fixed at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising 
on rent reviews or rents linked to tenant revenues, are recorded 
as income in the periods in which they are earned. Rent reviews 
are recognised as income from the date of the rent review, 
based on management’s estimates. Estimates are derived 
from knowledge of market rents for comparable properties 
determined on an individual property basis and updated for 
progress of negotiations.
Service charge income is recognised on an accruals basis in line 
with the service being provided.
– trading property income
Revenue on the sale of trading property is recognised when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer . This will normally take place on exchange 
of contracts. Accounts

2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued)
Interest income
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment 
has been established.
Share-based payments
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration is recognised through the income statement with 
reference to the fair value of the equity instrument, assessed at 
the date of grant. This cost is charged to the income statement 
over the vesting period of the awards. All awards are accounted 
for as equity settled with the credit entry being taken directly to 
equity. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is 
reversed if it appears probable that the performance criteria will 
not be met.
For share options an option pricing model is used applying 
assumptions around expected yields, forfeiture rates, exercise 
price and volatility. Where the share awards have non-market 
related performance criteria the Group has used the Black-
Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair 
values. Where the share awards have a TSR market related 
performance criteria the Group has used the Monte-Carlo 
simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values.
Investments held in the Company’s own shares in connection 
with employee share plans and other share-based payment 
arrangements are accounted for as treasury shares (see 
accounting policy below).
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view 
are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size, 
nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance. 
Taxation
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method 
in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and their 
tax bases.
T emporary differences are not provided on the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to 
the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and 
are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believe it is probable that future taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary differences can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when 
they relate to taxes levied by the same authority and the Group 
intends to settle them on a net basis.
T ax is included in the income statement except when it relates 
to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income or 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised directly in 
other comprehensive income or equity.
Investment and development property
Investment and development property is owned or leased 
by the Group and held for long-term rental income and 
capital appreciation.
The Group has elected to use the fair value model. 
Properties are initially recognised at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by 
professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of market 
value. Valuations conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered 
Surveyors (‘RICS’), Valuation – Professional Standards 2014.
The main estimates and judgements underlying the valuations 
are described in note 19.
Properties held under leases are stated gross of the recognised 
finance lease liability. 
The cost of investment and development property includes 
capitalised interest and other directly attributable outgoings 
incurred during development. Interest is capitalised on the 
basis of the average rate of interest paid on the relevant debt 
outstanding. Interest ceases to be capitalised on the date of 
practical completion.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment and development property are recognised 
in the income statement. 
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment and 
development property.
Gains or losses arising on the sale of investment and 
development property are recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the 
buyer . The gain or loss recognised is the proceeds received less 
the carrying value of the property and costs directly associated 
with the sale.
Leases
Leases are classified according to the substance of the 
transaction. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease. 
All other leases are normally classified as operating leases.
Group as lessee
Finance leases of investment property are accounted for as 
finance leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to 
pay future minimum lease payments. The investment property 
asset is included in the balance sheet at fair value, gross of the 
recognised finance lease liability. Contingent rents are recognised 
as they accrue. Notes to the accounts

Intu Properties plc  –  Annual Report 2014

2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued)
Other finance lease assets are capitalised at the lower of the fair 
value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and the useful life of the asset.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Group as lessor
Investment properties are leased to tenants under operating 
leases, with rental income being recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. For more detail see the revenue 
recognition accounting policy.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment consists of vehicles, fixtures, fittings 
and other equipment. Plant and equipment is stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life up to a maximum 
of five years.
Other investments
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended to 
be held for an indefinite period, are initially and subsequently 
measured at fair value. For listed investments, fair value is the 
current bid market value at the reporting date. For unlisted 
investments where there is no active market, fair value is 
assessed using an appropriate methodology as described in 
note 25.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are included in 
other comprehensive income, except to the extent that losses are 
considered to represent a permanent impairment, in which case 
they are recognised in the income statement. 
Upon disposal, accumulated fair value adjustments are 
reclassified from reserves to the income statement.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is assessed for 
impairment on an annual basis.
Impairment of assets
The Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to 
determine whether events or changes in circumstances exist 
that indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs to sell and its value in use. An impairment loss 
is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which 
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows.
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews whether there is 
any indication that an impairment loss recognised in previous 
periods may have decreased. If such an indication exists the 
asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods is reversed if, and only if, there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s 
recoverable amount. In this case the asset’s carrying amount 
is increased to its recoverable amount but not exceeding the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised. The reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement. No impairment 
reversals are permitted to be recognised on goodwill.
Trading property
T rading property comprises those properties either intended for 
sale or in the process of construction for sale. T rading property is 
carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Trade receivables
T rade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
The Directors exercise judgement as to the collectability of 
trade receivables and determine if it is appropriate to impair 
these assets. Factors such as days past due, credit status of the 
counterparty and historical evidence of collection are considered.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits with 
banks, whether restricted or unrestricted, and other short-term 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or less.
Trade payables
T rade payables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Pensions
The costs of defined contribution schemes and contributions 
to personal plans are charged to the income statement in the 
year in which they are incurred. The Group has no defined 
benefit scheme.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds on issue 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost with the exception of 
certain convertible bonds as detailed in note 33. Any transaction 
costs and premiums or discounts are recognised over the 
contractual life using the effective interest method.
In the event of early repayment, all unamortised transaction 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Accounts

2 Accounting policies – Group and Company (continued)
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage 
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risk. 
They are initially recognised on the trade date at fair value and 
subsequently re-measured at fair value. In assessing fair value the 
Group uses its judgement to select suitable valuation techniques 
and make assumptions which are mainly based on market 
conditions existing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of 
interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future 
cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract 
and using market interest rates for similar instruments at the 
measurement date. These values are tested for reasonableness 
based upon broker or counterparty quotes.
Amounts paid under derivative financial instruments (currently 
for the Group this relates to interest rate swaps), both on 
obligations as they fall due and on early settlement, are 
recognised in the income statement as finance costs. Fair value 
movements on revaluation of derivative financial instruments are 
shown in the income statement through changes in fair value of 
financial instruments.
The Group does not currently apply hedge accounting to its 
interest rate swaps.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. 
In the case of interim dividends to owners, this is the date of 
payment. In the case of final dividends, this is when declared by 
shareholders at the AGM.
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are assessed on issue, as to whether they 
should be classified as a financial liability, as equity or as a 
compound financial instrument with both debt and equity 
components. This assessment is based on the terms of the bond 
and in accordance with IAS 32. Each bond is assessed separately 
and the detailed accounting treatment of each is given in note 33.
Treasury shares
Investments held in the Company’s own shares are deducted 
from equity at cost. Where such shares are subsequently sold, 
any consideration received is recognised directly in equity.
Current/non-current classification
Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, 
cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised 
in, or intended for sale or consumption in, the course of the 
Group’s operating cycle. All other assets are classified as non-
current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading 
purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the 
Group’s operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year 
from the reporting date. All other liabilities are classified as non-
current liabilities.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with 
IFRS 3 Business Combinations using the acquisition method of 
accounting. The consideration transferred for the acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the 
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. 
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any 
asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Costs associated with the acquisition are expensed 
as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on an acquisition comprises the excess of the 
consideration over the fair value of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets 
and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration this difference is 
recognised in the income statement at the date of the acquisition. Notes to the accounts

3 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are determined based on the internal reporting and operational management of the Group. The Group is 
primarily a UK shopping centre focused business and has one reportable operating segment. 
The principal profit indicator used to measure performance is net rental income. An analysis of net rental income is given in note 4.
The Group’s geographical segments are set out below. This represents where the Group’s assets reside and where revenues are 
generated. In the case of investments this reflects where the investee is located.

number of assignments.
1 Relates to review of the Group’s Interim Report.
2  2014 included £916,000 in respect of reporting accountant work associated with the rights issue and raising debt on intu Trafford Centre 
and within the Secured Group Structure (SGS).
   The role of the reporting accountant requires detailed knowledge of the entities involved. If a firm other than the audit firm were to 
undertake this work then they would have to spend a significant amount of additional time becoming familiar with those entities. 
PwC were therefore chosen to undertake this work as it was considered to be sensible and more efficient both in terms of time and costs. 
For the same reasons, certain elements of the SGS work were undertaken by another firm that had performed the most recent audit for 
those entities. 
  2014 also included £118,000 in respect of financial due diligence related to the acquisition of intu Merry Hill, intu Derby and Sprucefield. 
PwC were chosen to undertake this work on efficiency grounds given the overall assignment, including reporting accountant work on 
the rights issue. Additionally, as for all non-audit work, consideration was given as to whether PwC’s independence could be affected by 
undertaking this work. It was concluded that this would not be the case.
  2013 principally related to reporting accountant work associated with the Group raising debt within the SGS and on intu Metrocentre. 
The reasons for using PwC were the same as above. Notes to the accounts

In 2014, the Company offered shareholders the option to receive ordinary shares instead of cash for the 201 3 final and 2014 interim 
dividends of 9. 1 pence (as adjusted by the bonus factor) and 4.6 pence respectively under the Scrip Dividend Scheme. As a result 
of elections made by shareholders 16,442,684 new ordinary shares of 50 pence each were issued on 20 May 2014 and 5,257 ,861 
new ordinary shares of 50 pence each were issued on 25 November 2014 in lieu of dividends otherwise payable. This resulted in 
£62.2 million of cash being retained in the business.
In 201 3, the Scrip Dividend Scheme resulted in £56.2 million of cash being retained in the business.
Details of the shares in issue and dividends waived are given in notes 37 and 39.
17 Earnings per share
On 22 April 2014, the Company issued 278,24 1,628 new ordinary shares of 50 pence each through a rights issue. Further details of the 
rights issue are provided in note 37 . T o reflect the rights issue, the number of shares previously used to calculate basic, diluted, headline 
and underlying earnings per share have been amended in the table shown below. An adjustment factor of 1.098 has been applied, 
based on the ratio of an adjusted (ex-dividend) closing share price of 301. 1 pence per share on 28 March 2014, the business day before 
the shares started trading ex-rights and the theoretical ex-rights price at that date of 27 4.2 pence per share. The adjusted share price 
has been calculated based on the Company’s share price of 31 1. 1 pence per share on 28 March 2014 less the 201 3 final dividend of 
10 pence per share which the rights issue shares were not entitled to.

T ransfers into and transfers out of the fair value hierarchy levels are recognised on the date of the event or change in circumstances 
that caused the transfer . There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 for investment properties during the year .
The market value of investment and development property at 31 December 2014 includes £7 4.4 million (31 December 201 3 – 
£29.3 million) in respect of property considered to be developments. These are accounted for as investment property and are valued 
using the same methodology as other investment property.
The Group has only one class of investment and development property asset. All the Group’s significant investment and development 
property relates to prime shopping centres which are of a similar nature and share characteristics and risks.  Notes to the accounts

Valuation process
It is the Group’s policy to engage independent external valuers to determine the market value of its investment and development 
property at both 30 June and 31 December . The Group provides information to the valuers, including current lease and tenant data 
along with asset specific business plans. The valuers use this and other inputs including market transactions for similar properties to 
produce valuations (see valuation methodology below). These valuations and the assumptions they have made are then discussed and 
reviewed with the Group’s asset management team and Directors.
The Group engages a number of independent valuation experts to undertake the Group’s property valuations. A summary of the 
valuers and the value of property assets they have been engaged to value is given below:

Others 10.0 6.9
8,081.6 7,339.1
In addition to the above, investment properties in the Group’s joint ventures were valued by Knight Frank, Jones Lang LaSalle and DTZ. 
Valuation fees are a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers in advance of the valuation and are not linked to the 
valuation output. 
Valuation methodology
The fair value of the Group’s investment and development property as at 31 December 2014 was determined by independent 
external valuers at that date. The valuations are in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – 
Professional Standards 2014 and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties. Fair values for investment 
properties are calculated using the present value income approach. The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to 
rent profile and yields as discussed below.
The key driver of the property valuations is the terms of the leases in place at the valuation date. These determine the majority of 
the cash flow profile of the property for a number of years and therefore form the base of the valuation. The valuation assumes 
adjustments from these rental values to current market rent at the time of the next rent review (where a typical lease allows only 
for upward adjustment) and as leases expire and are replaced by new leases. The current market level of rent is assessed based on 
evidence provided by the most recent relevant leasing transactions and negotiations. This is based on evidence available at the date of 
valuation and does not assume future increases in market rent.
The nominal equivalent yield is applied as a discount rate to the rental cash flows which, after taking into account other input 
assumptions such as vacancies and costs, generates the market value of the property. The nominal equivalent yield applied is assessed 
by reference to market transactions for similar properties and takes into account, amongst other things, any risks associated with the 
rent uplift assumptions.
Annual property income as disclosed in the table below reflects current annualised gross income.
The net initial yield is calculated as the current net income over the gross market value of the asset and is used as a sense check and to 
compare against market transactions for similar properties.
Full definitions of nominal equivalent yield, annual property income and net initial yield are provided in the Glossary.
The valuation output, inputs and assumptions, are reviewed to ensure that they are in line with those of market participants. 
A significant change in the nominal equivalent yield in isolation, would result in a significant change in the value of investment and 
development property. A decrease in nominal equivalent yield of 50 basis points would result in an increase in the total market value 
of £87 4 million (31 December 201 3 – £718 million re-presented), while a 50 basis point increase would result in a decrease in the total 
market value of £718 million (31 December 201 3 – £61 1 million re-presented). Accounts

23 Joint operations
The Group’s interests in Cribbs Causeway and Manchester Arndale are accounted for as joint operations. The Group holds 50 per cent 
beneficial interests in the relevant freehold or leasehold of these properties. Each joint arrangement is governed by a T rust Deed giving 
each party rights to income, and obligations for expenses, in respect of their beneficial interest in the property. The management 
of the property is established under the T rust Deed as being undertaken by an entity jointly controlled by the beneficial owners of 
the property. This entity does not have the right to a share of the income or expenditure from the property, other than the receipt 
of a management fee. Therefore these interests are accounted for as joint operations. The principal place of business of the joint 
operations is England.

Investment in associates comprises a 32.4 per cent holding in the ordinary shares of Prozone Intu Properties Limited (formerly Prozone 
Capital Shopping Centres Limited) (‘Prozone’) (incorporated in India).
As required by IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, the equity method of accounting is applied in accounting for the 
Group’s investment in Prozone. The results of Prozone for the year to 30 September have been used as 31 December information is 
not available in time for these financial statements. Those results are adjusted to be in line with the Group’s accounting policies and 
include the most recent property valuations, as at 30 September 2014, determined by independent professionally qualified external 
valuers in line with the valuation methodology described in note 19. The market price per share at 31 December 2014 was INR26 
(31 December 201 3 – INR18), valuing the Group’s interest at £1 3.0 million (31 December 201 3 – £8.8 million). Following a review it was 
concluded no adjustment was required at this time.

reflected amounts held to match the 2014 loan notes shown within borrowings and cash deposited against a Spanish local property 
tax included within trade and other payables.
A number of the Group’s borrowing arrangements place certain restrictions on the rent received each quarter . These do not prevent 
access to or use of this funding within the borrowing entities, however they do place certain restrictions on moving those funds around 
the wider group, typically requiring debt servicing costs to be paid before restrictions are lifted.

The fair values have been established using the market value, where available. For those instruments without a market value, a 
discounted cash flow approach has been used. 
The Group substantially eliminates its interest rate exposure to floating rate debt through interest rate swaps as described in note 35.
The market value of assets secured as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2014 is £8,818.6 million. There are certain 
restrictions on the realisability of investment property where a credit facility secured on that property is in place. In most 
circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset. 
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.
The Company had non-current borrowings of £230.0 million at 31 December 2014 consisting of a revolving credit facility expiring in 
2019 (201 3 – £285.0 million). This debt is floating rate, secured and its fair value is equal to book value. Notes to the accounts

33 Convertible bonds
2.5 per cent convertible bonds (‘the 2.5 per cent bonds’)
On 4 October 201 2 Intu (Jersey) Limited (the ‘Issuer’) issued £300.0 million 2.5 per cent Guaranteed Convertible Bonds due 2018 at 
par all of which remain outstanding at 31 December 2014. At 31 December 2014 the exchange price was £3.5759 per ordinary share. 
The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations 
(including payments) in respect of the 2.5 per cent bonds and the obligations of the Company, as Guarantor , constitute direct, 
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company.
Subject to certain conditions, the 2.5 per cent bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or (at the Company’s election) any combination of 
ordinary shares and cash. The 2.5 per cent bonds can be converted at any time from 14 November 201 2 up to the 20th dealing day 
before the maturity date.
The initial exchange price was £4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 
£100,000 nominal of the 2.5 per cent bonds. Under the terms of the 2.5 per cent bonds, the exchange price is adjusted upon certain 
events including the rights issue on 22 April 2014 and the payment of dividends by the Company. 
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Company’s option subject to the Company’s ordinary share price having traded 
at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the 2.5 per cent 
bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled. If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the 
2.5 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018.
The 2.5 per cent bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair value 
with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the changes in fair value of financial instruments line. At 31 December 
2014, the fair value of the 2.5 per cent bonds was £325.6 million (201 3 – £31 2.8 million), with the change in fair value reflected in 
note 1 3. The 2.5 per cent bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During the year interest of £7 .5 million (201 3 – £7 .5 million) in respect of these bonds has been recognised within finance costs.
In the Company’s balance sheet the bondholder option is held at its fair value of £25.6 million on a derivative financial instrument.
3.75 per cent convertible bonds (‘the 3.75 per cent bonds’)
In 201 1 the Company issued £1 54.3 million, 3.75 per cent perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, with a conversion price of 
£4.00 per ordinary share, in connection with the acquisition of intu T rafford Centre. These were accounted for as equity at their fair 
value on issue which totalled £143.7 million. Following the rights issue on 22 April 2014, the conversion price was adjusted to £3.64 
per ordinary share. On 2 July 2014 a conversion notice was issued for all the bonds resulting in 42,394,779 new ordinary shares 
being issued. 
During the year interest of £2.9 million (201 3 – £5.8 million) has been recognised on these bonds directly in equity. This is deducted in 
arriving at earnings per share (see note 1 7).
34 Operating leases
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 1 5 years. Standard lease provisions include service charge 
payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent. Standard turnover based leases have a turnover 
percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail unit’s annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent 
and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group. 
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows:

35 Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Group’s operations being principally market risk (including interest 
rate risk, and foreign exchange risk), liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing 
each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk
a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of 
financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, 
whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR. Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at 
fixed rates. 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Group’s lenders, to eliminate substantially all exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in order to establish certainty over cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps. Such swaps have the economic effect of 
converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. 
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed 
in the Financial review on pages 40 to 46.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group:

Derivative impact (nominal value of interest rate swaps) 943.9 (943.9) 1,207.4 (1,207.4)
Net borrowings profile 3,682.3 504.7 3,500.2 354.5
Interest rate protection 87.9% 90.8%
1 Borrowings are stated at nominal value and excludes the Metrocentre compound financial instruments and finance leases. At 31 December 2014 they include the £230.0 million 
(2013 - £285.0 million) drawn under the revolving credit facility which incurs interest at a variable rate. Excluding the revolving credit facility borrowing interest rate protection is 93.1 per 
cent (2013 – 98.1 per cent).
Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 2.24 per cent (201 3 – 2.71 per cent).
Unallocated and forward starting swaps are excluded from the above calculation. The nominal value of these swaps is £7 46.7 million 
of which £1 25.0 million are forward starting. Their fair value of £242.5 million is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of £83.6 million 
(201 3 – £73.7 million) in the fair value of derivatives. The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest 
rates would be a negative movement of £90.2 million (201 3 – £78.7 million) in the fair value of derivatives. In practice, a parallel 
shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely. However , the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from 
the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur . Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are 
matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional 
currency other than sterling. The Group’s policy is to ensure the Group’s net exposure to foreign currency is less than 10 per cent of the 
Group’s equity attributable to owners of the Company. At 31 December 2014 the Group’s exposure amounted to 6.4 per cent of equity 
attributable to owners of the Company (31 December 201 3 – 7 .6 per cent). Notes to the accounts

The approximate impact of a 10 per cent appreciation in foreign exchange rates would be positive movement of £32.3 million 
(201 3 – £29.5 million) to equity attributable to owners of the Company. The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in 
foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of £26.5 million (201 3 – £24.2 million) to equity attributable to owners of 
the Company.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due. 
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Group’s operational requirements and 
committed investments. The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable 
securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements. Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 31. The Group’s 
policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk. In effect 
the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years. As at 31 December 2014, the maturity profile of Group 
debt showed an average maturity of eight years (201 3 – eight years). The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings 
and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by arranging a selection of maturity 
dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by re borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for 
market risk. 
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are 
those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency. Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange 
rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises 
primarily from trade receivables but also from the Group’s holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits and 
derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who 
continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, 
which is conducted internally. As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 
31 December 2014 is £3.4 million (201 3 – £4.0 million).
It is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows:

At 31 December 2014 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling £7 . 1 million (201 3 – £6. 1 million).
The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Group’s treasury department. 
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to 
limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and AAA).
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Level 3: Where one or more inputs to valuation are unobservable. Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more 
closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models. Such testing has not indicated that any material 
difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

Capital structure
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by 
managing the capital structure. The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and hybrid financial instruments. The Group aims to 
access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and interest cover . The Group’s stated 
medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 40–50 per cent range and interest cover to be greater 
than 1.60x. At 31 December 2014 the debt to asset ratio remains within the preferred range and the interest cover ratio continues to 
be above the preferred level.
As the Group’s debt is sometimes secured on joint ventures, these ratios are monitored for the Group including share of joint ventures. 
A reconciliation from the relevant amounts as presented to those including the Group’s share of joint ventures is presented in the

36 Deferred tax provision
Under IAS 1 2 Income T axes, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of assets and 
liabilities at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time the temporary differences are expected to reverse. 
For those UK assets and liabilities benefitting from REIT exemption, the relevant tax rate will be 0 per cent (201 3 – 0 per cent), for 
other UK assets and liabilities the relevant rate will be 21.5 per cent (201 3 – 20 per cent) and for other assets and liabilities the relevant 
tax rate will be the prevailing corporate tax rate in the relevant country.

timing of certain deductions for tax and accounting purposes.

Acquisition during 2014
On 1 May 2014 the Group acquired interests in a number of entities for a consideration of £854.9 million. These entities together hold a 
100 per cent interest in intu Derby, a 50 per cent joint venture interest in intu Merry Hill and a 100 per cent interest in Sprucefield retail 
park in Northern Ireland. The transaction is accounted for as a single business combination as this was announced as one deal, from 
one ultimate vendor and completed on the same day. Consideration was in cash and totalled £854.9 million, consisting of a payment 
on completion of £867 .8 million less £1 2.9 million received following final agreement of the completion balance sheet. The cash 
flow statement reflects the £854.9 million less the cash acquired of £3.6 million. Acquisition related costs of £1 1.8 million have been 
incurred in the year and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses. Further details of the acquisition 
are given in the Strategic review.
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is set out in the table below:

The fair value of the assets, investment in joint venture and liabilities acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration and as a 
result a gain of £1.6 million is recognised in the income statement on acquisition.
The acquired companies contributed £28.7 million to the revenue of the Group and £76.9 million to the profit of the Group for the year .
Acquisitions during 2013
Acquisition of Midsummer Place
On 25 March 201 3, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the Midsummer Place Shopping Centre (renamed intu Milton Keynes) with 
certain integrated activities, assets and liabilities for cash consideration of £248.6 million. Assets and liabilities acquired consisted of 
investment property with book and fair value of £250.5 million, along with other payables with book and fair value of £1.9 million. 
Consideration was equal to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and so no goodwill arose. Acquisition related costs of 
£1 1.2 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses.
During 201 3 the acquired business contributed £1 1.4 million to the revenue and £9.3 million to the profit of the Group. Notes to the accounts

Acquisition of Parque Principado
In 201 3, the Group and CPP Investment Board Real Estate Holdings Inc. (CPPIB) together established Parque Principado S.à r .l., set 
up for the purpose of acquiring Parque Principado. On 4 October 201 3 a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of Parque Principado S.à r .l., 
acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Parque Principado S.L. and other properties for total cash consideration of €168.6 million 
(£142.6 million). The businesses acquired form Parque Principado, a shopping centre in Oviedo, Spain. Acquisition related costs of 
£2.0 million were incurred and recognised in the income statement in exceptional administration expenses.
CPPIB held a 49 per cent non-controlling interest in Parque Principado S.à r .l., the holding company for the Group’s Parque Principado 
investment, and provided funding of £71. 1 million. In 2014, CPPIB exercised an option allowing them to acquire an additional one per 
cent of debt and equity, on terms in line with the original acquisition (see note 4 1 ).
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in 201 3 is set out in the table below:
Fair value

Trade and other receivables 1.1

T otal assets 158.8
Liabilities
Trade and other payables (8.4)
Deferred tax liabilities (12.0)
T otal liabilities (20.4)
Net assets 138.4
The fair value of the consideration of £142.6 million exceeded the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired resulting in the 
recognition of goodwill of £4.2 million in the balance sheet on acquisition. The goodwill arose due to the recognition of a deferred 
tax liability. The deferred tax liability is calculated, as required under IFRS, on the basis of the tax gain that would arise in the acquired 
company were it to dispose of the asset. 
During 201 3 the acquired businesses contributed £3.4 million to the revenue and £2.8 million to the profit of the Group.
41 Disposal of subsidiaries
On 20 June 2014, the Group sold 80 per cent of its interest in Intu Uxbridge Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary, for consideration of 
£1 7 4.6 million, before expenses of £1.3 million. The Group retains a 20 per cent interest in the company and as a result of the terms 
governing the management of the business, this interest has been accounted for as a joint venture from 20 June 2014. As a result of 
this transaction the Group has recorded a gain on disposal of £0.6 million in the income statement. The cash flow statement records 
a net inflow of £1 7 4. 1 million being cash received of £1 7 4.6 million net of cash in the business of £0.5 million.
During the year CPPIB, who held a 49 per cent non-controlling interest in Parque Principado S.à r .l., exercised an option allowing 
them to acquire an additional one per cent holding and certain rights relating to the management of the business. This has resulted 
in Parque Principado, previously accounted for as a subsidiary, being accounted for as a joint venture from that date. As a result the 
assets and liabilities of Parque Principado, previously recorded in the balance sheet at 100 per cent, and the related non-controlling 
interest in reserves of £68.7 million, have been reclassified to investments in joint ventures. The cash flow statement shows an outflow 
of £1 1.6 million representing cash in the business of £1 2.9 million, which is reclassified as part of the investment in joint ventures, net of 
consideration received on exercise of the option of £1.3 million. No gain or loss arose on exercise of the option. 
42 Capital commitments
At 31 December 2014, the Board had approved £80. 1 million (201 3 – £86. 1 million) of future expenditure for the purchase, 
construction, development and enhancement of investment property. Of this, £30.7 million (201 3 – £54.3 million) is contractually 
committed. The majority of this is expected to be spent in 201 5.
43 Contingent liabilities
At 31 December 2014, the Group has no material contingent liabilities other than those arising in the normal course of business. Accounts

49 Share-based payment
The Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements providing employee benefits and incentives. All schemes 
are equity settled, and as such the expense recognised in the income statement is based on the fair value of the equity instruments 
awarded as determined at their grant date. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group 
estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Share Option Schemes
Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Intu Properties plc Approved Share Option Scheme and the Intu 
Properties plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Certain grants are subject to an earnings per share (‘EPS’) performance condition. Options granted to members of the Executive 
Committee in 201 2 are subject to a sliding scale performance condition based on EPS growth of between 4 to 6 per cent per annum 
over a three-year period. Options granted to staff who are not members of the Executive Committee 201 2 are not subject to a 
performance condition. Notes to the accounts

Except in the case of a ‘good’ leaver , options may not be exercised within three years of grant and before satisfaction or waiver of any 
applicable performance condition, and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options become capable of exercise. 
The options automatically lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise during the year was 307p (201 3 – 334p).
The number of options outstanding at 31 December 2014 includes a total of 2, 1 50,54 1 (201 3 – 3,81 7 ,931 ) which are subject to a 
capped gain price of £2.8563 per share (as adjusted for rights issue). In 201 3, 663, 192 were subject to a capped price of £3.066 per 
share (adjusted for the rights issue). All were exercised in 2014. If the market price of shares at the date of exercise exceeds the capped 
price, the maximum gain the holder of such options can realise is the difference between exercise price and the capped price per share.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2014 had exercise prices between 232p and 292p (201 3 – between 272p and 528p) and a

Performance Share Plan 
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) for eligible employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 201 3 Annual General Meeting.
Awards may be made in the form of nil cost options, a conditional share award or a joint share ownership award and fixed value zero 
cost option, and eligible employees may be granted any combination of such awards subject to any individual limits.
Vesting of PSP awards made in 2014 and 201 3 is based on T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) and Absolute T otal Return (TR) with 
performance measured one third over three years, one third over four years and one third over five years. Half of the awards vest by 
reference to TR (25 per cent vesting for 6 per cent per annum return; full vesting for 10 per cent per annum; straight line vesting in 
between). The remaining half of the awards vest by reference to TSR relative to the top five UK-listed REIT s (25 per cent return vesting 
for TSR in line with the third rated company; full vesting for TSR in line with the top rated company; straight line vesting in between) 
subject to a Remuneration Committee operated discretionary assessment of underlying financial performance. 
Movements in the number of PSP options outstanding are as follows:

Forfeited in the year (129,825) –
Outstanding at 31 December 3,548,076 1,913,145
The fair value of TSR options granted during the year was determined using the Monte-Carlo option pricing model. The fair value 
of the TR options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values per option 
granted in the year were as follows:
2014 2013
Performance period TSR TR TSR TR
3 years £0.74 £0.73 £0.72 £0.89
4 years £0.79 £0.73 £0.98 £0.89
5 years £0.84 £0.73 £1.42 £0.89
The significant inputs to the valuation model for the TSR options granted during the year were as follows:
2014 2013
Performance period TSR 3 years TSR 4 years TSR 5 years TSR 3 years TSR 4 years TSR 5 years
Share price at grant date £2.92 £2.92 £2.92 £3.57 £3.57 £3.57

Average correlation 68% 71% 72% 72% 74% 78%
The fair value of the TR options, before taking account of the performance condition, is equal to the share price at the date of grant 
of £2.92 (201 3 – £3.57) as these awards accumulate dividends over the performance period. At the date of grant a 25 per cent vesting 
has been assumed resulting in a fair value per share of £0.73 (201 3 – £0.89) as above.
Joint Share Ownership Plan
Eligible employees may be invited to participate in the Joint Share Ownership Plan (‘ JSOP’) which forms part of the Intu Properties 
plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme and the PSP . Under the JSOP shares are held jointly by the employee and the Employee Share 
Ownership Plan T rustee with any increases in the share price and dividends paid on those shares being allocated between the joint 
owners in accordance with the terms of the scheme.
Conditions for exercise (including satisfaction of the same performance condition), forfeiture and lapsing are as set out above for 
options or PSP generally. Notes to the accounts

In 201 2, individuals who received awards of unapproved options in 201 1 and 201 2 were given the option to exchange their awards for 
jointly owned shares under the JSOP . In 201 3, participants in the PSP were given the option to take their awards in the form of jointly 
owned shares under the JSOP and fixed value zero cost options. No option was given in 2014.
Bonus Share Scheme
Under the Company’s Bonus Scheme (the ‘Bonus Scheme’), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.
Such awards comprise ‘Restricted’ shares and ‘ Additional’ shares. Where awarded, Additional shares are equal to 50 per cent of the 
Restricted shares and SIP shares (see below) combined. The vesting of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement 
of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time from the 
date of the award, typically two to three years in the case of Restricted shares and four years in the case of Additional shares. The fair 
value of Restricted shares granted with the condition for participants to remain employed by the Group for two years during the year , 
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was £2.66 per share (201 3 – £3.06 per share). The fair value of Restricted 
shares with the condition for participants to remain employed by the Group for three years, determined using the Black-Scholes 
options pricing model, was £2.54. The significant inputs to the model were as follows:

Share incentive plan (‘SIP’)
The Company operates a SIP for all eligible employees, who may receive up to £3,000 (£3,600 from the tax year 2014/1 5) worth of 
shares as part of their annual bonus arrangements. The SIP arrangements offer worthwhile tax advantages to employees and to 
the Company. 
The SIP Bonus shares can be released three years after the date of the award, provided the individual employee has remained in 
employment, but the shares must then be held in trust for a further two years in order to qualify for tax advantages. The fair value of 
shares granted during the year , determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was £2.92 per share (201 3 – £3.35 per share). 
As these awards accumulate dividends, the fair value of each share awarded is equal to the share price at the date of grant of £2.92.
As part of the SIP arrangements, the Company also offers eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a ‘Partnership’ share 
scheme, under which employees can save up to £1 25 a month (£1 50 a month from the tax year 2014/1 5). The Group offers one free 
Matching share for every two Partnership shares purchased by the employee at the end of a 1 2 month saving period. Matching shares 
are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group within three years of the date of award, and qualify for tax advantages if they are held in 
the SIP for five years. The fair value of Matching shares is determined by the market price at the grant date.
The dividend payable in respect of the shares held in the SIP is used to purchase additional shares, known as Dividend Shares, which 
are also held in trust and allocated to individuals and are subject to the same conditions of release. Accounts

50 Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution group pension plans for its head office and centre management staff. Additionally the Group 
makes contributions to self-invested personal pension arrangements (‘SIPPs’) on behalf of an Executive Director . All contributions are 
invested in funds administered outside of the Group.
In 201 3, the Group also operated for T rafford Centre employees a trustee-based money purchase scheme (The T rafford Centre 
Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme) and a stakeholder scheme. From 1 October 201 3, the Group’s subsidiary, Intu Retail Services 
Limited has operated a defined contribution group pension plan for its staff, including previous members of The T rafford Centre 
Limited Retirement Benefit Scheme. Since 1 October 201 3, the Group has made no further contribution to The T rafford Centre 
Limited Retirement Benefits Scheme, which no longer has any active members.
The pension charge for the Group’s contributions to these arrangements is the amount paid which totalled £2.7 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 (201 3 – £1.9 million).
51 Events after the reporting period
On 19 January 201 5 the Group completed the acquisition of Puerto Venecia Investments SOCIMI SA which owns the Puerto Venecia 
shopping centre in Zaragoza, Spain. Initial consideration was €21 5.5 million which will be adjusted to reflect the finalisation of the 
completion balance sheet. Additionally, loans of €59. 1 million were acquired from the vendor . The value of investment properties 
on acquisition was €450.8 million and loan liabilities of €180.9 million were acquired and refinanced on completion. An exercise is 
being undertaken to assess the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired but has not been completed at the date of signing these 
financial statements.

3 EPRA earnings
EPRA earnings per share has been presented as recommended by EPRA which seeks to assist comparison between European 
property companies. However , we believe that our measure of underlying earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA 
measure in the context of our business as set out in note 1 7 . The key difference relates to the adjustments in respect of exceptional 
items where EPRA is prescriptive about the adjustments that can be made limiting these to acquisition related costs and costs incurred 
on termination of derivative financial instruments. A reconciliation of EPRA earnings per share to the Group’s measure of underlying 
earnings per share is provided below. 
On 22 April 2014, the Company issued 278,24 1,628 new ordinary shares of 50 pence each through a rights issue. The number of shares 
previously used to calculate earnings per share have been adjusted to reflect the rights issue as per note 1 7 .

4 EPRA NAV
(a) EPRA NAV
EPRA NAV has been presented as recommended by EPRA which seeks to assist comparison between European property companies. 
However , we believe that our measure of NAV per share (diluted, adjusted), as presented in note 18a, is more appropriate than the 
EPRA measure in the context of our business. The key difference is the swaps not currently used for economic hedges of debt which 
are excluded in the Group’s definition of NAV per share (diluted, adjusted). The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest 
recoverable balance not recognised is due to historic accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value 
of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group. A reconciliation of EPRA NAV to the Group’s measure of NAV per share 
(diluted, adjusted) is provided below.
As for earnings per share, the comparative number of shares have been adjusted to reflect the rights issue. See note 1 7 for details.
