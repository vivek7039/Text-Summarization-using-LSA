Corero Network Security plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 What is a DDoS attack? 
A Distributed Denial of Service 
attack is a cyber-threat, in which 
multiple computer systems 
attack a target, such as a server, 
website or other network asset, 
and cause a denial of service for 
users of the targeted resource. 
The flood of incoming messages, 
connection requests or 
malformed packets to the target 
system, forces it to slow down or 
shut down, thereby denying 
service to legitimate users or 
systems. DDoS attacks are a 
threat to service availability, 
network security, brand 
reputation and ultimately lead to 
lost revenues. 
Attackers are continuing to 
leverage DDoS attacks as part of 
their cyber-threat arsenal to 
either disrupt business 
operations or provide a 
smokescreen while they access 
sensitive corporate information, 
and they are doing it in 
increasingly creative ways that 
circumvent traditional security 
solutions or reduce the previous 
effectiveness of DDoS scrubbing 
centres.

The impact of DDoS attacks
Why is there a need for businesses to address DDoS threats?
• Availability and security of Internet services and applications is essential  
for digital / online businesses 
• Downtime or compromise equates to:
• Lost revenues and additional operational costs
• Unhappy customers with increased costs for retention of existing  
customers and acquisition of new customers
• Brand and reputation damage 
• Legal liability and fines

Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory Strategic Report  Results
Corero revenue for the year ended 31 
December 2017 was $8.5 million (2016: 
$8.8 million) with SmartWall revenue up 
43% over the prior year whilst legacy 
product revenues declined as expected. 
Smartwall recurring revenue increased 
to $3.4 million (2016: $1.5 million). The 
EBITDA loss reduced to $5.1 million  
(2016: EBITDA loss $6.4 million). 
Revenue and the EBITDA loss for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 was impacted 
by delays in world-wide implementation 
schedules for a large digital enterprise 
customer win in Q3 2017 and an existing 
customer’s ongoing deployment (with 
the majority of the revenue from these 
two customers now expected in the first 
half of 2018).
Market dynamics
Cyber-security risks are growing, both in 
their prevalence and in their disruptive 
potential. Another growing trend is the 
use of cyber-attacks to target critical 
infrastructure and strategic industrial 
sectors, raising fears that attackers 
could trigger a breakdown in systems 
that are essential to modern society. The 
World Economic Forum Global Risks 
Landscape for 2018 ranks cyber-attacks 
as the third most likely risk in its top 10 
risk analysis, behind extreme weather 
events and natural disasters.
The head of the National Cyber Security 
Centre (“NCSC”), Ciaran Martin, recently 
commented that while the UK is fortunate 
to have avoided a so-called category one 
cyber-attack so far, it is only a matter of 
time before a catastrophic cyber-attack is 
launched on its critical infrastructure or 
election setup.
A recent report from Neustar revealed 
that many businesses viewed unsecured 
Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices as a 
major concern. This is hardly surprising, 
given the recent developments in IoT 
botnets and the huge potential for 
unsecured IoT devices to be turned into  
a botnet army and used by hackers to 
launch DDoS attacks.
IoT devices still suffer from basic 
security vulnerabilities and it is 
precisely this lack of security that 
makes them so attractive to hackers. 
But it’s not just a password problem 
anymore. Attackers understand that 
manufacturers and users are waking 
up to the problem of passwords on IoT 
devices, and so are seeking more 
complex ways to access them. As this 
trend continues, and hackers become 
increasingly inventive when searching 
for new devices and ways to enlist 
them, there is really no limit to the size 
and scale of future DDoS attacks 
driven by IoT botnets. Any device that 
has an Internet connection and a 
processor can be exploited. In an ideal 
world, all devices should be forced to 
go through some sort of network 
configuration before being used, 
rather than being exploitable from a 
default position.
Businesses and government 
departments can protect their networks 
from DDoS attacks fuelled by IoT-driven 
botnets by deploying a real-time, 
automated solution at the network edge, 
which can instantaneously detect and 
mitigate DDoS activity, thereby 
eliminating threats from entering a 
network. As with all DDoS threats, clear 
visibility is a crucial step in detecting and 
defending against attacks. The Corero 
SmartWall solution is this real-time 
automated solution providing rich 
actionable analytics.
As organisations develop their 
businesses to harness the benefits and 
power of technology, we are seeing 
companies reassess their security 
architecture, including DDoS protection, 
as traditional approaches will not be 
sufficient to protect enterprises.
Government regulations
Corero welcomes the investment and 
attention that governments are 
committing to the cyber-security of 
Critical National Infrastructure (“CNI”), 
particularly recent guidance from the US 
Government which sets out detailed 
recommendations on how to boost 
resilience and ensure suitable 
protections and mitigation systems are 
deployed. Corero recently submitted a 
response to the Joint Committee on the 
National Security Strategy’s inquiry 
‘Cyber Security: UK National Security in a 
Digital World’ and recommended the 
following actions are taken:
Chief Executive’s strategic update
Corero is well positioned to deliver on its goal  
of being the leading player in the real-time 
DDoS mitigation market with SmartWall 
solution validation from over 90 customers. 
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 06 Operating performance against strategy
Our performance against our 2017 strategic objectives is summarised below:
• Establish SmartWall as the leading solution for real-time DDoS mitigation:  
Continued progress in growing our customer base to 90 customers and the 
addition of a number of high profile customers including Corero’s first US 
federal government customer, two one million dollar customers, first 
Australian customer and first potentially significant revenue share contract 
with a Tier 1 service provider. 
• Improve Smartwall DDoS defence technology:  
SmartWall software releases in 2017 have added new attack defence and 
improved forensics and analytics capabilities.
• New products to address the evolving requirements of the target market:  
Corero further enhanced its market leading SmartWall product portfolio in 
2017 with the deliverables from a two-year development program with a new 
SmartWall 100Gbps capable product to capture growth in customer demand 
for 100Gbps connectivity and SmartWall virtual software appliance to capture 
demand for hybrid on-premises / Cloud DDoS mitigation deployments. Corero 
announced the first sales of the 100Gbps product (totalling $0.4 million) in 
early January 2018.
• Target market focus:  
Customer wins in 2017 have continued to validate the target market for 
real-time, automatic DDoS mitigation solutions; namely service providers, 
cloud providers and digital enterprises.
• Expand routes to market:  
Corero’s strategy is to work with leading IT and network technology vendors to 
make DDoS mitigation an integral component of any well-engineered Internet 
facing network design thereby increasing our go-to-market opportunities. In 
2017, Corero signed agreements with major global technology companies 
including Juniper Networks, Gigamon, and McAfee. The technology alliance 
partnership with Juniper Networks, a US based multinational corporation that 
develops and markets networking and security products, has provided benefits 
in 2017 with the opportunity for Corero to expand its market reach by 
leveraging Juniper Networks’ global footprint.
• Develop sales models to attract new target customers:  
The DDoS protection as-a-service model launched in late 2016 has gained 
traction in 2017 with 16 customers by the year end. In addition, the Service 
Portal, a turnkey solution for service provider customers to manage the 
delivery of DDoS mitigation services to their customers, has been an 
important competitive differentiator.
• DDoS attacks on CNI, particularly 
frequent low-volume and short 
duration attacks, must be a priority 
area for Government;
• Government must take advantage of 
opportunities, such as that provided by 
the implementation of the NIS 
Directive, to fulfil its ambition of 
becoming ‘the safest place in the  
world to live and work online’;
• The implementation of the Directive 
on Security of Network and 
Information Systems (“NIS Directive”) 
should not be treated as a tick box 
exercise but instead should be grasped 
as an opportunity for the UK to lead 
the world in the strength of its 
cyber-security regulatory framework;
• Government should look at 
international best practice and adopt a 
more attack-specific and specialist-led 
approach towards cyber-security, 
moving away from generic wide-
ranging statements;
• Government must set out and 
rigorously enforce detailed cyber-
security requirements for operators  
of critical national infrastructure; and
• Government should clarify 
Departmental cyber-security 
responsibilities and allocate further 
resource to the NCSC.
“We were driven to seek out a DDoS mitigation solution due to the increasing 
severity and frequency of DDoS attacks against our hosted client base.  
DDoS attacks can create service interruptions for customers and create 
unpredictable work efforts for the engineers tasked with resolving them.” 
Larry Patterson, Chief Technology Officer  
and Co-founder, Atomic Data

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory Fund raise
On 5 April 2018, Corero will announce a 
conditional placing and subscription to 
raise £4.0 million ($5.2 million) (“Equity 
Fund Raise”). In addition, Corero is in 
advanced discussions with a UK bank to 
provide a term loan of £3.0 million ($4.2 
million) (“Bank Loan”), contingent on the 
Equity Fund Raise. The Bank Loan is 
expected to be finalised and drawn 
down following the completion of the 
Equity Fund Raise.
Outlook
Corero enters 2018 with the 
foundations in place for continued 
acceleration of SmartWall revenue 
growth as a result of:
• strong market demand from the 
growing awareness of the threat and 
impact of DDoS attacks, and increased 
risk associated with the projected 
growth of IoT deployments;
• pending regulations in the US, UK and 
Europe, including the NIS Directive 
which comes into force for all EU 
member states on the 9th May 2018, 
are expected to positively impact 
demand for DDoS mitigation 
investment in 2018 particularly by 
Digital Enterprises (including critical 
national infrastructure providers);
• Corero go-to-market partner 
recruitment and enablement efforts 
with partners is expected to 
contribute to revenue in 2018; and
• investment in channel sales 
development to grow Corero’s routes 
to market in 2018.
This gives us confidence Corero will 
deliver revenue growth in 2018.
Ashley Stephenson 
Chief Executive Officer 
4 April 2018
“Corero enters 2018 with confidence following a year of strong growth in SmartWall revenue 
with proof points of multiple $1.0 million plus customers, a growing catalogue of industry 
awards and several disruptive contract wins against competitors. In addition, Corero also 
expanded its ecosystem of world class partners and introduced an enhanced product 
portfolio. We are excited about the prospects for the future of the business.”

Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 08 KEY INSIGHT
IoT Botnets should be a grave concern
Despite its advantages, the Internet of Things comes with a host of security 
challenges. IoT devices are usually poorly managed, patched and secured. They 
are thus prime targets for hacker infiltration and takeover, aside from the 
personal privacy and security concerns that result from these security gaps.
The big danger is that these connected devices 
can be harnessed by hackers for a variety of 
nefarious purposes; in many cases hackers 
use them to form a botnet to carry out 
DDoS attacks. 
Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory
09 A wide range of critical cyber-security 
issues face every Internet connected 
enterprise or organisation. These threats 
include denial of service, hacking, breach, 
phishing, fraud, data theft and 
exfiltration. These threat vectors present 
themselves via the essential Internet 
connections that are required to support 
the online business.
Today, the vast majority of the leading 
Internet service providers sell raw 
Internet transit capacity. This capacity, 
usually sold via 1Gbps, 10Gbps and 
increasingly 100Gbps transport 
connections, carries good customer 
traffic and malicious bad traffic without 
discrimination. If an enterprise data 
centre or hosting facility connects to 
these raw transit providers they will be 
exposed to Internet borne cyber-threats 
and the enterprise’s information security 
posture should be prepared to detect 
and protect against the associated 
malicious intent.
Corero has focused on one specific 
category of these cyber-threats 
encompassing denial of service and has 
developed a real time DDoS detection 
and mitigation solution that can provide 
automatic detection and protection 
against DDoS attacks. In contrast to 
legacy approaches to DDoS mitigation 
which often require tens of minutes to 
detect and react, the Corero solution can 
block DDoS attack traffic in seconds 
eliminating critical service latency  
and downtime. 
The broad range of motivations for 
executing a DDoS attack, coupled with 
the relative ease with which they can be 
performed, means that they are carried 
out by a variety of actors, including 
criminal gangs, activists, terrorist groups 
and nation state “bad actors”. Aside from 
those who are focused purely on 
disrupting services, many of those who 
carry out DDoS attacks do so as a form 
of extortion or as a smokescreen to steal 
data, map other vulnerabilities, or plant 
malware or ransomware.
Both businesses and public-sector 
organisations are vulnerable to DDoS 
attacks and recent years have seen some 
of the world’s best-known companies fall 
victim, with notable UK examples 
including TalkTalk, the BBC and HSBC. 
Similarly, the vulnerability of Government 
services was highlighted in October 2016 
when Dyn, a company that provides DNS 
services to some of the world’s largest 
digital brands, was subject to a DDoS 
attack resulting in downtime for a range 
of Government services.
Market overview
DDoS attacks are accelerating in purpose, 
sophistication, complexity, scale and frequency.
“Attacks are increasing, both in prevalence and disruptive potential. In addition, 
cybercriminals have an exponentially increasing number of potential targets 
because the use of cloud services continues to accelerate and the Internet of Things 
is expected to expand from an estimated 8.4 billion devices in 2017 to a projected 
20.4 billion in 2020.”

While the frequency of attacks is 
concerning, the size of and duration of 
attacks are also important to highlight. 
Approximately 96% of mitigated DDoS 
attacks were less than 5Gbps in volume, 
in both Q2 and Q3 2017.

Routes to Market
Corero has, in 2017, focused on 
developing and expanding its routes  
to market which include:
• Corero sales team: selling directly and 
indirectly with value added distributor 
and reseller partners in its chosen 
markets of North America, Europe, and 
Australia;
• Go-to-market (“GTM”) partners: 
“meet-in-the-market” relationships 
with leading IT and network technology 
vendors to leverage these partner’s 
customer and geographic 
market reach; and
• System integrator partners: 
relationships with leading  
systems integrators to leverage  
their customer and geographic  
market reach.
Corero sells the SmartWall technology to 
customers in the form of either (a) an 
appliance sale and perpetual software 
license plus annual SecureWatch services, 
(b) as a software subscription for its 
virtual appliance software, or (c) 
as-a-service which enables the customer 
to utilise the technology on a subscription 
or revenue share basis (without owning 
the appliance and software).
SecureWatch services include:
• Updates delivered to the Corero 
appliances and software instances in 
customer networks to provide 
proactive on-going protection from the 
latest DDoS threats; and 
• 24x7x365 monitoring and support 
services including DDoS attack 
mitigation services delivered by the 
Corero Security Operations Centre.

Market
At Corero, our most deeply ingrained 
shared value is “Customer Delight”.  
Far from being a marketing gimmick, 
delivering on customer delight simply 
makes good business sense. This 
becomes ever more true with our 
increasing levels of recurring business 
being driven by our support and service 
renewals in our growing base of 
SmartWall customers and DDoS 
Protection as-a-Service business model. 
Our experience is that delighted 
customers renew their subscriptions, 
they buy more products as their 
businesses grow, and they are happy to 
share their positive experiences with 
their industry colleagues.
We measure Customer Delight using our 
Delight-o-Meter. The science behind this 
tool is consistent with that promoted by 
Bain Consulting’s Net Promoter Score® 
(“NPS”). At Corero, we do not explicitly 
track NPS as each customer relationship 
is important to us. As such, we 
frequently take a Delight-o-Meter 
reading (scaled from 0 to 10). Our 
readings are consistently high. This 
delight is reflected in our world-class 
renewal rates.
Delighted customers are also an 
important contributor to finding 
new customers for Corero’s products 
and services. 
Our Customer Journey typically begins 
with “Strangers” being enticed to follow 
our published content (e.g. research, 
press releases, blogs) such that they 
become “Followers”. Our marketing 
automation investments allow us to 
identify these Followers and to qualify 
them as “Prospects”. In turn, the efforts 
of our direct and channel sales teams are 
focussed upon persuading these 
Prospects to become “Customers”. 
Whilst a new customer order is always a 
cause for celebration, this event is the 
starting point for what we hope will 
become a lasting relationship. Our goal is 
to deliver a delighted customer who is 
happy to be an “Advocate” for us in the 
market. Our Advocates who inform other 
Strangers close the virtuous circle of our 
Customer Journey. Many of Corero’s 
sales wins in 2017 came via 
such referrals.

Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 14 RDoS
Ransom Denial of Service (“RDoS”) made a significant comeback in Q3 2017. 
A widespread wave of RDoS threats from the Phantom Squad hacker group 
kicked off in September. These threats targeted companies throughout the 
US, Europe and Asia with targets spanning a number of industries – banking, 
hosting providers, online gaming and SaaS organisations.
KEY INSIGHT
This extortion campaign launched messages 
demanding Bitcoin payment, with a threat to 
execute attacks on September 30 unless the 
demands were met. Most solutions focus on  
recovery from such attacks rather than  
defeating or blocking them.

15 Over a third of CNI organisations in the UK 
(39%) have not completed basic cyber-security 
standards issued by the UK government, 
according to data revealed to Corero in August 
2017 under the Freedom of Information Act by 
163 CNI organisations in the UK, including fire 
and rescue services, police forces, ambulance 
trusts, NHS trusts, energy suppliers and transport 
organisations (out of a total of 338 requests). It 
suggests that some of these organisations could 
be liable for fines of up to £17m, or 4% of global 
turnover, under the UK government’s proposals 
to implement the EU’s Network and Information 
Systems (“NIS”) directive.
This research suggests that CNI organisations are 
not as cyber-resilient as they should be, and must 
take proactive steps in deploying dedicated, real-
time mitigation and visibility solutions to stay 
ahead of the threat.
DDoS attacks against national infrastructure 
have the potential to inflict significant, real-life 
disruption and prevent access to critical services 
that are vital to the functioning of our economy 
and society.
Boards and IT professionals of CNI organisations 
will be worrying about the implications of the 
NIS Directive, which will come into effect in 
May 2018. It could mean monetary fines for CNI 
organisations that experience service outages 
due to a cyber-attack.
Regulations and compliance
KEY INSIGHT
Over a third of CNI organisations in the UK (39%) 
have not completed basic cyber-security standards.
• Freedom of Information data reveals lack of 
cyber-resilience among Critical National  
Infrastructure (“CNI”) organisations
• CNI organisations could be ignoring 90% of 
the DDoS attacks on their networks by not 
mitigating short duration DDoS attacks, which 
are frequently used by hackers to distract from 
data theft attempts
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 16 Corero is dependent on revenue growth to deliver on its strategy. Lower sales growth will reduce the Company’s cash resources 
which could impact the investment in product development.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Corero’s business success  
depends on growing 
SmartWall product and 
Secure Watch Service sales to 
new customers in its target 
market of service providers, 
cloud providers and digital 
enterprises. If Corero is not 
successful in identifying 
customer prospects with a 
business need Corero can 
solve, or developing 
go-to-market partner and 
channel partner relationships 
which generate revenue, this 
will compromise growth 
plans and success. 
To be successful Corero will:
• Focus its lead generation 
and sales resources, and 
product development, on 
its target markets
• Develop relationships with 
go-to-market partners, 
channel partners and 
system integrators to 
expand its routes to market.
 
Corero is an emerging player 
in the DDoS prevention 
market and competes with 
much larger organisations.  
If Corero is not successful in 
connecting with the market 
and raising its profile this will 
compromise growth plans. 
To raise market awareness  
of Corero and its DDoS 
mitigation solutions, the 
Group will invest in targeted 
public relations and 
marketing. 
The DDoS mitigation market 
is competitive and 
characterised by constant 
changes in technology, 
customer requirements  
and frequent new product 
introductions and 
improvements. Cyber-
security and DDoS attacks 
are constantly evolving and 
changing as attackers 
develop new methods and 
tools to evade defences. To 
be a market leader and to 
grow, Corero needs to be 
focused on its chosen market 
and deliver continuous 
innovation by adding new 
DDoS attack defences. 
Retaining and recruiting 
people with the necessary 
skills and experience. To grow 
and address the challenges 
resulting from technology 
change and innovation in the 
DDoS mitigation market, the 
Company needs to retain and 
recruit the required sales, 
business development, and 
technical product 
development skills. Corero 
operates in a high growth 
market with new players 
emerging. If Corero is unable 
to recruit and retain the right 
skills this will compromise 
growth plans.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory SmartWall revenue of $7.9 million grew 
43% over the prior year, with the 
contribution from legacy product 
revenue only $0.6 million (2016: 
SmartWall revenue of $5.5 million and 
legacy product revenue of $3.3 million). 
Revenue for the year ending  
31 December 2017 was however 
impacted by delays in world-wide 
implementation schedules for a large 
digital enterprise customer win in Q3 
2017 and an existing customer’s ongoing 
deployment (with the majority of the 
revenue from these two customers now 
expected in the first half of 2018).
SmartWall order intake for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 was $9.3 
million, with 50% representing recurring 
revenue in the form of support, services, 
and as-a-service contracts (2016: 
SmartWall order intake was $6.7 million 
including recurring revenue order intake 
of $2.6 million). 
The loss for the year after taxation 
amounted to $8.6 million (2016:  
$17.2 million including an impairment  
to goodwill acquired of $9.0 million)  
and includes: 
• Unrealised exchange loss of $0.6 
million (2016: gain $1.2 million) arising 
on an intercompany loan;
• Finance costs of $0.004 million (2016: 
$0.006 million).
Review of performance & 
performance indicators
The Directors monitor a number of 
metrics, both financial and non-financial, 
on a monthly basis.
The most important financial metrics are 
as follows:
• Sales order intake: $9.3 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 
(2016: $7.1 million);
• Gross margin: 75% for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: 76%). The 
2016 revenue included support 
revenue of $3.3 million from the 
legacy product (the recognition of 
support revenue from multi-year 
contracts). Support revenue gross 
margins are high, with margins of 
c.100%. The equivalent revenue in 
2017 was $0.6 million; 
• Operating expenses (gross of 
research and development costs 
capitalised and before unrealised 
foreign exchange differences on an 
intercompany loan, depreciation 
and amortisation): $13.7 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 
(2016: $15.6 million gross of 
research and development costs 
capitalised and before unrealised 
foreign exchange differences on an 
intercompany loan, depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment of 
goodwill). Following the mid-year 
completion of the SmartWall 
NTD1100 and vNTD virtual software 
appliance development, Corero 
optimised its development 
resources by reducing the size of 
the development team in the US 
and increasing the Edinburgh based 
team with the additional benefit of 
grant funding for the increased 
Edinburgh investment. In addition, 
lower management bonuses were 
awarded in 2017 versus 2016, and a 
provision relating to an indemnity 
provided in relation to the sale of 
Corero Business Systems in 2013 
was released in 2017; 
•  Research and development $2.2 
million (2016: $2.5 million) was spent 
on the continuing development of 
the SmartWall product portfolio. 
These costs relate to (i) the 
SmartWall NTD120 – 1/10/20 Gbps 
product, SmartWall NTD1100 – 
100Gbps product and the virtual 
software appliance, and (ii) the 
Smartwall Service Portal which is 
sold as an add-on for Service 
provider and Cloud provider 
customers; and
• Cash and cash equivalents: 
$1.4 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: $2.9 million).
The order intake in 2017 comprised $9.3 
million of SmartWall orders, an increase of 
38% over the prior year (2016: $6.7 million). 
The average perpetual license order 
value in 2017 was $250,000 (2016: 
$200,000), and the average as-a-service 
contract value was $40,000 per annum 
(2016: $40,000 per annum).
The 2017 operating loss of $8.7 million 
(2016: $17.3 million) includes 
amortisation of capitalised 
development expenditure of $2.4 
million (2016: $2.3 million). The 2016 
operating loss included an impairment 
to goodwill of $9.0 million.
Cash and Treasury
The closing cash balance was $1.4 million 
(2016: $2.9 million). Corero had no debt 
at 31 December 2017 (2016: $0).
The net reduction in cash from 
operating activities in the year ended 
31 December 2017 was $6.0 million 
(2016: $5.5 million). In the year ending 
31 December 2017, the Company raised 
$7.0 million (before expenses), of which 
the Chairman contributed $4.4 million, 
to fund the further development of the 
SmartWall product and sales and 
marketing activities.
On 5 April 2018, Corero will announce a 
conditional placing and subscription to 
raise £4.0 million ($5.2 million). In 
addition, Corero is in advanced 
discussions with a UK bank to provide a 
term loan of £3.0 million ($4.2 million), 
contingent on the Equity Fund Raise. The 
Bank Loan is expected to be finalised and 
drawn down following the completion of 
the Equity Fund Raise. 
The Strategic Report on pages 6 to 19 is 
signed by order of the Board.

Overview
The cyber-security and DDoS market 
growth fundamentals remain very strong, 
fuelled by rampant cyber-crime and a 
growing awareness of the significant threat 
posed by cyber-attacks, including DDoS, as 
well as pending regulations.  
Corero has a market leading SmartWall 
product portfolio which has been further 
enhanced in 2017 with new SmartWall 
100Gbps and virtual appliance software 
products.
Our employees and values
Successful companies have a strong culture 
and deeply rooted shared values.  
In common with most intellectual property 
businesses, at Corero, we know that the 
skills, experiences and passion of our 
employees are genuinely what make our 
products and services work. The Corero 
culture has been shaped by our decade-
long experience in the United States and 
our more recent expansion in Europe. 
Corero’s team in Scotland is especially 
diverse; we have team members from seven 
European nations based in Edinburgh.
With a growing business, the level of team 
diversity and multi-site operations, we have 
recognised the importance of our culture 
and values.  During the year, we invested in 
bringing the whole company to Scotland for 
a meeting that we called “The Gathering”.  
At The Gathering, the team agreed Corero’s 
values and refined the definition of these 
values. Corero’s agreed values are:
• Integrity
• Customer delight
• Innovation
• Open and honest communications
• Empowerment
More recently, Corero invested in an online 
tool, known as Kudos, which is being used to 
acknowledge, reinforce and measure the 
values-supporting behaviours and actions 
taken by team members.
Board changes
The notice of AGM will include a resolution 
to reappoint Jens Montanana and Andrew 
Miller who retire by rotation in accordance 
with the Company’s Articles of Association.
Looking ahead
With its market leading SmartWall product 
and the significant investment made in the 
SmartWall technology, and the strategy of 
expanding Corero’s routes to market 
through channels and go to market partners, 
the business is well placed to deliver on its 
strategic goals and become a leading player 
in the DDoS mitigation market.
I would like to give special thanks to our 
institutional and private investors for their 
continued support of the Company’s 
strategy and funding requirements.
Finally, thank you to all our employees for 
their hard work and commitment.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory
Corero has taken note of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the UK Code”) 
published in April 2016. The UK Code and 
associated guidance can be found on the 
Financial Reporting Council website at 
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm. 
The rules of the London Stock Exchange do 
not require companies that have securities 
traded on AIM to formally comply with the 
UK Code and the Company does not seek to 
formally comply nor give a statement of 
compliance. However, the Board is 
accountable to the Company’s shareholders 
for good governance and has sought to 
apply those principles of corporate 
governance commensurate with the 
Company’s size. The Company’s approach 
is set out below.
The Board
Corero recognises its responsibility to 
provide entrepreneurial and responsible 
leadership to the Group within a 
framework of prudent and effective 
controls (described below) allowing 
assessment and management of the key 
issues and risks impacting the business. 
The Board sets Corero’s overall strategic 
direction, reviews management 
performance and ensures that the Group 
has the necessary financial and human 
resources in place to meet its objectives. 
The Board is satisfied that the necessary 
controls and resources exist within the 
Group to enable these responsibilities to  
be met.
Operational management of the Group is 
delegated to the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board of Directors comprises the 
Non-Executive Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and one Non-Executive Director 
whose Board and Committee responsibilities 
as at 4 April 2018 are set out below:
The composition of the Board of Directors is 
reviewed regularly. Appropriate training, 
briefings, and induction are available to all 
Directors on appointment and subsequently 
as necessary, taking into account existing 
qualifications and experience.
Executive Directors’ normal retirement age 
is 60 and Non-Executive Directors’ normal 
retirement age is 65. One third of all 
Directors are subject to annual 
reappointment by shareholders as well as 
any Director appointed by the Board in the 
period since the last AGM. Jens Montanana 
and Andrew Miller will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Board of Directors meets on average 
once a quarter and additional meetings are 
held each year to review and approve the 
Group’s strategy and financial plans for the 
coming year. Each Director is provided with 
sufficient information to enable them to 
consider matters in good time for meetings 
and enable them to discharge their duties 
properly.
All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. There is 
also a procedure in place for any Director to 
take independent professional advice if 
necessary, at the Company’s expense.
The Board also ensures that the principal 
goal of the Company is to create 
shareholder value, while having regard to 
other stakeholder interests and takes 
responsibility for setting the Company’s 
values and standards. 
There is a documented schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board, the most significant 
of which are:

Remuneration Committee, details of which 
are set out below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee members comprise 
Richard Last, who is the Committee 
Chairman, and Jens Montanana, and meets 
twice a year. The Group Chief Financial 
Officer and Group Financial Controller, and 
the Company’s external auditors attend the 
meetings. The Audit Committee considers

Nominations Committee
Due to the size of the Board of Directors, 
the Directors do not consider there to be 
any need for a nominations committee. 
Issues that would normally be dealt with by 
a nominations committee are handled by 
the Board of Directors. The Board of 
Directors will review the need for a 
nominations committee on a regular basis.
Internal controls
The Directors are responsible for the 
Group’s system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness whilst the role 
of management is to implement policies on 
risk management and control. The Group’s 
system of internal control is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve the Group’s business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board continually reviews the 
effectiveness of other internal controls, 
including financial, operational, compliance 
controls and risk management. There were 
no specific reports tabled during the year 
ended 31 December 2017. 
The Group operates a risk management 
process, which is embedded in normal 
management and governance processes. 
As part of the annual and budgeting 
process, the Group documents the 
significant risks identified, the probability 
of those risks occurring, their potential 
impact and the plans for managing and 
mitigating each of those risks. 
The Group operates a series of controls to 
meet its needs. These controls include, but 
are not limited to, the annual strategic 
planning and budgeting process, a clearly 
defined organisational structure with 
authorisation limits, reviews by senior 
management of monthly financial and 
operating information including 
comparisons with budgets, monthly 
treasury and cash flow reports and 
forecasts to the Board.  25
Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory
The Audit Committee receives reports 
from management and observations from 
the external auditors concerning the 
system of internal control and any 
material control weaknesses. Significant 
risk issues, if any, are referred to the Board 
of Directors for consideration.
The Board of Directors makes an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal control system, including 
financial, operational and compliance 
controls, before making this statement.  
The Board of Directors also considers issues 
included in reports received during the 
year, how the risks have changed during  
the year and reviews any reports prepared 
on internal controls by management and 
any issues identified by external auditors. 
The Board of Directors does not believe  
it is currently appropriate to establish a 
separate, independent internal audit 
function, given the size of the Group.
Remuneration report
The Remuneration Committee’s principal 
function is to set remuneration of the 
Group’s Executive Directors and 
management to ensure they are fairly 
compensated. 
Basic salaries are set to ensure high quality 
Executive Directors and management are 
attracted and retained by the Group. They 
reflect the knowledge, skill and experience 
of each individual Director. Bonuses are 
non-pensionable and only payable if the 
Remuneration Committee assesses the 
Director’s achievements as worthy of  
the award.
The Remuneration Committee is also 
responsible for ensuring the Group’s share 
option schemes are operated properly. 
Details of Directors’ share options at  
31 December 2017 are disclosed in note 25 
of the financial statements.
Details of Directors’ remuneration for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 is set out in 
note 22 of the financial statements. Jens 
Montanana has elected to waive the fees 
payable to him for the financial year ended 
31 December 2017.
Ashley Stephenson, Executive Director, has 
a service agreement which provides for the 
payment of six months’ base salary if the 
agreement is terminated by the Company 
without cause. 
Andrew Lloyd, Executive Director, has an 
employment agreement which can be 
terminated by either party on not less than 
three months’ written notice increasing by 
one month at the end of each complete 12 
month period of continuous employment 
provided that the notice period shall not 
exceed six months in total. The agreement 
contains provisions for early termination in 
certain circumstances.
Andrew Miller, Executive Director, has an 
employment agreement which can be 
terminated by either party on not less than 
three months’ written notice increasing by 
one month at the end of each complete 12 
month period of continuous employment 
provided that the notice period shall not 
exceed six months in total. The agreement 
contains provisions for early termination in 
certain circumstances.

Directors’ Report 
Group results
The Group’s Statement of Comprehensive 
Income on page 34 shows a loss for the year 
of $8.6 million (2016: $17.2 million).
Going concern
The financial position and cash flows are 
described in the Financial Review on pages 
18 and 19. An indication of likely future 
developments affecting the Company is 
included in the Strategic Report on pages  
6 to 19.
On 5 April 2018, Corero will announce a 
conditional placing and subscription to raise 
£4.0 million ($5.2 million). In addition, 
Corero is in advanced discussions with a UK 
bank to provide a term loan of £3.0 million 
($4.2 million), contingent on the Equity Fund 
Raise. The Bank Loan is expected to be 
finalised and drawn down following the 
completion of the Equity Fund Raise. 
A circular containing a notice of General 
Meeting will be sent to shareholders on  
5 April 2018. At the General Meeting to be 
convened on 26 April 2018, Corero 
shareholders will be asked to approve the 
Equity Fund Raise.  Since the participants in 
the Equity Fund Raise include shareholders 
which at 4 April 2018 held more than 75% of 
the Company’s issued shares, it is 
anticipated that the resolutions to approve 
the Equity Fund Raise will be duly passed. 
The Board are confident that the Equity 
Fund Raise and Bank Loan will be completed 
successfully.
The Directors believe that on the basis of a 
successful Equity Fund Raise and draw down 
of the Bank Loan, that the Company and the 
Group have, or have access to, the necessary 
financial resources to continue operating 
for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are of the opinion that the 
Group and Company has adequate working 
capital to continue as a going concern for 
the foreseeable future and, in particular, for 
a period of at least 12 months from the date 
of approval of these financial statements.
On this basis, the Directors have therefore 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare 
the financial statements on a going concern 
basis.  However, in the absence of certainty 
that the Equity Fund Raise and Bank Loan 
will successfully complete as anticipated, a 
material uncertainty exists which may cast 
significant doubt over the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern.  The financial statements do not 
include the adjustments that would result if 
the Group and Company was unable to 
continue as a going concern. Further details 
are included within note 2 to the financial 
statements on page 40. 
Dividends
The Directors have not recommended a 
dividend (2016: $nil).
Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company, 
together with details of movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the 
financial period are shown in note 20 to the 
financial statements. 
As at the date of this report, 315,417,642 
ordinary shares of 1p each (“ordinary 
shares”) were in issue and fully paid with an 
aggregate nominal value of $3.2 million.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 
31 December 2017 was 6.75p and the shares 
traded in the range 5.05p to 12.875p during 
the year.
Issue of shares
At the AGM held on 20 June 2017, 
shareholders granted authority to the 
Board under the Articles and section 551  
of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) to 
exercise all powers of the Company to allot 
relevant securities up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £678,058. 
Also at the AGM held on 20 June 2017, 
shareholders granted authority to the 
Board under the Articles and section 570(1) 
of the Act to exercise all powers of the 
Company to allot equity securities wholly 
for cash up to an aggregate nominal 
amount of £203,418 without application of 
the statutory pre-emption rights contained 
in section 561 (1) of the Act. 
Substantial shareholdings
The Company has been notified of the 
following holdings that are 3% or more  
of the Group’s ordinary share capital as  
at 4 April 2018:

Financial risk management  
objectives and policies
The Group’s business activities expose it to 
a variety of financial risks. The policies for 
managing these risks are described below:
• Liquidity risk – arises from the Group’s 
management of working capital and 
finance charges. It is a risk that the Group 
will encounter difficulty in meeting its 
financial obligations as they fall due. 
Liquidity risk is managed by the finance 
function. Budgets are agreed by the Board 
annually in advance, enabling the Group’s 
cash flow requirements to be anticipated.
• Credit risk – arises from cash and cash 
equivalents and from credit exposures  
to the Group’s customers including 
outstanding receivables and committed 
transactions. Credit risk is managed with 
regular reports of exposures reviewed by 
management. The Group does not set 
individual credit limits but will seek to 
ensure that customers enter into legally 
enforceable contracts that include 
settlement terms that demonstrate  
the customers’ commitment to  
the transaction and minimise this 
risk exposure.
The amounts of trade receivables presented 
in the Statement of Financial Position are 
shown net of allowances for doubtful 
accounts estimated by management based 
on prior experience and their assessment  
of the current economic environment 
(note 14).
The Group has no significant concentration 
of credit risk, with exposure spread over a 
number of customers. 
The credit risk on liquid funds and financial 
instruments is limited because the 
counterparties are banks with acceptable 
credit ratings assigned by international 
credit rating agencies.
• Cash flow interest rate risk – the Group’s 
policy is to minimise interest rate cash 
flow risk exposure on its financing. The 
Group’s policy is to balance the risk in 
relation to cash balances held by 
spreading these across a number of 
financial institutions as opposed to 
maximising interest income
• Currency risk – there is no material 
impact on the Group’s profit or loss for 
the year from exchange rate movements, 
as foreign currency transactions are 
entered into by Group companies whose 
functional currency is aligned with the 
currencies in which it transacts. An 
exchange rate risk does arise in relation 
to equity fund raises which are in GBP, 
given the Company’s AIM listing, to the 
extent these funds are required to 
support US dollar denominated funding 
requirements. The Group has not hedged 
such GBP fund raises in the past but will 
review this policy based on the expected 
timing of US dollar and GBP operational 
funding requirements.
The principal risk which applies to the 
parent Company’s financial statements is 
the risk that the returns generated by the 
subsidiaries might not support the carrying 
value of the cost of the investments in 
subsidiaries. The carrying value is tested at 
least annually for impairment and, if 
necessary, impaired.
Capital management
The Group monitors its available capital, 
which it considers to be all components of 
equity against its expected requirements. 
The Group’s objectives when maintaining 
capital are to safeguard the entity’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, so that it 
can continue to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders, and to ensure that sufficient 
funds can be raised for investing activities. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Company may return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell 
assets. The Group does not review its 
capital requirements according to any 
specified targets or ratios.

Treasury management
The objectives of Group treasury policies 
are to ensure that adequate financial 
resources are available for development of 
the business while at the same time 
managing financial risks. Financial 
instruments are used to reduce financial 
risk exposures arising from the Group’s 
business activities and not for speculative 
purposes.
The Group’s treasury activities are managed 
by the Group Financial Controller who 
reports to the Board on the implementation 
of Group treasury policy.
Environment
The Group’s activities are primarily office 
based and as such the Directors believe that 
there is no significant environmental impact 
arising from the Group’s activities. The 
Group complies with local WEEE regulations. 
No environmental performance indicators 
are therefore included within this report. 
The Group’s environmental policy states: 
“We endeavour to recycle appropriate 
materials where possible and to efficiently 
use natural resources and energy supplies 
so as to minimise our environmental 
impact. We will comply with the relevant 
statutes and legislation. Furthermore, 
employees are encouraged to be 
environmentally aware. Company  
cars are not provided.”
Research and development
The development of computer software is 
an integral part of the Group’s business and 
the Group continues to develop its core 
software in response to user demand, and 
particularly the changing IT security threat 
landscape, and changes in software 
technology. During the year the Group 
enhanced its existing products and 
developed new products. A capital 
investment of $2.2 million (2016: $2.5 
million) was made during the year. 
Amortisation of $2.4 million (2016: $2.3 
million) and costs not capitalised of $1.5 
million (2016: £2.4 million) were charged to 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income 
during the year. 
Employees
The quality and commitment of the 
Group’s employees has played a major 
role in the Company’s progress. This has 
been demonstrated in many ways, 
including strong customer satisfaction, 
the development of new product 
offerings and the flexibility employees 
have shown in adapting to changing 
business requirements. The Group 
operates sales commission, incentive 
bonus plans and share option plans to 
provide incentives for achievements 
which add value to the business.
Post balance sheet event
On 5 April 2018 Corero will announce a 
conditional placing and subscription to raise 
£4.0 million ($5.6 million) before expenses. 
This Equity Fund Raise is subject to 
shareholder approval at a general meeting 
of the Company on 26 April 2018.
Annual General Meeting
A circular including the notice convening 
the AGM together with the details of the 
business to be considered will be sent to 
shareholders in due course.
Auditors
In so far as each Director is aware:
• there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all the steps 
that they ought to have taken to make 
themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that 
information.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Group and 
Company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (“IFRSs”). The Directors 
have chosen to prepare the Company 
financial statements in accordance with 
FRS101. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements 
unless they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and parent 
company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period. The Directors are 
also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of 
the London Stock Exchange for companies 
trading securities on the AIM. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on  
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the  
Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring 
the annual report and the financial 
statements are made available on a 
website. Financial statements are published 
on the Company’s website in accordance 
with legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements, 
which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The 
Directors’ responsibility also extends 
to the ongoing integrity of the financial 
statements contained therein. Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Corero Network Security plc
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Corero Network Security plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
financial position, the company statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity, the company statement of changes in equity and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union.  The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state  
of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law.  
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied  
to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that  
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Material uncertainty related to going concern
We draw attention to note 2 in the financial statements which states that the Group and the parent company is reliant on 
securing additional funding, which it has planned to secure by means of an Equity Fund Raise and Bank Loan. The planned Equity 
Fund Raise is subject to Corero shareholder approval at a General Meeting which will be convened after the date of these 
financial statements and may or may not be forthcoming. In addition, the Company has received a credit approved Bank Loan 
offer, which is subject to final agreement of loan documentation and is contingent on the Equity Fund Raise. If finalised it will 
only be drawn down after the date of these financial statements.
These events or conditions indicate that material uncertainties exist that may cast significant doubt on the Group and the 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Given the conditions and uncertainties noted above we considered going concern to be a key audit matter. We have performed 
the following work as part of our audit:
• we reviewed the terms of the Bank Loan and Equity Fund Raise documents to understand the conditions attached to both 
the Bank Loan and Equity Fund Raise;
• we reviewed the Bank Loan covenant terms and whether these are likely to be met based upon cash flow forecasts;
• we considered whether the terms of the Bank Loan and Equity Fund Raise are in line with the disclosures in the financial 
statements; and
• we reviewed and challenged the Directors’ forecasts used to assess the Group’s and Company’s ability to meet its financial 
obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, taking in

Annual Report & Accounts 2017 30 Key audit matters
In addition to the matter described in the material uncertainty related to going concern section, key audit matters are those 
matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter How we addressed the Key Audit Matter in the Audit
Revenue recognition
See accounting policy at note 2.5.
The Group generates revenue primarily from the 
sale of hardware and associated software and 
related maintenance and support contracts.  It does 
this through arrangements with direct end-users, 
either through the sale of hardware and a software 
licence or by selling the software as-a-service, as 
well as to distributors.  
We considered there to be a significant audit risk 
arising from the allocation of the value of the 
transaction between the multiple elements or 
deliverables included in the sale as well as the 
timing of revenue recognition with regard to proper 
deferral of support revenues.  
Our audit procedures included assessing the appropriateness of the 
revenue recognition policy in accordance with IAS 18.  
We gained an understanding of the detail of the Group’s 
methodology in determining the fair value of the different 
deliverables in multiple element arrangements as set out in note 2.5 
and interrogated the approach, comparing the quantitative 
measures by which BESP was determined to actual pricing practices 
used by the company, to ensure it provided a suitable basis on which 
to recognise revenues.  
For each type of revenue, we selected a sample of contracts for 
testing. We assessed whether the revenue recognised was calculated 
in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy.  
We also tested the accuracy of the deferred income balance, which 
arises most commonly on deferred maintenance and support income, 
and tested a sample of transactions around the year end to ensure that 
they were recorded in the correct period.  
Finally, in relation to the Group’s SaaS revenues, a sample of 
contracts was obtained, and the revenue recognition in relation to 
these contracts was confirmed as appropriate.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment risk
See accounting policy at note 2.12 and note 8.  
In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is tested for 
impairment annually and other non-current tangible 
assets with finite lives are tested for impairment 
whenever an indicator of impairment arises. 
Management performed an impairment review over 
its sole cash generating unit (“CGU”) – Corero 
Network Security (“CNS”) – as at 31 December 2017 
using a discounted cash flow model to calculate fair 
value less costs to sell. The impairment review 
necessitates significant management judgement 
over the timing and degree of certainty attaching to 
future net cash flows and the rate at which those 
cash flows should be discounted to present value.
The recoverable amount of the Group’s CNS CGU 
was assessed as being higher than its carrying value 
at the reporting date. 
Management concluded that the goodwill and 
intangible assets were not impaired at the  
reporting date.
Our work on the impairment reviews prepared by management had a 
dual focus: firstly, to ensure the model was mechanically accurate and 
prepared in accordance with the detailed requirements of IAS36 and 
secondly, to ensure that the assumptions regarding future cash flows 
and the rate at which they had been discounted were appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances.  
We used specialists in order to assist with our interrogation of the model 
and to support our assessment of the treatment of future tax savings 
arising from available losses.  This work also included comparison to 
industry data, historic trading, and macro-economic factors. 
Our audit procedures relating to the review of operating cash flows 
included verification of the existence of selected future sales 
opportunities which are expected to drive growth in 2018, as well as a 
comparison of previous performance to expectations.  
We took into account previous shortfalls against sales targets and 
discussed key sensitivities with those charges with governance.  
Fundamental to this evaluation was a comparison of the forecasts in 
the impairment review to recent financial performance and budgets 
approved by the Board, verifying that the sensitivities prepared by 
management were sufficiently challenging.  
We also examined development cost intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment to determine that there no additional 
impairment indicators in respect of specific assets within the CGU.

Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. For 
planning, we consider materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic 
decisions of reasonable users that are taken on the basis of the financial statements. In order to reduce to an appropriately low 
level the probability that any misstatements exceed materiality, we use a lower materiality level, performance materiality, to 
determine the extent of testing needed. Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as 
immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, 
when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
Level of materiality applied and rationale
We consider EBITDA to be the most appropriate performance measure for the basis of materiality in respect of the audit of the 
Group as this measure reflects the Group’s profitability excluding the impact of non-operating charges.  EBITDA is calculated for 
this purpose as Operating Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortisation.  Using this benchmark, we set materiality at 
$291,000 (2016: $255,000) being 5% of EBITDA. 
Materiality in respect of the audit of the parent company has been set at $145,000, based on 50% of Group materiality. 
Performance materiality was set at 75% of materiality for both the Group and parent company audits. In setting the level of 
performance materiality we considered a number of factors including the expected total value of known and likely 
misstatements (based on past experience and other factors) and management’s attitude towards proposed adjustments.
Component materiality
We set materiality for the Corero Network Security, Inc. component of the Group based on 90% of Group materiality as it makes up all 
of the Group’s external revenue generating activities. UK components were audited to a lower materiality of between 10% and 50% of 
Group materiality. In the audit of each component, we further applied a performance materiality level of 75% of the component 
materiality level to our testing to ensure that the risk of errors exceeding component materiality was appropriately mitigated.
Agreement with the Audit Committee
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences individually in excess of 
$14,000 (2016: £13,000).  We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group’s system of 
internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements at the Group level. 
We obtained an understanding of the entity-level controls of the Group as a whole which assisted us in identifying and assessing 
risks of material misstatement due to fraud or error, as well as assisting us in determining the most appropriate audit strategy.
A full scope audit was performed for each component included in the consolidation.  All audit work was undertaken by the 
Group audit team.  
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements 
does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 32 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report 
to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory Notes to the Financial Statements
1. General information
Presentation currency
These consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars (“$”) which represents the presentation currency of 
the Group. 
The average $-GBP sterling (“GBP”) exchange rate, used for the conversion of the Statement of Comprehensive Income, for  
the 12 months ended 31 December 2017 was 1.29 (2016: 1.36). The closing $-GBP exchange rate, used for the conversion of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities, at 31 December 2017 was 1.35 (2016: 1.23). 
Corero Network Security plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 
and registered in England and Wales. The functional currency of the Company is GBP.
2. Significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations and those parts of  
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The parent Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
2.2 Going Concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. 
The Directors have prepared detailed income statement, balance sheet and cash flow projections for the period to 31 December 
2019. These include cash of £4.0 million ($5.6 million) to be raised by the proposed Equity Fund Raise to be announced by the 
Company on 5 April 2018 and Bank Loan of £3.0 million ($4.2 million) which is expected to be drawn down following the 
completion of the Equity Fund Raise. The cash flow projections have been subjected to sensitivity analysis at the revenue,  
cost and combined revenue and cost levels. The cash flow projections show that the Group and Company will maintain a  
positive cash balance until at least December 2019. 
A circular containing a notice of General Meeting will be sent to shareholders on 5 April 2018. At the General Meeting to be 
convened on 16 April 2018, Corero shareholders will be asked to approve the Equity Fund Raise.  Since the participants in the 
Equity Fund Raise include shareholders which at 4 April 2018 held more than 50% of the Company’s issued shares, it is 
anticipated that the resolutions to approve the Equity Fund Raise will be duly passed. 
The Board are confident that the Equity Fund Raise will be completed successfully.
On this basis, the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.  However, in the absence of certainty that the Equity Fund Raise and Bank Loan will successfully complete as 
anticipated, a material uncertainty exists which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group and Company was 
unable to continue as a going concern.
2.3 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the Company and each of its 
subsidiaries for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control is deemed to exist when the Group has all of the following elements  
a) power over the subsidiary, b) exposure or rights to variable returns from that subsidiary, c) ability to use its power to affect 
the amount of the return from the subsidiary. The results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with those used by the Group.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
2.4 Business combinations
The acquisition method is used to account for all acquisitions. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair values, on the 
date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued. 
At the date of acquisition, the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair 
values. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 40 2.5 Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the amounts receivable for 
services provided in the normal course of business, net of all related discounts and sales tax.
The Group has adopted the following policy in respect of revenue recognition:
1. Hardware and Software Products
When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as combined hardware and software products, licenses and/or 
services, the Group allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy, having evaluated each deliverable in  
an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit  
of accounting when it has standalone value.
The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third party evidence 
(“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or best estimated selling price (“BESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element 
arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit, 
accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling  
prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy.
The Group establishes the VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately. The TPE of selling 
price is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly 
situated customers. As Corero’s hardware product with embedded software is generally not sold on a standalone basis, the 
Company determined that VSOE cannot be obtained. Management has also determined that third party pricing for similar 
products sold separately is not obtainable or reliable so TPE cannot be used, therefore BESP is used (note 3). 
2. DDoS Protection as-a-Service contracts
Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement.
3. Consulting and Professional Services
Revenue from the provision of consultancy and professional services is recognised as the work is performed.
4. Maintenance and Support Services
Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement.
2.6 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the 
conditions attaching to them and the grant will be received. Grants related to purchase of assets are treated as deferred income 
and allocated to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the useful lives of the related assets while grants related to 
expenses are netted off against the related item of expenditure in the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss. 
2.7 Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes all direct costs associated with revenue generation, including goods directly related to revenue, services 
delivery, operation costs, DDoS as-a-service depreciation and amounts charged by external third parties for services. Examples 
of such costs would include, but not be limited to, royalties and third party hardware and software costs.
2.8 Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated using the exchange rates at the reporting date. Gains and losses arising from 
changes in exchange rates after the date of the transaction are recognised in profit or loss in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the original transaction.
In the consolidated financial statements, the net assets of the Group’s UK operations are translated from GBP into US dollars at 
the exchange rate at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rates 
for the period. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in the translation reserve.

2.9 Intangible assets
Internally generated intangible assets
The Group’s internally generated intangible asset relates to its development expenditure.
Development expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefit will result from the project and 
the following criteria are met:
• the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained;
• adequate, technical, financial and other resources are available to complete and sell or use the intangible asset;
• the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate future economic benefits and the ability to use or sell the 
intangible asset can be demonstrated;
• it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use it or sell it; and 
• the development costs can be measured reliably.
Expenditure not meeting these criteria is expensed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss.
After initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
impairment losses. Amortisation is charged once the asset is capable of generating economic benefits. 
Acquired intangible assets
Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised separately from goodwill, 
irrespective of whether the assets have been recognised by the acquiree before the business combination. An intangible asset  
is considered identifiable only if it is separable or if it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those 
rights are transferable or separable from the entity or from other rights and obligations.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination and recognised by the Group are computer software, customer 
contracts and the related customer relationships.
Purchased computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Customer contracts and the related customer relationships are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses.
Amortisation
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis, to reduce their carrying value to zero over their estimated useful lives. 
The following useful lives were applied during the year:
• Computer software acquired – 3 years straight line
• Capitalised development expenditure – 5 years straight line
• Amortisation costs are included within operating expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
• Methods of amortisation and useful lives are reviewed, and if necessary adjusted, at each reporting date.
2.10 Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost or value of an 
asset, net of anticipated disposal proceeds, over the useful life of that asset as follows:
• Leasehold improvements – period of the lease straight line
• Computer equipment, evaluation units and DDoS Protection as-a-service units – 3 years straight line
• Fixtures and fittings – 5 years straight line
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase cost of property, plant and equipment together with any directly attributable costs. Evaluation units are used by 
customers during proof of concept trials. Evaluation units are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. When an evaluation 
unit is retained by a customer as part of a sale the net book value of the evaluation unit is charged to cost of sales. DDoS 
as-a-service depreciation is charged to cost of sales.
Subsequent costs are included in an assets carrying value or are recognised as a separate asset when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the additional expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other costs are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss as incurred.
Methods of depreciation, residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and if necessary adjusted, at each balance sheet date.
The gain or loss arising from the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item, and is included in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 42 2.11 Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual 
cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. Rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements could result in 
excess or obsolete inventory, the value of which may not be recoverable. 
To minimise this risk, the Group evaluates inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records valuation 
allowances as required.
2.12 Impairment
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that its assets have been impaired. If any such 
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment. If it is 
not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs is determined.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. 
The recoverable amount is calculated using the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or 
cash-generating unit. This present value is derived using a cost of capital rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and of the risks specific to the asset for which future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable 
amount. That reduction is recognised as an impairment loss.
An impairment loss relating to assets carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation or amortisation is recognised 
immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units or 
groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for cash-generating units if the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit. The impairment loss is allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit by first reducing 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then reducing the carrying amounts of the other 
assets of the unit pro rata.
If an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount but limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. 
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income - Profit and Loss. Impairment losses 
on goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
2.13 Leases
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset are transferred to the Company (a 
“finance lease”), the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower 
of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the 
lease. The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. 
The interest element is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss over the period of the lease and is 
calculated so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance owed to 
the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the Company (an “operating 
lease”), the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of the rental 
expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
2.14 Investments in subsidiaries
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment provisions.
2.15 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
43
Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Current tax
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date. Taxable profit differs from accounting profit either because items are taxable or deductible in periods different 
to those in which they are recognised in the financial statements, or because they are never taxable or deductible. 
Deferred tax
Deferred tax on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Using the balance sheet liability method, deferred tax liabilities are recognised in full for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. However, if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the 
initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, it is not recognised as deferred tax asset or liability.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability settled, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
2.16 Provisions
A provision is recognised when, as a result of a past event, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the 
amount of such an obligation can be made.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. When 
the effect is material, the expected future cash flows required to settle the obligation are discounted at the pre-tax rate that 
reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
2.17 Post-retirement benefits
The Group makes contributions in respect of certain employees to defined contribution pension plans under which it is required 
to pay fixed contributions to group and personal pension funds. 
Contributions to the schemes are based on a proportion of the employees’ earnings and are charged to the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income – Profit and Loss when incurred. The Group has no obligation beyond these contributions.
2.18 Financial instruments
The Group classifies financial instruments, or their component parts, on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability 
or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The particular recognition and measurement methods adopted for the Group’s financial instruments are disclosed below:
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value at time of initial recognition, reflecting, where material, the time value of 
money. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to 
collect all amounts due according to the original terms of these receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits on call with banks.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value at time of initial recognition. Thereafter they 
are accounted for at amortised cost.
2.19 Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 44 2.20 Employee share option schemes
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employees’ services received in 
exchange for the grant of share options is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is determined by reference to the 
Black-Scholes option pricing model.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
When share options are exercised, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital (nominal 
value) and share premium.
2.21 Receivables-backed working capital facility
The Group has use of a receivables-backed working capital facility. Trade receivables are recognised as the Group retains the 
significant risks and benefits. The related funding is shown as a financial liability and accounted for on an amortised cost basis.
2.22 Standards and Interpretations not yet effective
The following standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective have not been applied by the Group 
in these financial statements:
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments. Effective date, periods beginning after 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Effective date, periods beginning after 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 – Leases. Effective date, periods beginning after 1 January 2019
The effect on the financial statements of the application of the standards and interpretations that are expected to have a 
significant impact or are relevant to the Group, is:
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The standard requires an analysis of 5 key steps:
1. Identify the contract with the customer;
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
3. Determine the transaction price;
4. Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and
5. Recognise revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.
The Management have applied the 5 steps to each of the sources of revenue and concluded that no change will be required to 
the current revenue recognition. The standard also requires consideration of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract 
including sales commission. Sales commission relating to the deferred element of a sale will be capitalised and amortised over 5 
years which has been assessed as the period of a customer relationship. The value of deferred commission at 31 December 2017 
not deferred was $0.16 million. The Group will adopt the Retrospective Method of adoption for IFRS 15 in the 2018 Financial 
Statements and restate the operating expenses for the effect of deferred commissions. No changes will be made to the 
reported revenues. 
Management are in the process of evaluating IFRS 9 and 16 and will report on the impact once known.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group accounting policies, the following judgements have had a significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements:
Internally generated research and development costs
Management monitors progress of internal research and development projects. Judgement is required in distinguishing the 
research phase from the development phase. Development costs are recognised as an asset when all criteria are met and a 
project has passed the feasibility phase, whereas research costs are expensed as incurred. Management monitors whether the 
recognition requirements for development costs continue to be met. This is necessary as the economic success of any product 
development is uncertain.
3.2 Key accounting estimates and assumptions
Key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
45
Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory 3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment
The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
All other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. 
Impairment is determined with reference to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Fair value less costs to sell 
is estimated using discounted future cash flows. Significant assumptions are made in estimating future cash flows about future 
events including future market conditions, future growth rates and appropriate discount rates. Changes in these assumptions 
could affect the outcome of impairment reviews. Details of the main assumptions used in the assessment of the carrying value 
of the Group’s cash generating unit is set out in note 8.
Impairment of investments and intercompany balances (applies to the Company Financial Statements only)
The Directors have reviewed the carrying value of the intercompany balances and cost of investments in subsidiaries of the 
Company with reference to current and future trading conditions. The investment and intercompany balances between the 
Company and Corero Network Security, Inc. and Corero Network Security (UK) Limited have been reviewed with reference to  
a valuation based on a discounted free cash flow which the Directors consider to be an appropriate valuation methodology,  
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment review. 
Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the future profit and cash flow projections in conjunction with the current economic climate  
in order to express an opinion on the adequacy of working capital and the ability to continue as a going concern for the 
foreseeable future. The methodology contained in the projections is detailed in the note 2.2. 
Best Estimated Selling Price – Revenue Recognition
On a quarterly basis the Group analyses the selling prices for each deal compared to the current BESP. Analysis includes 
grouping similar deals based on qualitative factors such as customer profile, size, and region followed by quantitative 
comparison to the then current BESP. BESP fair value prices are adjusted for future quarters if management identifies a  
pattern of variances, greater than 10%, between actual selling prices versus the then current BESP. 
4. Segment reporting
Business segments
The Group is managed according to one business unit, Corero Network Security, which makes up the Group’s reportable 
operating segment. This business unit forms the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information to the 
Board, which management consider to be the Chief Operating Decision maker for the purposes of IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

Factors affecting future tax charges
As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s cumulative fixed asset timing differences were $426,000 (2016: $62,000) and no deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of these items.
In addition, the tax losses at that date amounted to $82.0 million (2016: $72.8 million). This comprised UK tax losses of 
$12.5 million and US tax losses of $69.5 million. $9.0 million of the tax losses relate to pre-acquisition US tax losses which can  
be offset against taxable profits over 15 years (there is a limit on the utilisation of pre-acquisition tax losses of $0.7 million  
per annum and any unused loss may be carried forward to subsequent periods). All other US tax losses will expire in 20 years 
from the end of the accounting period in which the loss arose. UK tax losses do not expire.
The deferred tax assets of $2.1 million (2016: $2.1 million) at a rate of 17.0% relating to the UK tax losses and the deferred tax 
assets of $14.6 million (2016: $21.3 million) at a rate of 21% relating to the US tax losses and taxable temporary fixed asset 
differences have not been recognised due to uncertainties as to the extent and timing of their future recovery.

Strategic Report Financial Statements Governance Corporate Directory 7. Loss per share
Loss per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The effects of anti-dilutive ordinary shares resulting from the 
exercise of share options are excluded from the calculation of the loss per share. Therefore the diluted loss per share is equal to 
the loss per share.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and whenever there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s single cash-generating unit (“CGU”) Corero Network Security (“CNS”).
The recoverable amount for the CNS CGU was determined based on a discounted cash flow calculation to calculate fair values 
less costs to sell using cash flow projections over a 10 year period (2016: 10 year period). The discounted cash flow approach is a 
level 3 fair value calculation in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. The key assumptions for the discounted cash flow calculation are 
those regarding revenue growth and discount rates as summarised in the table below and commented on below: 
2017 2016
Forecast cash flow period Years 1–2 Years 1–2
Extrapolated cash flow period Years 3–10 Years 3–10
Cumulative annual growth rate (“CAGR”) for revenue used for the  
forecast/extrapolated periods 17.8%  19.6%
Average revenue growth rates used for the forecast/extrapolated periods:
 Year 1–2 (forecast period) 36.1% 33.1%
 Years 3–5 (extrapolated period) 24.9% 28.2%
 Years 6–10 (extrapolated period) 7.4% 9.9%
Revenue growth rate used beyond the extrapolated period 2.5% 2.5%
Discount rate 17.7% 16.5%
Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Corero Network Security plc
Annual Report & Accounts 2017 48 The pre-tax cash flows for the forecast period are derived from the most recent financial budget for the year ending 
31 December 2018 and the plan for the year ending 31 December 2019 approved by the Board, with a sensitivity to reflect prior 
years forecast inaccuracies (35% applied to the 2018 budget and 40% to the 2019 plan). The extrapolation for the period 2020 to 
2027 is based on management estimates (with the key assumptions set out below).
The future pre-tax cash flows are discounted by a WACC of 17.7%.
The key assumptions underlying the cash flow projections and which the recoverable amount is most sensitive to are (i) the 
revenue growth rates forecast and extrapolated for the period 2019 to 2023 and (ii) the discount rate. 
The cash flow forecasts assume a CAGR revenue growth of 29.3% in the period 2017 to 2022 (36.1% for the period 2017  
to 2019) and 7.4% for the period 2022 to 2027 (a CAGR of 17.8% for 10-year forecast period). These growth rates reflect 
 a sensitivity of 35% applied to the CNS 2018 budget revenues and a sensitivity of 40% applied to the 2019 plan revenues  
(and a sensitivity of 17.5% to 2018 operating costs and a sensitivity of 20% to 2019 operating costs) to reflect risk associated 
with historic forecast accuracy.
The management of the Group believe these growth rates are appropriate for the forecasts given the expected impact from 
the SmartWall sales traction in 2017, the focus on delivering sales growth through channel partners, the expected contribution 
from go-to-market partners to expand the opportunities Corero can sell into and the 100Gbps and virtual software products 
introduced in late 2017, all of which are expected to deliver a step change in revenue in the forecast period. 
These growth rates are supported by the fact that the IT security market is forecast to grow strongly for the foreseeable future. 
According to IDC (one of the leading global IT analyst firms), the global spending on security-related hardware, software and 
services was forecast to grow $83.5bn in 2017 (an increase of 10.3% over 2016) and to $119.9bn in 2021 (a CAGR of 9.6% over the 
2016-2021 forecast period). (Source: IDC Update to Worldwide Semi-annual Security Spending Guide published 19 October 2017). 
The DDoS appliance market is expected to reach $1.4bn by 2021 – a CAGR or 15.6% in the period 2016 to 2021. (Source: IHS 
Market Technology research - DDoS Prevention Appliances Worldwide, Biannual Market Tracker (November 2017)).
These security market growth rates contrast with Gartner’s Q4 2017 Worldwide IT Spending Forecast, which shows IT spend will 
grow from $3.5 trillion in 2017 to $4.0 trillion in 2021, a CAGR 3.3% over the 2017-2021 forecast period.
The above market growth rates used in the future cash flow assumptions reflect that CNS is in the early stages of the 
commercial exploitation of its intellectual property. In addition, the business’ strategy is to continue to develop its product and 
solution offerings to remain a market leader in its chosen markets thereby providing the opportunity to generate above market 
average growth rates.
The growth rate assumed in the period beyond the 10-year extrapolation period of 2.5% is considered reasonable as historically 
IT spend has exceeded GDP growth.
The discount rate is based on a cost of equity using the Capital Asset Pricing Model with the key inputs being a risk-free interest 
rate estimate of 2.48% (based on 10-year US government bonds) (2016: 2.44%), comparable company betas, an equity risk 
premium of 7.4% (2016: 7.4%), and small company risk premium of 4.5% (2016: 4.5%). The WACC has been assessed based on 
that fact that the Company had no gearing at 31 December 2017. The WACC used in the valuation reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to CNS.
As stated above, the valuation to support the value in use of the CNS CGU is highly sensitive to changes in cash flow forecasts 
and discount rate assumptions, and there is no guarantee that the expected growth will be achieved. If the discount rate is 
increased by 50%, which in the assessment of management is reasonably possible, from 17.7% to 26.6%, this would result in an 
impairment of goodwill with the result that the goodwill would be fully impaired. If the sensitivity of 35% applied to the CNS 
2018 budget and 40% to the 2019 plan revenues (and a sensitivity of 17.5% to CNS Budget 2018 operating costs and 20% to the 
2019 Plan operating costs) was increased to 50% for revenue (and a sensitivity of 25% to operating costs), which in the 
assessment of management is reasonably possible, this would result in an impairment of goodwill with the result that the 
goodwill would be fully impaired. 
Apart from the considerations in determining the value in use of the CNS CGU described above, the management of the Group 
is not currently aware of any other reasonably possible changes that would necessitate changes in its key estimates.

In August 2010, 1,257,000 options were granted to certain Directors and employees under the 2010 Executive Enterprise 
Management Incentive scheme and 2010 Unapproved Share Option Scheme. The options granted vested immediately 
upon grant.

acquired on the exercise of an option may not be sold until the expiry of the second anniversary following the date of 
option grant.
If an option holder ceases to be in employment or hold office within the Group, options granted shall immediately lapse unless 
such cessation is because of the option holder’s death; the option holder’s ill health or disability; the company that employs the 
option holder ceasing to be under the control of the Company or such company ceasing to be within the Group; the transfer of 
sale of the undertaking or part-undertaking in which the option holder is employed to a person who is neither under the control 
of the Company nor within the Group; or any other reason that the Board in its absolute discretion shall determine.
On a cessation of employment or office as set out above, options shall be exercisable to the extent they have vested according 
to the terms of the option agreement and the provisions of the relevant share option scheme and must be exercised within 30 
days following such cessation unless it is by reason of death whereby the option holder’s personal representatives must exercise 
the option within 12 months following the date of the option holder’s death.

The closing mid-market price for the Company’s shares at 31 December 2017 was 6.75p (8c) and the high and low for the year 
was 12.9p (16c) and 5.1p (6c). There are no performance conditions to be met before share options are exercisable. 
No options were exercised and 1,673,500 options were forfeited in the 12 months to 31 December 2017. On 9 June 2017, the 
Company announced the cancellation and re-granting of options over Ordinary Shares to certain Directors and employees, with an 
option re-grant price of 13.6p (“New Option Grant Price”) being the weighted average price of the Company’s historic investment 
rounds).  A total of 6,667,055 options were granted on 8 June 2017 at the New Option Grant price in return for the cancellation of 
existing option grants.  The new options have the same vesting and share sale conditions as the existing share option grants.
The Company also announced that it intended to cancel 2,356,000 options previously granted to Andrew Miller and 425,000 
options granted to Jens Montanana and grant an equal number of new options to each of them (the “New Concert Party 
Options”) at the New Option Grant Price. Andrew Miller and Jens Montanana are considered to be a “Concert party” under the 
City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. Since the terms of the New Concert Party Options are different from existing options 
currently held by Andrew Miller and Jens Montanana, the Company will require consent from the Panel on Takeovers and 
Mergers (“Panel”) to waive the obligation on them to make a general offer to shareholders under Rule 9 of the Code that could 
otherwise arise if the New Concert Party Options were exercised.  The Panel’s waiver (if given) will be subject to the approval of 
independent shareholders, being shareholders other than Andrew Miller and Jens Montanana, taken on a poll at a general 
meeting of the Company.   The Company can confirm that it intends, subject to the Panel granting a waiver, to seek approval at 
the 2018 AGM for the grant of the New Concert Party Options and to include the required resolution in the notice of AGM.
