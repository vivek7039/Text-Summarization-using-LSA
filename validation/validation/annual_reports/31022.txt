ASTHMA
Asthma is one of the most common non-communicable diseases.1
Asthma is a chronic, reversible disease that inflames and narrows airways in 
the lungs, causing wheezing, chest tightness and coughing.2 Not all asthma  
is the same and severe asthma can have a number of underlying causes.3
Symptoms
• Recurring attacks of breathlessness and wheezing that 
vary in severity and frequency from person to person
5
• Asthma attacks – a sudden worsening of symptoms,  
can be unpredictable
• During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial 
tubes swell, causing the airways to narrow and 
reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs
6
14%
of the world’s children experience asthma symptoms12
40–50%
of patients are not well controlled
14
; poor 
adherence to treatment and device user errors 
contribute to lack of control

to be worth over

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow 
limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by 
significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. COPD is not curable, but treatment 
can relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of death.

Viability statement
Dear Shareholder 
I am pleased to introduce Vectura’s Annual Report for 2017.
The past year has been a mix of challenge and opportunity. 
Revenue growth was impacted by the delay in the approval of 
VR315 (US), the Group’s US generic Advair
®
 programme partnered 
with Hikma. Whilst this has had a significant impact on the share 
price, we should not let this overshadow the operational progress 
achieved by the Group during the year.
Operational performance and revenue growth
Underlying performance from our key in-market inhalation products 
was strong. The main growth drivers, flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
®
 
Breezhaler
®
, continued to perform well in competitive markets, 
growing net sales at 11.8%¹ and 20.6%
1
 respectively on a constant 
currency basis, when compared to calendar year 2016. 
The Group has reported strong underlying financial performance, 
preserving a strong balance sheet through a combination of existing 
royalty streams and disciplined investment in R&D. The Group’s 
2017 IFRS operating loss of £96.2m was driven by a full year, 
non-cash, amortisation and impairment charge of £109.7m from 
prior acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA
2
 of £25.8m is underpinned by 
key products flutiform
®
, Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 and Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
, 
which together delivered gross margin of £41.1m, up 18.8% on an 
underlying full year comparative basis, with flutiform
®
 supply chain 
gross margin up 6.2 percentage points to 37.6%. Adjusted EBITDA 
also benefited from R&D expenditure of £60.3m being at the lower 
end of the guidance range and the delivery of merger synergy 
savings and ongoing R&D transformation initiatives.
Vectura continued to make operational progress across its proprietary 
partnered programmes. The Breelib
TM
 device was approved and 
launched in Europe by our partner Bayer in April 2017 with positive 
patient feedback. This application of Vectura’s FOX
®
 smart nebuliser 
technology, from the Activaero acquisition, has enabled an almost 
one-hour reduction in the total daily treatment time for patients 
who are receiving treatment (iloprost) up to six times a day, a very 
meaningful improvement in patient quality of life. Whilst the financial 
benefit for Vectura from this product is modest, the validation of this 
important technology represents a significant milestone for the 
Group. The approval and subsequent commercialisation have opened 
up the possibility for multiple new valuable and relatively low-risk 
development programmes combining the device with known 
molecules, which are now under feasibility review. 
Vectura’s lead wholly owned programme in severe adult asthma 
patients, VR475 (EU), completed Phase III recruitment and the trial 
is due to complete in Q4 2018. The first patient in the Phase II trial 
for paediatric asthma, VR647 (US), was dosed in December 2017 
and this trial is due to complete in Q3 2018.
We are uniquely positioned  
for future growth 9 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
STRATEGIC REPORT
Vectura is one of the few companies able to develop complex inhaled 
generics and overcome the strict regulatory barriers imposed by 
the FDA and EMA. During the year we announced a collaboration 
with Sandoz to develop VR2081, a pMDI generic for the US, and 
the licensing of technology from Pulmatrix, initially to support the 
development of VR410, a tiotropium DPI generic. As a result, the 
Group’s pipeline now includes the current three largest US generic 
opportunities. In March 2018, Hikma confirmed that the dispute 
resolution process for VR315 (US) had concluded with the FDA upholding 
its original decision with a requirement that Hikma completes an 
additional Clinical Endpoint study. Hikma anticipates being able to 
submit a response to the FDA with new clinical data as early as 
possible in 2019, with a potential approval and launch during 2020.
An Operational Excellence review of the Vectura R&D function 
was performed during the year and a number of opportunities to 
significantly enhance productivity were identified. These will free 
up capacity to support future project development and achieve cost 
reductions. These activities are a priority for implementation in 2018. 
In November 2017 the Board also approved a share buyback and 
cancellation programme to return up to £15m of capital to shareholders. 
This programme, which completed post period, is an efficient 
allocation of capital as part of our ongoing strong financial management 
discipline and demonstrates the Board’s confidence in the cash 
generation of the business. 
Merger integration and synergy realisation
The post-merger organisation structure was implemented early in 
2017 and all priority integration initiatives have been completed. 
As announced in September 2017, we are on track to deliver £11m 
to £12m synergies by the end of 2018, with the majority of the 
savings being realised in 2017.
2018 business strategy 
In the latter part of 2017 the Group completed a full review of its 
R&D investment strategy and this was communicated to the market 
on 4 January 2018. The following decisions were made: 
• investment in relatively high-risk novel molecules at early stage 
will end and opportunities to partner remaining programmes 
will be sought; 
• the Group will be more selective in identifying co-development 
programmes of novel molecules, focusing only on highly 
profitable and significant opportunities; and 
• Vectura will seek to develop further high-potential generic medicines 
for the US market, in association with well-established partners. 
This serves to increase the Group’s focus on relatively lower-risk 
high-value development programmes, ultimately optimising the return 
on our R&D developments. In addition, it was decided that, in the 
absence of additional specialist marketed products being acquired, 
through M&A or licensing, the Group will initiate partnering discussions 
for VR475 (EU) and VR647 (US), following the completion of their 
respective current Phase III and Phase II activities.
Governance 
As a Board, we are committed to the principles of good corporate 
governance and we have continued to comply with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) throughout the year 
and to the date of this report. Through a robust internal framework 
of systems and controls, we strive to maintain the highest standards. 
Full details can be found in the Corporate governance report on 
pages 70 to 78.
Board changes
In December 2017, we welcomed Juliet Thompson as a new 
Independent Non-Executive Director. Upon appointment, Juliet also 
became a member of the Audit Committee and was appointed a 
member of the Remuneration Committee. Her extensive understanding 
of the healthcare industry and experience in corporate finance bring 
important insight to Board discussions, as well as supplementing 
and strengthening the existing skills and experience of the Board. 
Juliet’s appointment also signals the Board's and Vectura’s commitment 
to increased diversity up and down the organisation. Full details 
on succession planning can be found in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 79.
People and culture 
The Group has a highly talented workforce with an invaluable diversity 
of proven capabilities, knowledge and experience. During the year, 
the Executive Leadership Team led a Company-wide project to 
identify and deliver a shared culture comprised of the values 
and behaviours which make our Company distinctive. This initiative 
is of paramount importance to the Board because it underpins 
Vectura’s ability to deliver its product pipeline and to innovate. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank each one of our employees 
for their continued commitment and excellent contributions during the 
past year.
Shareholders 
I would also like to thank our shareholders for their continued support 
following the delay with VR315 (US). The Board remains confident 
in the approvability of this product. With a newly renewed pipeline 
focus and commitment to Operational Excellence, our mission is 
clear: delivery, simplification and focus. We remain committed to 
growing an innovative and differentiated business which delivers 
shareholder value. 
Outlook
The Board sees Vectura as being a highly competitive business 
with strong underlying revenues from our in-market products. 
The business is differentiated by its unique set of capabilities, 
as medicines in the respiratory space become more complicated. 
Vectura is one of the few companies globally with the expertise to 
formulate and deliver the most complex products for inhaled delivery. 
I look forward with optimism as we work towards successful 
outcomes from developing our refocused pipeline and believe 
the Group is increasingly well positioned to achieve its ambition 
of becoming the industry-leading inhaled drug-device development 
specialist, delivering significant value for our shareholders.

Delivering sustainable growth  
with risk-balanced investment
It has been an important year of progress for Vectura. We have 
delivered a good set of financial results, in line with market expectations, 
and our key inhaled flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 products have 
continued to show strong in-market growth. We have progressed our 
enhanced therapy pipeline, extended our valuable generics portfolio 
and delivered our merger integration plans in terms of both financial 
synergies and the establishment of the “AsOne” Vectura Group culture 
and values. Despite these achievements, Vectura’s performance in 
2017 has been partly overshadowed by the delay in the approval of 
VR315 (US), our generic Advair
®
 programme. 
It was certainly disappointing to receive a complete response letter 
(CRL) in May but our confidence in the approvability of VR315 (US) 
has not changed. Only three companies have publicly stated that 
they have filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for an 
AB-rated substitutable product and all three applicants had their 
submissions rejected. Although tough, the experience we have 
gained through the review process and feedback we have received 
in relation to the formulation and device elements of the programme 
give us even greater conviction that we are one of the very few 
companies which has the capability to meet the FDA’s high standards 
to develop complex inhaled generic drug-device combinations. 
Our confidence in our drug formulation and device capability, the 
heart of what Vectura does, is reflected in our increased investment 
focus and our belief in the future valuation of our expanding 
generics portfolio. 
Our belief in the value of our rare generic capabilities was further 
validated by Sandoz’s decision in June 2017 to partner the VR2081 pMDI 
US generic development programme. This was after we had already 
received our VR315 CRL. Given that Sandoz has its own Advair
®
 
generic in development, its choice of Vectura for this new development 
was an important further validation of our capabilities.
Strategy
Vectura’s strategy and vision remain unchanged. 
Our goal is to be the industry-leading inhaled drug-device 
development specialist, enabling us to deliver on our purpose to 
transform the lives of airways disease patients. Our strategy is to 
fully leverage our differentiated technology and skills, maximising 
value through partnered generic drug-device combinations and 
enhancing the inhaled performance of existing molecules. We will 
do this by continuing to invest and grow our business alongside 
demonstrating strong financial and capital allocation discipline.
We aim to develop a strong portfolio, primarily partnered to share 
the risk and cost of development, and to progressively develop assets 
in niche specialist disease segments. Our current revenues result 
primarily from partnered sales in the largest respiratory disease 
segments of asthma and COPD. Over time, smaller niche disease 
areas will increasingly become an important revenue source and 
it is in this market segment that we would look to establish a 
successful specialist commercial product portfolio.
The plan is one of organic growth supplemented by the potential 
to acquire products with in-market revenues and specialist customer 
capabilities in the US.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Future self-commercialisation of our specialist assets remains an 
option open to us but only as part of a wider commercial portfolio.
Vectura has a well-established business with proven capabilities 
and a simple differentiated business model which can be described 
in three simple steps: firstly, inhaled drug formulation and licensing; 
secondly, inhaled device design, development and licensing; and 
thirdly, our "sweet spot", where we combine the drug formulation 
and device work together and license a combined development 
programme to partners. We hit this "sweet spot" when we maximise 
the integrated combined IP, technology and skills across our platforms 
and teams and it is at this point that we can create the highest 
value returns from our partners.
We have a well proven track record of value creation through this 
model with some of the world’s biggest pharma companies. Typically, 
our formulation licensing expertise is seen in the revenues from 
novel patented molecules for inhaled delivery including Novartis’ 
Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 and GSK’s Ellipta
®
 portfolio. Proprietary device 
licensing is a relatively small part of the business, again typically for 
novel patented molecules. Bayer’s Breelib
TM
 iloprost product and 
Ablynx’s ALX-0171 novel inhaled Nanobody
®
, both of which use 
the FOX
®
 device, are both examples of this approach. Our “sweet 
spot”, where we combine our inhaled drug formulation, device 
and development expertise for the enhanced delivery of existing 
molecules or as generic developments, is demonstrated through 
in-market products such as flutiform
®
 and AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
. 
In total, our partnered model, capabilities, reputation and track 
record are exemplified in the more than ten partnerships we 
have with leading pharmaceutical companies. 
What we do is technically complex and the way we do it is different. 
Unlike most companies operating in this sector that work on elements 
of what we do, few have a proven successful track record of combining 
and integrating the three key elements of inhaled drug formulation, 
device and combined product development. Additionally, none have 
the range of skills and platforms that Vectura has developed ranging 
from small to large molecule and biologic formulation through to 
dry powder, pressurised metered dose and novel nebulised device 
design and development. In the complex and challenging world 
of inhaled drug-device development these proven capabilities are 
rare and difficult to replicate and provide the basis for our sustained 
and valuable differentiation. 
In order to further accelerate the value leverage of our skills, we 
have taken the decision to adjust the focus of our investment with 
a deliberate shift towards projects with higher value and higher 
probability of success. Investment priority is being given to projects 
where Vectura has the highest probability of value creation with 
known medicines, either as partnered generics or as medicines 
with enhanced delivery mechanisms, using Vectura’s advanced 
proprietary devices. Vectura will be more selective in identifying 
partnering and co-development opportunities for novel molecules, 
focusing only on highly profitable and significant opportunities. 
Existing early-stage novel programmes will be out-licensed where 
the cost, risk and likely returns do not meet our newly defined 
investment criteria. 
Our strategy remains one where we are pursuing growth whilst, 
at the same time, maintaining and demonstrating strong financial 
management and capital allocation discipline. 
Operational highlights
In-market portfolio
Our key inhaled growth drivers, flutiform
®
 and Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
, 
have continued to perform strongly in market. flutiform
®
 generated 
in-market sales of €206.2m, up 11.8% on a constant currency 
basis, contributing £68.5m to underlying revenues for Vectura 
(2016 underlying: £65.8m).
Mundipharma continues to focus on driving growth for flutiform
®
 
and is making steady market share gains in a highly competitive 
and mature European ICS/LABA market, reporting value growth of 
5.0% on a constant currency basis. Outside of Europe, Mundipharma 
has continued to drive strong growth of 32.5% in 2017. As anticipated 
in our interim statements, Vectura’s 2017 reported revenues were 
impacted by destocking which was driven by partner working 
capital management.
In Japan, which now contributes over 37.1% of total flutiform
®
 
sales, Kyorin continues to make good progress with in-market sales 
up 19.8%. This performance has given flutiform
®
 a market share 
of 11.5% in the Japanese ICS/LABA market. With a strong respiratory 
commercial heritage in Japan and the relatively less mature nature 
of the Japanese ICS/LABA market, we believe that Kyorin has a solid 
basis for further strong growth in the future. 
Ultibro
® 
Breezhaler
®
 grew in market by 20.6% on a constant 
currency basis with total reported sales of Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
and Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
 exceeding $550m. Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
continues to be the leading LAMA/LABA combination ex-US and is 
maintaining a strong growth profile despite heavy competition from 
Boehringer’s Stiolto
®
 combination. Following the initial rapid launch 
of Stiolto, its market share is now stabilising with Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
maintain its market-leading position and strong trajectory growth 
supported changes to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) global COPD management strategy and a 
robust clinical data set. Reported sales for Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 were 
also affected by destocking as indicated by Novartis; however, they 
reported strong Q4 growth of 26% on a constant currency basis. 
GSK’s branded Ellipta
®
 portfolio has also grown strongly with 
annual capped revenue of £9m achieved in Q3 2017.
Generics pipeline
A number of people have asked me why we would increase our 
focus on generics at a time when generics are under huge pressure 
in the US. To date there have been no approvals of complex inhaled 
substitutable drug-device combinations in the US and our own VR315 
asset has been delayed following the receipt of a CRL. The answer is 
quite simple.  12 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Operational highlights continued
Generics pipeline continued
We should not confuse the overall generics market, including the oral 
solids market, for example, which is relatively simple and commoditised, 
with the complex inhaled drug-device combination market, which 
remains untapped in the US today. The inhaled formulation market 
in 2017 in the US was valued at over $23bn, with less than 1% generic 
conversion in key inhaled classes. This compares to the oral solids 
market in the US, where over 91% of the prescriptions dispensed 
are for generic products. Vectura, with our partner Hikma, remains 
one of only three known companies with an inhaled drug-device 
combination application for a substitutable generic Advair
®
 product 
(VR315 (US)). Our unique capabilities have been validated throughout 
the regulatory review process and the lessons we have learned on 
the VR315 (US) programme journey put us in a good position going 
for future development of complex generic programmes.
Following the announcement of the partnering of VR2081, and the 
in-licensing of an advanced tiotropium from Pulmatrix, our generics 
pipeline now includes the three largest current inhaled branded 
opportunities in the US. 
In addition, following a series of interactions with the FDA, we are 
looking forward to the partnering and development of what we 
believe is the leading industry drug-device combination for the 
Ellipta
®
 portfolio. This portfolio includes, potentially, five separate 
project opportunities with analyst projections of net sales of 
approximately $6bn in 2023.
Enhanced delivery pipeline
One of the highlights for me during the year was participating in a 
symposium about Breelib™ at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) 
meeting in Milan. Breelib™, which uses our novel FOX
®
 handheld 
nebuliser, is the new iloprost product device combination sold by our 
partner Bayer. This was the first time that Breelib™ and the FOX
®
 
device were being showcased at such an event since the product 
was launched. The compelling data presented at the meeting showed 
a decrease in the average inhalation time of approximately 48 minutes 
per patient per day and is quite remarkable for these very sick 
pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. It provides us with both 
an enormous source of pride in terms of patient impact as well as 
important validation of the technical value of these novel devices.
In addition to Breelib
TM
 we have made very good progress with our 
two leading AKITA
®
 budesonide clinical programmes. The Phase III 
EU adult asthma programme is now fully recruited and we look forward 
to the completion of this important and challenging project before the 
end of 2018. The US paediatric programme has also progressed well, 
with the first Phase II patients dosed in Q4 2017, with completion 
expected in Q3 2018. 
Based on the increased conviction in both the differentiation and 
validation of our devices seen with Breelib™, we are now initiating 
the development of a series of known compounds where, through 
formulation and enhanced delivery, we believe that efficacy and 
convenience of delivery for the patient can be significantly improved. 
We look forward to sharing details of these projects around the 
time of our interim results. 
Novel drug-device partnering pipeline
During the year we have made good progress with continued 
support for the ongoing Ablynx ALX-0171 neonatal RSV Nanobody
®
 
development utilising an adapted variant of the FOX
®
 handheld 
nebuliser device. Ablynx is expected to report Phase IIb results 
in Q4 2018.
In December 2017, Mundipharma informed the Group of its decision 
to stop the development of the pMDI triple therapy for asthma and 
COPD (VR2076), which was at an early formulation phase. 
Aligned to our refocused investment strategy, we will now take an 
increasingly selective approach to future novel partnered development 
programmes, with each programme having to achieve a higher 
hurdle rate in terms of potential financial returns.
Organisation 
Following the successful completion of the merger with Skyepharma 
in June 2016, we made huge progress in the integration across the 
business in 2017 and we are tracking above the targeted plan of 
£10m annual savings in cost synergies. We now expect financial 
synergies to total between £11m and £12m by the end of 2018.
A key component of the integration has been the alignment of a 
new “AsOne” culture. Our target culture is supported by a clear set 
of values and expected behaviours. These elements were articulated 
with the engagement of all Vectura employees and have been 
incorporated into all the key management frameworks and 
systems being used across the business.
Alongside the merger integration activities, I was pleased to welcome 
Gonzalo De Miguel and Tony Fitzpatrick to the Executive Leadership 
Team. Both Gonzalo and Tony bring a wealth of experience to 
the clinical development and manufacturing operations settings 
respectively and have quickly settled into their new roles making 
positive contributions to, and beyond, their functions.
Summary 
2017 was a challenging year for Vectura. Despite this we remained 
highly focused and we have delivered well against our key objectives. 
The team demonstrated great tenacity and resilience and I would like 
to extend my heartfelt thanks for their contributions and support. 
With strong in-market product performance and validation of our 
team’s skills, capabilities and technology during 2017, we enter 
2018 with a clear, refocused investment strategy and increased 
conviction in our ability to create and deliver shareholder value.

13 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
The airways disease market is currently estimated to be worth 
in excess of $40bn
1
 worldwide; population growth and lifestyle 
changes, coupled with increasing longevity and wealth, particularly 
in developing economies, are increasing the disease burden for 
airways diseases. As a whole, this market is expected to grow 
in value by 3.5% annually to $56bn by 2025
1
.
After many years of status quo, the dynamics within this market 
are beginning to change with new treatment classes emerging, 
offering society and patients new ways to treat and control 
airways-related diseases.
Asthma and COPD
Asthma and COPD are expected to remain the largest and most 
competitive segments with new classes of treatment emerging and 
new phenotyping leading to more personalised medicine. Given the 
size and scale of these markets, these disease areas are best served by 
Vectura partnering with pharmaceutical companies which have the 
expertise and infrastructure to sell and market these products globally. 
Vectura’s existing portfolio and existing pipeline are well 
placed to benefit from changing market dynamics in the 
asthma and COPD market
The COPD market as a whole is expected to grow from $15bn to  
in excess of $19bn
2
, with the growth being driven from continued 
uptake of dual bronchodilators such as Breezhaler
®
 (LAMA/LABA, 
partnered with Novartis) and Anoro
®
 Ellipta
®
 (LAMA/LABA, IP licence 
with GSK) and the emergence of closed triple therapies.
The asthma market as a whole is expected to grow from $17bn to nearly 
$18bn
3
, with growth being driven by the emergence of closed triple 
therapies such as QVM149 (ICS/LAMA/LABA, partnered with Novartis) 
and biologic therapies expected to grow strongly from a small base 
offsetting genericisation of the ICS/LABA class (VR942, co-developed 
with UCB, now available for license).

The world population is expected to rise from its current level  
of some 7bn to 8.5bn by 2030 according to the United Nations
13 
and, alongside this population increase, life expectancy is also 
expected to increase significantly. Globally, over the same time 
period, the number of people aged 60 years and over will 
increase from 901m to over 1.4bn
14
. Alongside these changing 
demographics, the number of people who can access healthcare 
continues to increase.
In most established markets, ageing populations and certain 
lifestyle choices such as smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise 
are increasing the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such 
as airway-related diseases, which require long-term management.
Advances in science and technology innovation are critical if  
we are to address unmet medical need. Existing drugs will 
continue to be important in meeting the growing demand for 
healthcare, particularly with the increasing use of generic 
medication. The use of large molecules, or biologics, has also 
become an important source of innovation, with biologics 
amongst the most commercially successful new products.

Asthma and COPD generics – inhaled generics  
class still in its infancy, set to expand rapidly
Generic penetration is increasing in the EU; however, there is currently 
very little generic penetration in the US. Globally, the use of generic 
medicines is growing. In the US, the inhalants market was estimated 
to be worth some $23bn
5
 in 2017, with less than 1% generic 
conversion in key inhaled maintenance classes
6
. This trend is set 
to change as a number of inhaled products reach patent expiry in 
the US, with generic entrants expected over the coming years. 
Generic erosion is expected to have the most impact in ICS, ICS/
LABA and LAMA classes
7
.
Significant growth in these classes is likely as substitutable products 
are approved; however, the large volumes and value opportunities 
are made up of a limited number of large individual opportunities, 
e.g. Seretide/Advair
®
, Symbicort
®
, Spiriva
®
 and QVAR
®
. Technology 
barriers remain, making inhaled generics a specialist area.
The ICS/LABA class is expected to remain the largest and at present 
Advair
®
 and Symbicort
®
 remain the largest brands within this class 
in the US. Vectura’s pipeline asset VR315 (US) is one of only three 
known AB-rated generic Advair

 applications that has been submitted 
to the FDA for review. 
Globally, the LAMA class is expected to be worth $2.7bn by 2025

Specialist markets
Alongside the expected growth in asthma and COPD markets, 
specialist markets are also expected to grow significantly with  
high unmet medical need and increasing scientific understanding 
driving development of new therapies. Patient populations are 
smaller, but significant commercial potential exists and this 
specialist market has less competitive intensity than the larger 
asthma and COPD markets. 
The growing specialist disease segment is well suited to 
nebuliser therapy and provides an opportunity for future Vectura 
enhanced delivery programmes to enhance patient benefit using 
our smart nebuliser technology. The nebuliser device market is 
currently worth c.$630m, and France, Germany, the UK and the

Specialist diseases with high unmet need are expected 
to show significant growth as therapies become available
Over the past few years, changing attitudes towards globalisation 
and free trade, coupled with concerns over inflation and wages 
and, for many, concerns about inequality, have caused significant 
volatility and uncertainty in western markets. In 2016, these 
uncertainties were exemplified by the UK vote to leave the 
European Union and the result of the US presidential election. 
These trends have continued during 2017 as the “Brexit” 
negotiations have commenced and further national elections 
have been held in the UK, France and Germany. 
Expanding patient populations and growing unmet medical need 
are contributing to higher demand for healthcare services and 
leading to increased cost pressure within global healthcare systems. 
The world’s major regions are expected to see healthcare spending 
increases ranging between 2.4% and 7.5% between 2015 and 
2020
15
. This background of steadily rising healthcare costs has 
also led to increased scrutiny on drug pricing by governments, 
the media and consumers, particularly in the US. 
Increasingly, government agencies and insurers are looking for 
ways to manage increasing costs and, in some cases, are restricting 
access to treatment, slowing the uptake of innovative new medicines. 
With continued focus on cost management, it is expected that 
generics will take an increasingly larger share of global medicine 
spend, increasing from 27% in 2012 to 36% by 2017

Our range of device and formulation capabilities provides us with a competitive 
advantage for developing generics for Asthma and COPD, as well as products 
aimed at the enhanced delivery of known molecules to the lungs in specialist 
disease areas. This includes inhaled reformulations of medicines normally delivered 
by the oral or injectable route, including biologics.
Our in-house capability to design and engineer our own formulations and adapt 
their aerodynamic properties by altering size, shape, surface roughness and 
surface chemistry to optimise them for their particular purpose. 
For example, we can engineer a particle to make it less “sticky”, so that it flows and 
aerosolises better and has the potential to be delivered with higher efficiency to 
effect an increased efficacy.
The versatility and ability to alter drug formulations according to dosing regimens 
is key when delivering complex biologics and is increasingly demanded by regulators 
and physicians. Our wide range of delivery devices also allows us to easily combine 
different molecules together in combination products. 
We are an attractive partner for pharma companies, working closely with them  
to select the right technology for the intended patient and disease before the 
formulation or device becomes fixed in the later stages of development. 
Comprehensive enabling 
formulation technology
Vectura’s advanced in-house analytical capability further cements the Company’s

Spotlighting our capabilities
CASE STUDY: Breelib
™
 meets iloprost —  
a modern nebuliser for an established drug 
What is Breelib™?
Breelib™ is a small handheld, battery-powered, breath activated, 
vibrating mesh technology inhalation system utilising the FOX
®
’s 
unique flow rate and volume control technology. It is a smart 
nebuliser device designed to provide patients with both an easier 
to use device and improved delivery of Ventavis
®
 (iloprost), 
a well-established inhaled treatment for patients with pulmonary 
arterial hypertension.
Drug product is available at 10 microgram/ml (1ml ampule) 
and 20 microgram/ml nebuliser solution through the technology. 
Patients can initiate on Ventavis
®
 (iloprost) with this device or 
switch from an alternative device.
History 
In October 2012, Vectura established a collaboration with Bayer 
to develop Breelib
TM
, a smart hand-held nebuliser device designed 
to provide patients with both an easier to use device and improved 
delivery of Bayer’s Ventavis
®
 (iloprost), a well-established inhaled 
treatment for patients with PAH. 
Class-leading device technology
Together with Bayer, Vectura used its in-house respiratory 
expertise to customise its proprietary FOX
®
 platform to design 
a patient-focused drug-specific nebuliser system to match the 
high-performance profile of the existing device. 
The Bluetooth
®
 enabled device incorporates a patient feedback 
mechanism, which helps to guide a patient's breathing during the 
inhalation process. To improve inhalation technique, the Breelib
TM
 
mouthpiece will glow green if the patient is breathing with the right 
speed and force and red for sub-optimal breathing. Vectura also 
supported the development of the BreeConnect app solutions, which 
helps patients to monitor the number of inhalations they have taken 
a day, reminds them when to inhale and shares the data with their 
doctor, providing an enhanced patient experience. In 2014, the 
FOX
®
 device won the Red Dot Award for product design. 
Now approved in Poland, Germany, Austria, Portugal and the UK 
with further roll-out underway. The adapted FOX
®
 handheld smart 
nebuliser, which utilises Vectura’s unique FAVORITE™ inhalation 
technology, is able to significantly reduce each treatment time from 
eleven minutes to three minutes, whilst maintaining efficacy. This 
reduction in treatment time, along with an improved cleaning 
regime, saves a typical patient over one hour per day.
Comprehensive regulatory support
Leveraging our strong clinical and regulatory capabilities 
throughout the development of Breelib
TM
, Vectura supported 
the planning of the required clinical studies with drug delivery, 
device and PAH experts providing support for the dosing strategy 
and patient-specific device parameters, and undertaking device 
validation and device vigilance. 
Faster delivery and an improved 
cleaning regime save the typical 
patient over one hour a day.
Breelib™ highlights our integrated development 
capabilities which enable us to support the development 
of complex inhaled products throughout the development 
lifecycle, from initial partner interaction, right down to 
product launch support and digital solution development. 
Breelib™ is an alternative delivery mechanism for Bayer’s 
Ventavis
®
 (iloprost) to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) patients. Vectura’s simple and easy to use proprietary 
hand-held FOX
®
 nebuliser enhances the delivery of this 
known product, significantly reducing treatment times  
for patients. 
The commercialisation of Breelib™validates the potential 
opportunity for multiple further developments, leveraging 
our device technology to enhance the delivery of existing 
approved medicines.
Scale-up, industrialisation and GMP manufacturing
Vectura handled all aspects of industrialisation and supply of the 
Breelib
TM
 inhalation device, and were responsible for the GMP 
manufacturing of the device from clinical trials through to commercial 
launch. Vectura supported Bayer by enabling a seamless transition 
and transfer of the Breelib
TM
 design to commercial manufacturing 
sites to support the scale-up and industrialisation of the device. 
Market launch
Working closely with Bayer, Vectura was part of the market launch 
team, performing device workshops and training for the Bayer 
commercial team and healthcare professionals.

Clear strategic priorities
OUR STRATEGY
We are resolutely pursuing our 
vision to be the industry-leading 
inhaled drug-device 
development specialist.
At our Capital Markets Day in June 2017, the management team 
presented a comprehensive overview of Vectura’s differentiated 
formulation and device development capabilities. The team 
identified the growing market segments where Vectura is best 
placed to succeed and also outlined the investment required 
to drive development programmes and launch and commercialise  
our pipeline assets.
As part of our annual strategy review process, during the second 
half of 2017, we reviewed our investment priorities to ensure that 
we remain focused on delivering against our vision for the Group 
alongside building shareholder value.
The outputs of this review reaffirmed our conviction in the  
strength of our core capabilities. The review determined that  
these capabilities are best deployed across relatively lower-risk, 
higher-value development opportunities, particularly in well-known 
on-market medicines. We are therefore refocusing our pipeline  
and adjusting the mix of R&D investment during 2018. In making 
these adjustments, we are reducing the level of overall R&D investment, 
optimising the risk profile of the business and creating headroom 
to introduce new development programmes leveraging our proven 
capabilities. We believe that by focusing our resources in this 
manner we will increase the probability of valuable returns from 
our investments and we look forward to the future with confidence.

Key priorities in 2018 KPIs Key challenges in 2017 28 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Maximising pipeline value
Vectura’s pipeline has historically focused on three key areas – generic partnering (device and formulation), Vectura-led development of 
programmes for enhanced delivery of known medicines (device and formulation) and novel molecule partnering (device or formulation). 
Each of these types of programme carries a different level of risk for Vectura; they have different probability of success rates and have 
different development requirements, meaning that certain programmes will cost more and/or take longer to get to market than others. 
The objective of our 2017 investment review was to ensure that our pipeline contained an optimal mix of these programmes, thus 
giving Vectura the best chance of achieving valuable returns for its stakeholders over the short, medium and long term.

Maximising pipeline value continued
OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED
Our 2018 refocused investment priorities explained:
We will take an increasingly selective approach to further novel 
partnering. Development of novel molecules is a higher risk activity 
which typically has a long and expensive development cycle and 
carries a lower probability of success. Whilst we do receive 
significant interest from a number of biotech companies who want 
to use our technology to pursue novel development programmes, 
the near-term financial returns of such projects are typically low and 
therefore we believe that such programmes do not represent the 
optimal type of investment for the Group.
Future novel partnering arrangements will need to meet strict, 
pre-defined investment hurdles. 
SELECTIVE NOVEL PARTNERING
Increasingly selective approach to novel molecule partnering
During 2018 we will seek to partner and out-license VR588, a 
wholly owned kinase inhibitor, and, along with our co-collaborator 
UCB, we will also seek to partner VR942, a dry powder inhaled 
biologic that successfully completed Phase I during 2017. 
In January 2018, we confirmed that our partner Mundipharma had 
informed us of its decision to stop the development of the pMDI 
triple therapy for Asthma and COPD (VR2076), which was in an early 
formulation phase. Given the early stage of this asset, we do not 
expect this change to have a material impact on the Group’s 
revenues in 2018. 
STOPPING EARL Y-STAGE NOVEL INVESTMENT
Stopping Vectura investment in early-stage novel molecule clinical development
As we are seeking to balance the mix of our overall investment,  
we will therefore increase our focus on expanding our generics 
pipeline. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to be one  
of few winners with inhaled mono and combination generic 
products. The global generics market is large and is growing 
in value and volume terms and the inhaled respiratory generics 
segment is largely untapped. 
Development of inhaled generics requires specialised capabilities 
which are scarce in the industry but are core competencies of Vectura.
Our current pipeline includes development programmes covering 
the three leading generic molecule opportunities in the US and 
combined US net sales of the branded reference products in 2017 
were in excess of $4.9bn
1
. VR315 (US) is partnered with Hikma, 
VR2081 (US) is partnered with Sandoz and VR410 (US) is, as yet, 
unpartnered. We, and our partner Hikma, remain confident that 
our generic Advair
®
 programme (VR315 (US)) will be approved 
and launched in due course. 
Beyond our existing pipeline, we believe that there are a number 
of additional valuable opportunities within the generics space 
and we look forward to confirming development and licensing 
of further programmes in due course.

During 2017, we completed an Operational Excellence review of activities within the R&D function. This review validated 
that Vectura has a highly skilled and stable workforce and it highlighted a number of areas where we have opportunities 
to significantly enhance productivity. 
By delivering against these activities during 2018, we will free up capacity to support future new development programmes 
and achieve cost savings through a lower internal programme expenditure.

Vectura currently has two leading Vectura enhanced delivery assets which target niche 
patient populations; we believe these assets represent a transformational opportunity 
for nebulised therapy. The VR647 (US) Phase II trial has now initiated with the first 
patient dosed in December 2017 and activities are expected to complete in Q3 2018.  
We remain on track to complete the current VR475 (EU) Phase III trial in Q4 2018. 
As part of the investment review, we have considered the commercialisation options  
for these two assets. We have decided that, in the absence of additional specialist 
marketed products being acquired through M&A or in-licensing, the Group will initiate 
partnering discussions for these assets. This approach reflects the high cost, low  
financial leverage and opportunity cost associated with the commercialisation of single 
assets in a given territory. 
In 2018 we will focus on continued and successful execution of current clinical activities 
and the initiation of partnering discussions. We would expect the conclusion of these 
partnering discussions to be in 2019, following read-out from the ongoing clinical trials.

Strong financial discipline
High performance culture
OUR STRATEGY CONTINUED
We remain committed to exercising strong financial discipline over our business and 
demonstrating excellence in stewardship of our capital. 
Our refocused pipeline and commitment to Operational Excellence have allowed us to 
optimise our R&D investment in 2018 and beyond.
As a result of stopping development of VR942 and VR588 and savings identified through 
our Operational Excellence initiatives, 2018 R&D guidance has been reduced to £55m–£65m. 
We have the potential to further reduce this investment level to between £45m and £55m 
from 2019 assuming that VR647 (US) is partnered in 2019 prior to the start of Phase III 
activities. These are substantial reductions in investment which can be achieved whilst 
simultaneously reducing the risk profile of the business and accelerating the pipeline 
value proposition. 
Our £15m share buy-back and cancellation programme, which commenced on 
14 November 2017, was completed post period on 28 February 2018. As at the end 
of December 2017, approximately £1.4m had been spent in respect of this scheme and the 
balance of cash outflows was incurred in 2018. The Group maintains a disciplined approach 
to capital allocation and capital expenditure is expected to be in a normal annual range of 
£10m to £15m during 2018 as the majority of capacity expansion initiatives having been 
completed in previous years.
Our high performance culture enables us to achieve significant and lasting performance 
that strengthens our competitive advantage.
We facilitate a high performance culture by ensuring our people have the autonomy,  
skills and confidence they need to excel in their roles and that they feel connected with  
our purpose and values.
Throughout 2017 we, collectively as an organisation, have undertaken an exercise to 
clearly articulate our culture and values. Our culture and values are now embedded  
across our business and within our business processes. 
During 2018, we will continue our focus on effective talent retention and development  
for succession planning, as we seek to increase the depth, breadth and diversity of  
our employees.
As a result of stopping development of 
VR942 and VR588 and savings identified 
through our Operational Excellence 
initiatives, 2018 R&D guidance has been

The Board maintains its expectations for strong growth in 
total 2018 revenues, driven by the established performance 
from in-market inhaled products, particularly flutiform
®
 and 
Ultibro
®
/Seebri
® 
Breezhaler
®
. 
As previously guided, until the expiry of certain patents, the earliest 
of which will expire in September 2018, Vectura will continue 
to receive a 3% share of Pacira's cash receipts from net sales of 
EXPAREL
®
. The Group remains entitled to a non-patent-dependent 
milestone of $32m, receipt of which is subject to cumulative 
twelve-month sales of the product reaching $500m which may 
occur in the medium term. 
Revenues in 2018 may also be supplemented by further business 
development activity, including potential milestone and development 
services revenues from further partnering deals signed during 
the year.
The Board also reaffirms its 2018 R&D guidance at the reduced level 
of £55m to £65m. This guidance reflects merger synergy delivery 
of £11m to £12m per annum from 2018, ahead of the original 
£10m annual target together with focused pipeline investment and 
ongoing R&D Operational Excellence initiatives. As announced on 
4 January 2018, the costs to deliver the Operational Excellence 
initiative are estimated at approximately £0.5m within exceptional 
items in 2018, in addition to the £0.9m reported in exceptional 
items in 2017. 
Vectura anticipates important data from its lead enhanced therapy 
programmes, with the VR647 (US) Phase II study in children with 
asthma, and the VR475 (EU) Phase III trial in severe adult asthma, 
both expected to complete in the second half of the year. The Group 
intends to partner both programmes after these important data 
points. Were VR647 to be partnered before the commencement 
of Phase III activities, total R&D spend in 2019 is expected to 
reduce to between £45m and £55m. flutiform

from product supply and royalties from in-market net sales, and is 
eligible to receive up to €30.0m in future sales milestones from 
Mundipharma. The product is now launched in 39 countries, and 
approved in a further nine.

, generating total underlying product 
supply and royalty revenue for the Group of £68.5m (2016 proforma 
underlying: £65.8m). Revenues earned by the Group grew at a rate 
below the rate of in-market sales growth, impacted by the previously 
reported destocking in the supply chain during H2 2017 driven by 
partner working capital demand which is independent of in-market 
sales growth.

In October 2017, Mundipharma received a successful outcome 
of the DCP for the flutiform
®
 breath-triggered product. The UK's 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
acted as the Reference Member State for the DCP, which covers 
18 countries across Europe. This positive DCP outcome marked 
an important step in the regulatory process and Mundipharma 
has now begun to apply for national approvals and reimbursement 
in the European countries covered by this procedure. The launch 
of the enhanced flutiform
®
 k-haler

 device, in due course, will 
represent a helpful life cycle management for an already successful 
product and supports our confidence in the further evolution of

 (Novartis, EU and RoW (excluding US))
A first-in-class once-daily fixed dose inhaled dual bronchodilator 
(LAMA/LABA) indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment 
to relieve the symptoms of adult patients with COPD.
The product is now approved in over 100 countries including Japan, 
the EU and China (approved December 2017). In-market net sales 
grew by 12.0% (CER) on an annual basis.
4
 This growth rate was 
impacted by destocking in certain territories. Novartis reported Q4 
net sales growth of 26.0% (CER).
4
 IMS data shows strong regional 
growth in Europe of 18.6% (CER) which accounts for 76.0% of total 
IMS reported in-market sales
1
.
This growth was fuelled by positive results from the FLAME
5
 study and 
GOLD
6
 changes, which recommend LAMA/LABA as a treatment option 
in the majority of symptomatic patients regardless of their exacerbation 
risk. This was further reinforced by new data published by Novartis 
from the FLASH
7
 study, which demonstrated significantly improved 
lung function in COPD patients after a direct switch from Seretide
®
.
In February 2018, data from Novartis’ CLAIM study was published in 
the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, which showed Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 
provided significant improvements in cardiac and lung function in 
COPD patients with lung hyperinflation, compared to placebo. Many 
people living with COPD are at increased risk of death and disability 
due to comorbid cardiovascular disease.
8
 Lung hyperinflation is 
common in people with COPD
9
, and has been linked to impaired 
cardiac function and a worsening of COPD symptoms, especially 
breathlessness.
10,11,12
 CLAIM is the first study to investigate the effects 
of dual bronchodilation on cardiac function and lung hyperinflation.
The CLAIM study met its primary endpoint demonstrating 
that treatment with Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 led to decreased lung 
hyperinflation and improvements in cardiac function
13
 after 14 days 
of treatment
14
. This translated into clinically relevant patient benefits 
of improved health status and breathlessness (dyspnea), studied 
as exploratory endpoints.

Vectura has significant oral technology and manufacturing expertise 
and capabilities. Our manufacturing facility in Lyon, France, 
has cGMP status with approvals from the European Medicines 
Agency, the FDA, ANVISA (Brazil) and KFDA (South Korea), 
amongst others. The site currently manufactures seven oral 
products for partners. 
Focusing on maximising the value of the facility, Vectura continues 
to leverage the undercapacity of this high-quality manufacturing 
site with increasing business development volumes being achieved. 
Whilst Vectura’s investment in the site continues to be modest, 
we believe that over time the site will become a well-utilised, 
fully integrated development, manufacturing and packaging 
contract organisation.

37 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc Generic programmes 
What is a generic?
A generic drug is a medication that has exactly the same active 
ingredient as its equivalent brand-name drug and yields the 
same therapeutic effect. It has the same dose, safety, efficacy 
and quality. 
Developing products for the generic respiratory market has 
additional complexities as it involves interactions between the 
drug, the formulation and the delivery device.
Pricing pressures in global healthcare systems
Expanding patient populations and growing unmet medical 
need are contributing to higher demand for healthcare services 
and are leading to increased cost pressure within global 
healthcare systems. Steadily rising healthcare costs have also 
led to increased scrutiny on drug pricing by governments, 
the media and consumers. In this context, it is understandable 
that extending the use of generics is considered an important 
element in most prescribing strategies to achieve substantial 
savings without impacting patient care. Switching from 
branded inhaled drugs to lower-cost generic inhaled drugs 
represents an opportunity to reduce the cost of drug 
treatments in asthma and COPD. 
The market for inhaled generics
One of the most significant changes the airways diseases market 
is facing is the increase in the number of generic equivalents, 
both substitutable and therapeutic equivalents, of major 
blockbuster products. Of the major inhaled products facing 
genericisation in the US, Advair
®
/Seretide
®
, Symbicort
®
 and 
Spiriva
®
 are the largest in terms of volumes and value, 
collectively generating US net sales in excess of $4.9bn in 2017
1
. 
Globally, the use of generic medicines is growing. In the US, 
the inhalants market was estimated to be worth some $23bn
2
 
in 2017, with less than 1% generic conversion in key inhaled 
maintenance classes
3
 meaning that the inhaled generics 
market for major airways diseases products in the US remains 
largely untapped. This is in contrast to the oral solids market, 
where generic products account for 18.3% of the market value 
and 90.8% of all prescriptions
4
. 
Whilst pricing is a key challenge for the wider generics market, 
the relatively low level of competition within the inhaled 
generics space underpins our belief that this area continues to 
be a valuable opportunity that Vectura is well placed to exploit. 
As we refocus our investment and pipeline, we will seek to 
bring more partnered generic programmes into our strong 
existing generics pipeline.

STRATEGIC REPORT
A complex development process with multiple variables and challenges
Given the inherent complexity associated with developing inhaled generics, we believe that there are only a handful  
of companies which have the necessary capabilities to successfully develop these programmes. 
5 Orange Book – accessed 22 February 2018.
Legal/IP challenges
Formulation challenges
Technical challenges
Regulatory challenges
Copying an oral small molecule drug or an injectable is simple 
and many hundreds of generics companies are able to do it. 
Copying an inhaled therapy is more challenging. Sourcing the 
drug is similar to simpler dosage forms. However, from this 
point in development the complexity of inhaled product 
development rapidly increases due to the need for the 
product to be formulated, combined with a specific delivery 
device and manufactured at a commercial scale, all requiring 
specialist capabilities, IP and know-how. 
The approval of a generic is litigious, particularly for inhaled 
therapies where multiple overlapping patents are typical. 
Even after all the patents expire, a generic cannot infringe 
design copyright or trademarks relating to the device.
Development of non-inhaled or injectable generics typically 
does not pose the same IP challenge; as an example of a 
modern tablet product facing generic competition in the US, 
rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR
®
) tablets have four patents 
listed in the Orange Book, whereas GSK’s inhaled product 
Breo
®
 Ellipta
®
 (ICS/LABA) has 14 patents listed
5
.
The formulation of inhaled generics has many variables, all  
of which need to be understood and managed. The way in 
which these variables interact can change over the lifecycle 
of the product meaning that product performance changes 
throughout shelf life or as a result of shipping or seasonal 
factors. This variability of the originator product must be 
successfully matched to demonstrate bioequivalence. 
Once the technical legal and formulation challenges are 
overcome, regulators must then be convinced that the 
generic is an accurate copy by proving "bioequivalence".  
This is relatively straightforward for simple oral generics, 
but is significantly more challenging for inhaled therapies.  
For example the US FDA requires clinical evidence of 
equivalence for inhaled products, not just reliance on  
single-dose pharmacokinetic studies. REFOCUSED R&D INVESTMENT AND PIPELINE CONTINUED

Developing generics in Europe and the US
Europe and the US have different guidelines on developing 
respiratory generics. Broadly, there are two routes to follow:
US direct substitution route (“ANDA” or “505j”): this requires the 
generic to prove bioequivalence to the branded drug, and is the 
preferred route to market as it gives the generic an “AB rating” 
that allows pharmacists to directly substitute a cheaper generic 
instead of a branded version, increasing sales and decreasing 
distribution costs. 
It is more difficult to copy a respiratory drug unless the same 
or a very similar device is used as the reference product. This 
is often not possible because of layers of patent protection 
around devices.
US branded generic route (“505b2”): this is used where it is 
difficult to prove bioequivalence or where devices are different. 
Under this route, the generic is not directly substitutable and 
needs to be actively marketed. This type of development often 
requires significant investment in the development of the product.
EU Hybrid MAA route: unlike the US, the EU only has one 
development route known as a "Hybrid MAA"; this allows 
differences in device design and drug delivery compared with 
a reference product, resulting in more market entrants compared 
with the US. The "generic" products are usually non-substitutable 
at the pharmacy and require some level of promotion to support 
the sales of the product; this leads to lower rates of conversion 
to the generic product relative to a substitutable product.
Our current generics pipeline
Our partnering model allows us to access high-volume generic 
opportunities whilst managing the significant costs associated 
with their development. Typically our involvement will include 
both device and formulation development and, as a result, 
Vectura earns development services revenues as well as 
milestones and mid-teen royalties on net sales of the final 
marketed products. This type of programme sits squarely 
within our “sweet spot” of capabilities and potential returns.

We currently have nine generic products in development, including 
VR315 (US), a generic version of Advair
®
 Diskus
®
, partnered with 
Hikma, for the treatment of asthma and COPD in adolescents and 
adults, and programmes targeting the Symbicort
®
 and Spiriva
®
 
opportunities in the US market. 
Only three companies have publicly stated that they have 
submitted an ANDA filing for an AB-rated substitutable generic 
Advair
®
 in the US and all three companies have had their initial 
submissions rejected. Of the companies which have made an 
ANDA filing, only Vectura has developed the device and formulation 
capabilities in house rather than via acquisition or in-licensing. 
In May 2017, we announced that the US FDA had issued a Complete 
Response Letter (CRL) in relation to our partner Hikma’s ANDA 
for a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's Advair
®
 Diskus
®
. 
Throughout 2017, Vectura supported Hikma in a constructive 
dialogue with the FDA and a number of the questions raised were 
clarified and resolved. However, one issue remained outstanding 
regarding the Clinical Endpoint (CEP) study and Hikma, supported 
by Vectura, progressed a dispute resolution process. 
Post period, on 12 March 2018, Hikma confirmed that the dispute 
resolution process had concluded with the FDA upholding its original 
decision with a requirement that Hikma completes an additional 
Clinical Endpoint study. In anticipation of this as one of the 
potential outcomes, Hikma had already finalised the planning of 
a new clinical study and expects to start patient enrolment in the 
coming weeks. Hikma has confirmed that it anticipates being 
able to submit a response to the FDA with new clinical data as 
early as possible in 2019. This decision will have no impact on 
Vectura's revenue or R&D expectations for 2018. 
Both Vectura and Hikma remain confident in the approvability 
of the product and are committed to bringing this cost-effective 
alternative to Advair
®
 Diskus
®
 to the market as quickly as possible. 
Assuming the successful execution of the new study and a standard 
regulatory review, we now expect a potential approval and 
launch during 2020.
Throughout the process, we have gained significant insight into 
the FDA approval process for complex inhaled generic programmes, 
which we believe has strengthened our likelihood of success for 
VR315. Whilst the regulatory bar remains high, the ongoing 
dialogue with the FDA leaves us well placed to react to any new 
requirements or challenges that lie ahead. These learnings support 
our confidence that we have the capabilities to achieve US regulatory 
approval for our extensive inhaled generic pipeline, which includes 
generic versions of the three current largest US inhaled brands.
Significant patient need for accessible lower priced medicines 
remains and, in 2017, US sales of Advair
®
 were $2.1bn
1
. 
This remains a significant market opportunity and we do not 
believe that there will be a large number of new entrants into 
this space; therefore, those who can successfully cross the 
regulatory line stand to win significant and valuable future 
market share.
Future opportunities
Following FDA interactions, Vectura is progressing further 
development of its Open-Inhale-Close device which has the 
potential to be an AB-rated substitutable generic drug-device 
combination for the GSK Ellipta

 portfolio. This programme 
offers a very significant opportunity for Vectura, with analyst

Vectura enhanced delivery programmes
A core pillar of our R&D strategy is 
focused on developing known molecules 
and optimising their safety and efficacy 
profiles by delivering them right to the 
site of action using our advanced device 
technology and inhaled formulation 
capabilities. Our next wave of development 
programmes focuses on specialist disease 
areas affecting the lungs and on very 
specific patient groups with high unmet 
medical need which require targeted 
treatments into the airways. 
The strategic case for investment in Vectura 
enhanced therapies
• Ability to target niche patient population and speciality 
disease areas with high unmet medical needs 
• Low development risk associated with proof of enhanced 
delivery for molecules with a known safety profile
• Strong rationale of an improved efficacy profile with 
enhanced and targeted pulmonary delivery
• Simpler development programmes with lower 
development costs than those involving novel chemical 
entities or mass market inhaled generics 
• Opportunity to partner and achieve attractive upfront 
milestones and royalties and/or to build out portfolio of 
specialist assets for potential future self-commercialisation
• Focus on areas that are less competitive yet have 
the potential for premium prices

Vol. 5. 2001, Dusti-verlag Dr Karl Feistle: München 99–100.
42 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 A patient’s breathing pattern can alter the efficiency of drug delivery 
to different parts of the lung. Control of the inspiratory flow rate, the 
inspiratory volume and the stage at which drug aerosol is delivered 
during the inspiration can materially affect how much drug gets to 
central or peripheral parts of the lungs, influencing the efficacy of the 
drug administered. When using a conventional nebuliser, the normal 
"tidal" breathing pattern (short and shallow) leads to a lot of the 
delivered drug either being stuck at the back of the throat and 
swallowed, or mainly being delivered to the central part of the lungs, 
where many molecules cannot fully exert their action. To overcome 
oral absorption and therefore increase lung deposition, patients 
would need to inhale high amounts of drug to achieve the desired 
clinical effect, with the consequent safety risks that the orally 
absorbed dose may cause.
Our FAVORITE
TM
 technology optimises the amount of drug delivered 
to the lung by guiding the patient to inhale slowly and deeply 
during inhalation. This technology is breath activated, delivering the 
drug only once the patient starts inhaling so that no drug is wasted 
during exhalation, as is the case with conventional jet nebulisers. 
Finally, the duration of each breath can be adjusted to promote an 
ideal breathing pattern which remains comfortable for an individual 
patient. This efficient drug administration allows for either faster 
drug delivery, reducing treatment times, or a higher drug 
deposition in the lungs, with the potential for greater efficacy. 
STRATEGIC REPORT
The device emits lower sound when it is activated during 
inhalation, and stops when the patient exhales. This indicates 
to patients and carers when the treatment is effectively 
administered to improve compliance.
The device has a smart card which serves a dual purpose; it 
instructs the device on how to deliver the drug according to the 
patient’s specific profile and it provides a locking mechanism 
to prevent a generic drug being used off-label in the device. 
Other opportunities to use our innovative technology  
to enhance delivery of known molecules
We see further significant nebulised product opportunities 
where efficacy/safety ratios could be improved by utilising 
our unique technology across multiple potential indications.  
We are currently evaluating potential application of this 
technology and we look forward to providing a pipeline 
progress update in Q3 2018.

paediatric asthma. Both these programmes

differentiated outcomes for asthma patients. 
VR475 (EU) – "A significant opportunity based on delivery 
of challenging reduction in exacerbation primary endpoint"
Phase III – nebulised budesonide for severe, uncontrolled 
adult asthma
The GINA guidelines provide the evidence-based management 
strategies for asthma and advocate a stepwise approach 
to control asthma symptoms and reduce risk (learn more at  
www.ginaasthma.com). At each treatment step in asthma 
management, different medication options are presented. 
Treatment steps are graded 1–5, with severe asthmatics 
defined as those asthmatics that are inadequately controlled 
at treatment step 4.
Inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of current asthma 
treatment. Patients whose asthma is uncontrolled while on  
short-term reliever therapies commence a low dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids (treatment step 2), with the dose of inhaled 
corticosteroids increasing in a stepwise fashion until their  
asthma symptoms are controlled. Patients at treatment step 4 
are treated with medium-high doses of inhaled steroids but 
experience shows that for severe uncontrolled patients, the 
inflammation in the lungs becomes unresponsive to inhaled 
steroids or, in other words, inhaled steroids reach a flat dose-
response level beyond which higher doses of standard inhaled 
steroids will not improve asthma control any further. Therefore in 
step 5 asthmatics, asthma guidelines recommend adding either 
oral corticosteroids, which provide more efficacy but have very 
undesirable side effects, or biologic treatments, which are 
currently very expensive.
The cost of biologic treatments in the EU5 countries (UK, Germany, 
France, Spain and Italy) range from £10,000–£20,000 per annum 
and only target a subset of the severe asthma population that have 
certain characteristics that make them suitable for biologic therapy.
VR475 (EU) targets patients who are uncontrolled at treatment 
step 4 and are about to move up to treatment step 5, with 
the proposition that using the FAVORITE
TM
 technology a higher 
lung deposition of budesonide into the small airways will be 
achieved, thus optimising and shifting up budesonide's dose 
responsiveness, providing a clinically relevant additional efficacy. 
Consequently, a large proportion of this patient population could 
be controlled using inhaled steroids without having to resort to 
unpleasant and unwanted oral corticosteroids or expensive 
biologic treatments. This has a clear patient benefit but also a 
significant benefit for healthcare systems and payors.

VR647 (US) – "A significant opportunity for reduced nebulisation

Phase II – nebulised budesonide for paediatric asthma
In North America, the use of home nebulisation in young children is 
standard of care and the market for nebulised budesonide is valued 
at approximately $770m
7
. Nebulised budesonide (ICS) is approved 
by the FDA for “the maintenance treatment of asthma and as a 
prophylactic treatment in children of twelve months to eight years 
of age”.
The treatment of paediatric asthma requires specific solutions 
to achieve optimum treatment outcomes. The VR647 (US) product 
uses a smart nebuliser device, which is specifically optimised for 
use with children. This produces much shorter treatment times 
and much better control of the delivery of inhaled corticosteroids 
than conventional treatments, an important advantage for 
children and their caregivers.
Recent Phase I data in adults has demonstrated the potential of 
VR647 to reduce treatment time. Compared with standard doses 
of budesonide administered using a convention nebuliser, delivery 
of the same amount of budesonide to the lungs with VR647 reduced 
the treatment times from twelve to fifteen minutes in a non-clinical 
setting down to one to four minutes in a clinical setting. It also has 
the potential to reduce exposure to corticosteroids within the body, 
potentially reducing the risk of steroid-related adverse effects in 
children. These promising patient benefits offer the opportunity 
to capture a sizable market share at brand-level prices.

Underlying revenue growth Underlying adjusted EBITDA 
progression
Why is it a KPI? Underlying 
revenues are those revenues which 
the Group earns from royalties 
earned on sales of approved 
in-market products and on supply 
of products to partners. Underlying 
revenues represent those revenues 
which recur in both the current 
reporting period and the prior year 
reporting period and therefore they 
provide a key measure of Vectura’s 
growth and sustainability. 
How is it measured? Reported 
revenue adjusted for revenue from 
non-recurring sources comprising 
royalties and share of sales which 
have discontinued in either period 
(due to patent expiry or GSK 
dispute), milestones and 
development services revenue.
Refer to pages 57 and 62 for a 
reconciliation of underlying revenue 
to reported revenue. 
2017 performance Underlying 
revenues have grown by 4.0% 
compared to 2016. This headline 
growth rate was impacted by 
previously reported destocking in 
the flutiform
®
 supply chain during 
H2 2017. The destocking was driven 
by partner working capital demand 
and is independent of in-market 
performance of flutiform
®
 which 
grew by 11.8% on a constant 
currency basis compared to the 
prior year. 
In addition, the GSK Ellipta
®
 royalties 
reached their £9m annual cap in 
2016 and 2017.
Why is it a KPI? Underlying adjusted 
EBITDA is an important non-GAAP 
measure used by the Board, the 
Executive Leadership Team and 
managers to monitor and assess 
Vectura’s performance. It provides 
useful information about the 
underlying profitability and cash 
generation of the Group.
How is it measured? Underlying 
adjusted EBITDA is calculated by 
taking adjusted operating profit 
based only on underlying revenues, 
and adding back charges for 
share-based compensation, 
amortisation and deprecation. 
Refer to pages 57 and 62 for a 
reconciliation of underlying adjusted 
EBITDA to statutory operating loss.
2017 performance Underlying 
adjusted EBITDA has increased 
to a profit of £10m, compared 
to a prior year loss of £2.6m, 
as the result of effective cost 
management, including early 
delivery of synergy savings and 
ongoing R&D transformation 
initiatives.
Why is it a KPI? Availability of 
sufficient liquidity is important in 
funding the Vectura’s strategy 
and R&D investment.
How is it measured? Cash and 
cash equivalents less drawn short 
and long-term debt.
2017 performance The increase in 
net cash compared to 2016 is the 
result of a 41.6% increase in cash 
inflows from operations, reported 
after £60.3m of R&D investment.

Changes to our KPIs this year
As explained in the Financial review, 
during the year, Vectura has 
reviewed its financial reporting 
framework to ensure that it remains 
current with both the latest 
regulatory requirements and 
developing best practice within the 
pharmaceutical industry. Following 
this review, Vectura has determined 
that “underlying revenue growth” 
and “underlying EBITDA progression” 
are more appropriate KPIs than 
“recurring revenue growth” and 
“EBITDA progression” since the 
underlying metrics reflect the 
ongoing business and are consistent 
with how management reviews the 
business for the purposes of making 
long-term operating decisions. 
Accordingly, the prior year KPIs of 
“recurring revenue growth”, “other 
revenues” and “adjusted EBITDA 
progression” have been replaced 
with two new KPIs “underlying 
revenue growth” and “underlying 
adjusted EBITDA progression”. 
Refer to the financial review for 
the reconciliation of prior year 
comparatives to previously 
reported KPIs.
Changes to our KPIs 
for 2018 onwards
During the year, in line with the 
Group’s focus on Operational 
Excellence, Vectura has established 
a number of Operational Excellence 
KPIs. As the KPIs were established 
during the year, 2017 performance 
against these KPIs is not reported; 
however, performance against 
these KPIs will be reported on 
from 2018 onwards. 
On 4 January 2018, Vectura 
announced a refocused R&D 
investment strategy which will 
increase the Group’s focus on 
generic and enhanced therapy 
programmes and decrease focus 
on novel molecule development. 
To reflect this refocus, from 2018 
the KPI “number of successful 
feasibility outcomes” will be replaced 
with “number of valuable new BD 
deals signed” and “partnering of 
generic programmes”.

Business development and alliance performance measures – we operate a partnered business model and building new partnerships 
and alliances ensures that we are able to pursue development of pipeline programmes in line with our strategic investment objectives.
Why is it a KPI? Having empowered 
and engaged people is fundamental 
to our success. We monitor our 
employee engagement to ensure 
that adverse trends or issues can be 
addressed in a timely manner.
2017 performance We conducted 
an annual employee engagement 
survey in March 2017 to find out 
how employees feel about working 
for Vectura and identify areas 
where we can do more to 
improve engagement. 
84% of employees participated in 
the survey, which was administered 
by an independent third party 
enabling us to compare our results 
with external benchmarks. 
The areas that received the highest 
engagement scores ahead of the 
benchmarks included:
•  value/culture and link with strategy;
• diversity;
• team collaboration; 
• pride in the organisation;
•  employees encouraged 
to share ideas and views; and
•  manager communication 
and feedback. 48 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Risk management and internal control
RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS
Objectives of our risk management process:
• to ensure that the risk appetite of the Board is 
embedded throughout the organisation and 
fully understood by those who are responsible 
for managing risk and making key decisions 
across the business;
• to identify and assess the likelihood and potential 
impact of the risks that Vectura faces in the 
execution of its strategy and the operation of 
its business model, and ensure that appropriate 
mitigating actions and controls are in place such 
that the residual risk is aligned to the risk 
appetite of the Board;
• to control systematic risks within the organisation 
by maintaining and improving a system of 
internal controls to manage risks in decision 
making, legal contract management, quality and 
regulatory processes and the processing of 
financial transactions; and
• to ensure that identified risks are reported 
to relevant stakeholders in a timely manner 
to facilitate effective decision making.
Our ability to meet our goals and objectives may be impacted  
by a number of these risks, which could impact our strategy,  
our business model and our operating environment. 
We have developed and implemented a risk management process 
which is designed to ensure that existing or emerging significant 
risks are identified, assessed, managed and reported to relevant 
stakeholders in a timely manner to inform and support decision 
making. Our risk management process aims to mitigate the 
significant risks that Vectura faces in accordance with our risk 
appetite. The Group’s risk appetite has been reduced following 
the refocused investment strategy announced in January 2018 
and described in this report. 
It is recognised, however, that no risk management process 
can provide absolute assurance against loss. 
This section provides an overview of our risk management process, 
the key risks faced by the business and the actions that we have 
taken to mitigate them. Not all the risks identified as part of our 
risk management processes are detailed in this section; instead this 
report focuses on those risks that the Directors believe to be the 
most important and which could cause Vectura’s results to differ 
materially from expected and historical results and significantly 
impact our strategy. Not all of these risks are within the control 
of the Group and other factors besides those listed may affect the 
Group’s performance. As with all business operating in a dynamic 
environment, some risks may not yet be known whilst other 
low-level risks could become material in the future.

We operate within a complex regulatory environment, which is subject

STRATEGIC REPORT
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of Vectura’s risk 
management and internal control at least annually, on behalf of the 
Board. This review has been undertaken during the year and, with 
direct support from the Audit Committee, the Board believes that it 
has taken all reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the risk management 
process is effective and fit for purpose. No material control 
weaknesses or deficiencies were identified as part of this review. 
Our approach to assessing risk
Risk is assessed net of the application of current control activities 
using a standard matrix which considers the potential likelihood of 
a risk event occurring and the potential impact on the business were 
such an event to occur. The output of this matrix allows the business 
to prioritise risks and mitigating actions. Risks are considered within 
the timeframe of at least three years, which is the same period that 
has been used in the Viability statement.
How our principal risks have evolved during 2017
One of the principal risks described in the 2016 Report and 
Accounts, “Disruption to the launch of the Group’s US generic 
Advair
®
 programme (VR315 (US))”, was realised during 2017. 
Accordingly, this principal risk has been updated to “Failure 
to launch VR315 (US) in a competitive timeframe”.
During the year, the Board undertook a review of the Group’s  
investment strategy and as a result of this review has determined 
that it will seek to partner VR475 (EU) and VR647 (US). Accordingly, 
the prior year risk of “Failure to successfully launch and self-
commercialise Vectura’s wholly owned pipeline products”  
is no longer considered a key risk and is replaced by the risk  
of “Failure or delay in partnering VR647 (US) and VR475 (EU)”. 
For further details of the Group’s investment review and impact 
on overall pipeline risk, see pages 28 to 30.
The Brexit deadline on 29 March 2019 is now closer with only 
the first phase of negotiations concluded. Uncertainty from  
Brexit is now considered to be a principal risk in its own right 
whereas previously it was absorbed into the risk of "Changes  
to the regulatory, operating or pricing environment for the 
pharmaceutical industry".
All other principal risks have remained broadly unchanged 
in the year.

STRATEGIC RISK
What is the risk?
In the absence of M&A, the Group plans to balance risk and 
value generation by partnering its specialist nebulised assets. 
The partnering of VR475 (EU) and VR647 (US) is anticipated 
in 2019 subject to the successful completion of the current 
clinical trial activity.
Vectura could be unable to find a partner with suitable commercial 
strength and respiratory heritage for these assets in a timely manner.
What would the impact be?
Failure to partner these assets with a suitable partner in a timely 
manner or at all could materially impact future revenues, 
profitability and prospects of Vectura. 
Failure to partner the assets may lead to an increase in Vectura’s 
future R&D investment.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Phase III (VR475 (EU)) or Phase II (VR647 (US)) clinical trials 
could be unsuccessful.
• Inability to identify a suitable partner.
• Inability to negotiate a deal with commercially attractive terms.
How do we manage the risk?
Vectura has acquired, developed and progressed these two 
specialist pipeline assets based on its experience and knowledge 
of the respiratory market. As such the Group believes these 
products are well placed to capture value in an attractive niche 
market where relatively few competitors have relevant assets. 
Vectura has dedicated, experienced personnel responsible for 
marketing assets to, and negotiating with, potential partners. 
In addition to its existing partner relationships, which have the 
potential to be extended to new projects, the Group also attends 
industry conferences and events where its programmes and 
technologies are marketed to new potential partners.

Supply chain disruption 
OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Vectura manages the supply chain for certain commercial products 
(flutiform
®
, AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
 and Breelib
TM
), and also relies on 
suppliers for the provision of quality compliant materials for R&D.
What would the impact be?
Major disruption to, or failure of, these supply chains, particularly 
for flutiform
®
, could result in lost revenues and business opportunities, 
stock shortages, liabilities and significant damage to profitability 
and prospects for Vectura. Such disruption could be either quality 
or capacity related.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Supply chain disruption involving single point of failure for 
which Vectura has high dependency and limited resilience.
• Supplier loss of licence or regulatory action impacting Vectura.
• Termination of the manufacturing agreement with Sanofi 
for flutiform
®
. The agreement continues to 2020 and will be 
automatically renewed biannually unless terminated by either 
party within 24 months’ notice.
How do we manage the risk?
Vectura has strong working relationships with its suppliers; we 
have established due diligence processes to ensure that our stringent 
quality standards are maintained and we have put in place appropriate 
systems that will provide an early warning of potential issues. 
A dedicated Commercial Quality Director has oversight of release 
of commercial product and ensures appropriate management of 
quality for commercial products.
Monthly meetings are held to discuss customer demand forecasts 
and to review Vectura’s ability to meet these forecasts. Vectura has 
established contingency arrangements to ensure that production 
capacities exceed forecast demand so that it would be possible 
to catch up on any shortfall in production or meet unexpected 
demand. Appropriate levels of safety stock are maintained. 
Supply chain mapping has been undertaken, and is regularly 
reviewed, to identify potential points of failure and mitigating 
actions. Where economically feasible, additional sources of 
supply are established and contracts negotiated to include 
appropriate provisions for replacement of defective goods. 
The Group also has appropriate insurance, but it is not possible 
to insure against all risks and not all insurable risks can be fully 
insured on an economically feasible basis.

Failure to launch VR315 (US) in a

OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
On 10 May 2017, our partner Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 
(“Hikma”) received a complete response letter (CRL) from the 
US FDA in relation to its abbreviated new drug application for 
its generic version of GSK’s Advair
®
 Diskus
®
. This CRL has been 
categorised as “Major”. 
Hikma and Vectura have had constructive dialogue with the FDA 
to resolve the observations made in the CRL and the majority 
of questions raised have been addressed and clarified. Hikma, 
supported by Vectura, decided to progress a dispute resolution 
process regarding the remaining outstanding issue, namely the 
different interpretation of the results from the Clinical Endpoint Study 
(CEP). The dispute resolution process concluded in March 2018 
and the FDA has upheld its original decision and included 
a requirement that Hikma completes an additional CEP study. 
What would the impact be?
Failure to complete the Clinical Endpoint study in a timely manner 
could result in the product being launched later than those of 
competitors resulting in loss of potential future revenues and 
funds for investment.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Competitor products are approved and launched while the 
additional CEP study is completed.
How do we manage the risk?
The Group is unable to take direct action to mitigate this risk. 
In anticipation of an unfavourable outcome from the dispute 
resolution process, Hikma has already finalised the planning 
of a new clinical study and expects to start patient enrolment 
in the coming weeks. Hikma anticipates being able to submit 
a response to the FDA with new clinical data as early as possible 
in 2019. A joint clinical team is in place to oversee the conduct 
of the study.
In addition, the Group has responded to the delay alongside other 
factors by reviewing its R&D investment strategy and, as a result, 
the Group plans to reduce its pipeline risk as detailed above.

Partner failure
OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Vectura operates a partnering business model and therefore 
is reliant on partners for development and commercialisation 
of pipeline assets. 
In addition, Vectura earns revenues from a number of partnered 
on-market assets and is dependent upon those partners for 
maintaining regulatory approvals and for marketing of the products.
What would the impact be?
Failure by a strategic partner to deliver on its obligations during 
the development phase could result in a delay or cessation of 
development; this in turn could cause a delay in the product 
reaching the market which could undermine the product’s 
commercial potential and result in lower returns on investment 
for Vectura. 
The marketing and commercialisation strategy taken by partners 
for existing on-market products could materially impact the level 
of royalties and sales milestones earned by Vectura.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Change in partner strategy or priorities.
• Partner trading issues/insolvency.
• Failure by a partner to market the product successfully.
• Partner failure to obtain appropriate pricing and reimbursement.
How do we manage the risk?
Vectura has a broad range of disclosed and undisclosed partners.
All collaborations are performed under a suitable legal agreement 
which is assessed by Vectura and its legal advisors. 
Typically, for collaborations, a joint steering committee (JSC) 
is established involving both Vectura and partner personnel. 
This provides Vectura with a mechanism to ensure that any 
joint project activity is managed appropriately. Where the 
Group supplies product, regular operational meetings take 
place to review demand forecasts. 
The Group also has a commercial and business development 
department which maintains regular dialogue with existing 
and potential new partners.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
Changes in the regulatory, operating or pricing 
environment (excluding Brexit)
OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Vectura operates in the highly regulated international 
pharmaceutical industry, which is subject to change.
What would the impact be?
Changes in the pharmaceutical regulatory landscape, operational 
restrictions and downward pricing pressure could impact whether 
a development product can be developed into a viable marketable 
product and the amount of time and expenses associated with 
such development. 
Even if products are approved, they may still face subsequent 
difficulties resulting in financial loss and reputational damage.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Political change.
• Competitor pricing strategies. 
• Regulatory action on pricing.
How do we manage the risk?
Regulatory changes tend to be slow due to lengthy consultations 
and discussions between regulators and the pharmaceutical 
industry. We work closely with expert regulatory advisors and, 
when appropriate, seek advice from regulatory authorities on 
the design of key development plans for pre-clinical and 
clinical programmes. 
We work with a number of blue-chip pharmaceutical partners 
which have significant regulatory expertise. 
Our business strategy includes investment in generic products 
which support government initiatives to reduce cost.

Failure or delay in achieving development 
milestones required to advance the product pipeline
OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Vectura increases the value potential of its research and 
development by successfully advancing its pipeline projects 
through the development cycle. 
Failure or delay in achieving development milestones for the Group’s 
late-stage product development pipeline (e.g. VR475 (EU) and 
VR647 (US)), generic programmes and other new development 
opportunities would impact the potential value of these programmes.
What would the impact be?
Pipeline failures or delays could materially impact the future 
revenues, profitability and prospects of Vectura.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Phase III (VR475 (EU)) or Phase II (VR647 (US)) clinical trials 
could be unsuccessful.
• Manufacturing issues associated with a particular device 
or product for clinical trials.
• Ineffective design and execution of clinical programmes 
and protocols.
• Failure of outsourced provider of clinical trials. 
• Constraints in R&D capacity and investment.
How do we manage the risk?
Vectura has an established governance process to oversee 
the conduct and delivery of all development programmes and 
to ensure that any potential changes to the development plan or 
budget are identified and discussed in a timely manner such that 
mitigating activities or actions can be put in place as required.
Vectura works closely with expert regulatory advisors and, when 
appropriate, seeks advice from regulatory authorities on the design 
of key development plans for pre-clinical and clinical programmes.
Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with prevailing practice 
and statutory/regulatory requirements.
Individuals with the necessary skills and experience have been recruited 
to lead and oversee the development of our late-stage assets. Vectura 
continues to work with a network of experienced consultants and 
contractors which provide additional support and expertise as required.
Operational Excellence initiatives within the R&D function have 
been established to increase productive capacity.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Failure to attract or retain talent/key personnel
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Vectura relies upon a number of key qualified management, 
scientific, technical, marketing and support personnel. Competition 
for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance 
that the Group will be able to continue to attract and retain 
such personnel.
What would the impact be?
The loss of talent or key personnel could adversely impact 
the effectiveness of the Group’s operations. 
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Inadequate succession planning/talent management.
• Organisational disruption and/or change.
• Failure to attract the correct calibre of candidates.
How do we manage the risk?
Vectura seeks to develop employees for current and future roles 
and our career development and talent management programmes 
remain a key area of focus for the Executive Leadership Team. 
We continue to invest in ongoing training and development. 
New leadership development training has been developed 
in 2017 and is currently being rolled out, starting with the 
Executive and Business Leadership Teams. 
Succession plans for key roles have been developed to ensure a 
talent pool is identified, developed and ready for implementation. 
These plans include the identification of “emergency successors” 
in the case of unanticipated and immediate absence.
Vectura offers market-competitive reward packages and a clear 
career development framework.
Our multiple locations provide flexibility for potential employees 
and an ability to target talent pools across a wide geography.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
Brexit uncertainty
STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
While the impact of the UK’s decision to leave the European 
Union (EU) in March 2019 is still uncertain, Brexit may result in an 
increase in cost of operations of the Group and disruption to the 
Group and partner supply chains, particularly flutiform
®
, where 
most raw materials are imported from the EU into the UK by 
Vectura and finished product is exported from the UK into the 
EU by a partner.
What would the impact be?
Disruption to or additional cost associated with managing 
an intra-EU supply chain.
Delays may also arise in progressing the R&D pipeline due 
to potential skills shortages and changes in the regulatory 
landscape for the UK pharmaceutical industry. 
Further volatility in exchange rates, particularly in the euro and 
US dollar versus sterling could materially impact the Group’s 
reported financial results. 
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Failure by the UK to negotiate an adequate transition period 
to prepare for exit from the EU.
• Tariffs introduced on flow of goods between the UK and EU.
• Inability to perform quality assurance release testing for 
products supplied by the Group into the EU.
• Reduced labour pool and increased competition for labour 
from EU citizens not wishing or able to work in the UK. 
• Partner failure to mitigate risks from Brexit (see risk #5 above).
How do we manage the risk?
A team comprising senior representatives from relevant functions 
is in place responsible for monitoring and mitigating the risks 
from Brexit. The Group and individuals on the team are members 
of various professional bodies and trade organisations. Guidance 
and intelligence from these organisations is monitored and 
actions are taken accordingly. 
Process mapping is taking place in the supply chain to identify all 
potential points where Brexit could impact the Group’s ability to 
meet its product supply obligations. 
The Group is raising the risk from Brexit with its partners and 
suppliers, providing support where required.

Failure to protect intellectual property
OPERATIONAL RISK
What is the risk?
Patent infringement by a competitor organisation or failure to 
obtain patents for Vectura-related development could impact 
on Vectura’s ability to deliver its product pipeline or impact 
on-market products.
What would the impact be?
Such infringement or failure could result in Vectura or a partner 
having to take a licence to third-party IP in order to develop a 
product, or even being unable to commercialise a product, 
materially impacting Vectura’s future revenues, profitability 
and prospects.
What could cause the risk to be realised?
• Competitor successful in challenging Vectura or partner patent.
• Critical information missing from filed patent.
How do we manage the risk?
Dedicated internal resource, supplemented with external 
expertise, files for and prosecutes patents and other forms 
of intellectual property.
In conjunction with our partners, where relevant, Vectura takes 
steps to enforce these rights. 
Third-party rights that may be of interest to and/or have adverse 
effects on Vectura’s activities are also monitored so that action 
can be initiated where appropriate.

STRATEGIC REPORT
In accordance with the provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(C.2.2 of the 2014 revision), the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period. The Directors’ assessment 
has been made with reference to the Group’s current strategy, the 
strong balance sheet including the availability of the £50m revolving 
credit facility and the Group’s principal risks as described in this 
Strategic report.
Whilst the Directors have no reason to believe the Group will not be 
viable over a longer period, a three-year period is considered appropriate 
as it is possible that one or more of the principal risks could reasonably 
be realised in the period which could materially impact the viability of 
the Group. In addition, this period is more than double that used for 
the going concern assessment and is within the term of the Group’s 
revolving credit facility. This period therefore provides the Board 
with an appropriate degree of confidence while still providing a 
suitable longer-term outlook.
The process adopted to assess viability this year followed that 
undertaken in 2016 and involved collaborative input from a range 
of business functions to model a series of theoretical “stress test” 
scenarios linked to the Group’s principal risks. These scenarios included 
both significant adverse financial outcomes and operational failures. 
Consideration was given to the impact of mitigations as well as their 
interdependencies. The Audit Committee reviewed the process 
before the viability evaluation was provided to the Board to 
assist in its assessment.
In making their assessment, the Directors have undertaken a sensitivity 
analysis of its forecast cash flows and liquidity. The key assumptions 
underpinning the assessment during the period are as follows: 
• changes to flutiform
®
 net in-market sales prices, growth 
of product supply volumes and the related supply margin;
• manufacturing and assembly of flutiform
®
 by Sanofi continues 
in line with contractual obligations; 
• the rate of growth of net sales of Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
/Ultibro
®
 
Breezhaler
®
 in EU/RoW; and
• the timing and forecast cash flows from partnering the product 
pipeline, particularly VR475 (EU) and VR647 (US).
The principal plausible stress tests in accordance with the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties are: 
• a significant reduction in product supply inflows for flutiform
®
 
from either a reduction in demand or an inability to supply;
• lower in-market sales prices of flutiform
®
 due to competition, 
technological change or regulatory body action;
• slower than expected sales growth in Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
/
Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 in EU/RoW and lower than expected 
royalties from the Group’s other on-market products;
• significant delays in contracting with new or existing partners;
• unsuccessful outcome from the VR475 (EU) Phase III clinical trial 
with no return on R&D investment;
• unsuccessful outcome from the VR647 (US) Phase II clinical study 
with no return on R&D investment;
• VR315 (US) is not launched in the viability period; and
• lower flutiform
®
 margins from tariffs on raw materials imported 
from the EU and a reduction in supply prices due to tariffs on 
export of finished product from the UK to the EU. 
As a worst case scenario, the combined impact of these downside 
scenarios was assessed in combination against the Group’s liquidity. 
Based on the assessment and stress testing, the Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a 
three-year period.
Going concern
At the time of approving the financial statements the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
2017 Annual Report and Accounts.
VIABILITY STATEMENT FINANCIAL REVIEW
Delivering consistent  
financial results
Comparative financial information
The comparison of the financial results for the twelve-months 
ended 31 December 2017 with those of the previously reported 
period is distorted by a number of factors: the Skyepharma merger 
which took place part-way through 2016; the subsequent change 
of the accounting reference date which had the effect of shortening 
the prior period to nine-months; and, as expected, significantly lower 
revenues from non-recurring sources (milestones, development 
services and certain royalties) earned in 2017 compared to 2016.
Accordingly, to assist full understanding of the Group’s 2017 results, 
this review includes financial information taken directly from the 
audited financial statements, prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the Group’s accounting 
policies, as well as financial information presented on an underlying 
basis as explained below. The Directors believe that this additional 
information is important to fully assess the financial performance of 
the Group on a comparable year-on-year basis.
Underlying financial information
In order to provide a comparative basis from which to calculate 
underlying financial performance, certain 2016 income statement 
measures have been prepared on a proforma full year calendar basis 
for Vectura and Skyepharma. This information has been extracted 
from the Group’s management accounts for the twelve-months 
ended 31 December 2016 and is prepared in accordance with 
Vectura’s relevant accounting policies. This proforma financial 
information presents performance for the business for the 
twelve-months ended 31 December 2016 as though Vectura and 
Skyepharma had always been merged, excluding the impact of the 
acquisition accounting adjustments required by IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. A reconciliation of 2016 reported results for the 
nine-month period to 2016 proforma results is included in an 
appendix to this report. 
However, comparison of the 2017 reported results to the 2016 
proforma twelve-month financial information is also impacted by 
significantly lower revenues from non-recurring sources, largely 
relating to: licensing milestones, which, by their nature, can vary 
materially year to year; R&D development services revenues; and 
lower royalties in 2017 due to the expiry of the ADVATE
®
 patent 
in 2016 and GSK’s decision to cease paying royalties in respect of 
the Ellipta
®
 products under a legacy Vectura agreement with effect 
from August 2016, which is now subject to a legal dispute process. 
The impact of these items can distort comparison of financial results 
from period to period and therefore can obscure trends in the 
underlying, recurring base of the business. 
Accordingly, certain underlying financial information is included in 
this report. Underlying financial information is calculated using the 
2017 reported results and proforma 2016 twelve-month financial 
information, excluding certain non-underlying items: (i) revenue 
from non-recurring sources comprising royalties and share of sales 
which have discontinued in either period (for example, due to patent 
expiry or legal dispute), milestones and development services 
Summary
Reported revenue of £148.0m, in line 
with expectations; underlying revenues 
grew 4.0% driven by the Group’s key 
inhaled products.
Adjusted EBITDA of £25.8m underpinned 
by key products flutiform
®
, Ultibro
®
 and 
Seebri

, which together delivered 
gross margin of £41.1m, +18.8%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
revenue; (ii) non-cash share-based payment and amortisation of 
intangible assets charges; and (iii) exceptional items. The underlying 
financial information therefore reflects the ongoing business in 
both periods and is consistent with how management reviews the 
business for the purpose of making long-term operating decisions.
A reconciliation of 2016 reported results for the nine-month period 
to 2016 underlying proforma results is also included in an appendix 
to this report. The appendix also includes a reconciliation of underlying 
proforma measures to the previously reported non-IFRS financial 
measures of recurring revenues and adjusted EBITDA based upon 
recurring revenues. 
Metrics presented on both reported and underlying bases include 
revenue, operating profit/(loss) and adjusted EBITDA. A summary 
reconciliation between the 2017 IFRS-reported metrics and the 
relevant underlying financial metrics is presented in the table above 
and further detail on the specific reconciling items is presented 
within the relevant line item commentary in the following sections 
of this report. 
The focus of the narrative below is on the underlying results; 
however, key aspects of reported year-on-year performance are 
also presented.
Revenue 
Vectura has five revenue streams: royalties earned from sales of 
in-market partnered products, product supply and device sales 
revenues, signing and milestone payments, development services 
and other revenue. 
In line with expectations, 2017 reported revenue was £148.0m, 
an increase of 17.0% compared to the prior nine-month period 
(reported nine-month 2016: £126.5m), with headline growth being 
impacted by the lack of comparability between the two periods as 
highlighted above. 
Underlying revenues, which are those revenues recurring in both 
comparable twelve-month periods, increased by 4.0%, reflecting 
strong in-market performance of key products flutiform

 and 
Ultibro
®
/Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
 where combined revenues grew 
5.4% to £85.8m (2016 proforma underlying: £81.4m). Growth in 
underlying revenues was moderated below the rate of in-market 
sales growth of these products due to 2017 supply chain stocking 
factors, as previously announced, which has not impacted the 
in-market performance of the products. AirFluSal

 Forspiro

 revenues 
were slightly below the prior period with lower sales of the

Revenue continued
Overall growth of underlying revenues also benefited from increased 
income from oral products and EXPAREL

, which more than offset 
£3.8m lower royalties from the topical product Solaraze

, which 
benefited from temporary market factors in the prior period, as 
previously reported and in line with expectations for that product.

Despite Vectura’s ADVATE
®
 patent expiring in January 2016, due to 
higher than anticipated run-off sales of inventory manufactured by 
Baxter prior to patent expiry, the Group continued to receive substantial 
royalties during 2016. In addition, royalties that Vectura had 
previously earned on sales of the Ellipta
®
 products under a legacy 
agreement with GSK ceased at the end of July 2016 and became 
the subject of an ongoing legal dispute. These two royalty streams 
are excluded from underlying revenues in order to present a clear 
trend of the Group’s ongoing royalty and overall revenue performance. 
A fair value credit of £1.5m in respect of the IFRS 3 acquisition 
accounting for the Skyepharma merger, which relates to Mundipharma’s 
clawback of certain development costs from flutiform
®
 royalties, 
has also been excluded from 2017 underlying revenues, as 
underlying revenues exclude acquisition accounting adjustments. 
Overall underlying royalties increased by 4.6% in 2017, with growth 
across inhaled and non-inhaled products partly offset by lower 
sales as expected of the topical product Solaraze
®
, which benefited 
from temporary market upside in 2016, as noted above. 
Total royalties recognised in respect of Ultibro
®
 and Seebri
®
 
Breezhaler
®
 were £17.3m (2016 proforma underlying: £15.6m). 
Novartis reported Ultibro
®
 Breezhaler
®
 net sales of $411m for 2017, 
an increase of 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the 
full year 2016
1
. Novartis has reported that this annual growth 
rate was impacted by short-term normalisation of stocking effects 
in certain territories. Novartis reported strong year-on-year growth 
in Q4 2017 of 26% on a constant currency basis
1
. As expected, 
reported Seebri
®
 Breezhaler
®
 net sales of $151m were in line with 
those reported for the 2016 full year. 
During 2017, Novartis’ sub-licence partner Sunovion launched 
both Utibron™ Neohaler
®
 and Seebri™ Neohaler
®
 in the US and 
roll-out of these products is now underway. In the future, US sales 
will generate a further contribution to Vectura’s royalty base and 
underlying revenues. 
GSK has continued to report strong performance of its Ellipta
®
 
franchise (Breo
®
/Relvar
®
 Ellipta
®
, Anoro
®
 Ellipta
®
, Incruse
®
 Ellipta
®
). 
Under the terms of a legacy Skyepharma agreement with GSK, 
Vectura royalties earned on the sales of these products are capped 
at £9.0m per annum and this cap was reached in 2016 and 2017 
(2016 proforma underlying: £9.0m).
Royalties on net sales of flutiform
®
, which continues to benefit from 
strong and growing demand, particularly in Japan, contributed 
£5.1m to 2017 underlying royalties (2016 proforma underlying: 
£5.0m). Total in-market net sales of flutiform
®
 were €206.2m in 
2017, 11.8% higher than 2016 on a constant currency basis
2
.
The underlying growth in total royalties recognised for flutiform
®
 was 
impacted by a cap in the agreement with Mundipharma, which limits 
the aggregate amount of revenues that can be earned by Vectura 
for royalties and the cost of product sales to 35% of Mundipharma’s 
net sales in the same period. Accordingly, the 2017 effective royalty 
rate received from Mundipharma is a low single-digit percentage 
(2016 underlying: low-single-digit percentage). However, when 
combined with the gross margin generated by flutiform
®
 supply 
to Mundipharma, the Group in effect receives a double-digit to 
low-teens percentage of in-market sales, depending on the sales 
mix of countries, at the gross margin level. Royalties received from 
our partner Kyorin were impacted by the effect of currency, and 
grew by 18% on a constant currency basis, in line with in-market 
net sales growth in Japan.

STRATEGIC REPORT
AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
 continued to make a modest but growing 
contribution to underlying royalties, and Vectura recognised £2.3m 
of royalties in respect of 2017 sales of the product (2016 proforma 
underlying: £1.8m). 
Underlying royalties from net sales of Solaraze
®
 were £2.9m, a 
reduction, as expected, compared to the prior period which benefited 
from short-term market factors (2016 proforma underlying: £6.7m). 
Other underlying royalties primarily relate to the legacy 
Skyepharma oral portfolio. Certain non-inhaled legacy products 
from Vectura continue to contribute an immaterial amount to 
other like-for-like royalties.
Product supply and device sales
Product supply and device sales of £74.7m form an important 
component of underlying revenues (2016 proforma underlying: £72.6m).
Revenue earned from the supply of flutiform
®
 to Mundipharma and 
Kyorin was up 4.3% to £63.4m in 2017 (2016 proforma underlying: 
£60.8m). As previously communicated, product supply revenue was 
impacted by customer supply chain destocking in the second half 
of 2017. Therefore, this relatively modest underlying growth is not 
reflective of the in-market net sales performance of this product, 
which, as noted above, grew by 11.8% on an annual constant 
currency basis during 2017
2
. 
In addition to flutiform
®
 product supply revenues, Vectura recognised 
£8.6m for the supply of certain oral products from Lyon to the 
Group’s partners, up 21.1% (2016 proforma underlying: £7.1m). 
Vectura also received £1.5m device sales revenue for the supply 
of its GyroHaler
®
 device to Sandoz to support the continued roll-out 
and growth of AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
 in a number of European and 
Rest of the World territories (2016 proforma underlying: £3.1m). 
As previously noted, relatively minor destocking was noted in the 
AirFluSal
®
 Forspiro
®
 supply chain during 2017.
Signing and milestone payments
Whilst signing and milestone payments represent an integral part of 
our partner-based business model and are an important source of 
income they are, by their nature, irregular and may vary materially 
from one year to the next. Milestones are therefore excluded from 
our definition of underlying revenues. 
Vectura recognised signing and milestone payments of £5.1m in 
2017; this relates primarily to a €5.0m (£4.2m) milestone received 
from Bayer following the first European launch of Breelib™, the 
new nebuliser for Ventavis
®
 (iloprost) based on the FOX
®
 handheld 
smart nebuliser. Vectura is eligible to receive contingent annual 
milestones on the anniversary of this first launch on a decreasing 
scale, over six years, to the total value of €5.75m. Vectura also 
receives small product supply revenues for the supply of the FOX
®
 
device to Bayer but does not receive royalties on commercial sales 
of this product.
In the twelve-month proforma to 31 December 2016, Vectura 
recognised £22.4m in signing and milestone payments. The major 
milestones recognised included $10.0m (£7.1m) following acceptance 
by the FDA of Hikma's ANDA filing for VR315 (US); €1.5m (£1.1m) from 
Ablynx after it exercised its commercial licence option in May 2016 
to use the Group's FOX
®
 handheld smart nebuliser technology to 
progress its ALX-0171 infant RSV programme; an $8.0m (£6.1m) 
sales milestone was recorded following Pacira's confirmation that 
worldwide annual net sales of EXPAREL
®
 (on a cash-received basis) 
to 30 June 2016 had reached $250m; and a $5.0m (£4.1m) sales 
milestone achieved as 2016 sales of Seebri
®
 and Ultibro
®
 
Breezhaler
®
 exceeded $0.5bn. 
Development services 
As with signing and milestone payments, development services 
revenues are irregular and dependent upon the level of specialist 
development services required by Vectura’s partners and as such 
may vary materially from one year to the next. Development 
services revenues are therefore excluded from our definition of 
underlying revenues. 
Development services revenues were £9.0m during 2017 (proforma 
2016: £7.5m) and mainly relate to the ongoing development of the 
breath-triggered version of flutiform
®
 and the VR2076 triple programme, 
both with Mundipharma, and the VR2081 US generic programme, 
partnered with Sandoz. 
As announced in January 2018, Mundipharma has decided to terminate 
the development VR2076, which was in an early formulation phase. 
Given the early stage of this asset, this is not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group's revenues in 2018. As an acquired 
programme from the Skyepharma merger, VR2076 was held as an 
intangible asset net of its associated deferred tax liability and had 
a value as at 31 December 2017 of £7.6m. This asset was fully 
impaired in the 2017 financial statements.
Other revenue
In 2017, other revenue of £6.6m solely comprised the Group's 3% 
share of Pacira's cash receipts from net sales of EXPAREL
®
 (2016 
proforma: £5.8m). Pacira reported 2017 net sales of EXPAREL
®
 of 
$282.9m, a 6.4% increase compared to 2016. Vectura expects to 
receive share of sales revenues until the expiry of certain patents, 
the earliest of which expire in September 2018. The Group is also 
eligible to receive a $32m sales milestone when twelve-month net 
sales of EXPAREL
®
 reach $500m (on a cash received basis). This 
milestone is not patent dependent. 
Other revenue in the twelve-month proforma to 31 December 2016 
also included £0.8m as the final portion of the annual rental income 
from Aenova of its lease of the Lyon facility for the period 1 January 
–30 June 2016. This element of other revenues is non-recurring and 
has been excluded from underlying revenues. 
Implementation of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The impact of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers is 
subject to final assessment and audit, but is not currently expected 
to have a material impact on total revenues for 2018. Refer to 
note 2 in the financial statements for further information. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by £2.1m to £57.2m (twelve-months 
proforma 2016: £55.1m). This increase is in line with increased 
product supply and device sales revenue. Underlying gross profit 
from flutiform
®
 product supply, excluding a £0.8m charge associated 
with a fair value adjustment, was £23.8m, which equates to a gross 
margin of 37.6% (2016 proforma underlying: gross profit of 
£19.0m, 31.4% gross margin). The 6.2 percentage point increase in 
gross margin reflects increasing benefits of scale, cost reductions 
and a one-off cost initiative that accounts for approximately half of 
the improvement.
Inventories for the flutiform
®
 supply chain were £21.5m at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £17.6m).  60 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Research and development (R&D) expenses
The Group maintains a disciplined approach to capital allocation 
in managing its R&D portfolio. R&D expenses of £60.3m were at 
the lower end of the 2017 guidance range, and were £4.8m lower 
than 2016 underlying as the result of pipeline prioritisation, early 
delivery of synergy savings and R&D productivity initiatives. 
Expenditure recorded during the period comprised £34.2m on the 
Group's enhanced delivery assets (2016 proforma underlying: £27.5m) 
related to the ongoing Phase III trial for VR475 (EU) and costs 
associated with continued development of VR647 (US); £14.3m 
on novel-patented molecule partnering projects (2016 proforma 
underlying: £24.8m) reducing compared to prior year as a result of 
the decision to partner both VR942 and VR588; £9.5m on generic 
partnering projects (2016 proforma underlying: £10.9m); and 
£2.3m on oral projects (2016 proforma underlying: £1.9m). 
Other operating expenditure and income
Underlying other operating expenditure and income, which 
excludes the impact of a £2.1m non-cash charge for share-based 
compensation, has decreased by 19.4% to £10.4m. This reduction 
is mainly due to merger synergy cost savings.
Other operating expenditure and income includes a £1.7m R&D 
expenditure credit (2016 proforma underlying: £1.4m). As this is 
effectively a taxable grant, it is booked within Vectura’s operating 
loss and is subject to taxation in the normal manner. Following 
the Skyepharma merger, Vectura is no longer eligible to receive 
cash tax credits under the small and medium enterprises R&D 
tax credit scheme. 
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets
The 2017 reported amortisation charge of £109.7m includes an £8.7m 
charge for impairment relating to the VR2076 intangible asset 
following Mundipharma’s decision to terminate this development 
programme. As expected, the 2017 charge is significantly higher 
than the prior nine-month period which only included approximately 
six and half months of amortisation for the Skyepharma intangibles 
(£64.0m). Intangible assets recognised from the Skyepharma and 
Activaero combinations will continue to be amortised over their 
remaining useful lives. As underlying financial information excludes 
acquisition accounting adjustments, there is no amortisation charge 
included in either the 2017 or 2016 underlying financials. 
Exceptional items
Adjusted EBITDA and underlying adjusted EBITDA are stated before 
exceptional items.
A total net exceptional charge of £4.5m was recognised in the 2017 
reported financial results (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: 
£9.4m charge).
Exceptional costs recognised during 2017 comprise £4.5m of 
post-merger integration costs, £1.8m for the progression of legal 
proceedings against GSK to enforce Vectura's patents in respect 
of the Ellipta
®
 products and £0.8m of restructuring costs at the 
Group’s oral manufacturing facility in France. These costs are 
partly offset by a £0.2m credit relating to curtailments of the Swiss 
pension scheme, a £0.2m credit relating to the movement in an 
onerous lease provision in Switzerland and a £2.2m release of 
research and development accruals.
As part of the merger integration and alignment, management has 
performed a detailed review of research and development accruals 
during 2017, including historical accruals. This activity identified 
a number of individually immaterial historical accruals originally 
established based upon specific programme knowledge obtained 
from members of staff who have now left the business. It is no 
longer considered probable that these accruals will result in future 
cash outflows. The accruals, totalling £2.2m, have been released in 
the 2017 Consolidated income statement and are presented within 
exceptional items to enable users to understand the impact of the 
credit on current year performance. Management has determined that 
there is no material impact of the accruals on any comparative 
income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement.
Post-merger integration costs comprise mainly spend on projects 
required to combine the two businesses including the cost of a third 
party consultancy to harmonise ways of working and enhance 
productivity in the R&D function. In addition, these costs also 
include a share-based payment charge of £1.8m in respect of 
retention awards granted to key members of management 
considered critical to the integration process. 
To date, the Group has recognised exceptional post-merger 
integration costs totalling £8.4m net of Swiss pension curtailment 
gains. The remaining balance of the total £9m merger integration 
costs are expected to be largely incurred in 2018.
As announced in January 2018, the Group will recognise further 
exceptional costs in 2018 of approximately £0.5m related to the 
delivery of operational excellence initiatives. 
Adjusted EBITDA and underlying adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA and underlying adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS 
measures which management uses to assess the performance of 
the business.
Adjusted EBITDA of £25.8m has decreased compared to reported 
adjusted EBITDA of £34.1m for the nine-month period ended 
31 December 2016. This reduction in EBITDA is the result of increased 
R&D expenditure for the twelve-month period compared to the 
previously reported nine-month period and a change in revenue 
mix with the prior year 2016 reported numbers including £22.4m 
of non-recurring milestones and material non-recurring royalties 
from sales of Ellipta
®
 products and ADVATE
®
, which achieve a 
100% margin. 
Adjusted underlying EBITDA, which excludes the impact of material 
non-recurring revenue streams, has increased from a loss of £2.6m 
in 2016 to a profit of £10.0m. This improvement demonstrates both 
the increased underlying revenue and the significant reduction in the 
fixed cost base of the business that has been achieved through the 
delivery of merger synergies and Operational Excellence initiatives. 
As shown in note 8 to the financial statements, adjusted EBITDA 
is calculated by adjusting statutory reported operating profit for 
non-cash items such as depreciation, amortisation and share-based 
compensation and for items that are exceptional in nature and do 
not represent the underlying trends of business performance. 
Underlying adjusted EBITDA is calculated in the same way but 
based on operating profit from underlying revenues.  61 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
STRATEGIC REPORT
Share of movements in associates
The charge of £3.4m recognised in 2017 (nine-months ended 
31 December 2016: income of £0.4m) includes £1.7m for the 
Group’s share of losses of its German associate (Ventaleon GmbH) 
and £1.6m relating to the contributions necessary to finalise the 
valuation process for approval by the Chinese State authorities 
of the Group's 37.84% share in Tianjin Kinnovata Pharmaceutical 
Company Limited. 
Net finance expenses/income
Net finance costs of £2.6m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: 
net £4.0m income) in 2017 mainly comprise foreign exchange losses 
of £1.4m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £4.2m gain). 
Loss before tax
As expected, the Group’s statutory loss before tax of £102.2m has 
increased significantly compared to the prior nine-month statutory 
reporting period (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £40.1m 
loss). This is due to the discontinued royalty revenues and significant 
non-recurring milestones recognised in 2016, increased amortisation 
charges and the change in accounting reference date, as noted above.
Taxation
The Group's effective tax rate (ETR) for the year ended 31 December 
2017 is a 16.2% credit (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: 
20.0% credit). The ETR is driven by tax charges on profits in 
Switzerland (8.5% charge) and the US (inclusive of prior year 
adjustments) (42.9% charge), and a small credit in the UK on losses 
and R&D incentives. The ETR is significantly impacted by deferred 
tax credits on the amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
(17.6% credit). The expectation of the long-term trend for the 
ETR is a high-teens credit percentage rate.
Loss after tax
Loss after tax was £85.7m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: 
£32.1m loss).
Loss per share
Basic loss per share has increased to 12.6p, reflecting the reduction 
in non-recurring revenues and increased R&D and amortisation 
charges, as noted above (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: 
5.3p loss per share). 
Balance sheet
Goodwill
Goodwill of £161.4m at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£162.8m) arises from historical acquisitions. The balance is not 
amortised but subject to annual impairment testing. The movement 
in the goodwill balance compared to the prior period relates to 
foreign exchange losses recognised. 
Intangible assets
The carrying value of intangible assets at 31 December 2017 
of £335.4m (31 December 2016: £456.8m) has decreased by 
£121.4m during the period. This is due to amortisation of £101.0m, 
an £8.7m impairment charge for the acquired pMDI triple therapy 
development programme (VR2076) and £11.9m of foreign 
exchange losses. 
Property, plant and equipment
During 2017, Vectura has invested £11.7m of capital expenditure 
(nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £3.1m). This consists mainly 
of £3.8m of equipment to support the manufacture of flutiform
®
 
actuators still under construction at 31 December 2017 and a 
£3.4m investment in manufacturing equipment at the Group’s 
oral manufacturing facility, of which £2.5m is under construction 
at 31 December 2017. Construction of the actuator equipment 
is expected to complete in H2 2018 and the construction of the 
oral manufacturing equipment is expected to complete in Q1 2018. 
Once completed, both assets will become operational and will be 
reclassified to property, plant and equipment and depreciated from 
this point. 
In January 2017, the Group's £8.8m investment in expanding capacity 
of flutiform
®
 at the Sanofi manufacturing facility in Holmes Chapel, 
previously classified as an asset under construction, became 
fully operational. 
Translation reserve
In accordance with IAS 21 – Effects of Changes In Foreign Exchange 
Rates, the Group has recognised a net foreign exchange loss of 
£15.1m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £49.0m gain) 
within reserves as a result of translating overseas operations 
denominated in local currencies to the presentational currency 
of the Group.
Cash position and liquidity
Vectura continues to maintain strong liquidity with cash 
and cash equivalents at 31 December 2017 of £103.7m 
(31 December 2016: £92.5m). 
The Group generated a £26.9m cash inflow from operations 
(restated nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £19.0m inflow). 
Excluding cash flows relating to exceptional items of £5.9m 
(nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £11.9m), cash generated 
from operations was £32.8m (restated nine-months ended 
31 December 2016: £30.9m). This is higher than adjusted 
EBITDA of £25.8m due to £6.5m of working capital movements, 
plus £0.5m of non-cash items.
The Group made scheduled corporation tax payments relating to 
prior years for its US and Swiss operations of £2.9m (nine-months 
ended 31 December 2016: £2.6m). These payments were almost 
offset by cash inflows from research and development tax credits 
received of £2.1m (nine-months ended 31 December 2016: £2.4m). 
Cash outflows from investing activities were £9.5m lower 
mainly due to the merger-related outflows in the six-months 
ended 30 September 2016, partially offset by higher capital 
expenditure outflows.
On 14 November 2017 the Group commenced a £15.0m share 
buyback and cancellation programme. As at 31 December 2017, 
total cash outflows relating to this programme were £1.4m. 
The programme was completed post-period on 28 February 2018.
On 22 August 2017, HSBC Bank Plc, one of the Group's existing 
relationship banks, was added as a lender to the £50m multicurrency 
revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank PLC. This facility expires 
in August 2021 and remains undrawn.

Adjustment 1: Adjustment to present nine-month financial information on a proforma full-year calendar basis by adding in actual 
performance reported on a management accounts basis under IFRS from 1 January 2016 as if the merger had occurred on that date. 
This excludes acquisition accounting adjustments required by IFRS 3 – Business Combinations. 
Adjustment 2: In the December 2015 management accounts, certain royalties were over accrued by £2.1m with no implication on the 
twelve-month March 2016 reported IFRS results. The adjusting entry has been posted in Q1 calendar year 2016 reducing royalty revenues 
accordingly. 2016 reported proforma revenues are therefore adjusted to exclude this understatement.
Adjustment 3: Adjustment to remove non-recurring royalties from ADVATE

 from proforma underlying revenues which 
materially ceased in 2016.
Adjustment 4: Adjustment to remove milestone payments, development services revenues and non-recurring other revenues from

The change in presentation to underlying results has impacted the comparability of current year alternative performance measures with 
those disclosed in previous years. The table above reconciles “recurring revenues” disclosed in 2016 to “underlying revenues” disclosed in 
the current year financial review. Underlying revenues exclude material royalties received in 2016 from ADVATE
®
 and the Ellipta
®
 portfolio 
that did not recur to a material extent in 2017. The impact of these items distorts comparison of financial results from period to period and 
therefore can obscure trends in the underlying, recurring base of the business. The Directors consider that reporting performance on an 
underlying basis provides a more meaningful reflection of the ongoing business in both periods and is consistent with how management 
reviews the business for the purpose of making long-term operating decisions. OUR PATIENTS
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
More than 300m people living with Asthma 
and COPD respectively and significant unmet 
need remains.
“Commercial success will follow if we are genuinely 
delivering solutions to match patient need. “
Frazer Morgan — Vice President, Programme Development
The future of our business depends upon our ability to meet the 
needs of our patients and our ability to respond to changing 
dynamics in the highly complex airways disease market. 
Our areas of focus
Our patient focus drives what we do and how we do it; we are 
passionate about transforming the lives of patients with  
airways-related diseases.
How we engage
We seek to understand the needs of our patients by maintaining 
an in-depth appreciation of the continuous clinical innovation in the 
way that Asthma and COPD patients are being treated. This enables 
us to match our future pipeline to the emerging treatment 
paradigm, thus addressing unmet medical need.
We ensure that our employees understand the science behind the 
diagnosis and treatment of airways disease patients by hosting 
educational seminars with charity advocates, internal experts, 
industry experts, practitioners and patient guest speakers. 
Our development teams actively consider the needs of our patients 
throughout the development process striving to develop relevant 
products and easy-to-use device platforms to help improve 
patient compliance.
Promoting affordable quality products
Our diverse pipeline includes a number of generics programmes. 
Vectura is a responsible partner to major pharmaceutical companies 
such as Hikma which strive to reliably supply affordable, high-quality 
generic medicines to meet today’s diverse healthcare needs.
Promoting access
Vectura currently licenses its products, technologies and know-how 
to partner companies. We play an important role in improving 
access to healthcare through the development of innovative 
technologies and solutions that address major areas of unmet 
medical need; the need to improve patient compliance and 
outcomes; and reduce overall costs of healthcare. We utilise our 
development and regulatory expertise to support our partners in 
bringing the benefits of these innovative products to as many 
markets as possible, including developing economies.
We transform the lives of patients 
with airways diseases. This shared 
purpose drives our strategy and our 
behaviours set a framework for how 
we deliver our goals and measure our 
successes. Ultimately, we believe that 
how we achieve success is every bit 
as important as what we achieve. 
We assess our performance across four  
key areas: our patients, our people, our 
partners, and our local communities and 
our environment. By operating responsibly 
we will build a business that is durable in 
the long term, maximise our commercial 
success and deliver long-term value for 
our shareholders and society.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Patient safety
Although our business does not include direct marketing and sales 
to patients, patient safety is our number one priority in the development, 
testing, manufacturing and ultimate use of our products. All medicines 
have potential risks as well as benefits. Our robust policies and 
governance framework are designed to help us and our partners 
detect and act on any side effects that may be associated with our 
medicines. We always put patient safety first in the design and 
conduct of our clinical trials.
Clinical trials
Vectura has an established set of standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and policies which govern the conduct of clinical trials which 
it sponsors. These SOPs and policies ensure that Vectura-sponsored 
clinical trials are compliant with internationally recognised and 
adopted standards and with national and international legislation 
in the relevant territories. Compliance with our SOPs and policies 
is monitored and inspected on an ongoing basis by our internal 
quality assurance department.
We do not conduct animal testing in house and we have no plans 
to do so. We outsource toxicology studies which are required by 
law before human clinical trials of novel therapeutics can be 
conducted. There are a limited number of companies with the 
expertise to conduct regulatory-standard, inhalation toxicology 
studies, which are our area of focus.
Our progress in 2017
During the year we:
• hosted a live patient interview event for all staff, giving a patient 
and their physician the opportunity to explain the impact of 
severe Asthma on their lifestyle including a discussion of the 
issues and side effects of current treatments and hopes for 
future treatment options;
• hosted an internal education event for all staff focusing on 
Vectura’s pipeline, including guest key opinion leader speaker 
to discuss the treatment burden and challenges in treating 
Asthma and COPD;
• held a V2V charity cycle ride where employees cycled from our 
Gauting site to Muttenz to raise money for Asthma UK, a charity 
for which Vectura is an ambassador; and
• offered two employees the opportunity to take paid leave to 
volunteer as part of the support crew for this year’s Antonia’s 
Friends’ “Race Across America” (RAAM) event, in support 
of Asthma UK.
More than 450 talented and diverse 
employees working internationally  
across five sites.
“Everything we all do has a positive impact on 
transforming the lives of airways disease patients – 
not only does it make me want to come to work 
each day, it makes me want to go the extra mile 
in everything that I do.”
Liza Hemmings — Director, HR Operations
Our ability to deliver upon our valuable product pipeline and to 
innovate for the future is dependent upon the skills and expertise 
of our workforce. It is vital that our people are motivated to achieve 
our common goals in order to drive Vectura forwards. Each of our 
employees contributes to and shares in Vectura’s success. 
Our areas of focus
We strive to create a stimulating and rewarding place to work 
and ensure that our culture and values are a definitive expression 
of “how we do things” at Vectura. 
How we engage
Communication is part of our day-to-day operating model. Engaging 
our colleagues is a priority and it is embedded in everything we do. 
We have a number of communication channels to ensure that the 
views and needs of our employees are understood and considered 
by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board. Connecting our 
different sites through communications channels, both electronic and 
face to face, improves collaboration and integration and embraces 
diversity as well as helping to speed up internal processes.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Our employment practices
Our commitment to diversity
The diverse perspectives and experiences of our global workforce 
strengthen our business and help us meet the needs of our patients 
and other stakeholders. Vectura promotes a culture of opportunity 
for all – decisions about employment, development, promotion, pay 
and benefits are based upon ability, qualifications and performance. 
We believe in diversity in its widest sense and we have not set any 
formal diversity quotas or targets; all appointments, both internal 
and external, are ultimately made on the basis of merit. Our policies 
support the differing needs and commitments of our employees, 
with around 16% of our employees benefiting from some kind of 
flexible working practice. James Ward-Lilley, our Chief Executive 
Officer, is the Board member responsible for overseeing human 
resources and non-discrimination issues. 
We are a global organisation and want our leaders to represent 
the varied markets we serve. Four nationalities are currently 
represented on our Board of Directors. 
Employee engagement
Communication is part of our day-to-day operating model. Engaging 
our colleagues is a priority and it is embedded in everything we do. 
In an industry based upon innovation and research and development, 
our employees are our biggest asset and it is therefore critical that 
we forge strong connections through timely and meaningful 
communication; we aim to achieve this through:
• our Group-wide intranet and video information terminals, which 
we are evolving every year. Working with our employees, we 
continually strive to improve the design and effectiveness 
of communications channels across the Group;
• our Manager Forum, which enables all people managers to 
meet on a monthly basis to discuss topical items, share learnings, 
communicate updates, provide feedback on corporate initiatives 
and benefit from upskilling;
• our Employee Representative Forum of elected representatives, 
which provides a mechanism by which employees can raise 
issues that matter to them for discussion, enables employee 
feedback and facilitates the communication and dissemination 
of key information throughout the organisation;
• our all-employee quarterly business updates, hosted by members 
of the Executive Leadership Team, are used to share strategy, 
programme, people and business performance updates through 
the use of a balanced scorecard and facilitate two-way dialogue 
through Q&A;
• our business leaders’ briefing packs, which are issued post 
the Quarterly Leadership Team meetings to facilitate ongoing 
engagement via team cascade sessions, to ensure that all 
employees understand how their work contributes to the 
overall progress of Vectura; and
• our annual employee engagement survey: the 2017 annual 
survey was conducted in March 2017; 84% of employees 
responded and we received feedback indicating we are ahead 
of the comparator benchmarks (including the top 10% of 
participating companies) in the following areas:
• employees are encouraged to share their thoughts and views 
with their managers and senior leaders at my organisation; 
• my manager communicates well with me, giving me clear 
feedback on my work and performance; and
• my organisation’s values have been clearly articulated.
We use the feedback obtained from the processes and activities 
outlined above to determine key priority areas for improvement 
going forward and we regularly communicate our progress. 
We monitor our employee turnover on a monthly basis to identify 
any possible employee relations or motivational issues and to 
assist in our recruitment and resource planning. 
During 2018, we will continue to review employee communication 
channels to identify opportunities for continuous improvement.
Developing our people
Attracting and retaining skilled people with values aligned to our 
ethos is critical for the long-term sustainability of our business and 
we aim to develop and maintain a motivated and professional 
workforce. We recognise the importance of investing in our people, 
ensuring that they are equipped to deliver in their current and 
future roles within the business. 
In addition to investment in general training and development, 
Vectura offers all employees the opportunity to apply for 
scholarship funding. The Vocational Qualification Award provides 
substantial financial assistance to those who wish to pursue further 
self-development, largely in their own time. Any course that would 
significantly enhance an employee’s skills whilst benefiting Vectura 
is considered. During 2017, we have supported employees through 
MSc studies in clinical development, A Levels in chemistry and EMBAs. 
Talent management is another key component in the attraction and 
retention of motivated and highly skilled employees. On an annual 
basis, the Executive Leadership Team reviews the succession plan, 
identifying the “high potential” employees who are the future leaders 
of our business, and ensures appropriate retention, support and 
personal development planning is in place.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Rewarding our people
Remuneration plays an important role in retaining and motivating 
our people. We seek to provide well-constructed and fair reward 
systems designed to incentivise superior performance and align 
the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
and other stakeholders. The annual bonus allows us to reward 
employees for achieving and exceeding challenging corporate and 
individual objectives. In addition to our remuneration packages, 
which include a pension entitlement, permanent health insurance, 
life assurance and private medical care, all employees are given the 
opportunity to participate in our all-employee share plans. 
For more details of our all-employee share plans, please refer to the 
Remuneration Report. In addition to standard remuneration packages, 
our recognition policy acknowledges the impact and value of a 
sincere “thank you” and a series of thank you cards are available 
for employees to provide sincere appreciation to colleagues, and 
managers are also encouraged to provide low monetary value 
awards to those who go the extra mile to achieve a great outcome.
Our commitment to health and safety
We consider health and safety to be a priority in our workplaces. 
We have an established Health and Safety Committee that reviews 
health and safety standards within the organisation. The Committee 
continually monitors and reviews health and safety practices to 
ensure that health and safety management procedures are robust 
and in line with industry best practice. Annual updates are provided 
to the Board for review and additional update reports are provided 
as required. Each ELT member also receives a quarterly HSE report, 
enabling them to reinforce the importance of a strong safety culture. 
James Ward-Lilley is the Board member to whom responsibility for 
health and safety issues has been delegated.
Specialist ongoing training is provided to those individuals who are 
responsible for health and safety across the organisation. General 
health and safety training is delivered to all staff via in-house 
training sessions provided by our Health and Safety Manager 
and by e-learning courses.
Vectura has an excellent safety record and there have been no 
major incidents or accidents to report to the Health and Safety 
Executive in the United Kingdom or to the equivalent bodies in 
Germany, Switzerland or France during the period (2016: none).
Policies and practices
Our Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct documents our behavioural standards and ways 
of working. The Code of Conduct is provided in all of the principal 
languages spoken by our people, and it describes the principles, 
policies and procedures that ensure our business continues to 
operate in accordance with the requirements of our highly regulated 
industry. The Code of Conduct is applicable to all permanent and 
temporary employees and contractors and third parties we work 
with are expected to adhere to the same standards. 
Our Code of Conduct sets out Vectura’s zero tolerance attitude to 
bullying and harassment and bribery and corruption and details 
our whistleblowing policy and procedure. The Code of Conduct 
is available to all employees via our Group-wide intranet.
Anti-bribery and corruption
We have adopted a clear anti-bribery policy, which has been 
communicated to all employees so they can recognise and 
avoid the use of bribery and report any suspicion for rigorous 
investigation. Political donations are prohibited and advance 
approval from management is required before management 
and staff may accept or solicit a gift of any kind.
We do not believe that human rights issues present a significant 
issue for Vectura, but we are committed to protecting the human 
rights of our employees and the people who come into contact 
with our business.
Sales and marketing ethics
Vectura does not currently market pharmaceutical products directly 
to patients; however, we are committed to employing ethical 
marketing and sales practices. We follow the Code of Practice of 
the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), which 
governs the promotion of medicines to health professionals.
Working with suppliers
Our ethical standards are integral to our procurement and partnering 
activities and we continuously monitor compliance through 
assessments and improvement programmes. We have a highly 
regulated vendor selection process, which includes evaluating 
prospective suppliers’ technical capability and a full audit of their 
quality systems to ensure compliance with appropriate quality 
and safety standards.
Manufacturing compliance
Vectura manufacturing and laboratory facilities are subject to regular 
inspection by relevant regulatory authorities. These inspections have 
not revealed any major instances of non-compliance at any of our sites.
Our progress in 2017
Vectura has a talented workforce with an invaluable diversity of 
skills, knowledge and experience. Following the 2016 merger with 
Skyepharma, we undertook a Group-wide project to identify, 
articulate and deliver our shared cultures and value. 
During the year we:
• worked across the Group to develop and articulate our shared 
culture, with high levels of participation and feedback from our 
employees achieved through surveys, workshops and an online 
digital discussion forum;
• hosted a Group-wide “AsOne” event to launch new culture and 
values with subsequent roll-out of materials and supporting 
tools across all sites to support consistency of understanding 
and behaviour;
• launched a new reward framework across all sites which 
includes career development paths so that all our employees 
can understand how their role fits into the wider organisation 
and clearly see their opportunities for development;
• launched a Recognition Scheme and Performance Management 
system that is fully aligned and supportive of our newly 
articulated values and culture; and
• developed and delivered a new Leadership Development 
Programme which equips leaders at all levels within our 
organisation with the skills and knowledge to lead their teams 
effectively and in accordance with our defined culture. 68 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Over ten active partnerships and 20  
revenue-generating in-market assets. 
“We build collaborations and alliances every day and 
everywhere. It makes us strong when we use the 
knowledge and experience of all our team members… 
it has helped us find solutions for difficult challenges.”
 
Vectura has developed and maintains a partnering model for its 
generic development programmes and certain Vectura enhanced 
delivery programmes. In order for this model to continue to be 
successful, Vectura needs to meet the changing scientific and 
operational needs of its wide partnership base, enabling the best 
outcomes for programmes and patients.
Our areas of focus
We strive for a culture of scientific and Operational Excellence 
and invest in our intellectual property portfolio and our device, 
development and formulation capabilities.
How we engage
We routinely establish industry standard management and governance 
process for our partnerships and then maintain close working 
relationships with our partners, ensuring regular feedback and 
dialogue to enable us to continue to deliver against our partners' 
needs and expectations. We continue to invest in our people, our 
IP and our core capabilities and technologies to maintain our broad 
integrated drug delivery platform offering, leaving Vectura uniquely 
placed as a key partner within the industry. 
Our progress in 2017
Our partnerships continue to make significant contributions to 
our business. To support systematic and continuous improvement 
in the performance of our partnerships during 2017 we designed 
and undertook a health check survey for use with partners. 
This scheme was piloted with a major partnership; we engaged 
with all key personnel across the partnership to assess how 
important behaviours are to supporting progress of the relationship. 
The analysis of the survey allowed us to jointly understand areas 
that are working well and where improvement should be targeted. 
Joint workshops allowed us to share the results with the team and 
to identify specific actions to progress the partnership more effectively. 
This process will be repeated at appropriate intervals and we intend 
to roll this approach out across other selected partnerships and 
alliances during 2018. 
On an ongoing basis we also use a “scorecard” where key attributes 
of the partnership – Strategic, Financial/Resources, Operational 
and Relational – are summarised, scored and tracked. This 
allows the governance teams (project teams and Joint Steering 
Committees) to easily track and measure progress of the project 
and partnership performance.
As a responsible business, we are committed 
to having a long-term positive impact within 
our local communities and to minimising our 
long-term impact on the environment. 
Our areas of focus
We maintain close relationships with our local universities, 
support our employees in local and national charity endeavours 
and monitor the carbon footprint of our organisation. 
How we engage
Vectura has always sought to foster close working relationships 
with universities close to our R&D sites. We believe that bringing 
placement students into our premises is an essential mechanism 
via which we can give students direct exposure to the world of 
work and, in so doing, we are contributing to developing the next 
generation of pharmaceutical scientists, creating potential future 
permanent employees and helping to support the local academic 
community. In addition to this, Vectura also supports a number 
of academic collaborations with universities developing novel drug 
delivery technologies of interest in the field of pulmonary delivery.
We support the communities within which we operate by providing 
high-quality employment opportunities, supporting charitable social 
engagement and local volunteering. Our employees, particularly 
those on our Green Action Team, are committed to reviewing Vectura’s 
impact on the environment over the long term and proposing 
energy reduction initiatives where appropriate. We offer our UK 
employees the opportunity to participate in a cycle to work scheme 
and encourage car sharing where possible.
Our progress in 2017
One of the most significant impacts that we can have within our 
local communities is to continue to provide high-quality employment 
opportunities and to develop therapies to help patients with 
airways-related diseases.
We are proud to have a highly creative and active Social Committee 
which initiates a calendar of social and charitable events each year. 
With a dedicated budget, this team is empowered to organise 
engaging and rewarding activities to raise money for local charities, 
as well as facilitating our support of nationwide charity campaigns 
such as Comic Relief, the BBC Children in Need appeal and Macmillan 
as well as local charities nominated by our employees. Wherever

STRATEGIC REPORT
Our carbon footprint
The Group is committed to protecting the environment in all areas 
of our operations, including undertaking initiatives to effectively 
manage and reduce waste throughout the organisation.
We aim to foster a positive attitude towards the environment 
among employees and to raise employee awareness of responsible 
environmental practices at all sites operated by the Group. The 
Group endeavours to ensure compliance with all relevant legislation 
and regulatory requirements as a minimum. Andrew Derodra, 
Chief Financial Officer, has responsibility for reporting on relevant 
environmental matters to the Board. There have been no reportable 
incidents in 2017 at any of the Group’s sites.
Due to the nature of our activities, Vectura considers that it has 
a low environmental impact. However, we remain committed to 
minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and 
actively seek to make energy savings in a way that is beneficial for 
the environment and cost effective for the business. Vectura has 
a Green Action Team which has responsibility to pursue initiatives 
for environmental sustainability and carbon reduction.
Our environmental initiatives 
Vectura has adopted and maintains a number of specific 
environmental initiatives.
Energy efficiency
• It is our policy that when an existing light unit requires 
replacement it is replaced with an LED light. The LED lights 
installed are up to four times more energy efficient than the 
traditional light units that they replace. The majority of the 
lighting at our Chippenham site is now LED.
• Passive infrared light sensors are installed in many general work 
areas. This ensures that lighting is not left on in work areas that 
are not currently in use.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Vectura reports greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 
2013 (“the Regulations”).
Emissions data is reported using a financial control approach to define our reporting boundary, which meets the requirements of the Regulations 
in respect of those emissions for which we are responsible. The information is presented for a twelve-month period. Emissions have been 
measured for all sites except for our office in London as it is considered to be negligible for these purposes. The amounts shown below for 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are those required to be reported under the Regulations.

last year.

Dear Shareholder 
The Board continues to focus on enhancing the corporate culture of 
the enlarged Group and is committed to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance, which we believe are integral to the 
long-term success of Vectura and its purpose of transforming the 
lives of airways disease patients. During the year the Group has 
continued to develop Vectura’s strategy by strengthening senior 
management, so that the core values of the Board are communicated 
throughout the Company, and by management being rewarded on 
the basis of achieving its objectives aligned to this strategy. Maintaining 
the development of good governance throughout the Group is a high 
priority and the Company continues to take advice from leading 
governance advisors. Details of our Executives’ remuneration is 
provided in the Directors’ remuneration report and the following 
report explains more about how Vectura’s corporate governance 
is embedded in the Company.
UK Corporate Governance Code
In relation to compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Board considers that it has complied in full with the applicable 
version (2016). Further information on areas that the Board 
discussed as part of its determination are set out below.
Board composition and evaluation
The Board acknowledges that some shareholders have raised issues 
regarding the independence of Frank Condella (Vice Chairman) and 
Susan Foden (Chair of the Remuneration Committee and SID), based 
on their respective lengths of service, which in Frank’s case was on 
the Boards of Skyepharma and Vectura and in Susan’s case on the 
Board of Vectura. Frank has been a Non-Executive Director since the 
merger with Skyepharma in 2016 and, prior to that, he was chairman 
of Skyepharma and including his service at Skyepharma, he has been 
a Director since 2006. Sue has been a Non-Executive Director of 
Vectura since January 2007. 
Dr. Thomas Werner also joined the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director in June 2016 as a result of the merger 
with Skyepharma and will have completed nine years’ service in 
aggregate in May 2018. Dr. Werner has not served concurrently 
with any Executive Director for more than six years. Thomas has 
over 30 years of Pharmaceutical business experience gained from 
appointments in a wide range of pharmaceutical companies and 
investment funds. The skills and experience, particularly of the 
European respiratory markets and investment environment, 
which Thomas brings are of great benefit to the Board.
It continues to be the belief of the other Board members that 
Frank, Sue and Thomas are fully independent in thought and action 
in terms of their participation in Board and Committee meetings, 
and they have the full support of the other Board members in the 
activities they undertake. The Company is aware that the proposed 
revised Corporate Governance Code reflects a more specific view 
on the maximum nine-year term and this will be taken into account in 
respect of the Board’s composition. It is, however, difficult with a 
Introduction  
from the Chairman
During the year the Group has 
continued to develop V ectura’s 
strategy by strengthening 
senior management, so that 
the core values of the Board are 
communicated throughout the 
Company , and by management 
being rewarded on the basis of 
achieving its objectives aligned 
to this strategy .

Chairman 71 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
GOVERNANCE
smaller Board to find candidates of suitable expertise to provide 
for effective succession planning and the Board feels that more 
flexibility in this respect is in the best interests of the shareholders. 
Following a search in 2017, an additional independent Non-Executive 
Director, Juliet Thompson, was appointed in December to supplement 
the skill and experience of the Board and to work towards ensuring 
successful succession planning for the future.
We can confirm that Frank stood down from the Audit Committee 
following the 2017 AGM and Dr Thomas Werner was appointed to 
the Nomination Committee to satisfy the requirement for a majority 
of independent NEDs on that Committee. In addition, following her 
appointment to the Board, Juliet was appointed as a member of 
both the Audit and Remuneration Committees in December 2017.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and as 
advised in last year’s report, an externally facilitated evaluation was 
carried out in 2017 by Independent Audit Limited (IAL), a company 
which has no other connection with Vectura. This year a review of 
effectiveness was carried out internally using IAL’s online governance 
assessment service and questionnaires were completed by all Directors. 
The results were based on self-assessment and, although collated 
by IAL, were not verified by them.
Board diversity
Juliet Thompson’s appointment has taken the Board closer to its 
diversity targets under the Hampton-Alexander Review. In addition, 
her appointment supplements the skills and experience of the 
existing Board. We are continuing to focus on Board composition 
and succession matters and the Board has retained an external 
consultancy, which is actively recruiting a further independent 
Non-Executive Director to join the Board during the course of the 
2018. The parameters of the search include Board diversity and 
expertise in the US marketplace as two major items. This individual 
will replace Frank Condella, the only Board member currently with 
this critical in-market US expertise, in due course and following 
a suitable handover period. On the assumption that this search 
is successful in finding the appropriate candidate, there will then 
be a total of ten Board members, three of which will be women. 
Even prior to Frank stepping down, this will enable us to meet 
the Hampton-Alexander requirements at Board level.
In terms of the next level of management, our Executive Leadership 
Team, excluding Executive Directors, totalled seven, of which 
there were two female members and we therefore met the 
Hampton-Alexander objective. At the business leadership level, 
the total number was 41, of which 18 were female. As highlighted 
in the Hampton-Alexander Review in November 2017, the Group 
has already achieved the target female representation at Leadership 
Team level of 41.9%, resulting in the Group being highlighted in 
the review as being in the top ten best performers.
As a Board, our strategy will be to maintain and improve these 
levels so that the objectives of the Hampton-Alexander Review 
continue to be met and maintained by 2019. 
Vectura believes in a diverse and gender-balanced workforce 
and is committed to creating a rewarding and stimulating place to 
work and one which embraces diversity throughout all levels of the 
organisation. At this time the Company is not required to report on 
gender pay but a copy of the Group’s policy will be available on the 
website in future.
Internal control and external audit tender
In relation to the appropriateness of the Company’s systems 
of internal control, the Board, as part of its deliberations, again 
considered whether there should be a separate internal audit 
function. The Board considered that, at this time, the financial 
controls and management oversight provided are appropriate 
for a company of Vectura’s size and complexity. This will continue 
to be reviewed annually.
As recommended by the Audit Committee last year it was considered 
appropriate to tender the provision of the external audit as the 
existing incumbent had been in the post for ten years. This process 
resulted in KPMG LLP being appointed and this appointment was 
approved by shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
A resolution to reappoint KPMG as auditor will be put to the 2018 
Annual General Meeting for approval.
The Board spent time considering the Group’s strategy 
going forward, its development pipeline, projects, markets 
and technological developments. In terms of governance, it 
also reviewed matters reserved to the Board, Market Abuse 
Regulation and anti-slavery requirements in order to ensure 
that the Company is compliant and also that the governance 
framework is appropriate.
Statement of compliance with the Code
The following sections contain an explanation of how good governance 
has been embedded into the larger Vectura Group including the 
Group’s reporting disclosures on corporate governance required 
by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(available on the FRC website, www.frc.org.uk), including how the 
main principles and supporting principles have been applied, and 
the UKLA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7, including the 
required statement of compliance.
I am pleased to confirm that the Board considers that it has 
been in compliance with the Code throughout the period ended 
31 December 2017. It further considers that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.

developing strategy and challenging the Executive Management 
appropriately and constructively.
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success 
of the Company, its governance and internal controls and is 
accountable for its activities. The Board reviews the operational

Board meetings
The Board meets ordinarily between six and eight times a year 
and ad hoc as required. In the twelve-months to 31 December 2017, 
in addition to seven scheduled formal Board meetings which were 
held, there were six ad hoc meetings held by telephone to discuss 
specific topics. 
Attendance at formal pre-scheduled Board and Committee 
meetings is set out in the table below.

Attendance above is in relation to members of the Board/Committees. Other Directors and Senior Executives may attend by invitation 
but their attendance is not recorded in the table.
At each formal meeting the Board considers reports on the key 
activities of the Group and reports from the Chairs of the Audit, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committees as appropriate. It also 
received information on important forthcoming events and received 
reports on investor relations, legal affairs and environment and 
health and safety matters. The Board regularly receives papers 
and presentations from senior management, which gives the Board 
the opportunity to meet Executives below Board level. In addition, 
there was a two-day Board meeting to focus on strategic 
development, looking at the Group’s longer-term horizon.
The Non-Executive Directors held meetings without management 
present after each Board meeting and, in addition, met in early 2018 for 
a routine meeting led by the Senior Independent Director to review the 
performance of the Chairman during the year, including the leadership of 
the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman, with assistance 
from the General Counsel and Company Secretary, is responsible 
for the governance arrangements including meeting agendas, timely 
information flows and dialogue between Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors encouraging an open and supportive culture. 
Executive Leadership Team 
The Board delegates day-to-day management of the Group to the 
Chief Executive and his team. The Executive Leadership Team (ELT) 
supports the Chief Executive and is accountable for delivery of the 
strategy adopted by the Board. The ELT consisted during the period 
of the Executive Directors, the General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
the Executive Vice President – Pharmaceutical Development, the 
Chief Medical Officer and Executive Vice President – Development, 
the Executive Vice President – Oral Business, the Executive Vice 
President – Commercial and Business Development, and Executive 
Vice President – Operations and the Executive Vice President – 
Human Resources. Two of the members were women. In July 2017 
Anthony Fitzpatrick joined the ELT. 
Risk
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management 
process. Responsibility for its implementation is delegated to the 
Chief Executive and ELT members. The Board outlines the general 
level of risk which is acceptable and has a considered approach 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 77 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
GOVERNANCE
to evaluating risk and reward, promoting a risk-aware culture 
throughout the business. 
The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Group and has also conducted an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the systems of internal control during the period. 
Risk management and internal control is a continuous process and 
has been considered by the Board on a regular basis, noting that it 
currently does not consider that a separate internal audit function is 
required for the business. 
The Board’s considerations include identifying and evaluating principal 
risks and the control strategies developed to mitigate these. The 
Board promotes the development of a strong control culture within 
the business and the Audit Committee regularly reviews the financial 
and operational controls, including in relation to the financial 
reporting process, reporting to the Board as appropriate.
Further information on the principal risks and the Group’s system 
of risk management is contained in the Strategic report on pages 
48 to 54.
Induction and development and information flows
New Directors receive formal induction training, including site visits 
and meetings with the Company’s advisors, brokers, auditor and 
major shareholders, and ongoing training is encouraged and provided 
upon request and as appropriate. This training is customised for 
each Director and varies depending upon their skills, experience 
and background.
Directors also received regular updates on changes and developments 
in the business, legislative and regulatory environments. During the 
period, the Board received updates on the Market Abuse Regulation 
and its impact on the Company and requirements for Directors; 
the anti-bribery and anti-slavery policies were reviewed by the 
Board during the period. Each board pack contains a copy of the 
Directors’ statutory duties. Directors are encouraged to discuss with 
the Chairman any further training requirements which they feel are 
needed. This is included in the discussions held during the annual 
performance evaluation. 
Good information flows between the Board and management 
are essential for effective governance together with senior 
management to ensure: that the agendas are appropriate for the 
business and are forward looking as well as providing historical 
and current results data; that papers are of an appropriate length 
and content for the Non-Executive Directors in particular to be 
able to understand and review; and that sufficient time is given 
for Directors to read and review the papers prior to meetings. 
To give time for such review, papers are typically sent out, usually 
electronically, one week before the meeting to give an opportunity 
to clarify any points before the meeting and to prepare questions 
and observations of the matter at the meeting.
Board evaluation
In accordance with the Code requirements and following last year’s 
external evaluation carried out in conjunction with Independent 
Audit Limited (IAL), the Board has this year undertaken a review of 
effectiveness with the assistance of IAL, using their online governance 
assessment service to review the role of the Board and its Committees. 
In addition, Sue Foden, in her capacity as SID, has conducted a review 
of the Chairman’s role by interviewing and discussing his position 
with the Non-Executive members of the Board. 
The Chairman and the Board discussed the results of the review 
at the March 2018 Board meeting. The resulting summary provided 
suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the Board and these 
are being reviewed. These included, for example: providing exposure 
to a wider range of Senior Executives and management outside 
Board meetings to create enhanced interaction between the Board 
and management, a better understanding of how technology 
drives strategy and improvements to response planning.
The Board as stated will also spend further time on succession 
planning and diversity of Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board looks forward to developing plans and taking action 
to implement and expand on recommendations made by this 
review and will further report on developments in the future.
Register of conflicts and time commitments
The Board formally considers any potential conflicts between a 
Director and the Company. Any situational conflicts must be notified 
to the Board for authorisation as and when they arise, notwithstanding 
a Director’s general duty to avoid such conflicts. Transactional 
conflicts must be notified to the Board in person or in writing at 
the next meeting, where the Board can decide, in the absence of 
the Director concerned, whether or not to authorise such conflict. 
If such conflict is approved, depending on the matter, action would 
be taken; for example, the Director concerned may not receive 
related Board papers, be present in the Board meeting for any 
related discussion or participate in any vote on the matters 
concerned. At no time during the period did any Director hold a 
material interest in any contract of significance with the Company 
or any of its subsidiaries, other than service contracts and 
insurance and indemnification arrangements.
Prior to finalising an appointment, a new Director is required to 
confirm his existing appointments and discuss the time commitment 
required to deal appropriately with the affairs of the Group. At each 
Board meeting, Directors are requested to inform the Board if there 
are any changes in their commitments or other appointments. 
Significant changes in a Director’s outside commitments are discussed 
with the Board prior to a Director accepting further appointments. 
No transactional conflicts arose in the period and no further actions 
were required following changes in Board members’ commitments.
Policy on other appointments
The Board believes that Directors should be able to accept other 
appointments where no significant actual or potential conflicts of 
interest arise and provided that the Director is able to maintain their 
time commitments to the Company. These other appointments 
enable Directors to develop further skills and experience from 
which the Company benefits, provided that such commitments 
do not impinge on their duties to the Company.
Details of any appointments held by each Director are listed under 
their biographies on pages 72 to 75. There are no significant actual 
or potential conflicts of interest arising from any appointments 
held by Directors. Their commitments were reviewed at each 
Board meeting. Although no Executive Director held an external 
non-executive position, this would be considered as part of their 
future development. 78 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Board Committees
There are three main Committees, all of which operate within 
written terms of reference. The terms of reference are available on 
the Company website (www.vectura.com). Details of attendance at 
Board and Committee meetings in 2017 can be found in the table 
on page 76.
Remuneration Committee 
The following were members of the Committee: Susan Foden 
(Chair), Bruno Angelici, Neil Warner and Thomas Werner. 
Juliet Thompson joined the Committee on 20 December 2017. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer may be 
invited to attend Committee meetings, other than when their own 
remuneration is discussed. No Director is involved in deciding his 
own remuneration. The General Counsel and Company Secretary 
acted as Secretary of the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee’s full report appears on pages 84 to 
104. 
Audit Committee
The following were members of the Audit Committee: Neil Warner 
(Chair), Per-Olof Andersson and Thomas Werner. Juliet Thompson 
joined the Committee on 1 December 2017.
The Committee continued to meet the UK Corporate Governance 
Code’s requirements that at least one member should have recent and 
relevant financial experience and that, as a body, the Committee 
has sufficient experience relevant to the pharmaceutical business 
sector. Mr Warner is considered as having recent and relevant 
financial experience being a chartered accountant and a current 
and past chairman of other listed company audit committees and 
has previously been finance director of a listed company. 
In order to facilitate good information flows and provide challenge 
where appropriate, the Committee invited the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel and Company Secretary, 
the Group Financial Controller and senior representatives of the 
external auditor to attend. The Committee held regular discussions 
with the external auditor independently of Group management. 
The General Counsel and Company Secretary acted as Secretary 
to the Committee.
The Audit Committee’s report including a review of its activities 
in the period is on pages 80 to 83.
Nomination Committee
The following were members of the Committee: Bruno Angelici 
(Chair), Per-Olof Andersson, Frank Condella, Susan Foden and 
Thomas Werner. The General Counsel and Company Secretary 
acted as Secretary to the Committee. 
Its work and activities are further described in its report on page 79.
Relations with shareholders 
Executive Management runs an extensive programme of roadshows 
and ad hoc meetings with both existing and potential new shareholders. 
In 2017, meetings were held in London and France as well as calls 
with potential investors in other countries. Executive Management 
also presented regularly at investor and industry conferences. Both 
the Chairman and Senior Independent Director have held meetings 
with shareholders independently of Executive Directors during the 
year and are regularly available for such meetings if requested.
The Company holds regular Capital Markets Days with analysts 
and institutional investors and holds updates post-results. These 
provide a detailed review of the Group’s development pipeline 
as well as an update of the progress of the Group’s key growth 
drivers and strategy. The Board also receives regular updates from 
its brokers on the views of shareholders about the Company and 
its market to ensure that the Non-Executive Directors in particular 
gain an understanding of the views of major shareholders about 
the Company.
The Company welcomes dialogue with investors, including retail 
investors, for which the AGM is an opportunity to meet with the 
Directors and put questions to the Board.
Going concern and viability assessment
Vectura’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position, are provided in 
the Strategic report. The Strategic report also describes the Group’s 
financial position, cash flows and borrowing facilities, with further 
information provided in the financial statements. The Directors 
consider that, having reviewed current performance and forecasts 
for the Group, they have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly Vectura continues to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. 
In relation to the Company’s viability, the Directors have examined 
the prospects of the Company and the Group and consider that, 
in accordance with the Code, a three-year assessment period is 
appropriate being significantly longer than twelve-months but 
providing some certainty. In considering the appropriate time period, 
the Audit Committee and Board took into account the risks facing 
the Group, its forecasting period and business plans.
Further information and the Company’s full Statement of viability 
and going concern is contained on page 55. 79 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee during the period consisted of 
Bruno Angelici (Chair), Per-Olof Andersson, Frank Condella, 
Susan Foden and Thomas Werner. A copy of the Committee’s 
terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
Review of the period
The Nomination Committee has continued to work throughout 
the year on the search for new Non-Executive Directors to supplement 
the skill and experience of the Board and to ensure that the appropriate 
succession planning in respect of the longest serving Non-Executive 
Board Directors was in place. The search, which included consideration 
of diversity, Board composition and succession planning, was carried out 
with the assistance of external search consultancy Odgers Berndtson, 
a company which has no other connection with the Group and 
resulted in the appointment of Juliet Thompson in December 2017, 
which took the Board closer to the diversity targets under 
the Hampton-Alexander Review.
A further search is being undertaken in 2018 with external 
assistance and, if an appropriate candidate can be identified, 
a further additional female appointment will be made. At that 
point, the Board representation percentage of at least 33% 
female membership will have been achieved. It is anticipated 
that, subject to a suitable handover period, Frank Condella 
will step down from the Board in due course.
As highlighted in the Hampton-Alexander Review in November 2017, 
the Group has already achieved the target female representation at the 
Leadership Team level of 41.9% and the Company was highlighted in 
the review report to be in the top ten best performers for this measure.
The Committee recommends the election of Juliet Thompson and the 
re-election of all Directors standing for re-election at the 2018 AGM.

Bruno Angelici AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Changes to the composition of the Audit Committee are set out 
in the Corporate governance report. 
Main activities of the Committee
During the period, and through to the finalisation of the report and 
accounts for the year to 31 December 2017, the main activities and 
principal issues considered by the Audit Committee were as follows: 
FRC review of the Vectura’s Report and Accounts 
to 31 December 2016
In October 2017, Vectura received a query from the UK Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC) concerning the following matters arising from 
the FRC’s review of the December 2016 Report and Accounts (R&A):
1.  Presentation of the IFRS loss within the Strategic report and 
compliance surrounding the usage of non-GAAP alternative 
performance measures (APMs) with the European Securities 
and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines.
2.  Accounting for merger-related transaction costs and cash flows, 
specifically the recognition of stamp duty payable on the share 
for share exchange within equity and the presentation of 
acquisition-related costs as investing activities in the cash flow.
The Committee reviewed all correspondence between Vectura and 
the FRC.
In respect of item (1), Vectura clarified that as a result of the scale 
and mid-year timing of the Skyepharma merger and shortened 
nine-month accounting period in 2016, explaining the performance 
of the Group through the usual comparison of reported GAAP numbers 
did not provide sufficient, meaningful information to a user of the 
accounts. This item has been closed with Vectura committed to (a) 
providing an explanation of the IFRS loss earlier in the strategic report 
and (b) continuing to monitor and improve disclosures on APMs against 
emerging best practice.
In respect of item (2), the FRC agreed with the undertaking to restate 
the Consolidated cash flow statement for the nine-month period ended 
31 December 2016. The adjustments are explained in note 30 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regarding the stamp duty recorded in equity, The FRC agreed 
not to take further action in view of the fact that the amount is 
not material. 
In their communication with the Group, the FRC also highlighted 
key themes for 2017/2018 reporting and made specific observations 
where the Group should consider improvements to its future 
reporting. The Committee reviewed and agreed with the proposed 
changes in respect of these themes and observations.
The FRC’s enquiries regarding the above matters are now complete.
The FRC’s review is limited to the published 2016 Annual Report 
and Accounts; it does not benefit from a detailed understanding 
of underlying transactions and provides no assurance that the 
report and accounts are correct in all material respects.
Carefully monitoring  
reporting and transition
The Committee’s focus this 
year has been on ensuring 
that the Group’s half year and 
annual financial statements 
for 2017 are fair, balanced and 
understandable, the impact 
of new accounting standards 
as well as the audit tender 
process and ensuring a 
successful and smooth 
transition to KPMG LLP .

Review of critical areas of accounting judgement and estimates 
The Committee reviewed the following matters of judgement and 
estimates considered critical to the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses. These included but were not 
limited to: 
• Critical estimate – intangibles impairment: the Committee reviewed 
management’s assessment of the indicators of impairment for 
the Group’s intangible assets. Where impairment indicators had 
been identified, the Committee concurred that the key assumptions 
used to assess their recoverable amounts were appropriate. 
The impairment of the VR2076 intangible asset resulting from the 
decision by Mundipharma to cease development was noted as 
well as the acceleration of amortisation of the VR876 intangible 
to fully write down the asset following receipt of the launch 
milestone in April 2017. The Committee also reviewed the sensitivity 
analyses to the impairment tests and the associated disclosures 
provided in note 16, noting that the carrying value of the 
flutiform
®
 intangible was particularly sensitive to impairment. 
• Critical judgement – revenue recognition: significant judgement 
can be required to determine the appropriate period in which to 
recognise milestone revenues. In the current period, the recognition 
of milestone revenues was not considered contentious and the 
Committee concurred that revenue recognised in the period is 
appropriate. The Committee noted that accrued royalty income 
at the balance sheet date had been adjusted for material differences 
to partner royalty statements received post 31 December. No 
matters were brought to the attention of the Committee relating 
to the completeness of flutiform
®
 product supply sales in 2017. 
• Critical estimate – useful economic lives of intangible assets: the 
Committee considered the useful economic lives of the Group’s 
on-market intangible assets and concurred with the assessment 
of average patent lives in the applicable territories for each 
intangible. The Committee also reviewed the useful economic 
lives of the smart nebuliser based technology assets following 
the recent change in the Group strategy and agreed with the 
assessments made. 
• Critical estimate – measurement of deferred tax liabilities: 
the Committee noted that the balances are particularly sensitive 
to any future tax reform noting that as this has not yet been 
enacted, the current rates are reasonable and consistent.
• Critical judgement – uncertain tax position: the Committee 
considered external professional advice and management’s 
judgement in respect of uncertainty from utilisation of tax losses 
claimed in an overseas jurisdiction. The Committee concurred 
with the position taken in the tax filings to date and the level 
of the provision held in the Consolidated balance sheet. 
• Critical estimate – actuarial assumptions on Swiss pension 
benefits: the Committee reviewed and agreed with the actuarial 
assumptions used by management having received advice from 
a local pension expert. 
• Critical estimate – impairment of parent company’s investments 
in subsidiary undertakings: the assets of the parent company 
include the investments in Germany (from the Activaero acquisition 
in 2014) and Switzerland and the US (from the Skyepharma merger 
in 2016). As these investments are not amortised, their carrying 
values are at risk of impairment. Although no impairment has 
been identified, the Committee noted that any significant diminution 
in expected value from these recent investments would result in 
impairment. In particular, the Committee observed that the carrying 
value of the investment in Germany is sensitive to the outcome 
of the VR475 (FAVOLIR
®
) Phase III study and VR647 (SCIPE) Phase II 
study scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018. 
Review of goodwill for impairment
The key assumptions used to support the carrying value of goodwill 
for each of the Group’s cash generating units (CGUs) was challenged 
by the Committee noting that headroom had decreased for all cash 
generating units versus the prior year. The reason for this reduction 
in headroom for the UK CGU was largely the result of the delay in 
approval for VR315 US for the single CGU for the UK and Germany 
and headroom for the Swiss CGU was impacted by the decision 
by Mundipharma to cease development of VR2076 and lower 
a forecast contribution from flutiform
®
. The Committee agreed 
with the conclusion that no impairment was required.
New accounting standards
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of the impact 
of IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and approved the recommendation 
to early adopt the standard for the Group’s 2017 financial statements. 
The project to assess the impact of IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers on the Group’s contractual arrangements with its 
customers has been substantial and complex. The Committee 
received regular updates on this project and concurred with the 
judgements and preliminary conclusions. 
In light of the improvement areas highlighted in the FRC Summary of key 
developments for 2017/2018 annual reports, the Committee considered 
the disclosures concerning the adoption of IFRS 15, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16 
and concluded that sufficient information is provided to users. 82 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
The Committee noted the challenge in providing an understandable 
assessment of performance in 2017 due to the distortions in the 
comparative 2016 period comprising the merger, the change in 
accounting reference date plus two material royalty streams ceasing 
in 2016. This was added to by the matter raised by the FRC above 
and the need to improve compliance with the ESMA guidelines. 
Alongside input from the Group’s brokers, the Committee agreed 
with the need to provide proforma information for 2016 as well as 
other APMs to assist users in understanding 2017 performance.
In addition to the annual reporting being understandable, the 
Committee considered the annual report to be fair and balanced. 
The report acknowledges the challenges from the delay in approval 
of VR315 (US) amongst others as well as the strengths and 
opportunities of the Group. 
Going concern and viability 
The Audit Committee reviewed management’s assessment of going 
concern and viability provided in the Risk management and internal 
control section of this report. Specifically, the Committee considered 
that the three-year viability period and stress tests applied to 
assessing viability was appropriate. 
Audit tender
As highlighted in the Corporate Governance report, an audit tender 
process was initiated by the Committee at the start of 2017. The 
process was mandatory due to the incumbent reaching the ten 
year limit. This was a significant undertaking for the Committee, 
supported by management, and concluded with the appointment 
of KPMG LLP. 
A number of firms were approached to tender for the audit including 
some firms outside the Big Four. The criteria for the firms approached 
was based upon their experience, pharmaceutical expertise, their 
ability to perform the audit to a high standard and any pre-existing 
business relationships that might affect their independence. Six firms 
were approached and three were shortlisted. Each was given 
access to Directors and Management, including meetings with the 
Executive Directors, relevant members of the Executive Leadership 
and Finance Teams, before presenting to the Audit Committee, 
Chief Financial Officer and Group Financial Controller. Two firms 
were recommended by the Committee to the Board for consideration 
with KPMG LLP proposed as the preferred firm based on the results 
of the tender. The Board and subsequently shareholders at the 
May 2017 AGM, approved the appointment of KPMG LLP. 
Following their appointment, the Committee has monitored the 
progress of KPMG against their transition plan and reviewed their 
proposed audit strategy and approach including their identification 
of significant risks and their determination of materiality. 
Independence and non-audit services performed  
by the external auditor
For the audit of the twelve-month period, the non-audit services 
performed by KPMG related to the review of the Group’s Interim 
Financial Report and the provision of liquidation services for a 
number of dormant entities as part of a project to streamline 
the Group’s corporate structure post the Skyepharma merger. 
The Committee assessed the threats to KPMG’s independence 
from providing these services and the safeguards applied to 
mitigate or eliminate these threats. 
KPMG’s fees for non-audit services equated to 20% of the fees 
earned in respect of its audit work in 2017. The Committee has 
considered the level of non-audit service fees and concurred 
with KPMG that they did not impact independence.
At both the half year and the full year, KPMG confirmed that 
its independence and objectivity have been maintained.
Committee evaluation
Following last year’s evaluation carried out by an external party, 
Independent Audit Limited (IAL), an internal review of the Board and 
its Committees has been carried out in 2017 using questionnaires. 
The results from this exercise demonstrate that the Committee is 
working well.

GOVERNANCE
Establishment and terms of reference
Under its terms of reference, the Audit Committee is constituted 
by at least three independent Non-Executive Directors. Its role and 
responsibilities are contained in the terms of reference, which are 
available on the Vectura website, www.vectura.com. 
Membership, skills, experience and training
Members of the Committee are determined by the Board, on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee, in consultation with 
the Audit Committee Chairman. When determining membership, the 
individual’s financial skills and experience and knowledge of the sector 
are of importance. The individual must bring independent thought and 
abilities to the role. As such, their previous roles and qualifications will 
have a bearing on their appointment to the Committee, together with 
the existing members, so that at least one member has recent and 
relevant financial experience and that, as a whole, the Committee has 
sufficient competence in the pharmaceutical sector that the Group 
operates in. Sufficient information to enable the Committee to 
discharge its responsibilities is made available from management and 
the Committee has access to the Company Secretary and to employees 
more widely if there are any matters for which the Committee requires 
further information. Committee members are provided with a tailored 
induction and receive updates on emerging financial and 
audit-related issues. 
Meetings
Meetings are held around the primary financial reporting periods 
and during the course of the year. Papers are provided typically 
one week before the meeting to Committee members. The Chairman 
of the Committee may hold pre-meetings to discuss matters with 
management and the external auditor as appropriate. Where possible 
there is sufficient time between the Audit Committee meeting and 
the Board meeting in order for matters to be considered and any 
further work carried out. The Committee has authority from the 
Board to seek independent advice if it wishes. 
Relationship with the Board
The Committee Chairman provides a verbal update to the Board 
following the Committee meetings. Any recommendations or further 
work required on major issues is reported in order to keep the Board 
apprised of matters within the Committee’s remit. If there is a 
disagreement between the Committee and the Board, the Committee 
can report that to shareholders in this Audit Committee report. 
Annual Reports and periodic reports
The Committee reviews and reports to the Board on significant 
financial reporting issues and judgements made in connection 
with the preparation of the financial statements, Interim Reports 
preliminary announcements and related formal statements. 
The Committee considers significant accounting policies and any 
changes to them and whether the Group has adopted appropriate 
accounting policies and, where necessary, the Group has made 
appropriate estimates and judgements.
The Committee reviews the Report and Accounts and the related 
information presented with the financial statements including the 
Strategic report and Corporate governance statement relating to 
the audit and risk management. It advises the Board on whether 
it considers that the Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and that the non-financial information 
provided is consistent with the financial statements. The Committee 
also reviews and recommends to the Board the disclosures in the 
Report and Accounts relating to internal control, risk management, 
going concern and viability statements. The Committee would also 
review, where practicable, information required for other statements 
where financial information is provided, such as a release of price 
sensitive information, prior to Board review.
Internal control and risk management systems
Whilst overall responsibility for risk management and internal 
controls systems resides with the Board, the Committee reviews 
the Group’s principal risks and internal financial controls, including 
the systems for identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring 
financial risks. Management retains responsibility for day-to-day 
oversight of the risk management and internal controls and provides 
the Committee with reports on the effectiveness of the systems. 
Internal audit 
Considering the Group’s scale, diversity, complexity, risk profile and 
controls within the Finance function, the Committee and Board do 
not believe that a separate internal audit function is required at this 
time. This remains under review and the Committee will report on 
this again to shareholders in the next Annual Report. 
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for the appointment, 
reappointment or removal of the external auditor. This includes 
determining the fee and scope of the audit and leading the tender 
process. The Committee reviews and assesses the auditor annually 
including its effectiveness when proposing to the Board whether 
shareholders should be requested to reappoint it.
The terms of engagement and fees of the external auditor 
determined by the Committee are reviewed and agreed prior to the 
start of the audit process. The scope and fee levels are considered, 
so that an appropriate, effective audit can be carried out at the fee 
level proposed. The Committee reviews the plans in place for the 
annual audit including the work plan and resources including 
seniority and expertise of the audit team. The effectiveness of the 
annual audit is assessed by the Committee including the quality of 
the audit, taking into account, for example, its quality control and 
the contribution of the auditor in relation to key judgements.
Independence, including non-audit services
The independence and objectivity of the auditor is reviewed by the 
Committee, taking into consideration relevant laws and standards. 
Any threats to independence, and appropriateness of safeguards, 
is considered with the auditor. The level of non-audit fees compared 
to audit fees is kept under review. The Committee agrees with the 
Board the Group’s policy in relation to the provision of non-audit 
services by the auditor, taking into account the relevant standard 
and legal requirements and keeping such policy under review. 
The Committee is responsible for approving non-audit services 
with the objective that the provision of such services does not 
impair the auditor’s independence or objectivity. In doing so it 
considers various factors relating to whether it is appropriate for 
the auditor to provide such service, including that the auditor’s 
skills and experience make it the most suitable supplier.
Communication with shareholders
The Committee is keen to provide shareholders with the information 
required for them to understand the process that the Committee 
has been through to achieve effective oversight of the financial 
reporting and internal controls for the Group. It is intended that 
the Chair of the Committee will attend the AGM in order to meet 
with and answer questions from shareholders relating to the 
Committee’s activities and matters within the Committee’s remit.  REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vectura’s Remuneration 
Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2017. The 
Remuneration Committee is grateful for the level of shareholder 
support for the new remuneration policy, which was put to a 
binding vote at the last AGM and received 96.56% support. 
2017 represents our first full year since the closing of the all-share 
merger with Skyepharma and is the first year of operation of the 
policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM. 
During the year, Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards of 185% 
of base salary were granted to the Executive Directors, with vesting 
subject to achievement of two performance measures, each of which 
is measured over a three-year period and subject to a two-year 
holding period following vesting. Half of the award is subject to 
relative TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
financial services and real estate sector companies). The remainder 
is subject to stretching growth in cumulative adjusted EBITDA target. 
Given the lack of clarity concerning the timing of regulatory approval 
of VR315, the Committee postponed the setting of the EBITDA 
targets and set a deadline in this regard of the final quarter 2017. 
Accordingly the targets were agreed and set in December 2017. 
In order to ensure that there was no benefit to participants based 
on any knowledge of the performance of the business in 2017, up 
to the point at which the targets were agreed, the targets were set 
based on the April 2017 management accounts and reviewed by 
the Board, updated only in respect of the Board’s expectations for 
the approval of VR315. The market was further updated of the 
regulatory status of VR315 at the start of 2018 and in line with our 
commitment to publish targets once this had occurred, we now 
disclose the relevant details in this report, which can be found on 
page 99.
As announced at last year’s AGM, Trevor Phillips stood down from 
the Board in May. In accordance with the regulations, his termination 
package is shown on page 101. These arrangements are in line 
with the remuneration policy.
Making considered and responsible  
decisions for the business
The Remuneration Committee 
is grateful for the level of 
shareholder support for the 
new Remuneration Policy 
which was put to a binding 
vote at the last AGM and 
received 96.56% support.

GOVERNANCE
Outturns for the period under review
As reported in the Financial review set out on pages 56 to 63, the 
Group has performed strongly in delivering on the synergies resulting 
from the merger and, given the delay in obtaining approval for 
VR315, has undertaken a number of initiatives to manage the 
business more efficiently. This has resulted in strong underlying 
EBITDA figures for the business excluding VR315. We have also 
delivered significant milestone achievements, including Fox capacity 
development and VR475 and VR647 clinical trials progress.
Against this backdrop the Committee considers that the remuneration 
paid to the Executive Directors, who have worked with determination 
and commitment in the face of the challenges that the Group has 
had to address, fairly reflects their performance during the year. 
The annual bonus payments to Executive Directors for the financial 
period to 31 December 2017, of between 74% and 81% of base 
salary, recognise a year of significant performance against 
a challenging backdrop. 
A detailed breakdown of the targets set and the payments awarded 
under the annual bonus scheme and the LTIP are set out on pages 98 
and 99.
LTIP awards granted in 2014 were eligible to vest during the year. 
Half of the award was subject to relative TSR performance 
measured against the FTSE SmallCap Index and half was subject 
to relative TSR performance against selected constituents of the 
Euro Stoxx Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology Index over the three 
years to 30 June 2017. TSR growth over the period did not achieve 
the median for either element and therefore none of the award 
vested. The performance period of the first tranche of the 2015 
LTIP award ended on 31 December 2017. This tranche, which 
represents 40% of the award, was subject to three-year relative 
TSR performance against FTSE 250 companies (excluding financial 
services and real estate) and selected European pharmaceutical 
peers. TSR growth over the period did not achieve the median for 
either element and therefore none of this tranche will vest on the 
vesting date in September 2018. The second and third tranches 
are subject to a five-year performance period that will end on 
31 December 2019. Vectura’s TSR is currently below median 
against both comparator groups. Further details of LTIP vesting 
against targets are set out on pages 98 and 99 of our report.
Remuneration for 2018 and beyond
The salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed early in 
December 2017 with effect from 1 January 2018. The salaries 
of James Ward-Lilley and Andrew Derodra were increased in line 
with the general workforce increase in the UK of 2.7% to £515,811 
and £357,211 respectively. 
AGM
Our Annual report on remuneration will be subject to an advisory 
vote at our forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I very much hope 
that you will join me in supporting the resolution at the AGM.
Yours sincerely

REMUNERATION REPORT
The following section sets out the remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders in a binding vote at the 2017 AGM held on 
25 May 2017. The text has been updated to reflect the passage of time and the fact that the policy has now been approved by shareholders.
This policy report can also be found in full on the Company website (www.vectura.com); it has been prepared in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (“the Regulations”). It also meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s Rules and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules. 
Directors’ remuneration policy
Vectura’s remuneration policy is driven by the Company’s strategy and business model and has been designed to reflect the Committee’s 
remuneration philosophy, as summarised below. 
Philosophy Support value creation for shareholders over the longer term and create alignment with shareholders
Fixed remuneration Variable remuneration
Element Base salary Benefits Pension Annual bonus LTIP
Share ownership guidelines 
and holding periods
How it is 
influenced by the 
remuneration 
philosophy
Broadly mid-market. Set no higher than 
mid-market and is the least 
significant variable element.
Has stretching corporate and 
personal targets that support 
Vectura’s annual goals and its 
overall strategy.
Deferral of a proportion in 
shares increases alignment 
with shareholders.
The most significant 
element of the package.
Has stretching targets that 
are clearly aligned with 
shareholder value.
Performance measured over 
three years and subsequent 
holding requirements for a 
further two years align with 
the long-term interests of 
the Company.
Significant personal 
holdings must be acquired 
and maintained and vested 
shares must be retained for 
a period.
Whilst the Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding its policy for Directors, the Committee has regard to the policy 
for remuneration of employees across the Group. It does so in a number of respects:
• Employees are rewarded with a remuneration package that includes certain key benefits such as life assurance, permanent health 
insurance, private medical insurance, access to the pension scheme and participation in Vectura’s all-employee share schemes and 
many employees are eligible to receive a bonus. 
• The bonus scheme for Directors and employees is designed to reward corporate and personal performance, and all individuals work 
towards challenging personal goals related to their roles. When determining the annual salary increases and remuneration packages 
for the Executive Directors, the Committee considers the general base salary increase for the broader employee population.
The remuneration of Senior Executives below Board level is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis. The remuneration packages 
of these Executives are broadly consistent with the policy outlined above, with the overall impact of the role and the individual being 
considered as well as relevant market comparative data, save that lower bonus percentages and lower long-term incentive opportunities 
are applicable.
• The following table and accompanying notes set out the main principles of reward for the Executive Directors of the Group as set out 
in the current remuneration policy.  87 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
GOVERNANCE
Executive Directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary
To recruit and retain Executives 
of the highest calibre who are 
capable of delivering the Group’s 
strategic objectives, reflecting the 
individual’s experience and role 
within the Group.
Base salary is designed to provide 
an appropriate level of fixed income 
to avoid an over-reliance on 
variable pay elements that could 
encourage excessive risk taking.
The Committee aims to set base 
salary at levels that are broadly 
aligned with the mid-points for 
equivalent roles in comparable 
companies in the UK, adjusted to 
reflect company size and complexity.
Salaries are normally reviewed 
annually and changes are 
generally effective from 1 January.
The annual salary review 
of Executive Directors takes 
a number of factors into 
consideration, including:
• business performance;
• salary increases awarded to the 
overall employee population;
• skills and experience of the 
individual over time;
• scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities;
• changes in the size and 
complexity of the Group;
• market competitiveness; and
• the underlying rate of inflation.
Base salary increases are 
awarded at the discretion 
of the Committee; however, 
salary increases will 
normally be considered 
in relation to the average 
pay rises awarded to the 
wider workforce.
Where a higher level of 
increase is appropriate 
given the performance 
and contribution of the 
incumbent, or where 
there has been a change 
in responsibilities, the 
Committee retains the 
discretion to award 
more significant base 
salary increases.
No formal metrics, although increases 
will take account of Group performance.
Benefits
Benefits in kind offered to 
Executive Directors are provided 
on a market-competitive basis, 
to assist with the retention and 
recruitment of staff.
The Company aims to offer 
benefits that are in line with 
market practice.
The main benefits currently provided 
are life assurance, permanent health 
insurance and private medical and 
dental insurance.
Under certain circumstances the 
Group will offer relocation 
allowances to employees.
Any reasonable business-related 
expenses (including tax thereon) 
can be reimbursed if determined 
to be a taxable benefit.
Executive Directors are eligible 
for other benefits which are 
introduced for the wider workforce 
on broadly similar terms.
The value of each benefit  
is not predetermined and  
is based upon the cost to  
the Group.
Not performance related.
Pensions
The Group aims to provide 
market-competitive 
retirement benefits, to reward 
sustained contribution.
The Group operates a money 
purchase scheme and all employees, 
including Executive Directors, 
are invited to participate.
For Executives who are affected 
by the HMRC lifetime or annual 
allowances, the Company may 
provide cash supplements in respect 
of benefits above the allowance.
Up to 20% of basic salary 
contribution to the Group 
Personal Pension Plan or 
equivalent cash allowance.

Annual performance bonus (awards made from 2017)
An annual bonus rewards the 
achievement of stretching 
objectives that support the 
Group’s corporate goals and 
delivery of the business strategy 
together with goals in relation to 
personal performance.
Delivery of a proportion in 
shares provides alignment with 
shareholders and facilitates the 
operation of clawback.
Objectives are agreed with the 
Committee, and the Board as a 
whole, at the start of each 
financial year.
Different performance measures 
and weightings may be used  
each year, as agreed with the 
Committee, to take into account 
changes in the business strategy.
Bonuses are paid at the discretion 
of the Committee. The Committee 
takes into account overall 
corporate performance and 
individual performance when 
determining the final bonus 
amount to be awarded.
Bonuses are typically paid in 
March. Bonuses up to 100% of 
base salary are payable in cash, 
with any bonus in excess of 100% 
of base salary normally compulsorily 
deferred into shares for two 
years. Participants may also be 
entitled to receive dividend 
equivalents on vested shares.
Under the rules of the scheme, 
the Committee can claw back up 
to 100% of the bonus awarded in 
the event of material misstatement 
of the Company’s financial  
results, an error in assessing 
the performance conditions to 
which an award is subject or 
for any other matter which it 
deems relevant.
Bonuses are limited to 
a maximum of 135% of 
base salary for the CEO 
and 125% of base salary 
for the CFO.
Corporate goals typically include revenue 
generation, development of pipeline progress, 
partnering successes and control of cash 
expenditure, although the Committee has the 
discretion to set other targets.
Goals set are specific, measurable and linked 
to the Group’s longer-term strategy.
Up to 20% of the maximum is payable at 
threshold performance against each measure.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (L TIP) (awards made from 2017)
The Remuneration Committee 
believes that a key component of 
the overall remuneration package 
is the provision of equity awards 
to Senior Executives through 
the LTIP, which is designed to 
incentivise growth in the longer 
term and align them with 
shareholders’ interests.
Discretionary annual award of 
nil or nominal cost options that 
vest according to performance 
conditions normally measured 
over three financial years.
Participants may also be entitled 
to receive dividend equivalents on 
vested shares.
Awards granted from 2017 
onwards are subject to an 
additional two-year post-vesting 
holding requirement on the net 
of tax value of shares vesting.
Awards will be subject to 
clawback where there has been 
a misstatement of the Company’s 
financial results, an error in 
assessing the performance 
conditions to which an award 
is subject or for any other 
matter which the Committee 
deems relevant.
Awards are subject to the 
discretions contained in the 
relevant plan rules.
Annual awards of up 
to 185% of salary may 
be granted.
Awards normally based on key measures linked 
to achievement of Vectura’s strategy such as 
relative total shareholder return (TSR) and/or 
financial metrics measured over three years.
The Committee retains the discretion to vary 
the chosen relative TSR peer group or the 
weighting between the metrics and/or 
introduce new metrics aligned to the Group’s 
strategy for awards in future years, providing 
they are not materially less challenging in 
the circumstances. The Committee would 
normally consult with its major shareholders 
before making significant changes to the 
performance conditions.
15% of the maximum award vests at the 
threshold/median performance level, rising  
to 100% vesting at maximum/upper quartile.
Awards are also subject to an underpin based 
on the Committee’s assessment of the Group’s 
underlying performance against a range of 
factors, including the Company’s underlying 
financial performance, absolute shareholder 
returns and progress against milestones over 
the performance period. Any exercise of 
discretion will be fully disclosed to shareholders.

long-term incentive awards are described

All-employee share schemes
All employees, including Executive 
Directors, are encouraged to 
become shareholders of Vectura 
Group plc through participation in 
our all-employee share schemes.
The Group currently offers UK 
employees the opportunity 
to participate in the Vectura 
Sharesave (SAYE) scheme and the 
Vectura Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
Where possible, similar plans will 
operate for overseas employees.
Both of the schemes offered are 
HMRC-approved schemes and 
operate on standard terms.
Participation limits are  
set by the relevant tax 
authorities from time  
to time.
Not performance related and no performance 
conditions apply.
Share ownership guidelines
Share ownership guidelines 
for Executive Directors and 
senior employees are designed 
to strengthen the alignment 
between the interests of senior 
management with those of 
Vectura’s shareholders.
In accordance with best practice, 
Executive Directors are required 
to retain at least half of any LTIP 
awards vesting as shares (after 
paying any tax due) until they 
have reached the required level 
of holding.
Executive Directors are 
required to build and  
retain a holding of 
Vectura Group plc shares 
equivalent to at least 200% 
of their base salary.

Notes to the policy table
For the avoidance of doubt, any commitments entered into by the 
Company prior to the approval and implementation of the policy 
outlined above may be honoured, even if they are not consistent 
with the policy prevailing at the time the commitment is fulfilled. 
In operating its policy, the Committee may exercise discretion set 
out below and in accordance with the relevant sections of the 
various plan rules:
Performance conditions
The Committee selected the performance conditions outlined in the 
remuneration policy because they are aligned with the Group’s 
overall strategy and they are the key metrics used by the Executive 
Directors to oversee the operations of the business. The Committee 
considers that the performance targets for the LTIP and the bonus 
represent an appropriate balance between the long-term and 
short-term performance of the Group, as well as an appropriate 
balance between external and internal assessments of performance.
The targets for the bonus scheme for the forthcoming year will 
be set out in general terms, subject to limitations with regards to 
commercial sensitivity. The full details of the targets will be disclosed 
when they are in the public domain, usually following the end of 
the relevant financial year, in the Directors’ remuneration report.  90 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Notes to the policy table continued
Performance conditions continued
Relative TSR has been chosen as a performance metric for 50% of 
the 2017 and 2018 LTIP awards as it is aligned with our shareholders’ 
expectations and it reflects the returns that we generate for our 
shareholders relative to the returns of the general market. The 
FTSE 250 Index (excluding financial services and real estate companies) 
has been chosen as it is a published index, is transparent for 
shareholders, and provides a robust comparator group of similarly 
sized companies.
The Committee believes that the introduction of a financial metric 
for the remaining 50% of the L TIP awards reflects our growth ambitions 
and the increasing maturity of our business. Over the life of the policy, 
the choice of financial metric and basis of measurement may be 
varied to reflect the Company’s development and strategic priorities. 
For awards granted in 2017 and 2018, cumulative adjusted EBITDA 
has been selected as the financial metric; however, the Committee 
intends to keep the choice of metric under review for future awards. 
The proposed performance conditions for the LTIP awards to be 
granted in 2018 are outlined on page 104 of the Directors’ annual 
remuneration report. 
Committee discretion
The Committee operates under the powers it has been delegated 
by the Board. In addition, it complies with rules that have either 
been approved by shareholders (Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan) or by the Board (annual performance 
bonus scheme). These rules provide the Committee with certain 
discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of the 
remuneration policy is fair, both to the individual Directors and 
to the shareholders. The Committee also has discretion to set 
components of remuneration within a range, from time to time. 
The extent of such discretions is set out in the relevant rules and 
the maximum opportunity or the performance metrics sections of 
the policy table above. To ensure the efficient administration of the 
variable incentive plans outlined above, the Committee will apply 
certain operational discretions.
These include the following:
• selecting the participants in the plans on an annual basis;
• determining the timing of grants of awards and/or payments;
• determining the quantum of awards and/or payments (within 
the limits set out in the policy table above);
• reviewing performance against LTI performance metric;
• determining the extent of vesting based on the assessment 
of performance;
• making the appropriate adjustments required in certain 
circumstances, for instance for changes in capital structure;
• determining “good leaver” status for incentive plan purposes 
and applying the appropriate treatment; and
• undertaking the annual review of weighting of performance 
measures and setting targets for the annual bonus plan and 
other incentive schemes, where applicable, from year to year.
If an event occurs which results in the annual bonus plan or LTIP 
performance conditions and/or targets being deemed no longer 
appropriate (e.g. material acquisition or divestment), the Committee 
will have the ability to adjust appropriately the measures and/or 
targets and alter weightings, provided that the revised conditions 
are not materially less challenging than the original conditions.
Remuneration scenarios for Executive Directors
The charts below show hypothetical values of the 2018 remuneration 
package for each Executive Director under three assumed performance 
scenarios and these scenarios are based upon the remuneration 
policy set out above. The information presented below uses the 
level of salary, benefits and pension entitlements for each of the 
Directors as at 1 January 2018.
Base salaries for 2018: CEO – £515,811 and CFO – £357,211. 
Benefits of £24,000 and £9,000 respectively, and a pension 
allowance of 20% of salary have been assumed.
Below target remuneration receivable – this scenario assumes that 
there is no annual bonus payment and no awards under the L TIP vest.
On-target performance remuneration receivable – this scenario 
assumes that the Directors receive a bonus payout of 67.5% (CEO) 
or 62.5% (CFO) of salary and that LTIP awards worth 27.75% of 
salary at grant would ultimately vest.
Stretch remuneration receivable – this scenario assumes that 
the Directors receive a maximum bonus payout of 135%/125% 
(CEO/CFO) of their salary and that a maximum LTIP award of 
185% of salary would ultimately vest. 
The actual amounts earned by Executive Directors under these 
three scenarios will depend on share price performance over the 
vesting period. For the purpose of these illustrations, any share 
price appreciation has been ignored. For simplicity, the value of 
participating in the Company’s all-employee share schemes has 
also been ignored.

Other remuneration policies
Termination and loss of office payments
The Group’s policy on remuneration for Executive Directors who 
leave the Group is consistent with general market practice and 
is set out below. The Committee will exercise its discretion when 
determining amounts that should be paid to leavers, taking into 
account the facts and circumstances of each case. When calculating 
termination payments, the Committee will take into account a 
variety of factors, including individual and Company performance, 
the length of service of the Executive Director in question and, 
where appropriate, the obligation for the Executive Director to 
mitigate loss. 
In the case of a “good leaver”, the following policy will normally apply:
• notice period of twelve-months and pension and contractual 
benefits, or payment in lieu of notice;
• statutory redundancy payments will be made, as appropriate;
• Executives have no entitlement to a bonus payment in the event 
that they cease to be employed by the Group; however, they 
may be considered for a pro-rated cash award by the Committee 
in good leaver circumstances;
• the rules of the LTIP and Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) contain 
provisions setting out the treatment of awards where a participant 
ceases to be employed by the Vectura Group. Other than in good 
leaver circumstances, awards will normally lapse. In the event 
of a participant’s death, retirement, ill health, injury, disability 
or redundancy, the sale of his employing company or business 
out of the Vectura Group or for any other reason, at the discretion 
of the Remuneration Committee, awards will not be forfeited 
but will instead normally vest on the original vesting date. 
Vesting in these circumstances will be subject to the satisfaction 
of the relevant performance conditions measured at that time 
and time pro-rating in the case of LTIP awards. DSBP awards will 
normally vest in full at the original vesting date. In exceptional 
circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may allow the awards 
to vest on cessation of the participant’s employment, subject to 
the satisfaction of the performance conditions measured at that 
time and time pro-rating in the case of LTIP awards. In either case, 
the Remuneration Committee can decide to disapply time pro-rating, 
if it thinks it is appropriate to do so in the particular circumstances;
• any other share-based entitlements granted to an Executive 
Director under the Company’s share and share option plans 
will be determined based upon the relevant plan rules; and
• the Committee may also provide for the leaver to be reimbursed 
for a reasonable level of legal fees in connection with a 
settlement agreement and may make a contribution towards 
outplacement costs.
In circumstances in which a leaving Director may be entitled to 
pursue a legal claim, the Company may negotiate settlement terms 
if it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company and, 
with the approval of the Committee on the remuneration elements 
therein, enter into a settlement agreement.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
It is the Group’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts 
with an indefinite term and which provide for a maximum period of 
twelve-months’ notice. The Executive Directors may accept outside 
appointments, with prior Board approval, provided that these 
opportunities do not negatively impact on their ability to fulfil their 
duties to the Group. Whether any related fees are retained by the 
individual or are remitted to the Group will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis. Neither of the Executive Directors currently 
hold any outside directorships.
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of engagement
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement which 
are terminable on not less than three-months’ notice by either party 
and not less than six-months’ notice in the case of the Chairman. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the 
Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based 
on a review of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of similar 
companies. In accordance with the Code, as applicable to a FTSE 250 
company, all Non-Executive Directors are subject to annual re-election 
at each AGM.
The dates of appointment of each of the Directors serving at 
31 December 2017 are summarised in the table below.

An external independent Board evaluation was performed in January – 
February 2017 and the Board confirmed that all Non-Executive Directors 
were regarded as independent, including Susan Foden, who has service 
greater than nine years, and Frank Condella, who was previously 
an executive director then non-executive director of Skyepharma. 
Notwithstanding her length of service Susan is considered by the Board 
to be independent in both character and judgement and there has been 
significant Board refreshment during her tenure. Further details of 
the evaluation are contained in the Corporate governance report on 
page 70. 92 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Other remuneration policies continued
Remuneration for new appointments
Where it is necessary to recruit or replace an Executive Director, 
the Committee has determined that the new Executive Director 
will receive a compensation package in accordance with the 
provisions of the policy.
In setting base salaries for new Executive Directors, the Committee 
will consider the existing salary package of the new Director and the 
individual’s level of experience. In setting the annual performance 
bonus, the Committee may wish to set different performance metrics 
(to those of other Executive Directors) in the first year of appointment. 
Where it is appropriate to offer a below-median salary on initial 
appointment, the Committee will have the discretion to allow 
phased salary increases over a period of time for a newly appointed 
Director, even though this may involve increases in excess of 
inflation and the increases awarded to the wider workforce. 
The Committee wishes to retain the ability to make buyout awards 
to a new Executive Director to facilitate the recruitment process. 
The amount of any such award would not exceed the expected 
value being forfeited and, to the extent possible, would mirror the 
form of payment, timing and degree of conditionality, etc. Where 
awards are granted subject to performance conditions, these would 
be relevant to Vectura Group plc. Any such award would only be 
made in exceptional circumstances and shareholders would be 
informed of any such payments at the time of appointment. 
Share-based awards would be made using the existing share plans, 
where possible, although the Committee may also use the flexibility 
provided under the Listing Rules to make awards without prior 
shareholder approval.
In respect of internal appointments, any commitments entered into 
in respect of a prior role, including variable pay elements, may be 
allowed to pay out according to its prior terms.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may consider 
it appropriate to pay reasonable relocation or incidental expenses, 
including payment of reasonable legal expenses. Tax equalisation 
may be considered if an Executive Director is adversely affected 
by taxation due to their employment with the Company.
The terms of appointment for a Non-Executive Director will be in 
accordance with the remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors 
as set out in the policy table. This was the case with the appointment 
of Juliet Thompson in December 2017.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
Whilst the Committee does not consult directly with employees 
regarding the policy, the Committee considers the general base 
salary increase for the broader employee population when 
determining the annual salary increases and remuneration 
packages for the Executive Directors. Accordingly, the Committee 
confirms that the remuneration policy outlined above has been 
designed with due regard to the policy for remuneration of 
employees across the Group. 
The remuneration of Senior Executives below Board level is reviewed 
by the Committee on an annual basis. The remuneration packages 
of these Executives are consistent with the policy outlined above, 
save that lower bonus percentages and lower LTIP opportunities 
are applicable. Variable pay elements for Senior Executives are 
driven principally by market comparatives and the overall impact 
of the role the individual holds at Vectura. Long-term incentives 
are provided to those individuals identified as having significant 
potential to influence Group performance. 
All employees are rewarded with a market-competitive remuneration 
package that includes certain key benefits such as life assurance, 
permanent health insurance, private medical insurance, access to 
the pension scheme and participation in Vectura’s all-employee 
share schemes and many have eligibility to receive a bonus. The 
bonus scheme for Directors and employees is designed to reward 
performance, and all individuals are required to achieve challenging 
personal goals. 
How shareholders’ views are taken into account
The Committee takes an active interest in shareholders’ views 
and voting on the Remuneration report. In developing the current 
policy, the Committee engaged directly with major shareholders 
and their representative bodies regarding the changes to salaries 
awarded following completion of the merger and also to the policy 
going forward.
This has informed a number of the key revisions to the proposed policy:
• the scaling back of the proposed salary increases post-merger;
• the introduction of a two-year post-vesting holding period for 
awards made in 2017 and subsequently under the LTIP;
• the introduction of a financial performance metric for awards 
made in 2017 and subsequently under the LTIP; and
• bonus deferral into shares under the annual bonus for awards 
in excess of 100% of salary.
The Committee will continue to engage directly with major 
shareholders and their representative bodies should any material 
changes to the policy be proposed. 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
GOVERNANCE
Annual report on remuneration 
Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”)
Governance
The Committee consists entirely of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee is chaired by Susan Foden and, during the 
year ended 31 December 2017, its members were Bruno Angelici, 
Thomas Werner, Neil Warner, and with effect from 20 December 2017, 
Juliet Thompson.
In accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board has confirmed that Bruno Angelici was independent 
upon his appointment to the Board. No conflicts of interest have 
arisen during the period and none of the members of the Committee 
have any personal financial interest in the matters discussed, other 
than as shareholders. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board on the joint recommendation of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.
The Committee’s principal function is to support Vectura’s strategy 
by ensuring that those individuals responsible for delivering the 
strategy are appropriately incentivised and rewarded through the 
operation of Vectura’s remuneration policy. In determining the 
Group’s policy, and in constructing the remuneration arrangements 
for Executive Directors and senior employees, the Board, advised 
by the Committee, aims to provide remuneration packages that are 
competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and senior employees of the highest calibre. 
The Committee is responsible for and considered during the period:
• setting a remuneration policy that is designed to promote the 
long-term success of the Company;
• ensuring that the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
other Senior Executives reflects both their individual performance 
and their contribution to the overall Group results;
• determining the terms of employment and remuneration of the 
Executive Directors and Senior Executives, including recruitment 
and retention terms;
• approving the design and performance targets of any annual 
incentive schemes that include the Executive Directors and 
Senior Executives;
• agreeing the design and performance targets, where applicable, 
of all share incentive plans requiring shareholder approval;
• rigorously assessing the appropriateness and subsequent 
achievement of the performance targets related to any share 
incentive plans;
• recommending to the Board the fees to be paid to the Chairman. 
The Chairman is excluded from this process; and
• the selection and appointment of the external advisors to 
the Committee to provide independent remuneration advice 
where necessary. 
The Committee is formally constituted and operates on written 
terms of reference, which are modelled on the Code and are 
available on Vectura’s website, www.vectura.com. 
Advice to the Committee
The Committee takes account of information from both internal and 
independent sources, including New Bridge Street (NBS) (Aon plc’s 
executive remuneration consultancy), which acts as the Committee’s 
principal, and only material, advisor. NBS advises on all aspects of 
Vectura’s remuneration policy and reviews Vectura’s remuneration 
structures against corporate governance best practice. 
NBS is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and complies with its Code of Conduct, which sets out guidelines 
to ensure that its advice is independent and free of undue influence. 
The Committee reviews the performance and independence of its 
advisors on an annual basis. During the period, Vectura incurred 
fees of £223,596 from NBS. 
The Group’s Executive Vice President – Human Resources provides 
updates to the Committee, as required, to ensure that the Committee 
is fully informed about pay and performance issues throughout 
the Group. The Committee takes these factors into account when 
determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and 
Senior Executives. The CEO and CFO also attend at the Committee’s 
request but are not present in discussions directly regarding their 
own remuneration.
During 2017, we reviewed our reward strategy below Board level 
to harmonise our terms and conditions to the fullest extent possible 
within local legislative parameters. Harmonisation took place in 
2017 and the Committee ensured it is aligned to our newly defined 
values and behaviours to ensure that our reward practices will both 
reinforce and embed our target culture. No Executive Director or 
employee is allowed to participate in any discussion directly relating 
to their own personal conditions of service or remuneration.
Key decisions during the period
The Committee met seven times during the year ended 
31 December 2017.
The key decisions made by the Committee during the period are 
summarised below:
• determination of the leaver arrangements for Trevor Phillips;
• approval of 2018 base salary increases for Executive Directors 
and other members of the Executive Leadership Team, ensuring 
that, where appropriate, these are aligned both internally 
and externally;
• review of achievement against the 2017 corporate goals and 
approval of the percentage of the bonus pool to be paid out 
across the Group, and a review of achievement against personal 
goals for Executive Directors; 
• determination of performance against the TSR conditions for 
awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), resulting in 
the approval of zero vesting of the awards granted in 2014; 
• approval of the grant of the 2017 LTIP awards and 
performance conditions; 
• review of the Company’s gender pay gap data; and
• review of remuneration packages for the appointment of new 
Senior Executives and, where appropriate, confirming approval. 94 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

GOVERNANCE
Notes to the remuneration tables
(a)  This is the amount earned in respect of the financial period.
(b)  This is the taxable value of benefits paid or payable in respect of the financial period. These benefits typically relate to death, disability 
and medical insurance. T M Phillips also received benefits in relation to US medical and dental insurance and A J Oakley received 
worldwide medical and dental insurance and was provided with a relocation allowance. 
(c)  This is the total bonus earned under the annual bonus scheme in respect of the financial year.
(d)  The amount shown relates to the market value of LTIP awards whose performance period ended during the year. Refer to page 99 
for details of LTIP awards.
(e)  UK tax legislation imposes penalty taxes on annual pension contributions where prescribed maximum amounts are exceeded. 
The Committee has previously determined that impacted Executive Directors would receive pension benefits limited by the prescribed 
maximum amounts and an additional taxable supplementary cash payment equal to the cost to the Company of the pension benefit 
foregone. The amount of the allowance awarded to any Executive Director so impacted has been set by the Committee so that there 
is no additional cost to the Company resulting from this arrangement.
(f)  Other payments in 2017 relate to travel allowances for F Condella and P-O Andersson and payments made under agreement with 
T M Phillips; amounts paid to T M Phillips are described later in this report on page 101. 
(g)  This relates to matching and free share SIP awards granted during the year and SAYE awards which have vested during the year. 
The benefit of the SIP awards is calculated as the number of shares awarded multiplied by the share price on the date of the award. 
The benefit of the SAYE award is calculated as the number of options awarded multiplied by the discount to the market share price 
on the date the option was awarded.
Additional requirements in respect of the single total figure table of remuneration (audited information)
Performance-related pay earned in the year to 31 December 2017
Annual performance bonus
Employees are eligible for an annual discretionary cash bonus, whereby performance objectives are established at the beginning of the 
financial period by reference to suitably challenging corporate goals. The scheme is offered to many staff below Board level and maximum 
bonus opportunities range from 10% to 75% of salary, depending on grade. Bonus payments are not pensionable. 
The Committee has consistently set stretching corporate goals, including goals around revenue generation, development pipeline progress, 
partnering successes and control of cash expenditure, which are weighted towards goals with the highest corporate significance.
In addition, a significant percentage of the bonus potential is set against challenging personal objectives which are linked to the overall 
business strategy. Bonuses were limited to a maximum of 135% of basic salary for the CEO and 125% for the CFO. 
The performance objectives against which bonus payments were calculated are set out in the table below. Full disclosure of some objectives 
has been restricted due to commercial sensitivity; however, full disclosure will be provided as and when the objectives cease to be 
commercially sensitive. It is anticipated that disclosure will be made in the following year, in line with best practice.
The Committee assessed that a bonus of 74%–81% (2016: 77%–99.5%) of salary was appropriate for the Executive Directors when judged 
by the achievement of the metrics set out in the tables below.
Threshold Maximum Actual
Revenue Target £172.7m £172.8m £183.0m £193.1m £203.3m £213.5m £223.6m £233.8m £148.0m

Given the importance of delivering the synergies announced to the market as part of the merger, threshold for the Adjusted EBITDA 
performance target required synergies of at least £10m, for which up to 5% of this element could be paid or Adjusted EBITDA of at least 
£49.1m, for which 5% would be paid. The Committee determined that 4% for this element would be paid for expected Synergies of £12m 
expected to be delivered by the end of 2018. 96 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

LTIP scheme
Scheme interests vested during the period
On 1 July 2014, an award of LTIP options was made to the Executive Directors who were in office at this time. As disclosed in the 2016 
report, James Ward-Lilley also has an award subject to the same conditions granted as part of his buyout arrangements.
Vesting of these awards was calculated in the period by our consultants, New Bridge Street, as follows:
Measure Performance target Actual performance
TSR against  
constituents of the  
FTSE SmallCap Index

The vesting outcome for each comparator group is calculated as follows:
Vectura’s TSR of -3.0% was below

Index over the measurement period. 
Consequently, none of this element of 
the awards was eligible to vest.

On 24 September 2015, an award of LTIP options was made to the Executive Directors who were in office at this time. The awards are 
subject to relative TSR, measured over three tranches over three or five years against two comparator groups (each representing 50% of 
the total award). 40% of the award vests on 24 September 2018 (with performance measured up to 31 December 2017) and the remaining 
60% of the award (40% for the standard five-year award and 20% for the “kicker” award) vests on 24 September 2020.
Vesting of the first tranche of these awards was calculated in the period by New Bridge Street, as follows:
Measure Performance target Actual performance
TSR against constituents 
of the FTSE 250 
companies (excluding 
real estate and 
financial services) 
(50% of award)
The vesting outcome for each comparator group is calculated as follows:
Vectura’s TSR of -31.6% was below the 
constituents of the FTSE 250 companies 
(excluding real estate and financial 
services) over the measurement period. 
Consequently, none of this element of 
the awards was eligible to vest.

In accordance with the rules of Vectura’s LTIP scheme, the Committee determined that Chris Blackwell, who retired as CEO on 30 June 2015, 
Andrew Oakley, who retired as CFO on 10 June 2016, and Trevor Phillips, who stepped down from the Board on 25 May 2017, should be 
treated as good leavers. During the period 300,751 awards made to Chris Blackwell, 165,413 awards made to Andrew Oakley and 206,766 
awards made to Trevor Phillips were due to vest in respect of their 2014 awards. Vesting of awards was subject to pro-rating to their dates 
of departure. However, as a result of the outcome of the performance conditions, all awards lapsed. In respect of their 2015 awards, 157,913 
awards made to both Trevor Phillips and Andrew Oakley respectively will lapse on 24 September 2018, based on the outcome of the above 
performance conditions.

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (audited)
The awards granted under the 2015 LTIP scheme on 25 May 2017 are subject to relative TSR and cumulative growth in adjusted EBITDA, 
measured over three years (each representing 50% of the total award), as set out in the following table:
Proportion of total award Performance period Measure Performance required for vesting
50% Three years Relative TSR against FTSE 250 companies 
(excluding real estate and financial services)
Median (15%) to upper quartile (100%)
50% Three years Cumulative adjusted growth in adjusted EBITDA Threshold (15%): £86.7m
Maximum (100%): £120.6m
Given the lack of clarity concerning the timing of regulatory approval of VR315, the Committee postponed the setting of the EBITDA targets 
and set a deadline in this regard of the final quarter 2017. Accordingly the targets were agreed and set in December 2017. The market was 
further updated of the regulatory status of VR315 at the start of 2018 and in line with our commitment to publish targets once this had 
occurred, we now disclose the relevant details in this report. 
As a business with a significant annual investment in research and development the Committee is highly conscious of the need to ensure 
that the performance against the EBITDA targets is consistent with a disciplined approach to research and development expenditure. 
The targets have therefore been set on the basis of planned levels of research and development spend. In order to ensure that participants 
are not inappropriately rewarded for changes in research and development expenditure, the Committee will have discretion to take 
account of changes in planned levels of research and development spend when determining performance against the performance 
conditions. Any such adjustments will be fully disclosed to shareholders at the point of vesting, 
Performance against the TSR condition will be measured by the Committee’s independent advisors.
Irrespective of the extent to which the conditions have been met, the Committee may decrease the percentage vesting based on a range 
of factors, including the Group’s performance, absolute shareholder returns and progress against milestones. Any exercise of this discretion 
by the Committee will be fully disclosed to shareholders with an explanation of the Committee’s reasoning in the Remuneration report for 
the relevant year. 
To the extent that performance conditions are not met in full at the end of the three-year performance period, awards lapse.
The Committee has the power to claw back and/or apply a malus mechanism in respect of all or part of the awards/payments for one 
year following vesting in the event of a material misstatement, error in the calculation of performance against the performance conditions 
of the plan or any other matter which it deems relevant to this provision. 100 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Sharesave
Vectura Group plc also operates a Sharesave (SAYE) Share Option Scheme for employees and Executive Directors. Under this scheme all 
eligible employees and Executive Directors are invited to subscribe for options, which may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of 
market value and which vest after three or five years. The SAYE is an HMRC-approved all-employee plan to which performance conditions 
do not apply. No Sharesave options vested for Executive Directors during the year.
Total pension entitlements
As stated in the notes to the single figure remuneration table, UK tax legislation imposes penalty taxes on annual pension contributions 
where prescribed maximum amounts are exceeded. Impacted Executive Directors receive an additional taxable supplementary cash 
payment in lieu of pension contributions in excess of any limits.

Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited information)
As a direct link between Executive remuneration and the interests of shareholders, the Committee has shareholding guidelines for 
Executive Directors and key senior employees. The guidelines require that Executive Directors build up and maintain an interest in 
the ordinary shares of the Company that is 200% of their annual base salary. In assessing compliance with this requirement, the value 
of the shareholding shown below is assessed using the share price on 29 December 2017, being 118p. The value as a percentage of 
salary has been calculated using the base salary as at 29 December 2017, as shown in the single figure remuneration table.
Until this level of shareholding has been attained, Executive Directors are required to retain at least half of any share awards vesting 
as shares (after paying any tax due) until they have a holding equivalent to at least 200% of their base salary.  101 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc

Payments made for loss of office and payments to past Directors (audited information)
Trevor Phillips stepped down from the Board as Chief Operations Officer and President of US Operations at the AGM last year on 25 May 2017 
and left the Company on 31 May 2017. He received normal pay and benefits up to this date and received his bonus in respect of 2016. 
Under the terms of his settlement agreement, Trevor Phillips received a sum of £216,352, which was comprised of £65,824 in lieu of any 
statutory or redundancy entitlements and £150,528 (equivalent to approximately six-months’ salary) by way of payment in lieu of notice. 
The Company paid the sum of £8,750 in lieu of healthcare benefits for the balance of the contractual notice period. He received a monthly 
cash payment in lieu of pension contributions up to 31 December 2017. The Company also agreed to provide £2,500 plus VAT towards 
reasonable legal fees in connection with the termination of employment. 
As disclosed on page 98 he also received a pro-rata bonus payment of £73,677 for the period worked from 1 January 2017 to 31 May 2017 
based on the Company and individual performance. 
He was treated as a good leaver under the LTIP. Outstanding awards will vest on their normal vesting dates, subject to the satisfaction 
of any relevant performance conditions, pro-rated based on the period from the date of grant of the awards to 31 May 2017. He was 
automatically treated as a good leaver under the Share Incentive Plan and, as a result, all free shares, partnership shares and matching 
shares held by him under the SIP on the date of cessation were released.
The Directors who have held office during the period ended 31 December 2017 and their interests 
(in respect of which transactions are notifiable to the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Transparency Rules) in the share capital of Vectura Group plc at 31 December 2017 are shown in the 
following table below.
There was no change in the Directors’ interests between 31 December 2017 and 20 March 2018, the

Performance graph and table
The following graph shows Vectura Group plc’s cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) over the last nine financial years relative to 
the FTSE 250 Index. This index was chosen as Vectura is one of the constituent companies and the Committee feels that it is the most 
appropriate against which to measure performance. 
TSR is defined as the return on investment obtained from holding a company’s shares over a period. It includes dividends paid, the change 
in the capital value of the shares and any other payments made to or by shareholders within the period.

Details of the share capital, together with details of the movements 
in the Company’s issued share capital during the year, are shown in 
note 28 “Ordinary share capital”. 
The Company has two classes of shares. Ordinary shares of 0.025p

fixed income. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company. Ordinary Shares are listed on 
the London Stock Exchange. 
The Company also has redeemable preference shares of £1.00 each. 
These shares are not listed on any exchange and carry no rights 
to dividend or other distribution. Holders have the right to receive 
notice of meetings and to attend, but not to vote at the same.
Pursuant to the general provisions of the Articles of Association 
and prevailing legislation, there are no specific restrictions on the 
size of a holding. The Directors are not aware of any restrictions on 
the transfer of Ordinary Shares in the Company other than certain 
restrictions which may from time to time be imposed by law and 
regulations, e.g. insider trading laws, and pursuant to the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain employees 
of the Company require the prior approval from the Company to 
deal in the Company’s securities.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders 
that may result in restrictions on voting rights and the transfer 
of securities.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 29 
“Share-based payments”. Shares were issued and allotted during 
the period only in relation to the administration of the Employee 
Share Plans. Shares held by the employee benefit trusts are not 
voted by the Trustees of each Trust. 
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and all issued shares are fully paid. 106 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Acquisition of the Company’s own shares
The Company purchased 1,422,503 of its own shares at an 
aggregate cost of £1,344,945.00 in the period under review. 
The nominal value of the shares was £355.63 and represented 
0.21% of the issued share capital at that time. The purpose of the 
Buyback is to reduce the share capital of Vectura and all shares 
purchased will be immediately cancelled. The employee benefit 
trusts purchased 1,775,922 shares during the year to meet the 
awards requirements of the Employee Share Incentive Plan and 
the delivery of shares arising from exercises of options granted 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan or Listing Rule 9.4.2(2). 
A resolution will be proposed at the 2018 AGM to give the Company 
authority to acquire Ordinary Shares following expiry of the current 
authority. The Directors will use this authority only after careful 
consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at 
the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels 
and the overall position of Vectura. In particular, this authority will 
be exercised only if the Directors believe that it is in the best interests 
of shareholders generally and will increase earnings per share.
Acquisitions and disposals
There were no other significant acquisitions or disposals during 
the period.
Change of control
The Company, and various subsidiaries, are party to a number 
of agreements which have change of control clauses. If triggered, 
these could lead to delays in product development programmes 
and/or product commercialisation. In the event of a takeover bid, 
there are no specific agreements between the Company and its 
Directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
(whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise). 107 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU) and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards, 
including FRS 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their 
profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, 
reliable and prudent; 
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; 
• assess the Group and parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and 
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect  
of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
We consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) 
and applicable law.  Our responsibilities are described 
below.  We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our 
opinion.  Our audit opinion is consistent with our report 
to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 25

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
to the members of Vectura Group plc
110 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team.  We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those 
procedures.  These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely forthe 
purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidenta l to that
opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The risk Our response
Recoverability of inhaled in-
market assets, smart nebuliser 
technology and non-inhaled in-
market assets 
(£335 million)
Refer to 81 (Audit Committee 
Report), 123 (accounting policy) 
and 1 3 6 - 137 (financial 
disclosures).
Subjective valuation
Recent acquisitions have led to the 
recognition of intangible assets with a 
significant value, where the development or 
commercialisation of the underlying 
pharmaceutical assets are at the early stages 
of their useful economic lives. There is a risk 
that the carrying amount of the inhaled in-
market assets, smart nebuliser technology 
and non-inhaled in-market assets may 
become impaired if financial performance or 
other events, such as regulatory approvals, 
are not in line with initial expectations. 
The Group’s estimated future cash flows for 
each asset are used to support their 
recoverability. The cash flow forecasts rely 
on a number of critical assumptions and 
estimates including the likelihood of success 
of early and late stage development 
programs, the discount rates, the asset’s 
future market share and associated pricing. 
Our procedures included: 
— Controls design: assessing the design and 
implementation of key controls over the preparation 
of forecasts and the challenge of the assumptions 
within those forecasts by management; 
— Our experience: challenging the Group’s assessment 
of impairment and impairment indicators depending 
on the asset concerned using our understanding of 
the asset’s current and future performed gained form 
performing our audit procedures;
— Test of details: agreeing significant observable inputs 
used in the discounted cash flow models to the 
related contracts and underlying data sets;
— Our sector experience: assessing whether key 
assumptions used, in particular those relating to the 
sales growth, timing and likelihood of development 
milestone, forecast sale pricing and cash flow risk 
adjustment percentages, reflect our knowledge of the 
business and industry, including known or probable 
changes in the business environment;
— Benchmarking assumptions: challenging, using our 
own valuation specialists, the key inputs used in the 
Group’s calculation of the discount rates by 
comparing them to externally derived data, including 
available sources for comparable companies;
— Sensitivity analysis: We performed breakeven 
analysis on the key assumptions noted above;
— Assessing transparency: assessing whether the 
group’s disclosures about the impairment test 
appropriately reflect the risks inherent in the 
valuation of intangible assets;
Our results  
— We found the resulting estimate of the recoverable 
amount of inhaled in-market assets, smart nebuliser 
technology and non-inhaled in-market assets to be 
acceptable.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement (continued)
The risk Our response
Revenue recognition
Royalty income, signing and 
milestone payments; product and 
device sales
Refer to 81 (Audit Committee 
Report), 124 (accounting policy) and 
128-129 (financial disclosures).
The Group’s total revenue includes the 
following principal revenue streams: royalty 
income, signing and milestone payments, 
and product and device sales.
Reliance on third party data:
Royalty income is earned on third party 
sales and is recognised based on 
information provided to the Group by its 
partners. The Group is reliant on the 
completeness and accuracy of third party 
royalty reports and has limited visibility over 
the level of third party product sales made 
(upon which royalties are earned). There is 
an inherent material risk over the accuracy 
of the royalty revenue accrued at the year 
end. 
For product and device sales of flutiform®, 
management is reliant on the third-party 
supplier notifying Vectura of the point at 
which the transfer of the risks and rewards 
occurs which is when the goods are 
“available for collection” by the licensing 
partner. Given the lack of direct control and 
limited visibility, particularly at the year 
end, there is a material inherent risk over 
the sales recognition at the year end.
Subjective estimate:
Recognition of signing and milestone 
payments is inherently subjective and 
management exercises judgement in 
determining whether the Group has fulfilled 
all of its performance obligations and the 
relevant period over which to recognise the 
associated revenues. Milestones are often 
individually material and the fulfilment of 
performance obligations is linked to the 
completion of a clinical milestone, a 
regulatory approval or transfer of 
intellectual property. 
Our procedures included:
— Controls design: assessing the design and 
implementation of key controls over the 
accuracy of royalty revenues and product sales 
notified by third parties. This included assessing 
the controls over accurately forecasting the 
third party sales;
— Test of details: agreeing total royalty income to 
statements received from partners and to the 
cash collected during the year to assess the 
reasonableness of the income accrued at the 
year end. This included reconciliation of accrued 
but not billed income at the year end to the post 
year end royalty reports, cash (where received) 
and credit notes;
— Assessing forecasts: assessing the 
reasonableness of the income accrued at the 
year end by considering the consistency 
between forecast royalties and those confirmed 
by third party royalty statements for the fourth 
quarter of the year;
— Test of details: agreeing a statistical sample of 
December and January product and device sales 
invoices to supporting evidence, such as third 
party delivery confirmations, to assess the 
appropriateness of the period of revenue 
recognition. We have also considered the level 
of credit notes issued post year end. 
— Test of details: reviewing the relevant licence 
contracts supporting each potential material 
milestone recognised or unrecognised and 
assessing the assumptions made by the Group 
against the underlying contractual terms, the 
data received from market sources and the data 
received from the counter party. This included 
assessing the recognition or non-recognition of 
the milestone by comparing the judgement 
made to the underlying contractual terms; 
corroborating the facts and circumstances to 
underlying supporting documentation and 
external third party data;
— Assessing transparency: considering the 
adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect 
of the judgement and estimates around revenue 
recognition. 
Our results
— We found revenue recognition to be acceptable.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Vectura Group plc
112 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement (continued)
The risk Our response
Recoverability of parent company’s 
investment in subsidiaries (£710.8
million)
Refer to 81 (Audit Committee Report), 
153 (accounting policy) and 153 
(financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The carrying amount of the parent 
company’s investment in subsidiaries is 
significant and at risk of not being 
recoverable due to the carrying value of 
certain investment exceeding the net assets 
value of the subsidiary and/or the 
subsidiaries being loss-making. There is a 
risk that the carrying amount of investments 
may become impaired if forecast financial 
performance or other events, such as 
regulatory approvals, are not in line with 
expectations. 
The estimated recoverable amount of this 
balance is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty in forecasting trading conditions 
and cash flows used in the budgets. The 
critical assumptions include the likelihood of 
success of early and late stage development 
programs, the discount rates, their future 
market share and associated pricing. 
Our procedures included: 
— Controls design: testing the controls over the 
forecasts prepared for the subsidiary, including 
annual approval and challenge of those 
forecasts by the directors;
— Benchmarking assumptions: challenging the 
assumptions used in the cash flows included in 
the budgets based on our knowledge of the 
Group and the markets in which the subsidiary 
operate; 
— Historical comparisons: assessing the 
reasonableness of the budgets by considering 
the historical accuracy of the previous forecasts;
— Our sector experience: evaluating the current 
level of trading, including identifying any 
indications of a downturn in activity, by 
examining the post year end management 
accounts and considering our knowledge of the 
Group and the market; and
— Assessing transparency: assessing the adequacy 
of the parent company’s disclosures in respect 
of the investment in subsidiary.
Our results  
— We found the group’s assessment of the 
investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
113 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a 
whole was set at £1.45m, determined with reference to 
a benchmark of Group revenue of £148.0m which it 
represents 1%. We consider total revenue to be the most 
appropriate benchmark as it provides a more stable 
measure year on year than group loss before tax. 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements 
as a whole was set at £1.4m determined with reference 
to a benchmark of company total assets of which it 
represents 0.2%. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected misstatements exceeding £73k and any 
other identified misstatements that warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds.  
4 of the Group’s 7 reporting components were subject 
to full scope audits for group purposes and a further 2 
components were subjected to specified risk-focused 
audit procedures. The latter were not individually 
financially significant enough to require a full scope 
audit for group purposes, but did present specific 
individual risks that needed to be addressed.
For the remaining 1 component, we performed analysis 
at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within this component. 
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.
The group audit team instructed component auditors as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and the information to be 
reported back. The Group team approved component 
materiality levels of £0.9m for the component audit 
teams, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components. The work on 2 of the 
6 components was performed by component auditors 
and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, 
was performed by the Group team. 
The Group team visited 3 component locations, in the 
UK and Switzerland to assess the audit risk and strategy. 
Video and telephone conference meetings were also 
held with these component auditors. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required 
by the Group team was then performed by the 
component auditor.

The mriality for the Group financial statements as a

benchmark of Group revenue of £148.0m which it
represents 1%. We consider total revenue to be the most

at an aggregated group level to re-examine our 
assessment that there were no significant risks of 
material misstatement within this component. 
The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the percentages illustrated opposite.
The group audit team instructed component auditors as 
to the significant areas to be covered, including the 
relevant risks detailed above and the information to be 
reported back. The Group team approved component 
materiality levels of £0.9m for the component audit 
teams, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of 
the Group across the components. The work on 2 of the 
6 components was performed by component auditors 
and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, 
was performed by the Group team. 
The Group team visited 3 component locations, in the 
UK and Switzerland to assess the audit risk and strategy. 
Video and telephone conference meetings were also 
held with these component auditors. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required 
by the Group team was then performed by the 
component auditor.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
to the members of Vectura Group plc
114 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4. We have nothing to report on going concern
We are required to report to you if:
— we have anything material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to the directors’ statement on page 107 to the 
financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast 
significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that 
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of 
approval of the financial statements; or  
— the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 
107 is materially inconsistent with 
our audit knowledge.
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5. We have nothing to report on the other information in the 
Annual Report
The directors are responsible for the other information 
presented in the Annual Report together with the financial 
statements.  Our opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.  
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit 
work, the information therein is materially misstated or 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit 
knowledge.  Based solely on that work we have not identified 
material misstatements in the other information.
Strategic report and directors’ report
Based solely on our work on the other information:  
— we have not identified material misstatements in the 
strategic report and the directors’ report; 
— in our opinion the information given in those reports for the 
financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and  
— in our opinion those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ remuneration report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial 
statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
— the directors’ confirmation within the viability statement 
(page 55) that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity;
— the principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and 
explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and  
— the directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how 
they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they considered that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary 
qualifications or assumptions.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability 
statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit 
and the directors’ statement that they consider that the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is 
fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy; or  
— the section of the annual report describing the work of the 
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance 
Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the 
eleven provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.  
115 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we 
are required to report by exception
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:  
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not 
been received from branches not visited by us; or  
— the parent Company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or  
— certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or  
— we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
We have nothing to report in these respects.
7. Respective responsibilities
Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 108, 
the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial 
statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing 
the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to 
do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities (see 
below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.  
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the 
FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
Irregularities – ability to detect
We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably 
be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements 
from our sector experience, through discussion with the directors 
and other management (as required by auditing standards).
We had regard to laws and regulations in areas that directly 
affect the financial statements including financial reporting 
(including related company legislation) and taxation legislation.  
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and 
regulations as part of our procedures on the related annual 
accounts items. 
In addition we considered the impact of laws and regulations in 
the specific areas of health and safety, anti-bribery, employment 
law and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the 
nature of the group’s activities.  With the exception of any known 
or possible non-compliance, and as required by auditing 
standards, our work in respect of these was limited to enquiry of 
the directors and other management. We considered the effect 
of any known or possible non-compliance in these areas as part 
of our procedures on the related annual accounts items.
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout 
our team and remained alert to any indications of non-
compliance throughout the audit. This included communication 
from the group to component audit teams of relevant laws and 
regulations identified at group level, with a request to report on 
any indications of potential existence of non-compliance with 
relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) in these areas, or 
other areas directly identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection 
of non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations 
irregularities, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
controls.
8. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our 
responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required 
to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

121 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements
1.1 General information 
Vectura Group plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Group’s operations and 
principal activities are described in the Strategic report. The “Group” is defined as the Company, its subsidiaries and equity-accounted associates.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), 
as adopted by the European Union (“EU-IFRS”). These consolidated financial statements also comply with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board. 
The financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial 
instruments and the recognition of net assets acquired including contingent liabilities assumed through business combination assets 
at their fair value on the acquisition date, modified by the revaluation of certain items, as stated in the accounting policies. 
The Group’s activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business 
Review. The Group has made a loss for the year, however, it continues to be cash generative. A summary of the Group’s financial position, 
cash generated in the year and accounting loss made after non-cash amortisation charges is included within the Financial review. The Group 
has considerable financial resources together with long-term contracts with a number of customers across different geographic areas and 
jurisdictions. The Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, and as such they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual 
financial statements. 
The financial statements of the parent company, Vectura Group plc (UK company number 03418970), have been prepared in accordance with 
FRS 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework. The Company balance sheet is presented immediately after these consolidated financial statements 
which comprise the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated statement of other comprehensive income, Consolidated balance sheet, 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity, Consolidated cash flow statement and accompanying notes to the financial statements.
All financial information is presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1m. Previously issued financial information and other relevant 
resources are made available on our website: www.vectura.com.
1.2 Prior period Skyepharma merger and the comparability of financial periods 
The results of Skyepharma have been included in the 2016 nine-month comparative numbers from the date of the merger on 10 June 2016 
to 31 December 2016. In order to assist users to evaluate underlying trends and like for like performance given the differing comparative 
periods, the Directors have provided certain unaudited proforma information in the Financial review. 
1.3 Alternative performance measures (“APMs”)
Adjusted measures, which are used in these financial statements are also used by the Board and management for planning and reporting. 
These measures are also used in discussions with the investment analyst community. APMs are not displayed with more prominence, 
emphasis or authority than IFRS measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and amortisation, adding back charges for depreciation and 
share-based payments. Refer to note 8 “Adjusted EBITDA”.
Underlying revenues are core ongoing revenue streams relating to licence royalties, product supply revenues and share of net sales of EXPAREL
®
. 
Non-recurring revenues comprise project milestones and services which can vary significantly each period and discontinued end-of-life 
licence royalties, or royalties currently suspended owing to ongoing patent disputes. 
Exceptional items are presented whenever significant expenses are incurred or income is received as a result of events considered to be 
outside the normal course of business, where the unusual nature and expected infrequency merits separate presentation to assist comparisons 
with previous periods. Refer to note 10 “Exceptional items”. Items which are included within the exceptional category include:
• costs associated with major corporate transactions;
• Board-approved spend on the integration of major corporate transactions; and
• other major transformation programmes.
Furthermore, significant and unusual items of litigation (e.g. GSK litigation) and significant and unusual items which individually distort 
the underlying performance of the business and therefore warrant highlighting separately to the users of the accounts, e.g. one-off 
research and development project historical accruals release, are also included within exceptional items. 
1.4 Critical accounting areas of judgment and estimation
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, critical judgements in the application of accounting policies can have a significant 
effect on the financial results; moreover, any changes in critical estimates and assumptions made could materially impact the amounts 
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported next year as actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates or those 
estimates could change in future.
122 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements continued
1.4 Critical accounting areas of judgment and estimation continued
The following critical accounting judgements are made in the application of accounting policies:
Revenue recognition on collaborative development and marketing arrangements spanning multiple periods
The Group enters into a wide variety of collaborative agreements with partners which may span several reporting periods and involve 
multiple revenue streams. Significant judgement is often required in assessing the obligations under such contracts and the revenue and 
costs that are applicable to be allocated to each reporting period. For royalty income, judgement is exercised as management are not directly 
responsible for the sale of the product to the market they prepare an estimate of the level of royalties to be earned and compare this to 
external sales data reported by partners and royalty statements received. For product supply of flutiform
®
, the Group is reliant on a third-party 
supplier notifying the point at which the transfer of the risks and rewards occurs which is when the goods are “available for collection” 
by the licensing partner. The recognition of income from non-recurring milestones requires an assessment of the Group’s future obligations 
under the applicable contract, such as when development or sales targets have been met, to determine the most suitable revenue recognition 
profile. Further details are included in significant accounting policy 2.3 “Current revenue recognition” (on an IAS 18 Revenue basis).
Uncertain tax positions
A provision for an uncertain tax position is recognised within current tax liabilities relating to recent utilisation of historical losses claimed 
in an overseas jurisdiction. The provision is recognised on the basis of the Group’s interpretation of inherently complex tax legislation. 
The judgement of whether and how much to provide is formed after taking external professional advice, and is based on Management’s 
judgement of the potential tax that could be assessed as due. The provision is recognised at £5.0m (2016: £0.9m) in Corporation tax payable 
on the Balance sheet. This provision is partially released to the Consolidated income statement as each annual Statute of Limitation (when 
the tax authority can enquire into each return) is closed, with the uncertainty expected to be fully resolved by 2021. Refer to note 23 
“Provisions”.
This provision excludes any potential interest and penalties which could be levied on the Group. The Group have recognised a contingent 
liability in respect of penalties, which, based on external advice, could range from 0 to 40% of unpaid tax, with a maximum of 20% considered 
appropriate. This would result in estimated penalties of up to £1.0m, but this payment is not considered probable. Refer to note 31 
“Commitments and contingent liabilities”. 
The following critical estimates if changed next year would materially impact reported performance:
Impairment of intangible assets acquired through the Skyepharma and Activaero business combinations
Intangible assets are reviewed for indications of impairment and, where such indicators exist, a full impairment test is performed to ensure 
the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying value. Impairment tests are based on internal risk-adjusted future cash flows discounted 
to present value. Some of the more significant assumptions include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset or product, 
including net revenues, directly attributable costs, and the probability of successful commercialisation, the appropriate discount rate to select 
to measure the inherent risk in each future cash flow stream, and the assessment of each asset’s life cycle. 
As these valuations are based on Board-approved budgets they are inherently judgemental. The sensitivity of intangible assets to downside 
scenarios is presented within note 16 “Intangible assets”. 
Useful economic lives of intangible assets acquired through the Skyepharma and Activaero business combinations
Intangible assets relating to on-market products are amortised with reference to average patent lives in the most applicable territories. 
The key estimate is which patent or midpoint of the patents to use, due to the varying strength of the patents and different time periods 
for different territories. Given the size of the values any point in that range would have a significant impact. Intangible assets relating to 
smart nebuliser-based technology acquired through the Activaero acquisition and leveraged in various development programmes are 
amortised in line with the expected consumption of economic benefits. These may change, for example on approval of a product incorporating 
the technology and in such cases, the useful economic life (“UEL”) is reviewed and adjusted accordingly. If the UEL changes the Group’s 
financial statements would be significantly impacted through changes to amortisation and deferred tax.
Actuarial assumptions applied to the Swiss pension benefits in the application of accounting policies 
The Group operates a pension scheme in respect of its employees in Switzerland. As some of the risks of the scheme match the criteria 
under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits for a defined benefit plan, the scheme is accounted for as such. Application of IAS 19 involves estimates 
about uncertain future events based on independent actuarial valuation reports. The defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the actuarial 
assumptions outlined in note 24 “Retirement benefit obligations”. 
Deferred tax liabilities 
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities takes account of relevant timing differences and tax legislation in the appropriate jurisdiction. 
As the rate in Switzerland currently depends on the status of the company, an estimated blended rate is applied for deferred tax valuation 
which reflects the effective tax rate of the Swiss entities, and there has been no change to the estimate in 2017. The deferred tax liabilities 
relate to a number of specific items, of which the classes are disclosed in note 25 “Deferred tax liabilities”.
It should be noted that, whilst there is no current impact to the deferred tax balances recognised, or the rate applied, the deferred tax 
liabilities in respect of Switzerland are particularly sensitive to any future Swiss tax reform. As this is likely, future periods result could 
be materially impacted as a result of adopting the enacted Swiss tax rate from the reform. This disclosure is not a significant estimate 
in the scope of IAS 1.125, but is provided as an additional disclosure to highlight the potential impact of the Swiss tax reform. Refer to 
note 13 “Taxation”.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Significant accounting policies
2.1 Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Vectura Group plc, its subsidiaries and 
equity-accounted associates for the year ended 31 December 2017.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has direct or indirect control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the 
activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases. All of the Group’s material trading entities are wholly owned subsidiaries, where the Group holds 100% of the 
share capital. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Group accounting 
policies are consistently applied to all entities and transactions.
2.2 Foreign currency translation and transactions
Results of the Group’s overseas entities are translated into the UK sterling presentational currency of the Group using monthly average 
exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of overseas net assets are recognised in the translation 
reserve and recycled to the Consolidated income statement upon any full disposal.
Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the original cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which it was allocated on acquisition. Fair value 
adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities denominated in the currency of the 
overseas operation. Any exchange differences on intercompany funding loans are deferred to equity, to the extent that these are 
considered permanent in accordance with IAS 21 – Foreign Exchange. 
Trading entities have a functional currency consistent with the denomination of cash inflows and outflows, being also consistent with the 
primary currency of their location. Local market transactions in a different currency to each local functional currency are translated using 
average exchange rates, provided these are materially similar to the spot rate on the transaction date. These foreign exchange differences 
are recognised in the same category in the Consolidated income statement as the underlying transaction, except for milestone and royalty 
revenues, where foreign exchange is presented within net finance (expense)/income. 
2.3 Current revenue recognition (under existing IAS 18 – Revenue guidance) 
Revenue represents the amount receivable for goods and services provided and royalties earned, net of trade discounts, VAT and other 
sales-related taxes. Revenues from partnering contracts with multiple revenue streams or conditions are recognised separately in line with 
the contractual terms and the nature of the revenue streams.
Revenues are recognised when the Group’s obligations related to the revenues have been discharged and their collection is reasonably 
assured as follows: 
2.3.1 Royalty income
Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis and represents income earned as a percentage of partner product sales in accordance 
with the terms of each agreement, net of amounts payable to other licensees. As management are not directly responsible for the sale of 
the product to the market they prepare an estimate the level of royalties to be earned and compare this to external sales data reported by 
partners and royalty statements received.
2.3.2 Share of net sales of EXPAREL® 
The Group is entitled to receive a percentage of net sales of EXPAREL
®
 (based on cash received by Pacira) in the USA, Japan, UK, France, 
Germany, Italy and Spain until the expiry of certain patents. The recognition of these amounts is in line with the royalty income recognition 
as per 2.3.1. 
2.3.3 Signing and milestone payments
Signing and milestone payments represent amounts earned for licences or payments relating to development achievements.
Upfront signing milestones received on entering collaborative development agreements, as per industry practice, are deferred onto the 
Balance sheet and then subsequently released to revenue over the appropriate stage of completion of the development services provided.
Milestone payments received in advance are treated as deferred until the milestone is achieved. Milestones which are contingent upon 
achieving a development or sales target are recognised when achieving them is virtually certain and recovery is assured.
2.3.4 Development services
Development services revenues principally comprise of contract product development and contract clinical trial manufacturing fees invoiced 
to third parties. Revenues are recognised upon the completion of agreed tasks or spread over the duration of the task, as appropriate.
2.3.5 Product supply and device sales
Product supply revenues, being income derived from manufacturing and supply agreements, are generally recognised upon transfer 
to the customer of significant risks and rewards, usually upon the goods being available for collection and the customer being informed 
of this and where the sales price is agreed and collectability is reasonably assured.
124 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.4 Segmental reporting
The Group is managed on the basis of a single reportable segment, being the development and supply of pharmaceutical products. This is 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to, and regularly reviewed by, the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM is 
responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segment and has been identified as the Board.
2.5 Research and development (“R&D”) expenses
R&D expenses comprise internal employee costs and third-party service costs relating to feasibility studies, technical development, costs 
of chemistry, manufacturing of trial batches, clinical work and the registration and maintenance of intellectual property. As the nature 
of our R&D projects is associated with obtaining regulatory approval, these costs rarely meet the IAS 38 criteria for capitalisation and 
are normally charged to the Consolidated income statement as the expenses are incurred. 
2.6 Other income
Other income relates to government grants for qualifying UK R&D under the research and development expenditure credit (“RDEC”) 
scheme for large companies. Such grants are taxable and are presented as other income in the Consolidated income statement.
2.7 Current taxation
The net taxation credit on the loss for the year includes current and deferred tax. Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or 
receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. 
The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received using tax rates 
enacted at the reporting date. 
2.8 Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the local tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is not discounted and is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability 
is settled, based on legislation enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
2.9 Goodwill
On acquisition of a subsidiary or associate, the fair value of the consideration in excess of the identifiable net assets and liabilities is recognised 
as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently where there is an indication of 
possible impairment. 
Goodwill is held in the functional currency of the CGU to which it was originally allocated for impairment testing, reflecting the original 
assessment of which CGUs would benefit from synergies from the combination. Following any significant reorganisation the denomination 
of goodwill is not changed but could be reallocated to different CGUs, being the lowest identifiable level that goodwill is monitored for the 
purposes of annual impairment testing. 
2.10 Intangible assets
Intangible assets predominantly relate to on-market licences, patents and marketing rights separately acquired as part of the Skyepharma 
merger on 10 June 2016. The fair values of patents and licences relating to on-market products acquired were aggregated by product and 
initially measured at fair value. This fair value is subsequently amortised over estimated useful economic lives (“UEL”). Intangible assets 
relating to on-market products are amortised with reference to average patent lives in the most applicable territories.
Intangible assets also include smart nebuliser-based technology (FAVORITE™) separately acquired through the Activaero transaction on 
13 March 2014 and leveraged in development programmes including VR475 (FAVOLIR
®
) and VR647 (SCIPE
®
). These assets are amortised 
in line with the expected consumption of economic benefits. 
UEL assumptions do not exceed eight years and amortisation is applied on a straight-line basis.
2.11 Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”)
PP&E is initially recognised at cost, with depreciation subsequently applied evenly over its estimated life, less any residual value. PP&E 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, as follows:
• Land and buildings – 20 to 50 years
• Laboratory and supply chain equipment – 3 to 10 years
PP&E for the flutiform
®
 supply chain is depreciated using the units-of-production method. No depreciation is provided on freehold land or 
assets under construction. On disposal of PP&E, the carrying value, less any proceeds, is recognised in the Consolidated income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.12 Impairment of non-current assets
Impairment of goodwill is assessed by measuring the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates versus the carrying value 
of the CGU. An impairment loss is recognised for goodwill in the Consolidated income statement when the carrying value of the CGU is less 
than its future cash flows. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
The carrying values of all other non-current assets are reviewed for impairment, either on a standalone basis or as part of a larger 
cash-generating unit, when there is an indication that the assets might be impaired. 
2.13 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include the direct costs and, where applicable, an allocation of 
overheads incurred in bringing inventories to their current location and condition. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, 
less any further costs expected to complete the sale of goods.
2.14 Financial instruments
For the purposes of recognition and measurement financial assets are classified into one of these categories:
• Trading activities: assets that are held for collection of contractual trading cash flows are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss is 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement only when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income is included in finance 
income using the effective interest rate method if applicable. 
• Financial assets held for future sale: assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“OCI”). 
In instances where the financial assets meets neither category, they are measured at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”). Due to 
the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their invoice amount as interest is 
not applicable to the contract. 
For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised 
from initial recognition of the receivables. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
2.15 Provisions 
Provisions are liabilities where the exact timing and amount of the obligation is uncertain. Provisions are recognised when the Group has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past events, when an outflow of resources is probable to settle the obligation and 
when an amount can be reliably estimated. 
Where the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to current values using appropriate rates of interest. The unwinding 
of the discounts is recorded in net finance income or expense.
2.16 Retirement obligations
The Group’s obligations for its Swiss pension scheme are to pay defined contributions. However, in accordance with the Swiss law  
“LPP/BVG”, the pension scheme incorporates certain guarantees, and has therefore been reported as a defined benefit pension plan 
in accordance with IFRS.
Pension obligations are measured as the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high-quality 
corporate bonds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit 
liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. 
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a participant is curtailed, the resulting gain or loss on curtailment is recognised 
immediately in the Consolidated income statement. 
2.17 Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of employee equity-settled share-based compensation plans as part of the Total Reward Strategy. Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the awards is expensed 
over the vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of awards that will eventually vest. The cost of equity-settled share transactions 
is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period. 
2.18 Employee share trusts 
The Group provides finance to ESOP trusts to either purchase company shares on the open market, or to subscribe for newly issued share 
capital, to meet the Group’s obligation to provide shares when employees exercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP 
trusts are charged to the Consolidated income statement. Shares held by the ESOP trusts are deducted from reserves and presented in 
equity as own shares until such time that an employee exercises their award. 
2.19 Share buyback and cancellation programme
As repurchased shares are cancelled immediately after being bought back, the amount of the consideration paid and directly attributable 
costs are booked to retained earnings. 
126 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.20 New accounting requirements
Adopted in the period – IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 
The Group adopted IFRS 9 on 1 January 2017, albeit it had no financial impact on either the current or comparative period. IFRS 9 addresses 
the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and introduces new rules for hedge accounting, 
a new impairment model for financial assets and early recognition of expected credit losses.
The Group is not involved with complex financial instruments, has not to date applied hedge accounting, nor has any history of material 
credit losses. As such, the only impact of adoption has been on disclosures. IFRS 9 provides a new hedge accounting model which is 
optional to apply and is closer aligned to commercial activities, such that it may in the future be applied if the Board deem applicable. 
Refer to note 26 “Financial instruments”.
Adopted in the period – IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration 
IFRIC 22 clarifies the date of the transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of advanced 
payments for assets or liabilities for deferred income. This guidance has been adopted in advance of formal EU endorsement, which is 
expected imminently, as it provides additional clarification to the application of existing accounting policies rather than any amendments 
to those policies. 
The date that payments are made is the reference date for foreign exchange and should not be remeasured for changes in exchange rates 
occurring afterwards on the date of recognition of the transaction to which that consideration relates.
2.21 New standards not adopted that will be adopted in the next reporting period
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
The Group will have to apply IFRS 15 to the next reporting period as it will be mandatory to do so. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive 
framework for determining whether, when and how much revenue is recognised in each reporting period, which is particularly relevant 
for longer-term development, licensing and marketing contracts. 
Transitional impact of IFRS 15 on Vectura – cumulative effect method
The Group has performed an IFRS 15 assessment on all revenue contracts, taking advantage of the practical expedient available removing 
the requirement to apply IFRS 15 to contracts that are considered completed on 1 January 2018. 
A contract is considered complete once all performance obligations relevant to the receipt of future revenues have been satisfied. 
This applies to all royalties for licences of on-market products. The existing IAS 18 treatment is maintained, which is compliant with 
IFRS 15 guidance for sales and usage-based license royalties. 
Product supply performance obligations arise on receipt of customer purchase orders to transfer inventory to the customer. As there is only 
one performance obligation to allocate revenues across, the new guidance will not generate a difference (consistent with the current treatment). 
However, 2017 revenues are estimated to be £0.5m higher on an IFRS 15 basis due to accelerated recognition of development revenues, 
but this review is ongoing. It is not expected that IFRS 15 will result in a material impact on underlying core revenue streams (royalties, 
product supply and share of net sales). Because the impact of this transitional adjustment is limited, the Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using 
the cumulative effect method through equity as opposed to restating the 2017 comparative when reporting the 2018 results. 
Impact of IFRS 15 on subsequent periods
Previous industry practice was to spread upfront signing milestones over the development period, on a basis consistent with the service 
being provided, irrespective of whether a licence is transferred on signing. However, IFRS 15 requires an assessment be made of how 
much of the signing milestone relates to R&D services and how much relates to the licence. The revenue allocated to the licence performance 
obligation will be recognised when the licence is transferred, which is normally upon signing consistent with current treatment, and the 
amount allocated to R&D services will be recognised as that service is delivered. 
The Group is required to identify performance obligations in its agreements under IFRS 15. In certain cases, performance obligations 
identified under an IFRS 15 assessment may differ from those under the current accounting policy assessments, thereby altering the 
timing of revenue recognition and classification between income streams. 
Acceleration of development milestones where future receipt is considered probable: the receipt of future development-stage milestones 
will be accelerated to the extent that their future receipt is considered highly probable and significant reversal of revenue will not occur in 
the future.
It is therefore expected that a significantly higher proportion of signing milestones will be recognised immediately on entering into new 
collaborative arrangements.
2.22 New standards not adopted mandatory at 1 January 2019 
The following standards and interpretations are mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with early adoption possible. 
At present the Group has not adopted these but indicates the likely future impact below.
IFRS 16 – Leases 
IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and introduces a single lessee accounting model 
where the lessee is required to recognise assets and liabilities for all material leases that have a term of greater than a year. There are 
recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. The Group has completed an initial impact assessment on its 
consolidated financial statements but has not yet completed its detailed assessment.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.22 New standards not adopted mandatory at 1 January 2019 continued 
IFRS 16 – Leases continued
The Group has operating lease commitments of £6.6m (2016: £7.5m) as disclosed in note 31 “Commitments and contingent liabilities”. 
The IFRS 16 lease liability is expected to be in the region of £4.5m on initial recognition based on the current lease portfolio. A corresponding 
asset of approximately £2.5m reflecting the Group’s right to use the asset will also be recognised. Rental charges of approximately £1.0m 
will be recognised outside of adjusted EBITDA, replaced with additional interest and depreciation of a similar value. As a detailed assessment 
has yet to be performed it is unclear what other adjustments, if any, will be required upon initial adoption.
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 
IFRIC 23 has been issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty within tax positions. This guidance precedes significant changes expected 
to tax legislation across a number of jurisdictions applicable to locations in which the Group operates. The application of a weighted average 
probability to the interpretation of uncertain country-specific tax legislation would not materially reduce the value of assets and liabilities 
recognised in these consolidated financial statements.
However, it is not possible to assess how this new guidance will impact reported tax balances from 2019 onwards.
A far-reaching proposal to reform the current Swiss tax regime currently lacks clarification as to the application and transitional 
arrangements at both federal and cantonal level. It also remains unclear as to the terms and timing of the planned UK exit from the 
European Union and the associated impact on tax legislation. 
2.23 Comparative period accounting for the Skyepharma merger (the “merger”)
The acquisition method of accounting was applied to Skyepharma on the merger date with assets and liabilities recognised at their fair

Post-merger integration costs include £2.7m (2016: £3.0m) of one-off instances of spend on projects required to combine the two businesses. 
This primarily relates to human resources, finance and information technology and costs from a third-party consultancy to harmonise 
ways of working and enhance productivity across the UK, Swiss and German R&D functions. 
In addition, post-merger integration costs include a share-based payment charge of £1.8m (2016: £0.5m). Upon completion of the merger, 
1,490,982 exceptional nominal awards were granted to key members of management considered critical to the integration process. These 
awards vest in full provided that an 18-month or 36-month service condition is met from their September 2016 grant date. The grant date 
fair value was £1.41 per share and the total share-based payment charge, reduced when lapses occur, is expensed evenly.
As part of the merger integration and alignment, management has performed a detailed review of the research and development accruals 
during 2017, including historical accruals. This activity identified a number of individually immaterial historic accruals where it is no longer 
considered probable that these accruals will result in future cash outflows. The accruals, totalling £2.2m, have been released in the 2017 
Consolidated income statement and are presented within exceptional items to enable users to understand the impact of the credit on the 
current year performance. Management has determined that there is no material impact of the accruals on any comparative income 
statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement.

11. Associates
During the year the carrying values of the associates were fully written off to £nil (2016: £1.7m) owing to share of losses and other 
charges recognised in the Consolidated income statement of £3.4m (2016: £0.4m credit). 
The Group does not recognise further losses as it currently has no future obligations to fund future losses or to make payments on behalf 
of the other entity. 
Ventaleon GmbH 
Following expenditure associated with Phase Ib and Phase II clinical trials, the Group’s share of Ventaleon’s losses for the year to 31 December 2017 
was £1.5m (2016: £0.4m credit), inclusive of £0.1m foreign exchange gain. The Group impaired the remaining value of £0.3m. 
Tianjin Kinnovata Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd
During the year, the Group received confirmation that the Chinese State authorities had approved the valuation of assets contributed by 
Vectura to this associate in return for a 37.84% share in Tianjin Kinnovata Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Kinnovata”). The investment 
is held through Innovata (HK) Limited. Refer to parent company financial statements note 6 “Subsidiary, associate and dormant 
undertakings” for details of the classes of shares held through the sub-structure.
Kinnovata will develop, manufacture and commercialise the Clickhaler
®
 and Duohaler
®
 respiratory products for the Chinese market. Vectura 
contributed the intellectual property associated with Clickhaler
®
 and Duohaler
®
 and will be entitled to a 5% royalty on future net sales. 
During the year contributions of £1.6m, comprising £0.6m for new equipment and a £1.0m waiver of a loan outstanding, were made. 
These transactions are considered to be at arms-length. The Group is not committed to making any further contributions and Vectura’s 
share could be diluted if it does not participate in future capital raises. 
No value of future benefit is attributed to the investment and no gain is recognised as a result of Vectura’s contribution.

Deferred taxation (note 25) 22.0 11.0
Net taxation credit 16.5 8.0
Deferred taxation charges of £1.4m (2016: £0.9m) were also recognised in other comprehensive income. 
Current taxation arises from trading profits generated in Switzerland and the US. Deferred tax relates predominantly to credits arising 
on the unwinding of tax liabilities on the intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of Activaero and the Skyepharma merger. 
The Group’s effective tax rate (“ETR”) before OCI is a 16.15% credit. This equates to the applicable UK tax rate of 19.25%, adjusted 
for a number of factors discussed below. 
The implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s guidelines on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
(“BEPS”) is not expected to impact the Group’s tax position.
UK taxation
The UK sub-group is loss making and benefits from the R&D expenditure credit (“RDEC”). The RDEC is subject to UK corporation tax and 
therefore is included within the Consolidated income statement and presented as other income. Refer to note 7 ”Other income”. In addition, 
UK companies are able to participate in the UK Patent Box regime, the benefit of which is expected to increase as new products are approved. 
The UK corporation tax rate has reduced to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017, and will reduce to 17% from 1 April 2020, which has been 
substantively enacted. The impact on the Group accounts is expected to be immaterial.
US taxation
Taxable income arises in respect of the percentage of net sales received from EXPAREL
®
. Vectura expects its future US after-tax earnings 
to be positively impacted by the recently enacted changes to US corporate taxes, largely due to the reduction of the US federal corporate 
income tax rate from 35% to 21% (effective 1 January 2018) which will be applied to the final contingent $32m milestone. The ultimate 
impact of the change in the US corporate tax rate is under review. The lowering of the US corporate income tax rate to 21% resulted in 
a reduction in the value of Vectura’s US deferred tax liabilities. A credit to the Consolidated income statement of £1.6m was recognised 
as a result. The Group does not recognise any deferred tax assets in respect of the US, and therefore no adjustment to the carrying value 
for the rate change was required. 
Swiss taxation
Vectura continues to monitor the impact of Swiss corporate tax reform. On 6 September 2017, the Swiss Federal Council indicated that tax 
proposal 17 (“TP17”) shall be dispatched to the Parliament in spring 2018. The Group monitors the situation closely and, while the overall 
tax burden is unlikely to change materially, there are a number of complex provisions in the legislation and a number of areas yet to be 
finalised and hence, once enacted, will likely cause an adjustment to the amounts recognised in these consolidated financial statements.
Effective tax rate (“ETR”)
In Switzerland and the US, the Group is profitable and subject to taxation at the local rates (Swiss ETR 8.5% charge, and the US corporate 
rate applied is 34% (ETR 2017: 42.9% charge)). The uncertain tax position disclosed has increased by £4.1m in the year (which includes a 
prior period adjustment following a change in basis as advised by the Group’s tax advisors). These charges, along with a significant credit 
(ETR: 17.6% credit) in respect of deferred tax liabilities relating to intangible assets acquired on the Skyepharma and Activaero acquisitions 
(refer to note 25 “Deferred tax liabilities”), together drive the Group’s ETR of 16.15% (credit).

The ETR is expected to remain in the low-teens (credit) percentage rate in the short to medium term as a result of reduced loss relief available 
to offset against taxable profits, as well as the expected increase in the Swiss tax rate following the proposed reform. The significant credit 
in respect of deferred tax liabilities on intangibles acquired is expected to continue in the short to medium term and this will continue to 
drive a credit ETR.

At end of the period 161.4 162.8
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model. Fair value less costs of 
disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post-tax 
cash flows and terminal value.
The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of 9% (2016: 9%) as assessed by external experts. 
Management considers this to be its best approximation of a market participant rate as required by IAS 36. The discount rate is adjusted 
for specific country or currency risks but at present, as both cash-generating units have global large pharmaceutical partners, operations 
and/or customers in each other’s territory, share access to short-term funding through the revolving credit facility (“RCF”), it is considered 
that the same discount rate should be applied to each CGU. There is currency risk associated with Switzerland, there is risk in the UK associated 
with Brexit and in the medium term both countries are expected to be closely affiliated with, but outside of, the European Union. 
Cash flows are based on the most recent budget approved by the Board covering 2018 and 2019 and the Ten-Year Plan to 2027. 
Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests of the cash-generating units are as follows:
Valuation basis Fair value less cost of disposal
Key assumptions Time to develop and launch pipeline products
Net sales forecasts and related royalty inflows
Milestones for pipeline products
Profit margins for product supply
Terminal growth rate
Discount rate
Taxation rate
Determination of assumptions Net sales forecasts are determined from partner forecasts and external market data.
Milestone amounts and royalty rates reflect past experience and forecast sales potential 
determined from external market data 
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes. Terminal growth rates based on 
management’s estimate of future long-term average growth rates. 
Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate. Taxation rates based on 
appropriate rates for each region.
Specific projected cash flow period Ten years (reflecting a longer term planning cycle)
Terminal growth rate nil
Discount rate 9%
The available headroom for the UK and Germany CGU has reduced versus 31 December 2016 following the delay in approval for VR315 (US). 
In addition, headroom for the Swiss CGU is lower as a result of stopping the development of VR2076. 
The Group conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value. The Group considered 12% to be a 
reasonably possible downside sensitivity. While this reduces headroom, it does not alter management’s assessment of future impairment 
risk, which is not considered significant. The UK and German CGU valuation indicates sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible 
change in a key assumption is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill. The forecasts would need to reduce in excess of 
70% primarily because this CGU comprises internally generated intangibles which are included in the valuation, but not the carrying value 
of the assets comprising the CGU.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

15. Goodwill continued
The Swiss CGU also shows significant headroom. It has been calculated that a 33% reduction in the forecast or a 10% reduction in the forecast 
using a 12% discount rate would likely cause goodwill impairment next year, but, as this assessment excludes the impact of any new business 
or upside in existing business, the risk of this happening is considered remote. Impairment of this CGU has been removed as a critical accounting 
estimate this year principally because the intangible assets are being amortised and each year the risk of impairment decreases.
IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets requires the use of pre-tax cash flows and pre-tax discount rates. However, discounting post-tax cash flows 
at a post-tax discount rate should give materially the same result when there are neither temporary differences nor available tax losses at 
the measurement date.

 products, other 
marketed products and VR2076 (now fully impaired). These intangible assets are being amortised over a period of between two and seven 
years with reference to average applicable patent lives in the Group’s main territories. 
Inhaled in-market assets include a large number of acquired licences, patents, know-how agreements and marketing rights, which are in 
use, and the Group receives royalties or product supply revenue from these. Non-inhaled in-market assets include a large number of near 
end-of-life acquired licences, patents, know-how agreements and marketing rights, which are in use, and from which the Group continues 
to receive royalties. 
Intangible assets also include smart nebuliser-based technology (FAVORITE™) separately acquired through the Activaero transaction on 
13 March 2014 and leveraged in development programmes including VR475 (FAVOLIR®) and VR647 (SCIPE®). These assets are amortised 
in line with the consumption of economic benefits. 
In December 2017 Mundipharma informed the Group of its decision to stop the development of the pMDI triple therapy for asthma and 
COPD (VR2076), in an early formulation phase. As an acquired programme from the Skyepharma merger, VR2076 had a book value of 
£8.7m, which accordingly has been fully impaired.

The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis based on reasonably possible downsides on the value-in-use calculations used for 
impairment testing. 
For the flutiform
®
 intangible, three downside scenarios were performed being (1) a 10% reduction in revenues due to volume changes 
(2) a 5% reduction in the percentage margin from customer supply or raw material price changes and (3) an increase in the discount rate 
from 8% to 9%. The first two sensitivity scenarios result in impairment while the third sensitivity results in a break-even position. The risk 
of future impairment from these downside scenarios is mitigated by future amortisation of the flutiform
®
 intangible. 
For VR475 (FAVOLIR
®
) and VR647 (SCIPE
®
), a reduction in probability of reaching market from 74% to 60% would not trigger any impairment. 
A 20% reduction in net sales forecasts would also not cause impairment of either asset. A 5% reduction in the forecast percentage royalty 
from partnering VR475 (FAVOLIR
®
) and a 20% reduction in the value of forecast milestones from partnering VR647 (SCIPE
®
) would not 
trigger impairment. 
For the EXPAREL
®
 intangible, a two year delay in the forecast receipt of the $32.0m milestone would not result in impairment.

Land valued at £5.1m (2016: £5.1m) is not depreciated. The Group has invested £11.7m in capital expenditure (2016: £3.1m) mainly in 
manufacturing equipment to support the production of flutiform
®
, the development of oral tablet production in Lyon and laboratory equipment. 
In January 2017, the Group’s investment in expanding the capacity of flutiform
®
 at the Sanofi manufacturing facility in Holmes Chapel, 
previously classified as an asset under construction, became fully operational and accordingly was reclassified to supply chain equipment. 
Transfers to other non-current assets relate to manufacturing equipment, located at a supplier site that will no longer be used by the Group. 
Instead a future sale at a minimum of book value has been agreed with the development partner. Refer to note 18 “Other non-current 
assets”. Assets under construction at the reporting date relate to replacement tooling equipment and, also associated with the production 
of flutiform

Non-current financial assets principally include £5.8m (2016: nil) of amounts receivable from a development partner for manufacturing 
equipment which Vectura has funded. The development partner has agreed to reimburse Vectura for the original costs incurred, although 
the exact timing of recovery is dependent upon other contractual terms and contingent events, with the earliest possible repayment being 
on 1 May 2020.
Nevertheless, as the cost recovery has been contractually agreed, it is considered certain and therefore the item has been classified as a 
financial asset at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The asset was previously classified as an asset under construction 
at historical cost of £6.4m, and will unwind to that previous value in 2020. The financing charge on transfer has been recorded in the 
Consolidated income statement. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised on differences between the tax base in the IFRS accounts for IAS 19 pension liabilities and certain 
contingent liabilities related to the profitable Swiss operations.

The carrying values of trade receivables approximate their fair values because these balances are expected to be cash settled in the near 
future unless a provision is made. 
In determining the expected credit losses for these assets, the Group has taken into account the historical default experience and the 
financial position of the counterparties, as well as the future prospects considering various external sources of actual and forecast 
economic information, as appropriate, in estimating the probability of default of each of these financial assets occurring within their 
respective loss assessment time horizon.
The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires the use of the 
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. 
The expected credit loss allowance provision at 31 December 2017 is determined below as follows and incorporates forward looking information:

Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. Employee provisions include French statutory one-off lump sum payments due 
on the retirement of employees at the Group’s manufacturing facility in Lyon, France.
Property provisions have been established in respect of an onerous lease in Switzerland and the commitment to restore the Group’s leased 
R&D facilities in Chippenham to their original 2012 condition in 2027. Other provisions relate to the best estimate of certain contractual 
liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date and in the comparative period related to exceptional redundancy costs which were fully 
utilised during the year. Refer to note 10 “Exceptional items”. The uncertain tax provision of £5.0m (2016: £0.9m) is included in corporation 
tax payable and is therefore not reflected above.

The Swiss sub-Group has affiliated itself with PKG Pensionskasse for the provision of its occupational pension for its employees and 
pension recipients. The pension scheme provides benefits in the case of disability, death, old age and termination. The risk benefits are 
defined in relation to the pensionable salary. The retirement pension is calculated based on the projected savings capital with interest 
and a conversion rate.
The highest corporate body of the foundation is the Board of Trustees. It handles the general management of the pension scheme, 
ensures compliance with the statutory requirements, defines the strategic objectives and policies of the pension scheme and identifies 
the resources for their implementation. It determines the objectives and principles of the asset management and the implementation 
and monitoring of the investment process.
The Board of Trustees of the PKG pension fund announced in December 2017 that:
• active policyholders’ retirement assets will earn 2.25% interest as of 31 December 2017; and
• further reduction in the relevant pension conversion (into an annuity) rates to 5.4% (2016: 6.0%).
Vectura, as an employer, matches employees’ contributions to the scheme on a monthly basis. The amount of contributions to be paid by 
the employer and employee are determined by the Board of Trustees or the pension fund commission such that on retirement participants 
can chose to receive a cash lump sum or convert their savings capital into an annuity to be paid monthly over the course of their retirement. 
The law (Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Plans and its associated ordinances) provides for 
minimum pension benefits and also a minimum amount for the savings contributions. The amount of the contributions to be paid by the 
employer and the employee is determined by the highest corporate body and/or the pension fund commission. These can exceed the 
statutory minimum. The employer contribution must be at least as high as the employee contributions.

Other includes higher risk investments such as commodities or emerging market investments. Despite the IFRS IAS 19 requirement to 
recognise these assets, they are not controlled by the Group but by the Swiss pension fund.
The pension fund manages these in accordance with Swiss pension regulations to generate a higher return on the fund but does not provide 
any further details as to the composition of the assets or, for example, the quoted prices of equity held in the fund (as such Vectura is 
unable to disclose quoted equity prices as required by IAS 19.142). 
The latest asset coverage ratio of 107.4% published by the fund, to which the assets prices relate, is not relevant to Vectura as the Group’s 
share of assets in the fund is capped at the level of participant savings contribution. Therefore, the Group will not share in any upside on 
the significantly larger quasi-governmental asset pool. Expected contributions to post-employment benefit plans for the period ending 
31 December 2018 are £0.8m (2017: £0.6m).

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The sole exception is the variation of the discount rate with 
simultaneous variation of the interest rate for projection of savings capital.
Defined contribution plans – UK and Germany
In addition the Group operates various defined contribution plans for its employees in the UK and Germany. The Group’s contributions 
to these plans are charged to the Consolidated income statement in the year to which they relate, and the assets are held in separate 
trustee-administered funds. The charge to the Consolidated income statement in relation to defined contribution plans is £2.0m as 
disclosed in note 6 “Employees”.
25. Deferred tax liabilities

Foreign exchange 2.2 0.3 — 2.5
At 31 December 2017 (45.6) (6.0) (1.9) (53.5)
Deferred tax liabilities associated with the Skyepharma merger and Activaero intangible assets unwind to offset the tax distortion that 
would otherwise occur as the assets are amortised. Deferred tax liabilities on Swiss and US unrealised foreign exchange gains arise 
on permanent funding loans because foreign exchange gains are deferred on the local balance sheet in accordance with Swiss and US 
laws. A deferred tax asset on German tax losses of £5.3m (2016: £4.3m) has been offset against the deferred tax liability on Activaero 
intangible assets. 
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets on tax losses amounting to £226.2m (2016: £187.9m). The majority of the losses are unlikely 
to offset taxable profits as they mostly relate to non-trading losses in Investment holding companies. There are no current plans to recover 
these losses in the foreseeable future. 
Following the recently-enacted US tax changes and the lowering of the US corporate income tax rate to 21%, revaluation of Vectura’s US 
deferred tax liabilities has occurred. The impact in the current year is a one-off non-cash credit to the Consolidated income statement of 
£1.6m. Refer to note 13 “Taxation”.
143 Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Vectura Group plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
26. Financial instruments
In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments (as revised in July 2014). IFRS 9 introduces three new requirements 
for 1) the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, 2) the impairment of financial assets and 3) general 
hedge accounting. 
Vectura is not a financial institution and does not have any complex financial instruments. Vectura does not apply hedge accounting and 
the Group’s customers are considered creditworthy and pay consistently within agreed payments terms. As such, other than on disclosures, 
IFRS 9 is not assessed as having a significant impact on the Group. Details of these new requirements as well as their impact are described 
as follows. 
Area Impact of IFRS 9 adoption
Classification and 
measurement
Reclassification of financial assets into the IFRS 9 categories has had no overall impact on their respective 
measurement bases.
Impairment of  
financial assets
New requirements to recognise expected credit losses on day one are not expected to materially impact the Group, 
whose customer base typically has favourable credit history and significant cash resources. One bad debt was fully 
provided for as soon as loss was expected in the prior period and hence no restatement of the comparative is 
required. In future, any impairment on debtors will need separate disclosure on an income statement line item, 
with debtors ageing analysis to be provided in the disclosure note.
Hedge accounting Vectura currently does not apply hedge accounting at present, and has not done so in previous periods. 
On 1 January 2017, the Group has assessed which business models apply to the financial assets held by the Group on 1 April 2016, 
the date of initial application of IFRS 9, and has classified its financial instruments into the appropriate IFRS 9 categories. 
The initial application of IFRS 9 has not had any impact on the Group’s financial assets as regards their classification and measurement:
31 December
 2017 
£m
31 December 
2016
£m
Cash and cash equivalents held at amortised cost 103.7 92.5
Trade receivables and accrued income held at amortised cost 24.6 41.1
Financial assets at amortised cost 6.0 0.2
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (53.3) (58.0)
81.0 75.8
The following items are not financial instruments as defined by IFRS 9 
(a) prepayments made/advances received (right to receive future good or service, not cash or a financial asset)
(b) tax receivables and payables and similar items (statutory rights or obligations, not contractual), or 
(c) deferred revenue and warranty obligations (obligation to deliver goods or services, not cash or financial assets).
Impairment of financial assets
In relation to the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model as opposed to an incurred credit loss model 
under IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The expected credit loss model requires the Group to account for expected 
credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of 
the financial assets. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised.
IFRS 9 allows a simplified approach for measuring the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for trade 
receivables and contract assets. 
The Group has three types of financial assets subject to the expected credit loss model:
• trade receivables for sales of inventory;
• trade receivables for R&D services; and
• accrued royalty and milestone income.
The Group was required to revise its impairment methodology under IFRS 9 for each of these classes of assets. There was no impact of the 
change in impairment methodology on the carrying values disclosed. 
Provisions against impaired assets are disclosed in note 20 “Trade and other receivables”.
1 44 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26. Financial instruments continued
Impairment of financial assets continued
a. Credit risk
The impairment provisions for financial assets disclosed in note 18 “Other non-current assets” are based on assumptions about risk of 
default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment 
calculation, based on the Group’s past history and existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each 
reporting period. 
b. Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the 
return to stakeholders. The capital structure of the Group consists of equity (as disclosed in the Consolidated statement of changes in 
equity), retained earnings, cash and cash equivalents (note 21 ”Cash and cash equivalents”), an RCF (note 21 ”Cash and cash equivalents”) 
and a Swiss property mortgage (note 22 “Trade and other payables”). The Group seeks to manage its capital through an appropriate mix 
of these items. At 31 December 2017, and to the date that these financial statements were issued, no funds were drawn against the RCF.
c. Financial risk management
The primary risks that the Group is exposed to through its use of financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit 
risk. Board authorisation is required for all significant agreements that may affect the Group risk structure. It is, and has been throughout 
the year, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments is undertaken. 
d. Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Group 
manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and by continually monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the 
maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s policy is to maintain continuity of funding through available cash and cash 
equivalents, an RCF and through the issue of shares where appropriate. 
e. Currency risk management
The Group’s presentation currency is sterling. The Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the assets of foreign subsidiaries 
whose functional currencies differ from that of the Group. The Group’s primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the Swiss franc, 
euro and US dollar. The Group aims to minimise balance sheet translation exposures, where it is practical to do so, by funding subsidiaries 
with long-term loans, on which exchange differences are taken to reserves. 
The Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency. These exposures are not hedged. 
Exposures also arise from foreign currency-denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries. The Group’s policy is to offset 
such currency exposure by matching foreign currency revenues with expenditure in the same foreign currency. Where there are no imminent 
foreign currency-denominated transactions, the surplus foreign currency cash balances are exchanged for the functional currency of the 
subsidiary. Where it has not been possible to use natural hedges, currency options and forward currency contracts may be used. No options 
or forward contracts have been entered into in the period (2016: none). 
A 10% strengthening of the euro, sterling, the US dollar and Swiss franc functional currencies within the Group against non-functional 
currencies of its subsidiaries would result in the loss before taxation being £7.0m lower and items recognised directly in other comprehensive 
income being £14.6m higher. A 10% weakening would have an equal but opposite effect on loss before taxation and other comprehensive 
income. The Group considers a 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its 
subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
27. Prior period business combination – Skyepharma merger 
On 10 June 2016, an all-share merger (the “merger”) between Vectura and Skyepharma was completed by way of a scheme of arrangement 
of Skyepharma. Immediately following the transaction, on a fully diluted basis, the previous shareholders of Vectura owned 61.3% of the 
enlarged Group, with the previous shareholders of Skyepharma owning 38.7%. These percentages are broadly proportional to the revised 
Board structure.
Under the terms of the merger, Skyepharma shareholders received 2.7977 Vectura shares in exchange for each Skyepharma share held, 
with the option to take a partial cash alternative for a portion of their shareholding, which in aggregate was capped at £70.0m. The final 
uptake of this partial cash alternative was £52.1m. As Skyepharma had £27.1m of net cash on the acquisition date balance sheet, the net 
cash outflow before transaction costs was £25.0m.

Net assets acquired 48.5 326.2 374.7
A: Intangible assets: Skyepharma previously did not generally recognise internally generated intangible assets. IFRS 3 requires purchased 
intangible assets to be recognised at fair value. The intangible assets acquired by Vectura were valued by independent external experts on 
the basis of the net present value of income streams less costs associated with those streams. 
B: Property, plant and equipment: fair value adjustments on land, buildings and equipment in Switzerland and France were recognised 
based upon property valuations obtained from independent external experts. 
C: Deferred taxation: deferred tax liabilities were recognised in relation to the fair value uplift on net assets such that the notional tax 
consequence of amortisation can be matched to the period in which the amortisation occurs. 
D: Inventories: inventories were uplifted to their fair value and have subsequently been sold through.
E: Trade and other payables and provisions: this relates to the recognition of contingent liabilities required by IFRS 3. On acquisition, 
Skyepharma was committed to make certain payments to a development partner contingent upon future receipt of sales milestones and 
royalties received, with the payments deducted from these amounts receivable from the partner. Accordingly, a liability of £6.6m was 
recognised and is expected to unwind by the end of 2020. There was no difference between the fair value and the carrying value of trade 
and other receivables at the merger date.

On 14 November 2017, the Group announced that the Board has approved a share buyback to return up to £15m of capital to shareholders. 
The Board believes that, in addition to the implementation of the current investment strategy, the buyback reflects strong financial 
management discipline and is an efficient allocation of capital.
At 31 December 2017, 1,422,503 shares had been repurchased at a weighted average price of 95p per share. A total of £1.34m has been 
returned to shareholders to date. Directly attributable costs of £11,240 has been expensed to equity. On 28 February 2018 the programme 
was completed. Refer to note 33 “Post balance sheet events”.

In 2016 the main Board Directors received LTIP grants worth 250% of salary subject to performance over three and five-year periods. 
The performance condition was subject to two relative TSR metrics, against the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and financial services 
companies) and a bespoke sector peer group.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
29. Share-based payments continued
Equity-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) including restricted stock awards (“RSA”) continued
In 2017, L TIPs granted to Executive Directors were reduced to 185% of salary (74% of 2016 levels), with the removal of the five-year performance 
element and changes to the vesting scale for TSR. Half of this three-year performance continues to be measured subject to a relative TSR 
metric against the FTSE 250 (excluding real estate and financial services). The remaining half of the award will be subject to a three-year 
cumulative adjusted EBITDA target as set by the Remuneration Committee. 
Employees at the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) level were granted LTIPs at 105% of salary. 35% of these awards were subject to 
the same TSR and adjusted EBITDA metrics as the main Board participants, with the remaining 70% classified as restricted stock awards. 
Below ELT, and where applicable, participants receive awards entirely of restricted stock options. 
Restricted stock awards are subject to service conditions, i.e. the requirement for recipients of awards to remain in employment with Vectura 
over the three-year vesting period and subject to a personal performance underpin. Any vested shares granted to the main Board member 
and Executive Leadership Team must be held for two years after vesting. 
The treatment of vesting and non-vesting conditions attached to awards in the valuation process varies in accordance with the requirements 
of IFRS 2. For the year ended 31 December 2017, the calculation of the grant date fair value for the total shareholder return was as follows:
Number of TSR awards granted 1,114,638
Service condition 3 years
Holding condition 2 years
Share price on grant date 117.6p
Exercise (nominal) price 0.025p
The TSR condition (50% of the 2017 award and all of the 2016 award) is a market-based performance condition; this has been incorporated 
into the fair value calculation and no subsequent adjustments may be made. 
For awards subject to a TSR condition, volatility is calculated over the period of time commensurate with the remainder of the performance 
period immediately prior to the date of grant being 28.12% (2016: 27.24%). The risk-free interest rate obtainable from government securities 
(i.e. gilts in the UK) over a period commensurate with the expected term was 0.09% (2016: 0.13%) and there was no dividend yield 
expected (2016: nil). 
The adjusted EBITDA condition (50% of the 2017 awards for main Board and ELT) is a non-market condition; the fair value calculation is 
adjusted at each period end for the likelihood of the number of shares that will ultimately vest. All awards require recipients to remain in 
employment with the Company over the vesting period. For the LTIP and RSA awards that will be subject to a holding period, the Chaffe 
model (an at-market put option variant of the Black-Scholes model) has been used to determine a discount for the lack of marketability. 
For the below ELT RSA awards, the probability of the non-market-based underpin condition being achieved does not need to be incorporated 
into the fair value at date of grant, but is evaluated periodically to true up the estimate for the number of awards expected to vest. 
Exceptional share-based awards
Share-based payments within exceptional items were £1.8m (2016: £0.5m). Upon completion of the merger 1,490,982 exceptional nil-cost 
awards were granted to key members of management, excluding Executive Directors, considered critical to the integration process. These 
awards vest in full provided that an 18-month or 36-month service condition from their date of grant on 22 September 2016 and personal 
performance targets are met. 
There are no performance conditions associated with these awards. The grant date fair value was £1.41 per share and the total share-based 
payment charge, assuming no lapses occur, will be expensed evenly to 21 March 2018 or 21 September 2019, depending on the applicable 
service conditions.
The increase compared to the previous period is owing to a full year’s charge in 2017 compared to a quarter of a year’s charge in 2016. 
£0.2m of exceptional charges were credited back in the period for employees with retention awards that left employment of the Group 
and hence did not satisfy the service condition. 
Share trusts 
The Group operates two share trusts. The Group’s own-share reserve represents the weighted average cost of shares in the Estera 
Employee Benefit Trust and the Vectura Employee Benefit Trust, which are held for the purposes of fulfilling obligations in respect of 
executive awards and employee share plans.
148 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30. Cash flow information 
Restatement of comparative cash flow information
The FRC’s corporate reporting review of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts to 31 December 2016 highlighted that IAS 7 – Statement 
of Cash Flows paragraph 16A prevents items being classified as investing activities unless a corresponding asset is also capitalised. 
As a result of this review the comparative Consolidated cash flow statement has been restated. Cash outflows related to exceptional 
merger costs of £11.9m have now been presented within cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities, 
as opposed to cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated cash flow statement. Net cash inflow from operating activities in 
2016 has decreased by £9.4m from £28.2m to £18.8m and net cash outflow from investing activities has decreased by £11.9m from a 
cash outflow of £38.1m to cash outflow of £26.2m. Net cash outflow from financing activities has decreased by £2.5m from an outflow 
of £0.1m to an outflow of £2.6m.

Share buyback and cancellation programme
On 14 November 2017 Vectura Group plc announced that the Board has approved a share buyback and cancellation programme to return 
up to £15.0m of capital to shareholders. A purchase for cancellation programme of the Company’s ordinary shares of 0.025p each 
commenced to a maximum consideration of £15.0m, expiring on 11 May 2018.
Numis Securities Limited was required to buy back shares independently of, and uninfluenced by, the Group. At 31 December 2017 £1.4m 
had been returned to shareholders and, accordingly, the Group had a commitment in relation to the remaining £13.6m of cash committed 
to the programme. The programme completed in February 2018, refer to note 33 “Post balance sheet events”.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
For the year ended 31 December 2017
31. Commitments and contingent liabilities continued
Contingent liabilities
The Group has multiple collaborative development agreements with its Partners, across separate development and licensing agreements. 
Within some agreements, the Group has committed to make payments to the development partner contingent upon future events, such 
as sales milestones and royalties received, or has committed to fund or partially fund costs within the associated development programme. 
Historically, a number of these payments have not been claimed by some partners. As it is not possible to reliably estimate the potential 
outflow, and the potential for the outflow is considered remote, no liability is held on the balance sheet for such items. 
The Group has an uncertain tax provision. Should any challenge from the relevant tax authority arise, it is possible that penalties (between 
0–40% of underpaid taxation) could be levied. Based on external professional advice, penalties in excess of 20% are considered remote, 
and penalties towards the lower end of the range are considered more likely, but not probable. As a result, the Group considers a contingent 
liability of up to £1.0m (2016: £nil) in respect of penalties to be appropriate, but as the amount remains uncertain and payment is not 
considered probable, no provision is held on the balance sheet. 
32. Related-party transactions
Associates
In order to finalise the valuation process of the Group’s Chinese associate, costs of £1.6m have been incurred comprising £0.6m for the 
cost of new equipment and a £1.0m waiver of a loan previously made to the associate. These contributions are considered arm’s length 
related-party transactions, necessary to finalise the valuation process. 
Remuneration of key management personnel

152 Vectura Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the year ended 31 December 2017
1. Presentation of the financial statements
1.1 Critical accounting areas of judgment and estimation
In preparing these financial statements, critical judgements in the application of accounting policies can have a significant effect on the 
financial results, moreover any changes in critical estimates and assumptions made could materially impact the amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses reported next year as actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates or those estimates could in 
future change.
The following critical estimates if changed next year would materially impact reported performance:
Carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings
The Company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried at historical cost less any provision for impairment. The Company’s 
investments in the UK arise from the acquisition of Coordinated Drug Development Limited in August 1999 and Innovata Plc in January 2007, 
Germany from the Activaero transaction in March 2014 and the Swiss and US investments on the Skyepharma merger in June 2016. As these 
investments are not amortised, their carrying values are at risk of impairment. Their recoverable amount is assessed with reference to the 
discounted cash flow forecasts associated with these territories including their products, research and development programmes, technologies 
and intellectual property (which for the more recent transactions are typically recognised as purchased intangible assets in the Consolidated 
financial statements of the Group). 
It is likely that any significant diminution in expected value from the underlying operations from the investments would result in impairment. 
The Company continues to monitor progress of its investments in Switzerland. The carrying value of the investment in Germany is particularly 
sensitive to the outcome of the VR475 (FAVOLIR
®
) Phase III study and VR647 (SCIPE
®
) Phase II study scheduled for completion in the second 
half of 2018. 
2. Basis of preparation – accounting policies for the Company financial statements
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement, and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and has excluded certain information as permitted by FRS 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework. Details of Directors’ 
remuneration, share options and retirement benefits are given in the Remuneration report. 
These financial statements, which are prepared using the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis, are prepared in accordance 
with Financial Reporting Standard 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework and with UK accounting presentation and the Companies Act 2006 
as at 31 December 2016, with comparative figures as at 31 December 2016. As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report.
The Company also takes exemptions in relation to share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative 
information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related-party transactions, on the basis that 
equivalent disclosures are given in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Key accounting policies and judgements relate to 
investments in subsidiary undertakings and are disclosed in note 4 “Investments in subsidiary undertakings”.
3. Dividend income
The Company received dividend income from subsidiary undertakings totalling £29.0m (2016: nil). The Company’s immediate subsidiary 
undertaking Skyepharma Limited declared ordinary dividends of £14.0m and £15.0m, which were fully settled for cash in September and 
November 2017 respectively. No amounts remain outstanding. 
4. Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at historical cost less any provision for impairment. The carrying amounts of the Company’s 
investments are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, 
then the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to ensure that the carrying value remains supportable. 
Any impairment charges are recognised in the income statement and are reflected in an allowance against the carrying value. The distributable 
reserves of Vectura Group plc are protected from the impact of any decrease in the valuations of investments to the extent of the merger 
reserves, which become distributable to offset any changes in the investment carrying value. When a subsequent event causes the 
amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the Company income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5. Disposal of dormant subsidiaries 
On 7 December 2017, the Group disposed of 14 dormant UK-based subsidiaries by appointing KPMG as liquidator pursuant to a member 
voluntary liquidation process. As these entities were dormant they were disposed of for nil consideration, and as these entities only contained 
intercompany positions, thereby already fully eliminated out upon consolidation, there was no impact on the Group’s results. 
The entities subject to the member voluntary liquidation process are as follows; (1) Quadrant Healthcare (UK) Limited, (2) Andaris Group 
Limited, (3) Quadrant Holdings Cambridge Limited, (4) Microshot Limited, (5) Quadrant Bioresource Limited, (6) Andaris (DDS) Limited, 
(7) Quadrant Trustee Limited, (8) Protosome Limited, (9) Sun Wharf Stratford Limited, (10) Vine (Building Maintenance) Limited, 
(11) Vine Industries Limited, (12) Vinestand Limited, (13) Playscheme Limited and (14) Big Ben Scaffolding Limited.
As the liquidation process has yet to be completed, the liquidator has confirmed that no contingent liabilities have been identified 
and hence no further costs in relation to these entities are expected to be incurred. 
6. Subsidiary, associate and dormant undertakings 
In accordance with section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 a full list of subsidiaries, partnerships, associates, joint ventures and joint 
arrangements, the country of incorporation and the effective percentage of equity owned at 31 December 2017 are disclosed below.

Redeemable preference shares of 34,000 at £1 par value have no associated voting, dividend or coupon rights but are eligible to be repaid 
before any distribution to shareholders; the shares can be repaid by the Company at any time.
8. Merger reserves
A merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of 
new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under section 612 and section 613 of the Companies Act 2006. Merger relief 
under the UK Companies Act 2006 is available to allow recognition of a merger reserve as opposed to non-distributable share premium. 
The merger reserves are non-distributable reserves, but become distributable to offset any future diminution in the investment value or 
where that investment is disposed of for qualifying consideration. 
9. Distributions to shareholders
Share buyback and cancellation programme
On 14 November 2017 Vectura Group plc announced that the Board has approved a share buyback to return up to £15.0m of capital 
to shareholders. A purchase for cancellation programme of the Company’s ordinary shares of 0.025p each commenced to a maximum 
consideration of £15.0m, expiring on 11 May 2018.
At 31 December 2017 1,422,503 shares had been repurchased at a weighted average price of 95p per share. A total of £1.4m had been 
returned to shareholders at the year end. 
Dividend policy
Vectura has not paid dividends in the past. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future will depend on the results of 
operations, financial conditions, cash requirements, future prospects, profits available for distribution and other factors deemed by the 
Vectura Board to be relevant at the time. 
At present, the Vectura Board does not expect to pay any dividends in the near to medium term. The Board will continue to reassess this 
position based on the factors above. 
10. Post balance sheet events 
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, a further £13.6m of shares have been repurchased with the £15.0m share buyback and cancellation 
programme completed by the end of February 2018. The weighted average price of shares purchased was 93p per share.
