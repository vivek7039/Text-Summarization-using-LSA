CentralNic’s Wholesale Division is a leading distributor of
registries’ domain names, on an exclusive basis, through
retailers globally – the only distributor with six of the top 
twenty new TLDs on its platform. The three most important
contributing factors behind this achievement are the Division’s
leading technology platforms, its extensive range of support
services and its integrated network of global retailers.
Every Top-Level Domain extension, such as .com, .org 
and .co.uk has an exclusive wholesaler (known as a 
“registry backend”). CentralNic’s registry backend supports
over 100 registries across all five categories of domain 
name extensions: 
• Country Code Top Level Domain extensions (ccTLDs)
such as .la, .cx and .fm; 
• Generic Top-Level Domain extensions (gTLDs) 
like .xyz and .online; 
• “Sponsored” Top-Level Domain extensions for 
a specific purpose such as .coop, the internet 
designation for cooperatives; 
• “DotBrand” Top-Level Domain such as .stc for Saudi
Telecom Corporation, which uses CentralNic’s registry
back-end platform to power domains not for sale but 
for the rights holder’s own use; 
• Second-Level Domain extensions (SLDs) such as 
.uk.com and .us.com; 
CentralNic’s registry backend platform enables retailers 
around the world to sell an increasing range of internet domain
names and associated products. It also handles billing and
cash collection on behalf of its registry clients – which hold the
rights to the domains that CentralNic distributes. CentralNic
also supports its registry clients with value added services
such as policy advice and sales and marketing. CentralNic’s
registry backend continues to maintain an uptime which
consistently exceeds the required standards set by industry
regulator ICANN. 
CentralNic’s registry backend platform integrates with around
1,500 retailers globally. Through them, the distribution channel
reaches out to over 100,000 resellers. In recent years, China
has been one of CentralNic’s most buoyant markets. This
reflects a business development and operational focus on
China that has positioned the Company to benefit from the
unprecedented demand for domain names in that market. 
CentralNic’s DNS system, which powers the domains, is a
global network of nameservers. With 60 locations distributed
around the world, CentralNic’s DNS handles over 1 Billion
queries per day. The DNS assures the stability, security and
resilience of all the domain names supported by CentralNic.
This vital system has maintained its unblemished record of
100% uptime for 21 consecutive years.

CentralNic’s Retail Division manages around 1 million domain

24 online retail brands and websites. The division boasts one
of the widest range of domain extensions offered by retailers in
the industry. These domain extensions include around:
In addition, the Retail Division supplies products associated
with domain names such as website hosting and website

demand from many customer segments including:
Retail customers – that purchase domain names and
associated products for non-business related websites.
Small Medium Sized Businesses (SMBs) – Self-service
small business customers that purchase several domain
names and associated products e.g. website hosting
and SSL certificates typically for an online shop or
informational website which gathers visitor information.
Midcap Corporations – Mid-sized businesses which
register and maintain a portfolio of domain names and
associated products such as SSL Certificates.
Resellers and Registrars – Business customers that 
purchase domain names for resale to their own
customers. Companies such as IP law firms, web
designers and website hosting companies are often
resellers of domain names. Other ICANN Registrars 
also purchase domain names from CentralNic Retail 
in situations where they do not hold a direct
accreditation with a registry.
Domain Professionals – Industry professionals that
trade in domain names or purchase domain names 
on behalf of clients.

Enterprise Division
The enterprise market is gaining in importance in the domain
name industry, and CentralNic is addressing this market in
several ways.
DotBrands
CentralNic provides technical services to companies seeking
their own “DotBrand” TLDs. These are a newly introduced type
of Intellectual Property (“IP”) which allows brands and company
names to occupy the Top-Level of domain names previously
restricted to country codes and generic terms like .com. Unlike
trade marks, this new form of IP can be operated by a company
exclusively, globally and in perpetuity. Therefore, DotBrands have
attracted significant interest in the corporate sector.
DotBrand clients which use CentralNic’s technical and
consulting services include Global 1000 companies such as
Saudi Telecom Company, Etisalat and Kuwait Finance House.
Corporate domain management
Through its high-quality workflow management platform for the
registration and management of domain names, CentralNic
addresses the domain management needs of corporate
clients. The platform can be used as an in-house solution by
enterprise clients, or as technology enabling corporations with
large SME customer bases to monetise those customers by
selling them domain names.Some of the largest corporations
in the German-speaking markets, such as Telcos and
publishing houses, use CentralNic’s corporate domain
management platform. CentralNic has successfully started
introducing it to other geographical and vertical markets.
Premium Domain Names
Like many of its peers, CentralNic realises an enterprise
revenue stream from trading in premium domain names. These
are particularly favoured by large companies for a number of
uses. They may correspond to a company brand name, they
may be easily memorable and marketable (like a two-letter
.com domain or a common word), or they may already benefit
from internet traffic comprising potential customers.
CentralNic trades in its own portfolio, with approximately
56,500 premium domain names (with values ranging from a
small premium over normal retail pricing to seven figure sums).
It also brokers premium domain sales for third parties in
exchange for a commission.
CentralNic is also a shareholder in and distributor of the
.tickets TLD. This innovative new use of a top-level domain 
is intended to allow venues, artists, sports teams and other
rights holders to retail tickets direct to consumers, while giving
consumers the comfort of knowing that any website using 
a .tickets domain is legitimate.

19.8% I am pleased to report on a strong year of growth for CentralNic.
The Group continued its strategy to build a diversified internet
services business of size and scale through an acquisitive
roll-up programme which delivers high-levels of recurring
revenues, quality of earnings and strong cash generation.
In addition, revenue (10%), gross profit (28%), adjusted
EBITDA (20%) and profit after tax (7%) all show year on year
increases, a pleasing achievement for the Group.
SK-NIC, the manager of the exclusive country code top-level
domain for Slovakia, was acquired in mid-December 2017 for
a maximum cash consideration of €25.7 million (£22.6 million).
The Board anticipates SK-NIC to be earnings enhancing in line
with expectations at the time of the acquisition, as well as
providing access to a new international market with sustainable
growth characteristics, a high renewal rate of over 86%, and
the opportunity to leverage CentralNic’s existing expertise and
bespoke technical platforms in the domain management
business. The acquisition was funded by the Company’s own
cash reserves and a term loan and revolving credit facility
totalling £18 million provided by Silicon Valley Bank, which
also provides a £3 million overdraft facility.
Significant growth was delivered in the Wholesale and Retail
Divisions, which contributed to an increase in recurring revenues
and an improvement in the quality of the Group’s earnings.
As part of that, the exclusive wholesaler contract with XYZ.com,
owner of the .xyz Top-Level Domain (“TLD”), was renegotiated in
September 2017 for a term running until May 2032. CentralNic
receives a fixed minimum fee which may increase based on the
volume of .xyz domains managed.
Whilst the Enterprise Division made a significant contribution to
the Group’s profits in the year under review, its contribution
through one-off domain name sales reduced when compared
to the prior year. In 2017, the Group sold portfolios of premium
domain names valued at a total of £3.0 million (2016: £3.7
million). In line with the Group’s strategy, whilst premium domain
name trading is a profitable activity, premium domain name
sales will be a decreasing proportion of revenues and
contribution going forward as the Company focuses on
building recurring revenue based business activities.
Performance
In the year ended 31 December 2017, revenue rose by 10% to
£24.3 million (2016: £22.1 million). This was driven by organic
growth in the Wholesale Division, which grew by almost 50%,
and also in the Retail Division which grew by almost 10%. Gross
profit increased by 28% to £9.8 million (2016: £7.7 million) with
gross margins ahead of the previous year in all divisions and, in
total 40%, (2016: 35%), an increase of 16%. Despite adverse
foreign exchange movements of £0.6 million, compared to a
positive impact of £0.6 million in 2016, adjusted EBITDA was in
line with market expectations at £6.6 million (2016: £5.5 million),
representing an increase of 20% on the prior year. Profit after
tax increased by 7% to £1.02 million (2016: £0.96 million).
Chairman’s statement
8      CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017
Our vision is to join the ranks of world leaders 
in the industry, as new TLDs (which the Group
distributes) expand to challenge the incumbent
dominant domain name endings (.com etc) 
and emerging markets, like China, grow to 
rival the size of the North American and
European markets.
Mike Turner Chairman Cash flow was positive during the year with year-end cash
balances of £10.9 million (2016: £9.9 million) and net debt
(excluding prepaid costs) of £7.2m (2016: net cash £7.3m).
During the year, CentralNic entered into a new facility
agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which enabled the
Group to acquire SK-NIC and optimise its capital structure
and gain access to funding for growth opportunities.
Diluted earnings per share increased by over 6% to 1.04p
(2016: 0.97p).
Strategy
The Group’s strategy remains to develop and operate scalable
software platforms by serving global markets with domain
names and related services. It continues to identify and exploit
high growth areas within the domain industry, retaining a
leading role in new Top-Level Domains, servicing country
code domains, and focusing on growth markets including
Eastern Europe and Asia. The Group aims to win and retain
well-resourced clients with complementary objectives and to
make acquisitions which meet the clear strategic criteria of
being earnings accretive in the short term with a strong
recurring revenue base, high quality of earnings, and high
cash conversion.
Management and Board
As part of the strategy to build a diversified business of size
and scale, the management team was strengthened to
support the Group’s ambitions. In May 2017, Sarah Ryan
joined CentralNic as Group Corporate Development Director,
following the previous year’s senior hires of Stuart Fuller and
Andy Churley as Group Commercial Director and Group
Marketing Director respectively. The Board itself was
strengthened further in July 2017 with the appointment
of Don Baladasan as Chief Financial Officer, bringing
considerable financial expertise in buy-and-build strategies
and risk management.
In August 2017 Desleigh Jameson, who joined the Group in
January 2016 when it acquired Instra Corporation, stepped
down from the Board. The integration of Instra’s operations in
to the Group was by that time complete following Desleigh’s
hard work in very quickly merging the highly successful Instra
business in to the ever-expanding CentralNic.
I would like to thank all members of the CentralNic team for
their professionalism and commitment to the ongoing growth
and transformation of the business. It is thanks to our staff, to
our clients and to our distribution channel partners, as well as
to our shareholders, that the Group continues to maintain and
enhance its industry-leading position.
Outlook
Our vision is to join the ranks of world leaders in the industry.
CentralNic strives to achieve this by continuing to disrupt
existing markets and by identifying and exploiting key growth
markets around the world. Moreover, ongoing consolidation
in the domain services industry presents step-change
acquisition opportunities for the Group to enter new markets
and broaden its service offerings.
Trading for the first quarter of 2018 is encouraging and inline
with expectations. CentralNic has continued to win new clients
including the distribution contract for .ooo TLD, owned by the
billion-dollar Mumbai-listed tech company Infibeam. In January
2018 the Group replenished its premium domain trading
inventory by acquiring a portfolio of domain names for a total
consideration of £2.5 million.
As reported in March 2018, discussions are taking place
regarding the potential combination of CentralNic and
KeyDrive S.A. The combination of the two businesses has
strong strategic logic and economies of scale. This represents
an opportunity to create a group with advanced technology
platforms delivering significant recurring revenues for every
major customer type within the industry. Although there can be
no certainty that a transaction will occur, the discussions are
proceeding well and the Board believes that the transaction
will take place in the third quarter of 2018.
The Board believes that the opportunity to continue to build a
sizeable business to rival the largest industry players, using the
Group’s existing infrastructure to deliver economies of scale
both financially and operationally, remains strong. The Group’s
management team has proven its ability to deliver and
integrate substantial acquisitions and there is a plentiful
pipeline of targets. The Directors are confident that the Group
will continue to deliver on its strategic goals in 2018, to deliver
growth both organically and by expansion of the business and
further improve the percentage of recurring revenues and the
Group’s quality of earnings.

Overview
CentralNic continued to develop as an internet services
business of substantial scale that is highly cash generative and
built around a recurring revenue model. There are significant
opportunities available for growth in the market, of which the
Company continues to take advantage.
During the year, the Company’s acquisition strategy continued
to target companies with a strong existing customer base and
a high proportion of recurring revenue, with a particular focus
on businesses with exposure to high-growth and emerging
markets. Building on the previous acquisitions of Internet.BS
in the Bahamas (2014: US$7.5 million) and Instra Group in
Australia and New Zealand (2016: AU$38.0 million), the Group
acquired SK-NIC in December 2017 for a maximum cash
consideration of €25.7 million. SK-NIC is the manager of the
exclusive country code top-level domain for Slovakia, .sk and
realises the majority of its earnings through a recurring revenue
stream from a substantial embedded customer base.
SK-NIC offers significant growth potential, achievable
through the combination of the strongest domain product
in the Slovak market and CentralNic’s specialist technical,
sales and marketing expertise. CentralNic migrated .sk
onto its proprietary software in 2017 and strengthened the
local management team to ensure that .sk achieves global
best practice as a foundation for that nation’s growing
digital economy.
Since its acquisition, the integration of SK-NIC has progressed
according to plan. The .sk operation has been migrated
onto a customised version of the CentralNic registry software
in the Slovak language, and the management team in
Bratislava has been strengthened with the addition of a Head
of Communications. Tasks that were outsourced to the
vendors as part of the transition plan are being successfully
migrated in-house. Trading since the acquisition was
completed is in line with expectations.
In July, CentralNic was recognised as the best performing
company in the Infrastructure Services category of the
Quoted25 awards. This annual award, created by Megabuyte,
acknowledges the top 25 performing technology companies
in the mid-tier of the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market.
Results
CentralNic achieved revenues of £24.3 million, a 10%
increase over 2016 revenues of £22.1 million, and Adjusted
EBITDA of £6.6 million, a 20% increase on 2016’s Adjusted
EBITDA of £5.5 million. The profit after tax reflected a 7%
increase at £1.02m (2016: £0.96m).
The Group continues to improve the quality of its earnings,
increasing recurring revenues to 84% of total revenues. The
Group’s global revenues also continued to grow, with over 37%
of total revenues coming from outside the UK, North America,
and Europe, reflecting a focus on high-growth emerging markets.
10    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017
Building on previous acquisitions of Internet.BS
in the Bahamas and Instra Group in Australia
and New Zealand, CentralNic has continued to
successfully execute its acquisition strategy.
In 2017, CentralNic acquired SK-NIC, the
manager of the exclusive country code top-level
domain for Slovakia, We will continue to grow
the company both organically and through
further acquisitions and remain entirely focused
on expanding our global footprint in the domain
and web services industry.

At the end of the year, the Group had cash balances of
£10.9 million (2016: £9.9 million) with net debt (excluding
prepaid costs) of £7.2m (2016: net cash £7.3m). During the
year, CentralNic entered into a new facility agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank, which enabled the group to acquire
SK-NIC and optimise its capital structure and gain access
to funding for growth opportunities.
Operational review
Wholesale (Registry Services)
Wholesale revenues grew 48% to £4.7 million (2016: £3.2
million) and the Company maintained its position as a leading
wholesaler of domain names using new gTLDs, with 22.6%
market share at the end of 2017. CentralNic’s Wholesale
Division is the only registry services provider to count six of
the top 20 new gTLDs as clients (from around 1,200
launched in total).
CentralNic has continued to be the world leader in winning
new clients in its Wholesale Division, including a contract to
manage 14 Top Level Domains from OpenRegistry, a
subsidiary of KeyDrive Group. CentralNic manages 104
domain extensions (gTLDs, ccTLDs and SLDs) overall, ranking
as an impressive 5th globally. In September 2017, the Group
renegotiated its exclusive wholesaler contract with .XYZ.com,
the owner of the world’s leading new gTLD, .xyz, on a fixed fee
basis until May 2032 with the potential to increase fees based
on the number of .xyz domains managed.
Retail
Retail revenues grew 9% to £15.6 million in 2017 (2016:
£14.3 million). The retail business serves three of the main
customer groups for domain names and supporting services;
small businesses, resellers and domain investment
professionals. One of the Retail Division’s objectives during
2017 was to broaden the number of supporting products it
can provide to its existing customer base. During the year,
it added IT security products, web and email hosting,
website construction and analysis products to its portfolio
available to its existing and future customer base.
The Retail Division increased the number of domain extensions
it provides and has continued to optimise the costs associated
with domain name provision and therefore increased
profitability. This was in part achieved through an outsource
arrangement with the leading global reseller platform RRPProxy,
a subsidiary of the KeyDrive Group. Considerable
management and technical resource has been dedicated to
this project which, when completed, will result in CentralNic’s
retailers obtaining all their domains from a single supplier, rather
than supporting hundreds of supplier relationships.
Enterprise
Revenues from CentralNic’s Enterprise Division decreased
slightly in 2017, down to £4.1 million (2016: £4.6 million),
reflecting the Group’s strategy to decrease the proportion of
its overall revenues obtained through one-off premium domain
name sales. The recurring revenue components of CentralNic’s
enterprise business continue to grow. With CentralNic’s
assistance, a number of corporate clients completed the
ICANN delegation process in 2017 and have begun to prepare
their “DotBrand” Top Level Domains for use. Other corporate
and government clients continue to licence CentralNic software
and many also use the Group’s fee-based support services to
distribute domains, develop and implement their own policies
and to market and manage their operations in-house.
CentralNic’s premium domain name trading business
performed well with revenues of £3.0 million achieved, reduced
from £3.7 million the previous year. In line with the Group’s
strategy to focus on increasing its revenues in the recurring
category, premium domain name sales will be a decreasing
proportion of revenues and contribution going forward.
Acquisitions: progressing CentralNic’s strategy
Moving forward, CentralNic will continue to identify
acquisitions that will add scale and new market leading
technology platforms to serve its customers as well as
creating opportunities for savings by eliminating duplication
in costs. The Group has established a robust foundation for
future growth, is able to leverage a suite of world-class
software and services, has a large and experienced
management team and significant staff resources able to
support customers around the world.
Infrastructure for growth
People
During 2017, CentralNic made significant additions to its
Board and management team to extend even further its ability
to execute our acquisitions-led growth strategy. In July,
Don Baladasan joined the Board as Chief Financial Officer,
bringing significant public company acquisition and integration
experience. At senior management level the Company had
already recruited Group Commercial Director Stuart Fuller
and Group Marketing Director Andy Churley, from NetNames
(formerly GroupNBT), to reinforce and build sales and
marketing operations. In May 2017, Sarah Ryan was
appointed Corporate Development Director to support the
Board in its M&A activities. Sarah was previously Director of
International M&A for LexisNexis and Thomson Financial
and brings significant transaction experience including in the
Middle East, Russia, China, India, South Africa and Europe.
Current market trends
In December 2017, there were approximately 332.4 million
domain names under management globally. This represents a
growth of 3.1m domain names (0.9%) over 2016. Generic Top
Level Domains (gTLDs e.g. .com and .net) had a combined
total of approximately 146 million domain names (2.9% growth)
and all country code Top Level Domains (e.g. .sk) accounted
for approximately 146 million domain names (2.4% growth).
The top 20 new gTLDs (of which CentralNic manages six)
account for 65% of all registrations in this category. Chief Executive’s report continued
Post year end
In January 2018, the Group replenished its premium domain
trading inventory for a total consideration of £2.5 million, as a
step towards ensuring that the company retains the capacity
to continue to trade profitably in premium domain names as
required. CentralNic also continued winning new clients,
including the .ooo TLD, owned by billion-dollar Mumbai-listed
tech company, Infibeam.
In March 2018, due to industry speculation, CentralNic
announced that it was in advanced negotiations to merge with
a leading operator of reseller and corporate platforms in the
domain industry, KeyDrive S.A., a Luxembourg company.
The combination of the two businesses has strong strategic
logic and economies of scale and represents an opportunity
to create a group with competitive technology platforms
delivering significant recurring revenues for every major
customer type within the industry. Discussions are ongoing
at the time of publication.
Outlook
Current trading is in line with expectations as the Group
continues to grow both organically and through further
acquisitions and remains entirely focused on expanding its
global footprint in the domain and web services industry.
New products and services are added continually to service
customers. For example, the group plans to offer online
security and brand protection services to its corporate clients.
Across all its business segments, new customer acquisition
remains a priority for the Group.
Finally, we will continue to make earnings enhancing
acquisitions to achieve further scale, additional capabilities
and greater economies of scale.

12    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic report
The Company continues to win, retain and grow business
from well-resourced clients with complementary objectives.
It also sources and executes acquisition transactions that meet
the Group’s strategic criteria of being earnings accretive with
a strong recurring revenue base, particularly revenues from
domain registrations and their subsequent annual renewal.
The Group has a culture derived from entrepreneurial roots.
This helps underpin its strategy, with a Group-wide passion
for entering and competing proﬁtably in new markets.
CentralNic’s culture is characterised by its focus on growth
and recurring high-quality earnings, a global perspective,
innovation, world-class technology, expert and ﬂexible client
services, and professional execution. The Group is able to
match, and often exceed, the service levels offered by its
larger competitors.
In turn, the organisation is transitioning from a smaller
successful player into a global leader, within the domain name
industry. The Group has established a robust infrastructure
for growth through developing and operating scalable
software platforms to serve global markets with domain
names and related services. This includes recruiting a
highly-experienced management team with complementary
skill-sets and significant staff resources able to support
customers around the world.
CentralNic’s businesses support all stages in the domain
name industry supply chain. The Group’s Wholesale Division
enables its domain registry customers to supply their domains
to an integrated distribution network of around 1,500 industry
accredited registrars (retailers), and through them, over
100,000 resellers. CentralNic supplies its new Top Level
Domains to more accredited registrars than any of its peers,
as well as operating billing and cash collection services.
CentralNic’s retail platforms allow all types of internet users
to register domain names and purchase additional services
required to deploy their websites and email. These platforms
are presented to the buyers through a number of retail
websites focused on different market segments and
geographies. The Retail Division has been increasing the
domain inventory that it provides whilst optimizing
provisioning costs.
Its enterprise platforms allow corporations and domain
investors to manage and protect their valuable domain name
portfolios. CentralNic’s own businesses operate these
software platforms and are offered to third parties on both a
Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and a managed service basis.
The same software platforms are also licensed to third parties,
including governments, telecommunication companies and
other enterprise clients, as well as TLD registries.
Identifying and exploiting relatively
high-growth areas of the domain industry
Demand in growth markets may be driven by supply from
new inventory, such as the launch of a new domain extension,
by a liberalisation of registration policies for a TLD, or by
promotional activities.
CentralNic’s registrars take advantage of these opportunities
in the markets they serve, often delivering strong results.
For instance, The Group’s registrars are the highest sellers of
.law domains for law ﬁrms and the second highest sellers of
.ae domains for the United Arab Emirates.
Growth opportunities also come from increased demand
caused by improvements in internet access levels in emerging
markets, emanating from the adoption of smart phones,
broadband connectivity and governmental support for local
digital economic development. Here again, CentralNic is
actively satisfying demand in these emerging markets.
Winning and retaining well-resourced partners
with complementary objectives
CentralNic excels in its ability to acquire and retain entrepreneur
and corporate clients to enable its ongoing growth.
For the Wholesale Division, CentralNic has sought out and
won contracts for over 50 new TLDs since listing. This
inventory includes a range of domain extensions with different
business strategies, including value-based mass market
generic domains such as .xyz and .website, industry-speciﬁc
TLDs such as. tickets, and .bar. For country code market
extensions, CentralNic works with the local providers to
develop marketing, distribution and policy initiatives. For
example, the country code for Lao PDR (.LA) has been
repurposed to address the alternative geographies of
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 13
CentralNic’s strategy for continuing its growth is to increase its scale and scope of
operations by developing and operating scalable software platforms to serve global
markets with domain names and related services. The Company specifically identifies
and develops areas of the domain industry with high-growth and/or high-margin
potential. This includes taking a leading role in disruptive initiatives such as new
Top Level Domains (“TLDs”), selling country code domain extensions, taking market
share in emerging markets, and focusing on the enterprise sector. Strategic report continued
Los Angeles and Latin America, while successfully retaining its
country’s national Internet identity. Similarly, .FM (the country
code for Micronesia) has been retargeted to address the radio
broadcast and music streaming industries. CentralNic is active
in developing a pipeline of new domain extensions to add to
its Wholesale platform. In 2017, CentralNic continued to win
new clients in its Wholesale Division, including a contract to
manage 14 Top Level Domains from OpenRegistry.
Group-wide, CentralNic deploys a number of online customer
acquisition strategies, including search engine and user
interface optimisation, search engine marketing, and email
marketing. The Group also employs a number of offline
marketing mechanisms such as promotion at events and
exhibitions, partnerships with registries and resellers, outbound
activity from its call centres and direct sales.
CentralNic also excels in customer retention thanks to its
philosophy of having a close collaboration with its clients and a
focus on providing added value. For example, to bring more
value to its clients, CentralNic offers expert advisers. These
include sales, marketing, policy and technical development
resources on a fee-for-service or revenue share model. The
Group’s clients are also provided with business information to
track service provision.
Financial performance
A review of the ﬁnancial performance of the Group is provided
in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on pages 16 to 19.
Key Performance Indicators
Details of the Key Performance Indicators are provided on
page 16.
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group
The Directors have considered the principal risks and
uncertainties facing the Group and the main ones are
outlined below.
Regulatory
The businesses of both registries and registrars are subject to
the legal and contractual environment, and to comply with
ICANN and country code policies. These are subject to change,
which has the potential to inﬂuence business outcomes.
CentralNic satisﬁes the technical and operational requirements
of ICANN and other regulators and maintains an active voice in
the development of policy within the ICANN community.
Market
There is a risk that the market for domains for which the Group
provides registry and registrar services may not increase as
quickly as expected or that the new TLDs may not generate
the revenue levels anticipated by the Board.
In either case, the Group’s revenues could reduce below
expectations with an impact on proﬁtability.
The risk is mitigated to a degree by operating multiple lines of
business themselves exposed to many vertical markets and
segments, the majority of which have very little reliance on
new TLDs.
IT security
If the Group does not prevent security breaches or becomes
susceptible to cyber-attacks, it may be exposed to lawsuits,
lose customers, suffer harm to its reputation, and incur
additional costs. Unauthorised access, computer viruses,
accidents, employee error or malfeasance, intentional
misconduct by computer “hackers” and other disruptions can
occur that could compromise the security of the Group’s
infrastructure or conﬁdential information.
The Group has created a resilient network infrastructure and
Domain Name System server constellation, with failover
secondary systems to ensure critical registry functions are
maintained. The Wholesale business has been certiﬁed under
ISO 27001/2013 for data security, thereby mitigating risk by
adherence to international best practice.
Impact on society
The Company has a positive impact on society by offering
internet services in developing countries, contributing to the
United Nations Broadband Commission’s objective of
connecting the 50% of the world that is still offline with
affordable internet.
The Company can see little negative impact on society from
its activities. Whilst the internet itself adds a potential avenue
through which fraudsters and other undesirables can operate,
the Company has stringent policies relating to its position as
an enabler of such traffic and at all times adheres to laws and
regulations in each and every jurisdiction, including working
with regulatory authorities at all times.
14    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 Supplier risk
A number of the key technical services used by the Group are
outsourced to key suppliers, thereby creating the potential for
risk in the case of the failure or loss of a supplier. In view of
these risks, redundancies have been introduced between the
suppliers and internal resources, ensuring that no single point
of failure could result in the inability of CentralNic to meet its
contractual or compliance obligations.
Currency risk
The Group reports its revenues and costs in British Pounds
Sterling, whilst some of these revenues and costs may arise
in other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates may
adversely affect the Group’s reported proﬁts and make its
overseas contracts relatively less valuable.
CentralNic contracts are usually denominated in British
Pounds Sterling, US Dollars, Euros or Australian Dollars and
the Directors keep the currency exposure under regular
review. The Directors consider the use of hedging instruments
in the event that currency exposure is considered a material
performance risk.
Dependence on key personnel
The Group has a small management team and the loss of any
key individual or the inability to attract appropriate personnel
could impact upon the Group’s future performance. Incentives
and a performance culture remain an important focus to the
achievement of the Group’s objectives.
Other risk factors
In addition to the impact of the downturn of the world’s
economies, the Group may be adversely affected by other
changes in economic, political, judicial, administrative, taxation
or other regulatory or other unforeseen matters. For example,
the impact on the Group from the UK exiting the European
Union is to emerge and will be monitored and assessed over
the coming months and years.
Director and employee gender
At the year-end the Board of Directors comprised of seven
members, all of whom are male, the Senior Management team
of eight was made up of five men and three women, and the
overall staff number of 92 contained 61 males and 31 females.
This strategic report was approved by the Board of Directors
on 30 May 2018 and signed on its behalf by:
Mike Turner Chairman
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 15 Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s report
The Group’s continued focus on improving the quality of the
revenue mix and earnings was highly successful with recurring
revenues rising to 84% of total revenue, compared to 81% in
2016. The contribution from one-off premium sales was
reduced in line with the Board’s strategy to focus on visibility
and quality of earnings.
The growth in the revenue line flowed down to the Adjusted
EBITDA, which increased by 20% to £6.6m (2016: £5.5m).
The overall Adjusted EBITDA Margin grew to 27% (2016:
25%). Adjusted EBITDA is before share based payment
expenses, acquisition deal fees and exceptional items.
This growth in Adjusted EBITDA was despite adverse foreign
exchange movements of £0.6 million, compared to a
positive impact of £0.6 million in 2016.
The attractive cash generative profile for the Group continued
in 2017 with the net operating cashflow, before tax and
one-off deal costs, being £6.8m (2016: £5.1m). Cash at the
end of 2017 was £10.9m (2016: £9.9m), an increase of
10% with Net Debt (excluding prepaid costs) of £7.2m
(2016: net cash £7.3m).
In December 2017, the Group progressed its acquisition
strategy with the completion of the acquisition for the country
code of Slovakia, SK-NIC. SK-NIC matched the characteristics
of our acquisition target profile, as a high quality, high margin
and recurring revenue asset in a significant growth emerging
market. We continue to seek acquisitions which add
considerable high quality, high margin and recurring
revenues to the Group.
The initial cash consideration of €20.3m (£17.8m) to acquire
SK-NIC was funded by loan-finance from Silicon Valley Bank
(“SVB”) through a £12m term loan and a £6m revolving credit
facility. SVB also provided a £3m overdraft facility which has
not been utilised. This transaction created a more balanced
capital structure which leverages the cash generative profile
for the Group, so this was deemed to be the most appropriate
funding route in order to achieve this.

Wholesale Division
The increase of revenue in the Wholesale Division was driven
predominately by the .xyz and radix TLDs, along with registry
consultancy. SK-NIC contributed £0.3m of revenue, following
the completion of its acquisition on 5 December 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Wholesale Division grew by 70% to
£2.1m (2016: £1.2m). This included £0.2m contribution from
SK-NIC, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin for SK-NIC
of 79%. Excluding the contribution from SK-NIC, the like for
like Adjusted EBITDA for Wholesale grew by 51% to £1.9m
(2016: £1.2m) representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of
42% (2016: 39%).
16    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017
The Group showed overall year on year growth
in revenue of 10% and Adjusted EBITDA of 20%.
Organic growth of 10% was achieved with
revenue growing to £24.3m (2016: £22.1m).
This was driven predominately by growth in the
Wholesale and Retail Divisions, which enjoyed
48% and 9% year-on-year growth respectively.
Don Baladasan Chief Financial Ofﬁcer  Retail Division
Retail revenue continues to be driven by the Instra Group,
with smaller contributions from Internet.bs and the flagship
stores. All three Retail businesses showed year-on-year
revenue growth with overall retail revenue growing by 9% to
£15.6m (2016: £14.3m).
Instra improved its year-on-year revenue to £11.4m (2016:
£10.3m). This was achieved by selling high value domains,
which benefit from higher margins, as well as cutting costs.
The resulting improved margins flowed down to the
Adjusted EBITDA line with Instra showing 20% growth to
£2.6m (2016: £2.2m).
Enterprise Division
Revenue for the Enterprise Division was £4.1m (2016: £4.6m).
The reduction was expected as the Group continued to move
away from its reliance on the sale of Premium Domain names,
to focus on improving quality of earnings by shifting the mix
from these one-off sales to more predictable, recurring revenue
streams. Although revenue reduced for one-off premium
domain sales, revenue increased from other Enterprise
Division recurring revenue streams to £1.1m (2016: £0.9m).
Overall Adjusted EBITDA was £2.8m (2016: £2.8m) with
adjusted EBITDA margin of 70% (2016: 60%).
Revenue profile
The quality of the Group’s earnings remains an important
strategic priority for the Group and its investors, as we increase
the proportion of its revenues derived from predictable sources.
This was one important factor in assessing the SK-NIC
acquisition, with all of SK-NIC’s revenues, earnings and cash
ﬂow derived from new registrations and renewals of domain
names. This, combined with the management’s focus on
recurring revenue streams, resulted in the proportion of
recurring revenues increasing to 84% (2016: 81%).
AIM and corporate overheads, which have not been allocated
by division, were consistent with the prior year at £1.0m
(2016: £1.0m).
Acquisition costs and exceptional items totaled £2.0m
(2016: £1.3m). The acquisition-related costs, supporting the
Group’s acquisition programme, included a variety of deal
costs for SK-NIC and Key Drive Group.
Finance costs include £0.3m of expenses for the term loan
arrangement fees and associated legal costs related to the
acquisition of SK-NIC.
Other non-cash expenses included the amortisation of
intangible assets, totaling £2.2m (2016: £2.1m), reﬂecting the
charges for the Instra customer list, domain names and
software acquired. They also included depreciation and the
share based payments expense. In accordance with IFRS 2
Share Based Payments, we have included a £0.5m charge
for Director and employee share options within administrative
expenses (2016: £0.6m). Further details can be found in
note 28 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group’s effective tax rate during the year was 25.4%
(2016: 17.5%), with the primary reason for the year-on-year
increase being the disallowable nature of the higher acquisition
related costs incurred during the period.
Basic earnings per share of 1.07 pence (2016: 1.00 pence),
reﬂected the improved Adjusted EBITDA in the business which
were offset by non-recurring acquisition costs, amortisation
charges, exceptional items and non-cash charges. Diluted
earnings per share, at 1.04 pence (2016: 0.97 pence),
reﬂected the dilutive effect of the share options “in the money”
at the average share price for the year.
Further details of the earnings per share calculations are
provided in note 12 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Pensions
The Group created a deﬁned contribution pension scheme in
June 2016 in line with the new auto-enrolment provisions in the
UK. In Australia, the Group operates a superannuation scheme
in line with statutory requirements, and the KiwiSaver scheme
in New Zealand, which is in line with the KiwiSaver Act 2006.
The Group does not operate and has never operated any
deﬁned beneﬁt schemes requiring actuarial valuations.
Dividends
It remains the intention of the Group to generate income
returns for investors in the future as part of a progressive and
commercially prudent dividend policy. However, due to the
continued expansion opportunities presented by the sector,
the Directors do not propose a ﬁnal dividend in 2017.
Group statement of financial position
The Group had net assets of £26.5m at 31 December 2017
(2016: £25.2m). This increase was driven by the retained
proﬁt for the year offset by downward movements on
the foreign exchange translation reserve, mainly due to
movements in AU$/£GBP exchange rates.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 17 Chief Financial Ofﬁcer’s report continued
Capital expenditure and investing activities
The most signiﬁcant investment made during the year was the
acquisition of SK-NIC, with further details of the acquisition
entries provided under Business Combinations in note 25 to
the ﬁnancial statements. The total value of intangible assets
includes £25.7m of intangibles relating to SK-NIC.
In line with the appropriate treatment for translation of a foreign
operation into the Group’s presentational currency, both the
tangible and intangible assets are translated at the closing
rate, generating foreign exchange differences as presented in
notes 13 and 14 to the ﬁnancial statements.
With the exception of goodwill, the Group’s intangible assets
are amortised in line with the accounting policy. The carrying
value of customer lists and goodwill are tested annually for
impairment, while the Directors also consider other intangible
assets and investments for indications of impairment.
Further details are provided in note 14 and 16 to the
ﬁnancial statements.
Capital expenditure on tangible assets was £0.1m during the
year (2016: £0.2m). Expenditure on plant and equipment was
again modest, reﬂecting the business model, which has a
relatively low capital expenditure requirement. Intangible asset
additions totaled £0.4m (2016: £0.4m), including the costs of
development activities satisfying the criteria detailed in note 3
part to the ﬁnancial statements. The slight increase related to
capitalised development activities in Instra and dnsXperts UG.
Further details are provided in notes 13, 14 and 25 to the
ﬁnancial statements.
Cashflow and net cash
The cashﬂow statement for the Group includes two major
themes: the entries related to the ﬁnancing and completion
of the SK-NIC acquisition and the results of the ongoing
operations of the business, taking into account the
ﬂuctuations in working capital.
Net cashﬂow from operating activities was higher than the
previous year at £3.7m (2016: £3.3m). In both years, the net
cashﬂow from operating activities was in line with expectations
relative to Adjusted EBITDA. 2017 beneﬁtted from favourable
working capital movements of £0.3m.
Investing activities were mainly related to the SK-NIC
acquisition, which was completed in December 2017.
The net cash outflow related to the SK-NIC acquisition totalled
£17.4m (net of cash acquired) in 2017 with a further £4.8m
of deferred and contingent consideration due up to 2024,
which was funded by additional SVB debt of £16.25m.
Banking facilities
A new facility agreement was entered into with SVB on
29 August 2017, which was amended and restated on the
30th November 2017 to support the SK-NIC acquisition on
5 December 2017.
This agreement refinanced the remaining principal of £1.75m
due under the original SVB facility agreement entered into for
the purposes of acquiring Instra in December 2015.
The new SVB facilities comprises a £12m term loan, a £6m
revolving credit facility, and a £3m overdraft facility. The term
and revolving credit facility were fully utilised at the end of the
year, the overdraft was unutilised.
The principal terms of the debt facility include amortisation of
the term loan over 5 years (£2 million per annum) with a bullet
payment at the end of term. Interest repayments have also been
settled quarterly based at a margin above LIBOR. The debt
facility is secured over the material companies within the Group.
Further detail is provided in note 24 of the ﬁnancial statements.
Scheduled quarterly repayments were made during the year
along with the release of associated ﬁnance costs. 
Critical accounting policies
The Summary of the Group’s Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies
is set out in note 3 to the Financial Statements.
The Group’s Revenue recognition policy may be summarised as:
• Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the
amounts of revenue and cost can be measured reliably;
• Domain sales are recognised over the period to which the
underlying sales contract relates, which can be for periods
between one and ten years. Revenues attributable to future
periods are deferred to future periods and are included in
“Deferred Revenues” and in the case of the Retail business,
the direct costs, associated with domain name Retail
revenues, that are payable to wholesale suppliers of the
domains, are recognised in deferred costs; and
• Revenues from strategic consultancy and other similar
services are recognised in proportion to the stage of
completion of the work.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions regarding the
future, which are regularly evaluated including expectations
of the future that are considered reasonable given historic
experience and current circumstances. In the future, actual
experience may differ from these estimates and assumptions.
18    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 The Board considers the carrying value of Intangible assets in
particular given the relative materiality to the Group. While the
Board acknowledges that estimates and assumptions could
have a material impact on the carrying value of the intangible
assets, the Board has considered the potential for impairment
as well as the estimated useful lives of the assets and does
not consider the carrying values to be impaired. Further details
are provided in note 4 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Group financial risk management
The Board reviews the ﬁnancial risk management policy,
noting that the Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk arising from ﬁnancial instruments. Further
details of the Financial Risk Management Framework is
provided in note 29 to the ﬁnancial statements.
The Group’s ﬁnance function is responsible for managing
investment and funding requirements including cashﬂow
monitoring and projections. The cashﬂow projections are
reviewed regularly by the Board to ensure the Group has
sufficient liquidity at all times to meet its cash requirements
and execute its business strategy.
The Group’s strategy is to ﬁnance its operations through the
cash generated from operations and where necessary, equity
and debt ﬁnance, notably to support investing activities.
The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments comprise cash and various
items such as trade and deferred receivables. The Group
had £10.9m of cash at the year-end, with interest bearing
ﬁnancial assets bearing interest at ﬁxed interest rates. Deposit
risk is mitigated by the Directors setting policy that the Group
only places deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institutions with
high credit ratings.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk from trade receivables is
relatively low, due to the fact that the business has traditionally
dealt with customers who often pay at the point or sale or in
advance. Where there are credit accounts, which is an
increasing trend in the industry particularly for the larger
domain name registrars, receivables are controlled through
credit limits and regular monitoring.
Foreign currency risk
The Board notes that the Group has predominantly traded in
US Dollars, Euros, GB Sterling Pounds and Australian Dollars,
and considers the exposure to foreign currency risk to be
acceptable. The Group has held reserves in each of these
currencies to meet trading obligations as required. The
currency risk is actively monitored through a periodic review of
inﬂows and outflows by currency, including an assessment
of the extent to which currencies are naturally hedged across
the Group’s business lines. Where this is not the case,
consideration is given to the use of hedging instruments.

Corporate governance
The Corporate Governance Report, on pages 26 to 28 is
incorporated into this report by reference.
Corporate responsibility
The Board recognises its employment, environmental and
health and safety responsibilities, and devotes appropriate
resources towards monitoring and improving compliance
with existing standards.
Management and staff
CentralNic’s management team has been assembled to ensure
the Group has the number of people and range of skills required
to deliver the business strategy and to support the expansion of
the Group as it becomes an increasingly international business.
The team is diverse and brings functional expertise across a
number of disciplines including technical and operational
delivery, finance, law, marketing and sales.
While the business is managed under budgetary controls, the
Directors focus on ensuring there is succession planning in
place as is appropriate for a business of our size.
Our staff and consultants represent a number of different
nationalities, and we are pleased by the gender diversity in
our business.
The executive leaders within the business recognise the
importance of engaging with employees and do so informally
on a day to day basis. We often use a cascade approach to
employee communications, with the heads of departments
disseminating appropriate information to their teams, including
those situated in various locations around the world.
While we do not believe that human rights issues are a
significant risk to our business currently, we are conscious that
as we expand into new international markets issues of human
rights may become more significant. The Directors keep all
aspects of business development under review, and act with
caution and integrity to ensure all our activities and specifically
business development activities are respectful of human rights.
Communication with employees is primarily through formal
and informal meetings and through the use of the Group’s
information systems This comprises regular communication of
information affecting our managers and their teams, to ensure
all employees are kept up to date with issues affecting them.
The Board recognises the importance of engaged employees
working within the Group and how they are vital to the future
success of the business. However, given the size of the Group
and the specialist nature of its technical operations, there is
dependency on a few key individuals and this is discussed
further in the Strategic Report on page 15.
The Group is committed to achieving equal opportunities and
to complying with anti-discrimination legislation. The Group is
committed to offering employees and job applicants equal and
fair opportunity to benefit from employment without regard to
their sex, sexual orientation, marital status, race, religion or
belief, age or disability.
The Group has a policy of share participation for employees
across the Group at all levels.
Standards accreditations
CentralNic’s wholesale business is certified against ISO 27001
(Information security management), ISO 9001 (Quality
management system) and ISO 22301 (Business continuity
management) having achieved ISO22301 accreditation during
2016. These certifications are internationally recognised and
provide CentralNic’s stakeholders with additional levels of
assurance as to the technical integrity of the Group’s IT system.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 23 Directors’ report continued

openly. Clear lines of communication and responsibility are in
place to report any incidences or suspected incidences of
abuse to provide an effective, trusted reporting mechanism.
Environment
The Group is committed to operating in an environmentally
responsible manner. The Directors consider environmental
impact when making decisions.
The community, charitable and political donations
The Directors consider the impact on the community when
making decisions. During the year charitable donations totalling

in the UK or overseas.
Policy on the payment of creditors
The Group’s policy is to agree terms and conditions for its
business transactions with suppliers and to endeavour to abide
by these terms and conditions, subject to the supplier meeting
their obligations.
No one supplier is considered to be essential to the business
of the Group.
R&D activity
The Group undertakes research and development activities to
enhance it’s competitive position in its chosen markets, drawing
on skilled development resource from across the Group.
Health and safety

providing for the welfare, health and safety of the Group’s
employees and have procedures in place, including regular
monitoring by third party specialists, to ensure compliance
with its legal and contractual obligations.
Business continuity

designed to provide data security and continuity of service.
The Board recognises the ongoing importance of resilience to
cyber threats and invests in primary and secondary data centres
along with a distributed domain name server constellation
operated by the Group and third party providers. The Board
keeps the infrastructure requirements under review and adopts a
continuous improvement approach to further investment, within
appropriate parameters, as business activities expand. The
technical provision, alongside customer support, is considered
one of the most significant aspects of Business Continuity.
Statement of Directors responsibilities in respect of
the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report,
the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs’) as
adopted by the EU and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of
the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these
financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
24    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 They are further responsible for ensuring that the Strategic Report
and the Report of the Directors and other information included in
the Annual Report and Financial Statements is prepared in
accordance with applicable law in the United Kingdom.
The maintenance and integrity of the CentralNic website is the
responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve the consideration of these matters
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred in the accounts since they
were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of the accounts and the other information included
in annual reports may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Disclosure of audit information
The Directors confirm that, as at the date of approval of this
annual report and these financial statements, so far as each
Director is aware there is no relevant audit information of which
the Company’s auditor is unaware and that he or she has taken
all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in
order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is
aware of that information.
Going concern
The Directors have in place procedures to review the forecasts
and budgets for the coming year, which have been drawn up
with appropriate regard for both the macroeconomic
environment in which the Group operates and the particular
circumstances influencing the Domain Name industry and the
Group itself. These were prepared with reference to historic and
current industry knowledge, contracted trading activities and
prospects that relate to the future strategy of the Group. As a
result, at the time of approving the financial statements, the
Directors consider that the Company and the Group have
sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future and that it is appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis in the preparation of the financial statements.
As with all forecasts, the Directors cannot guarantee that the
going concern basis will remain appropriate given the inherent
uncertainty relating to future events. Principal areas of
Uncertainty and Risks are highlighted on pages 14 and 15.
Auditors
The Company’s independent external auditors, Crowe Clark
Whitehill LLP , were initially appointed on 17 July 2013 and were
most recently reappointed at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting of 7 June 2017. It is proposed by the Board they be
put forward for reappointment as auditors and a resolution
concerning their reappointment will be proposed at the
forthcoming AGM.

Cautionary statement
Under the Companies Act 2006, a Company’s Directors’ are required to produce
a Strategic Report which contains, among other matters, a fair review by the
Directors of the Group’s business, through a balanced and comprehensive
analysis of the development and performance of the business of the Group and
the position of the Group at the year end, consistent with the size and complexity
of the business.
The Directors’ Report set out above, including the Chairman’s Statement, the
Chief Executive’s Report, and the Chief Financial Officer’s Report incorporated
into it by reference (together with the Directors’ Report), has been prepared only
for the shareholders of the Company as a whole, and its sole purpose and use
is to assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. In particular, the
Directors’ Report has not been audited or otherwise independently verified.
The Company and its Directors and employees are not responsible for any
other purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future developments and
other forward-looking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with,
among other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring from
time to time in the countries, sectors and business segments in which the
Group operates.
These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Principal
Risks and Uncertainties. These and other factors could adversely affect the
Group’s results, strategy and prospects. Forward-looking statements involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. They relate to events and/or depend on
circumstances in the future which could cause actual results and outcomes to
differ materially from those currently anticipated. No obligation is assumed to
update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. Corporate governance
Introduction
The Board of CentralNic Plc places governance and controls at
the centre of its strategy. CentralNic Plc has a dedicated
Compliance Committee which meets monthly. The remit of the
Compliance Committee is to ensure that all governance policies
are administered, reviewed and complied with across CentralNic
Plc Group. Don Baladasan, the CFO of CentralNic Plc, chairs
this committee and provides a conduit between The Board and
The Compliance Committee. This ensures timely decisions and
challenges are communicated to The Board. In addition, a formal
summary report relating on the Compliance Committee is
reported at Board meetings.
CentralNic takes a multi-disciplinary approach to governance as
it is not possible to have strong governance being driven by one
department due to departments interacting on day-to-day
operations. The Compliance Committee has representation from
Sales, Marketing, Technology, Operations, Legal and Finance
departments. By engaging with each department and team
leaders, CentralNic works to improve communication,
transparency and accountability in compliance matters.
CentralNic manages enforcement through well publicised
guidelines and policies.
CentralNic views this approach as integral to having a compliant
and robust governance structure. Governance in CentralNic is
seen as a culture and is communicated to staff and embedded
in policies and procedures to ensure compliance. CentralNic
uses legal, industry and political frameworks to create a culture
and infrastructure to attain strong governance and controls.
CentralNic sees governance not only as compliance driven
requirement but as an opportunity to gain commercial sustainability
and advantage. Improved compliance can build customer trust
by ensuring high standards of data processing and security
standards. With GDPR coming into force the measures put into
place in the preceding years on data security, internal training, and
experience of implementing new procedures are engaged to meet
the changes required. This is done by placing all stakeholders at
the centre of governance policy and implementation.
CentralNic uses formalised frameworks and directives such as
MAR, ISO standards and AIM regulations to help build and
maintain a compliant governance structure. Critical to the
business is the infrastructure and technology CentralNic uses
to provide services. Robust business continuity and disaster
recovery plans are in place and tested on a regular basis. IT
security policies and operational controls are in place. CentralNic
continues to engage, monitor and shape internet governance at
ICANN and other international forums, bodies and regulators.
A key tenet of this compliance is to look not only at procedures
but also how technology and systems can drive and support
compliance and manage risks appropriately.
Board governance and policy
The Directors appreciate the value of good corporate governance
and have regard to the provisions of the Corporate Governance
Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies, published from time
to time by the Quoted Companies Alliance, to the extent that they
believe it is appropriate in light of the size, stage of development
and resources of an AIM-quoted company.
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, three
executive directors and four non-executive directors. The Board
meets regularly to consider the business strategy, performance
and the framework of internal controls. To enable the Board to
discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely
information. Briefing papers are distributed to all Directors in
advance of Board meetings. All Directors have access to the
advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is
responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures are followed,
and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with.
In addition, procedures are in place to enable the Directors to
obtain independent professional advice in the furtherance of their
duties, if necessary, at the Company’s expense. In line with the
requirements of the Company’s Articles of Association, the
Group has voluntarily chosen that two Directors will retire at the
Annual General Meeting and being eligible, will offer themselves
for re-election.

Risk management and internal controls

maintaining the Group’s financial and non-financial controls,

responsibilities for aspects of the Group’s affairs and have

The Company prepares annual Budgets which are reviewed by
the Board. The Budgets are then updated during the year to
provide latest forecasts.
Capital expenditure is regulated by the Budget process, and is
kept under regular review during the year. Investment appraisal
techniques, using discounted cashflow projections, are
deployed in relation to material investments and are reviewed
by the Board as part of good governance such that material
transactions that are significant in terms of their size or type
are only undertaken after Board review.
The Board acknowledges that there are processes in place for
identifying, evaluating and managing risks faced by the Group,
and places emphasis on continuous process improvement.
Corporate responsibility, the environment
and health and safety
The Group is committed to maintaining and promoting high
standards of business integrity. Company values, which
incorporate the principles of corporate social responsibility
and sustainability, guide the Group’s relationships with its
stakeholders including clients, employees and the
communities and environment in which the Group operates.
The Group’s approach to sustainability addresses both its
environmental and social impacts, supporting the Group’s vision
to remain an employer of choice, while meeting client demands
for socially responsible partners. By way of example the Group
companies have arranged and promoted a number of ACE
(Athletics, Community and Environmental) activities in the past.
The Company is also certified by the Carbon Neutral Company.
The Group respects local laws and customs while supporting
international laws and regulations. These policies have been
integral in the way Group companies have done business in the
past and will continue to play a central role in influencing the
Group’s practice in the future.
Communications with shareholders
The Board regards the importance of effective communication
with shareholders as essential. Relations with shareholders are
managed principally by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and the Chairman, and meetings are regularly
held with institutional investors and analysts during the year.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer
and if required other Executive and Non-Executive Directors
make themselves available for meetings with major shareholders
either individually or collectively. The Group’s shareholders are
invited to attend the AGM at which the majority of Directors are
present. The Group’s Nominated Advisors and Joint Brokers
also convey shareholder opinions to the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and these are discussed with the Board.
The Group’s website contains information on current business
activities, including the annual and interim results.

to performance and as a result create a performance culture
within the business.
The Directors believe that it is important to properly motivate and

Shareholders. The Directors also recognise the importance of
ensuring that all employees are engaged, incentivised and
identify closely with the profitability of the Company.

Share options
Prior to admission to AIM, CentralNic established both and an
unapproved share option scheme and an Enterprise Management
Incentive option scheme (EMI) under which certain key executives
and employees were invited to participate. These options were
rolled over into the Company during 2013.
To reflect existing commitments, the options granted in June 2013
for the unapproved option scheme and the EMI scheme vest in
12 equal instalments at 3 month intervals following the Admission
(so that the options have fully vested). The unapproved options
granted on 14 October 2013 vest 3 years after the date of grant
(so again these options have fully vested).

applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at
31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the period
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the
FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in
relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:
• The directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or
• The directors have not disclosed in the financial statements
any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant
doubt about the Group’s or the parent company’s ability to
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for
a period of at least twelve months from the date when the
financial statements are authorised for issue.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
In planning and performing our audit we applied the concept of
materiality. An item is considered material if it could reasonably
be expected to change the economic decisions of a user of
the financial statements. We used the concept of materiality
to both focus our testing and to evaluate the impact of
misstatements identified.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined overall
materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be
£200,000 (2016: £170,000). In determining this, we considered
a range of benchmarks with specific focus and weighting on
revenue (0.75% of Group revenue) and profit (8% of Group
profit) for the financial year.
We use a different level of materiality (‘performance materiality’)
to determine the extent of our testing for the audit of the financial
statements. Performance materiality is set based on the audit
materiality as adjusted for the judgements made as to the entity
risk and our evaluation of the specific risk of each audit area
having regard to the internal control environment.
Where considered appropriate performance materiality may be
reduced to a lower level, such as, for related party transactions
and directors’ remuneration.
We agreed with the Audit Committee to report to it all identified
errors in excess of £6,000. Errors below that threshold would
also be reported to it if, in our opinion as auditor, disclosure
was required on qualitative grounds.
Overview of the scope of our audit
We conducted full scope audit work, engaging where
appropriate with component auditors, in four countries (UK,
Australia, New Zealand and Slovakia)) in which the Group has
significant operations. In addition, we performed the audit of
specific balances and transactions in six countries.
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken
at each of the components by us, as the primary audit
engagement team. For the full scope components in
Australia/New Zealand and Slovakia, where the work was
performed by two component auditors, we determined the
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine
that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis
for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
32    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 The primary team led by the Senior Statutory Auditor was
ultimately responsible for the scope and direction of the audit
process. The primary team interacted regularly with the
component teams where appropriate during various stages
of the audit and reviewed all relevant working papers. This,
together with the additional procedures performed at Group
level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the
Group financial statements.
Key audit matters
In preparing the financial statements, management made a
number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of
significant accounting estimates that involved making
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently
uncertain. We focused our work primarily on these areas by
assessing management’s judgements against available evidence,
forming our own judgements and evaluating the disclosures in the
financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management
override of controls, including evaluating whether there was
evidence of bias by management, which may represent a risk of
material misstatement, especially in areas of critical accounting
estimates and judgements as outlined in note 1.
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period and include the most significant
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of
the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the
context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole,
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using
sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we
considered necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to
draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing
the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a
combination of both. In determining the key audit matters we
noted the following changes from the prior year:
• The assessment of the SK-Nic A.S. business combination as
a significant audit risk was specific for the current year ended
31 December 2017, being the year of acquisition.
• The assessment of the Instra Holdings business combination
was specific for the prior year ended 31 December 2016.
There have been no other changes in the Group’s overall
operations during the current year that significantly impacted our
audit. Therefore, our assessment of the most significant risks of
material misstatement and resulting key audit matters, which are
those risks having the greatest effect on the audit strategy and
requiring particular focus, are otherwise the same as in the prior
year and are detailed below.
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Key audit matter in the audit of the group How the scope of our audit addressed the key audit matter
The Group’s operating revenue arises from domain sales,
consultancy services, corporate revenues and software
licensing services and amounted to £24.3 million for the year
ended 31 December 2017.
The revenue recognition for these various revenue streams
is sometimes different to the timing of cash flows received
and is recognised in the accounting period in which the
services are rendered, as per the Group’s accounting policy
in Note 3 to the financial statements.
Revenue is a key measure of the financial performance of
the Group, and in our view is of particular interest to the
users of the financial statements in assessing the
performance of the Group.                                                   
Revenue recognition
We obtained an understanding of the revenue agreements
and evaluated the Group’s processes and controls in place
to calculate the amount and timing of subscription and
activity based revenue transactions.
We performed the following audit procedures on a sample
basis, for both existing and new contracts, to assess the
appropriateness of revenue recognition for individual
transactions:
• assessed the appropriateness of the allocation of
various revenue elements with reference to the terms of
the contract;
• ensured revenue recognised from subscription fees was
supported by signed contracts;
• assessed the existence of debtors through testing to
contracts, cash received where applicable and a review
of credit notes issued after year-end;
• assessed that revenue was recognised in the correct
period, agreeing back to supporting documentation the
contract price and the period in which the services
were delivered. Independent auditors report continued

Key audit matter in the audit of the group How the scope of our audit addressed the key audit matter
During the year, the Group completed the acquisition of
SK-Nic a.s. as disclosed in Note 25. The Group has
determined this acquisition to be a business combination
for which the purchase price is to be allocated between
acquired assets and liabilities and identified intangible
assets, and leading to the resultant recognition of goodwill
at their respective fair values.
The Group used projected financial information in the
purchase price allocation (‘PPA’) exercise.
Management use their best knowledge to make estimates
when utilising the Group’s valuation methodologies. In order
to determine the fair value of the separately identifiable
intangible assets on a business combination, the valuation
methodologies require input based on assumptions
about the future and use discounted cash flows and cash
flow forecasts.
Due to the Group’s estimation process in the PPA exercise
and the work effort from the audit team, business
combinations is considered a key audit matter.
Business combinations and acquisition accounting (Including the carrying value of goodwill
and separately identifiable intangible assets)
Our procedures included the following:
• Assessing whether the acquisition during the year met
the criteria of a business combination in accordance with
IFRS 3;
• Validating whether the date of acquisition was correctly
determined by scrutinising the key transaction documents
to understand key terms and conditions;
• Assessing the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded in
the purchase price allocation, by performing procedures
including considering the completeness of assets and
liabilities identified and the reasonableness of any
underlying assumptions in their respective valuations and
this would also include assessment on the reasonableness
of the useful lives of the intangible assets and the
consideration given;
• We used our knowledge of the acquired business, and
its industry, to assess the cash flow forecasts used to
determine the value of intangible assets recognised on
date of acquisition. We challenged the key assumptions
used to determine the value of intangible assets, including
those relating to growth rates and discount rates; and
• Assessing the disclosures in respect of the business
combination.
When assessing the carrying value of goodwill, investments
(including fair value) and intangible assets, management
make judgements regarding the appropriate cash generating
unit, strategy, future trading and profitability and the
assumptions underlying these. We considered the risk that
goodwill, investments and/or intangible assets were impaired.
Carrying value of goodwill, investments and intangible assets
We evaluated, in comparison to the requirements set out in
IAS36, management’s assessment as to whether goodwill,
investments and/or intangible assets were impaired and the
appropriateness in respect of any reversal of previous
impairment made.
We examined Management’s evaluation of the fair value
of investments.
We challenged, reviewed and considered by reference to
external evidence, management’s impairment and fair value
models as appropriate and their key estimates, including the
discount rate. We reviewed the appropriateness and
consistency of the process for making such estimates.
We have no other key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements. Our audit procedures in relation to these matters were designed
in the context of our audit opinion as a whole. They were not
designed to enable us to express an opinion on these matters
individually and we express no such opinion.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other
information comprises the information included in the annual
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion based on the work undertaken in the course of
our audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the
directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial
statements; and
• the directors’ report and strategic report have been prepared
in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group
and the parent company and their environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we have not identified material
misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not
been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of the directors for the
financial statements
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement
set out on page 24, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the
preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are
responsible for assessing the group’s and parent company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate
the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 35 Independent auditors report continued
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so
that we might state to the company’s members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Consolidated statement
of cash ﬂows
for the year ended 31 December 2017
40    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 1. General information
(a) Nature of operations
CentralNic Group Plc is the UK holding company of a group of companies which are engaged in the provision of global domain
name services. The Company is registered in England and Wales. Its registered office and principal place of business is
35-39 Moorgate, London, EC2R 6AR. 
The CentralNic Group provides wholesale (“registry”), retail (“registrar”) and enterprise services and strategic consultancy for new
Top Level Domains (“TLDs”), Country Code TLD’s (“ccTLDs”) and Second-Level Domains (“SLDs”) and it is the owner and registrant
of a portfolio of domain names, which it uses as domain extensions and for resale on the domain name aftermarket.
(b) Component undertakings
The principal activities of the subsidiaries and other entities included in the financial statements are presented within the Particulars
of Subsidiaries and Associates on pages 78 and 79 of these financial statements. 
2. Application of IFRS
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements are measured and presented in sterling (£), unless otherwise stated, which is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which many of the entities operate. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except
for those financial instruments which have been measured at fair value through profit and loss.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will continue to be able to
meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”), including related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”).
The Directors have reviewed forecasts and budgets for the coming year having regard to both the macroeconomic environment in
which the Group operates, historic and current industry knowledge and contracted trading activities and the future strategy of the
Group. As a result of that review the Directors consider that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of preparation.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards not yet effective
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective and in
some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU.
As described below, the Directors have completed their detailed review of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and concluded that the adoption of
these standards would have no material impact on Financial Instruments and Revenue Recognition respectively from the next set of
financial statements. Whilst Directors carry out their detailed review on IFRS 16, which is effective from 1 January 2019, it is currently
expected that no material impact will arise from the adoption of this standard.
IFRS 15 is a prescriptive standard which requires a business to identify the performance obligations which are contracted with its
customer base. The transaction price of the contract is determined after which the transaction price is allocated against the identified
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised against each of the performance obligations as they are satisfied and as control is
transferred. The Group has evaluated the revenue recognition policy in place against the requirement of the standard. Performance
obligations within customer contracts have been identified where domain names are sold for a term, where the management,
customer and technical support is available to the customer over the period of that term, in both Wholesale and Retail Division.
The transaction price of the contract is evaluated in accordance with IFRS 15, and is attached to the performance obligations of the
customer contract. Performance obligations are deemed to be satisfied by transferring control rateably over the period of contractual
time, being the anniversary of the expiry date of the domain name. Enterprise and consultancy revenues take a similar approach,
however revenues here are either recognised when control is passed onto the customer either on a percentage completion basis
inline with contractual milestones or immediately recognised on delivery of the contracted work. Overall, the business has determined
that there is no material impact on the adoption of IFRS 15.
IFRS 9 relates to Financial Instruments which contains the requirement for a) the classification and measurement of financial assets
and financial liabilities, b) Impairment methodology, and c) general hedge accounting. As disclosed in note 29, the Group measures
it’s financial assets and liabilities and accounts for any expected credit losses on the basis of fair value recognition. Therefore, the
adoption of the IFRS 9 causes no material impact on the financial statements.
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 41 3. Summary of significant accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as explained in the accounting policies set out below,
which has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
(a) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all subsidiaries. The financial year ends of all entities in the
Group are coterminous.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control over the
operating and financial decisions is obtained and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the
Group. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including recognised gains arising from inter-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as recognised gains except to the extent that they provide evidence of impairment. 
(b) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of
the consideration transferred measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in
administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value
and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If the contingent consideration is not
within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity
is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised
for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair
value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the
amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired
over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing,
goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are
expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill
associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on
disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the
portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
(c) Functional and foreign currencies
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds
sterling (£) the Group’s and the Company’s presentational currency.
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements continued
42    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognised in the income statement, except where deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and
qualifying net-investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are
presented in the income statement within finance income or finance costs. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognised in profit and loss within administrative expenses.
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all of the Group entities, none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy that
have a functional currency different from the presentation currency of the Group are translated as follows:
a) assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of
financial position;
b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a
reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing at the transaction dates, in which case income and
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions).
c) All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity
and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
(d) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statements of financial position when CentralNic or one of the CentralNic Group
entities has become a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.
The CentralNic Group’s financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
The carrying value of the CentralNic Group’s financial assets (primarily cash and bank balances) and liabilities (primarily CentralNic’s
payables and other accrued expenses) approximate their fair values.
Financial instruments are offset when the CentralNic Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to settle either on a
net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Financial instruments recognised in the pro forma aggregated statements of financial position are disclosed in the individual policy
statement associated with each item.
(i) Financial assets 
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity
investments, loans and receivables financial assets, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (including deposits and prepayments) that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as other receivables, deposits and prepayments. Other receivables, deposits and prepayments are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment loss. Interest income is recognised by applying
the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Derivative financial instruments
Cash flow hedge
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair-value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair-value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated a hedging
instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group has only undertaken hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction (cash flow hedges).
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 43 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as
risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment,
both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives which are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit and loss in the period or periods that the hedged item affects profit and loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or where a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any cumulative
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in
the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss which was reported
in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
Cash and bank balances
Cash and bank balances comprise cash balances that are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by
the CentralNic Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
(ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities are classified as liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest,
dividends, gains and losses relating to financial liabilities are reported in profit or loss. Distributions to holders of financial liabilities are
classified as equity and charged directly to equity.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings, trade and other payables and accruals, measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest income over
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees on
points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)
through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the CentralNic Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised as liabilities when approved for appropriation.
(e) Property, plant, and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements and office furniture and equipment, are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. 
Depreciation is calculated using the methods below to write off the depreciable amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation of an asset does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully
depreciated. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
                                                                                                                   UK                     Australia              New Zealand                    Germany                      Slovakia
Depreciation method                                              Reducing            Reducing            Reducing               Straight               Straight 
                                                                                Balance              Balance              Balance                    Line                    Line
Computer equipment                                           60% – 65%                   25%                   25%                   33%                   20%
Furniture and fittings                                            15% – 20%                5-10%                5-20%                   10%                   20%
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements continued
44    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
The depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting
period to ensure that the amounts, method and periods of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected
pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
Subsequent component replacement costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when the cost is incurred and it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow
to the CentralNic Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of parts that are replaced is
derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Cost also comprises the initial estimate of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located for which
the CentralNic Group are obliged to incur when the asset is acquired, if applicable.
An item of property and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use.
Any gain or loss arising from de-recognition of the asset is recognised in profit or loss.
(f) Intangible assets
Intangible assets represent amounts paid to acquire the rights to own and act as registrant for a portfolio of domain names.
Capitalised domain names have a finite useful life and are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses,
if any. Domain names are amortised on an annual basis at the rate of 10% reducing balance. 
Domain names not held for resale are included in the balance sheet at amortised cost and classified as “Domain names” and
amortised over their useful lives. Domain names held for resale are included in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net
realisable value and classified as stock held for sale, no amortisation being charged. If a decision is taken to sell a domain name
previously included in intangible assets it is reclassified as stock at net book value prior to sale.
The useful economic life for the software acquired as part of the Internet.BS, Instra and SK-NIC acquisitions is five years with the
customer list acquired being amortised over ten years.
Development costs that the CentralNic Group incurs for identifiable and unique software will be capitalised, where the following
criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated that the asset will probably generate future economic benefits; and 
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.
• that there are adequate technical and finance resources available to complete this development.
Costs capitalised in relation to computer software development may relate to either:
• completely separable software, or;
• enhancements of existing software which are clearly identifiable as new modules within the system or new features which enable
the asset to generate additional future economic benefit. For the avoidance of doubt this excludes the ongoing maintenance to the
existing software.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the employee costs and an appropriate portion
of the relevant overheads. Computer software development recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives,
which are determined by the Directors.
Costs for development initiatives that the CentralNic Group undertakes that are not otherwise allocable to specific domain names or
projects are charged to expense through profit and loss when incurred.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 45 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business
combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development
costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. 
Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually if facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In the event that
the expected future economic benefits of the intangible assets are no longer probable or expected to be recovered, the capitalised
amounts are written down to their recoverable amount through profit and loss.
(g) Impairment 
(i) Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets not categorised at fair value through profit or loss are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine
whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event(s) had an impact on the estimated
future cash flows of the asset. Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired includes default or delinquency by a debtor and the
restructuring of an amount due to the CentralNic Group on terms that the CentralNic Group would not consider otherwise. 
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, including other receivables and deposits, is recognised
in profit or loss and is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in profit or loss and reflected in an
allowance account against the amounts receivable.
When the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying
amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the
impairment not been recognised. 
(ii) Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying values of non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated. The recoverable amount of the asset is the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost to sell and their value-in-use, which is
measured by reference to discounted future cash flows. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount of an asset is treated as a reversal of the
previous impairment loss and is recognised to the extent of the carrying amount of the asset that would have been determined (net of
amortisation and depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised. The reversal is recognised in profit or loss immediately. 
(h) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and bank balances comprise of cash in hand, bank balances, deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(i) Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits, including wages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are
accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the CentralNic Group.
(j) Leases
Assets held under leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the CentralNic Group’s statement of financial
position. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements continued
46    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
(k) Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises of current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and is measured using the tax
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than those that arise from goodwill or excess of the
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the business
combination costs or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the
time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and
unused tax credits can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred
tax assets to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or
the liability is settled, based on the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in
correlation to the underlying transactions either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a
business combination is included in the resulting goodwill or excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the business combination costs. 
(l) Share based payments
Employees (including Directors and Senior Executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment
transactions, whereby these individuals render services as consideration for equity instruments (“equity-settled transactions”). These
individuals are granted share option rights approved by the Board which can only be settled in shares of the respective companies
that award the equity-settled transactions. Share option rights are also granted to these individuals by majority shareholders over their
shares held. No cash settled awards have been made or are planned.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the
performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant individuals become fully entitled to the
award (“vesting point”). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments and
value that will ultimately vest. The statement of comprehensive income charge for the year represents the movement in the cumulative
expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
The fair value of share-based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the statement of
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that will
vest. The fair value is determined by use of Black Scholes model method.
(m) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
Provisions are recognised if, as a result of a past event, the CentralNic Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, when it is
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable
estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each financial reporting period and adjusted to reflect the
current best estimate. Where effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is the present value of the estimated
expenditure required to settle the obligation.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 47 3. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the CentralNic Group. It can also be a present obligation arising
from past events that is not recognised because it is not probable that outflow of economic resources will be required or the amount
of obligation cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent liability is not recognised in the financial statements but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. When a
change in the probability of a contingent outflow occurs so that the outflow is probable, a liability will be recognised as a provision.
A contingent asset is a probable asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the CentralNic Group. The CentralNic Group
does not recognise contingent assets but discloses their existence where inflows of economic benefits are probable, but not
virtually certain.
(n) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services
provided in the course of ordinary activities, net of discounts and sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the amounts of revenue and cost can be measured reliably. In particular:
(i) Sale of Wholesale (“registry”) services for domain names (“Wholesale Domain sales”)
Wholesale revenues are generated from the provision of wholesale and related services between a registrar and registry operator.
The sub revenue streams would be those of new registrations and renewals. The division performs the role of both the registry
operator and registry service provider for the legacy proprietary domains that the company owns and operates. For third party domain
names, the division provides the registry service provision, whether this be purely technical provision, or incorporate marketing and
billing and cash collection services. An invoice under the Wholesale Division could cover the sale of a domain name for a fixed term
period which could vary between one and ten years. An invoice generated to the registrar is offset by invoice from the registry
operator to derive net revenues. Revenues that relate to the period in which the services are performed are recognised in the income
statement of that period, with the amounts relating to future periods being deferred into ‘Deferred revenues.’
Revenue from strategic consultancy and similar services is recognised in profit and loss in proportion to the stage of completion of
the assignment at the reporting date. The stage of completion is determined based on completion of work performed to date as a
percentage of total services to be performed.
(ii) Sale of Retail (“registrar”) services for domain names (“Retail Domain sales”)
Retail revenues are generated from the provision of retail and similar services to domain registrants and resellers. The sub revenue
streams would be those of new registrations and renewals. Revenue originates when a transaction is generated on the service registry
platform by the customer. The transaction constitutes a term period which may vary between one and ten years. Revenues that relate
to the period in which the services are performed are recognised in the income statement of that period, with the amounts relating to
future periods being deferred into ‘Deferred revenues’. These revenues are matched to deferred wholesale costs which cover the
same period of the underlying sale.
(iii) Sale of Enterprise services including premium domain names (“Enterprise including Premium Domain Name Sales”)
Revenue from enterprise services and premium domain name sales are recognised in profit and loss at the point of sale. Revenue
from the provision of computer software to a customer is recognised when the Group has delivered the related software and
completed all of the adaptions required by the customer for either the whole contract or for a specific milestone deliverable within
the contract. Where no adaptions are required revenue is recognised on delivery.
Revenue from strategic consultancy and similar services is recognised in profit and loss in proportion to the stage of completion of
the assignment at the reporting date. The stage of completion is determined based on completion of work performed.
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements continued
48    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 4. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimating uncertainty
In the application of the CentralNic Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if
the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of
financial position date that have a significant risk of causing a significant adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the Financial statements:
Impairment testing and fair value assessment
The recoverable amounts of individual non-financial assets are determined based on the higher of the value-in-use or the fair value
less costs to sell. These calculations will require the use of estimates and assumptions. It is reasonably possible that assumptions
may change, which may impact the Directors’ estimates and may then require a material adjustment to the carrying value of
investments, tangible and intangible assets. 
The Directors review and test the carrying value of investments, tangible and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances
suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purposes of performing impairment tests, assets are grouped at the
lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets or liabilities. If there are indications
that impairment may have occurred, estimates will be prepared of expected future cash flows for each group of assets. 
For available for sale assets held at fair value, the Directors review the appropriateness and reasonableness of (i) the valuation
technique(s) followed to determine the fair value and corroborative support (ii) the assumptions used in preparing such valuations and
the evaluation of the sensitivity in such assumptions (iii) the evidence of indicators of a change in fair value and (iv) the adjustments
required if there are indications that a change in fair value has arisen. 
Expected future cash flows used to determine the value in use of tangible and intangible assets will be inherently uncertain and could
materially change over time. The carrying value of the Group’s investments, tangible and intangible assets are disclosed in notes 13,
14 and 16 respectively.
Acquisition accounting and goodwill
Where the Group undertakes business combinations, the cost of acquisition is allocated to identifiable net assets and contingent
liabilities acquired and assumed by reference to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition. The remaining amount is recorded
as goodwill. The valuation of identifiable net assets involves an element of judgement related to projected results. Fair values that are
stated as provisional are not finalised at the reporting date and final fair values may be determined that are materially different from the
provisional values stated. 
Judgement was exercised in determining the fair value of the SK-NIC a.s. acquisition. Further details are set out in note 25. 
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 49 5. Segment analysis
CentralNic is an independent global domain name service provider. It provides Wholesale, Retail and Enterprise services and is the
owner and registrant of a portfolio of domain names. Operating segments are prepared in a manner consistent with the internal
reporting provided to the management as its chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to segments and to
assess their performance. The segmental analysis is organised around the products and services of the business.
The Wholesale Division is a global distributor of domain names and provides consultancy services to retailers. The Retail Division
provides domain names and ancillary services to end users, also on a global basis. The Enterprise Division represents revenue
generated by providing technical and consultancy services to corporate and DotBrand clients, licencing of the Group’s in house

12. Earnings per share
Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the consolidated profit after taxation attributable to ordinary shareholders by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on the same basis as above, except that the weighted average number of ordinary
shares that would be issued on the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares as calculated using the treasury stock method
(arising from the Group’s share option scheme and warrants) into ordinary shares has been added to the denominator. There are no
changes to the profit (numerator) as a result of the dilutive calculation.

The recoverable amount of goodwill of £29,008,000 (2016: £15,303,000) at 31 December 2017, is determined based on a value
in use using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three year period. Cash flow
projections beyond the three year timeframe are extrapolated by applying a flat growth rate in perpetuity per the table below which is
based on management judgement, historical trends, expected return on investment, experience and discretion. The pre-tax discount
rate applied to the cash flow projections is 10.0%. As a result of the analysis, management did not identify any impairment of goodwill.
                                                                                                                                                 CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 57 14. Intangible assets continued

Discount rates
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to the CGU, taking into consideration the time value of
money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate
calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and is derived from its WACC, with
appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU and to determine the pre-tax rate. The cost of equity is derived
from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. 
Management consider that no reasonable change in these key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of this asset to
exceed its value in use.

This investment is categorised in the fair value hierarchy under Level 3 as no observable market data was available.
The fair value of the investment at 31 December 2017 continues to be assessed using a price of recent investment valuation technique,
supported by a DCF valuation technique to corroborate the measure of fair value of the investment. The valuation method applied to
this investment is considered the most appropriate with regard to the stage of the development of the business and the IPEVCV
guidelines. In applying the price of recent investment valuation methodology, the basis used is the initial cost of the investment.
Notes to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements continued
58    CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 16. Investments continued
In deriving the price of recent investment the Directors have given consideration to the cost of investment arising from transactions
involving both the Company and (subsequently) third parties. In determining the continued use of the price of recent investment valuation
the directors have considered the continued validity of this method by reference to the timing of the most recent transactions, the
existence of indicators of change in fair value and the appropriateness of alternative valuation techniques. The Directors have considered
that whilst Accent Media Limited continues to be at an early-stage, more recent developments within the business provide indicators that
it is now anticipated to progress during 2018/19 in line with the expectations set when the initial investment was made by the Group.
For the corroborative valuation measures determined by use of DCF techniques, the key significant unobservable inputs include
cumulative average growth rate, weighted average cost of capital and expected operating margins. A reasonable change to the input
assumptions, such as 2% change in weighted average cost of capital would lead to an increase or decrease in the value of this
investment of approximately £250,000. 
In the event that the performance of Accent Media Limited does not meet future expectations there is a risk that a reduction in the fair
value of the investment could arise. The net assets of Accent Media Limited (in which the Group has 10.4% shareholding) in the most
recently publicly available unaudited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 were £3,619,466.

As of 31 December 2017, trade receivables of £294,000 (2016: £451,000) were past due but not impaired. These primarily relate to
four customers for whom there is considered a low risk of default.
The aging of the trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows; 0-30 days £3,000 (2016: £163,000), 30-60 days £46,000
(2016: £229,000), 60-90 days £20,000 (2016: £29,000), and over 90 days £225,000 (2016: £30,000).
The deferred costs are prepaid invoices for a period within 12 months relating to domain name purchases from wholesalers. Supplier
payments on account reflect payments to domain name registries for use against future wholesale domain purchases within the
Internet.BS and Instra retail businesses. Other receivables primarily relate to rebates due from registries in the Internet.BS retail business.
Amounts due from shareholders represent amounts due from Jabella Group Limited, a shareholder during the period. Amounts due
from Jabella Group Limited were interest free until 31 August 2013, from which time the balance accrued interest at 2% above LIBOR
(2017: £17,359; 2016: £17,749). The loan was granted in August 2011 for an initial term of five years, the balance is currently
£764,000. The loan is now repayable on demand.
The Directors are reviewing the terms of the loan and consider the loan to be fully recoverable. The Directors consider that the fair
value of this receivable is not materially different from the carrying value.

The initial cash consideration of €20.3m was funded by an increase in the SVB term loan and RCF of €18.4m and existing cash
balances held by the Group of €1.9m. 
The deferred of €1m and contingent consideration of €4.85m, totalling €5.85m, has been placed in to an escrow account and subject
to any claims will be released to the vendor in tranches until 2024. Deferred contingent cash consideration of €4.85m is dependent on
SK-NIC attaining defined growth targets over the next three years, with the remaining deferred cash consideration being payable in
2024. At 2017 year end, the deferred cash consideration has been accounted for in the consolidated statement of financial position at
fair value, using a discount factor of 10%, which has amounted to €1.06m. This will unwind as the payment stages become due
through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The growth rates in relation to the contingent consideration are calculated on the number of registered domains at the end of each
financial year over the next 3 years (post completion) with the payment profile being spread over 8 years. The last payment on the profile
is not subject to the defined growth rates. The directors have considered the range of outcomes on the target growth rate which would
trigger the unwinding of the deferred consideration and on the basis that there exists sufficient headroom against management
sensitivity to attain these domain name growth rates, they have concluded that the deferred consideration will be payable in full over
the agreed period, with the first payment from the profile having been settled in April 2018 of €1.02m.  Notes to the consolidated

25. Business combinations continued
Management have evaluated the value of the acquired customer list in relation to the domains under management at the time of
acquisition and the expected discounted futurecashflow that is expected to derive from the existing customer base, with the residual
intangible classed as goodwill. Goodwill arising on acquisition primarily relates to the inherent value of the acquired .sk ccTLD and
goodwill in relation to employees.
Acquisition related costs of £883k (2016: £348k) have been recognised in the income statement, which are included in note 9.
For the post-completion period to 31st December 2017 revenues of £291k (€330k) and Adjusted EBITDA of £230k (€260k) have been
generated by SK-NIC. SK-NIC’s revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £3,207k (€3,664k) and Adjusted EBITDA was
£2,328k (€2,659k), with profit before tax of £2,292k (€2,168k).
The trade and other receivables are stated at gross valuation which equates to the contractual amounts with no provisions being made
against them in line with the director’s expectations.

Warrants
On 12 August 2013, CentralNic Group executed a warrant instrument to create and issue warrants to Zeus Capital to subscribe for an
aggregate of 1,772,727 ordinary shares. The warrants will expire six years after admission and were exercisable after the first anniversary

The CentralNic Group is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk arising from financial instruments. The CentralNic Group’s
overall financial risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse
effects on the CentralNic Group’s financial performance. The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The principal financial instruments used by the CentralNic Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2017                          2016

(a) Financial risk management framework
The Directors’ risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the CentralNic Group, to set
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. 
(i) Market risk 
Foreign currency risk
The CentralNic Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on transactions and balances that are denominated in a currency other than
its functional currency, primarily US$ and Euros. Foreign currency risk is monitored on an on-going basis to ensure that the
net exposure is at an acceptable level. 
The CentralNic Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal as it trades predominantly in US$, Euros, GB Pound Sterling and
Australian Dollars. Exposure to currency risk is negated by the CentralNic Group holding adequate reserves in these four currencies to
meet trading and provisioned obligations as the need arises.
As the Group evolves, foreign currency risk will be monitored more closely given exposure to additional markets and currencies.

The sensitivity analyses in the table below details the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the CentralNic Group’s post-tax
profit or loss for the year ended 31 December 2017.
It is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the other currencies
remain constant.
If the GBP strengthened or weakened by 10% against the other currencies, with all other variables in each case remaining constant,
then the impact on the CentralNIC Group’s post-tax profit or loss would be gains or losses as follows:

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates. The CentralNic Group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities.
The Directors’ policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rates available. 
As at each of 31 December 2016 and 2017, CentralNic Group’s long-term debt facility entered into with SVB bearing interest at a
margin plus LIBOR.

Equity price risk
The CentralNic Group does not have any quoted investments as at each of 31 December 2016 and 2017 and as such does not
have significant exposure to equity price risk. At 31 December 2016 and 2017 the CentralNic Group held an unquoted investment in
Accent Media of £1.0m which represents a shareholding of 10.4% of the share capital.                                                                                                                                                  CentralNic Group Plc Annual Report 2017 69

(ii) Credit risk
The CentralNic Group’s exposure to credit risk arises mainly from counterparty’s failure to meet its obligation to settle a financial asset. The
Directors consider the CentralNic Group’s exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables to be minimal as the CentralNic Group is
often paid at the outset or in advance. Credit risk arising from other receivables is controlled through monitoring procedures, including credit
approvals and credit limits, with the balance largely offset by separate liabilities held on the balance sheet relating to the same party.
The CentralNic Group uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of the trade receivables. Any receivables having significant
balances past due or more than 90 days, which are deemed to have higher credit risk, are monitored individually. Analysis of the trade
receivables past due is disclosed in note 17.
For cash and bank balances, the Directors minimise the CentralNic Group’s credit risk by dealing exclusively with banks and financial
institution counterparties with high credit ratings.
The carrying amounts of financial assets at the end of the reporting periods represent the maximum credit exposure.

(iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the CentralNic Group will encounter difficulty in settling its financial obligations that are settled with cash or
another financial asset. The Directors’ objective is to maintain, as much as possible, a level of its cash and bank balances adequate
enough to ensure that there will be sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.
The following set forth the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities as at:

(b) Capital risk management
The Directors define capital as the total equity of CentralNic. The Directors’ objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the
CentralNic Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Directors
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Directors manage CentralNic’s capital based on debt-to-equity ratio. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as net debt divided
by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.  29. Financial instruments continued
The debt-to-equity ratio of the CentralNic Group as at the end of each of the reporting periods was as follows:

The SK-NIC acquisition on 5 December 2017 had an element of deferred and contingent consideration of €5.85m that has been
placed in to an escrow account and subject to any claims will be released to the vendor in tranches until 2024. Deferred cash
consideration of €5.85m is dependent on SK-NIC attaining defined growth targets over the next three years. At 2017 year end, the
deferred cash consideration has been accounted for in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value, using a discount
factor of 10%, which has amounted to €1.06m. This will unwind as the payment stages become due through the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. 
The growth rates in relation to the contingent consideration are calculated on the number of registered domains at the end of each
financial year over the next 3 years (post completion) with the payment profile being spread over 8 years. The last payment on the
profile is not subject to the defined growth rates. The directors have considered the range of outcomes on the target growth rate
which would trigger the unwinding of the deferred consideration and on the basis that there exists sufficient headroom against
management sensitivity to attain these domain name growth rates, they have concluded that the deferred consideration will be
payable in full over the agreed period, with the first payment from the profile having been settled in April 2018 of €1.02m.
(d) Fair value hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are analysed by the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The different levels are defined as follows:
Level 1: Fair value measurements are derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2: Fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

1. General information
Nature of operations
CentralNic Group Plc (“the Company”) is the UK holding company of a group of companies which are engaged in the provision of
global domain name services. The Company is registered in England and Wales. Its registered office and principal place of business
is 35-39 Moorgate, London, EC2R 6AR. 
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of
certain fixed assets. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 – The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006. The principal accounting policies are described below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the period.
3. Significant accounting policies 
(a) Going concern
At 31 December 2017, the Company had net current assets of £24,192,000 (2016: £20,174,000) with the main current asset being
amounts owed from its subsidiaries amounting to £27,121,000 (2016: £21,818,000). The Company has assessed its ongoing costs
with cash generated by its subsidiaries to ensure that it can continue to settle its debts as they fall due.
The Directors have, after careful consideration of the factors set out above, concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going
concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements and the financial statements do not include any adjustments that would
result if the going concern basis was not appropriate.
(b) Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
(c) Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they
are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell
the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements. Neither is deferred
tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax
only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Taxation arising on disposal of a revalued asset is split between the profit and loss account and the statement of changes in equity on
the basis of the tax attributable to the gain or loss recognised in each statement.
(d) Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the statements of financial position when the Company has become a party to the
contractual provisions of the instruments.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
The carrying value of the Company’s financial assets, primarily cash and bank balances, and liabilities, primarily the Company’s
payables and other accrued expenses, approximate their fair values.

ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017 3. Significant accounting policies continued
(i) Financial assets 
On initial recognition, financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity
investments, loans and receivables financial assets, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables (including deposits and prepayments) that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as other receivables, deposits, and prepayments. Other receivables, deposits, and prepayments are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment loss. Interest income is recognised by applying
the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Derivative financial instruments
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss. 
(ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities are classified as liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest,
dividends, gains and losses relating to financial liabilities are reported in profit or loss. Distributions to holders of financial liabilities are
classified as equity and charged directly to equity.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise long-term borrowings, short-term borrowings, trade and other payables and accruals, measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest income over
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees on
points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts)
through the expected life of the financial liability or where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(e) Debtors
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair value net of
transaction costs and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
(f) Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities including bank loans, are measured initially at fair
value net of transaction costs and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(g) Parent Company disclosure exemptions 
In preparing the separate financial statements of the Parent Company, advantage has been taken of the following disclosure
exemptions available in FRS 102:
• Only one reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and end of the period has been presented as the
reconciliations for the Group (see note 19 in the notes to the Group financial statements) and the Parent Company would be
identical. Hence, the Parent Company has not disclosed this reconciliation in its notes to the financial statements;
• Disclosures in respect of the Parent Company’s financial instruments and share-based payment arrangements have not been
presented as equivalent disclosures have been provided in respect of the Group as a whole; 
• No disclosure has been given for the aggregate remuneration of the key management personnel of the Parent Company as their
remuneration is included in the totals for the Group as a whole; and
• No cash flow statement has been presented for the Parent Company.

4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the Directors are required to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources.
The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if
the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the statement of
financial position date that have a significant risk of causing a significant adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
in the Financial statements:
Share-based payment
The fair value of share-based remuneration is determined at the date of grant and recognised as an expense in the statement of
comprehensive income on a straight line basis over the vesting period, taking account of the estimated number of shares that will
vest. The fair value is determined by use of Black Scholes model method.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be
available in the future against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. To determine the future taxable profits,
reference is made to the latest available profit forecasts. Where the temporary differences are related to losses, relevant tax law is
considered to determine the availability of the losses to offset against the future taxable profits. 
5. Profit for the financial period
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and, consequently, a profit and loss account for the Company
alone has not been presented. The Company’s loss for the financial period was £1,383,000 (2016: profit £857,000) which included a net loss
on foreign currency translation of £209,000 (2016: gain of £2,511,000). The Company’s profit for the financial year has been arrived at after
charging auditor’s remuneration payable to Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP for audit services to the Company of £60,000 (2016: £59,000).

Share fraud warning
Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of
the blue and offered shares that often turn out to be worthless or
non-existent, or an inflated price for shares they own. These
calls come from fraudsters operating in ‘boiler rooms’ that are
mostly based abroad.
While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in
this way usually lose their money.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found most share
fraud victims are experienced investors who lose an average of
£20,000, with around £200m lost in the UK each year.
PROTECT YOURSELF
If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted
shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company or
research reports, you should take these steps before handing
over any money:
• Get the name of the person and organisation contacting you.
• Check the Financial Services Register at
http://www.fca.org.uk/ to ensure they are authorised.
• Use the details on the FCA Register to contact the firm.
• Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there
are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are
out of date.
• Search our list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid
doing business with.
REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
If you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares or other
investments, you will not have access to the Financial
Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation
Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.
REPORT A SCAM
If you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA
using the share fraud reporting form at http://www.fca.org.uk/
scams, where you can find out about the latest investment scams.
You can also call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
Identity theft
Tips for protecting your shares in the Company:
• Ensure all your certificates are kept in a safe place or hold
your shares electronically in CREST via a nominee.
• Keep correspondence from us and Link in a safe place and
destroy any unwanted correspondence by shredding.
• If you change address, inform Link in writing or update your
address online via the shareholder portal. If you receive a letter
from Link regarding a change of address but have not moved,
please contact them immediately.
• Consider having your dividend paid directly into your bank.
This will reduce the risk of the cheque being intercepted or
lost in the post. If you change your bank account, inform Link
of the details of your new account. You can do this by post
or online via the shareholder portal.
• If you are buying or selling shares, only deal with brokers
registered and authorised to carry out that type of business.
• Be wary of phone calls or e-mails purporting to come from us
or Link asking you to confirm personal details or details of your
investment in our shares. Neither we nor Link will ever ask
you to provide information in this way.
