2017 statutory and adjusted results
The statutory results are for the Group and includes closed titles and businesses, exceptional items, asset impairment and mark-to-market 
movements on the Group’s bond. The statutory results prior year comparative includes the i from acquisition date and excludes the 
disposed of Isle of Man business, which was a discontinued operation. The adjusted measures represent trading results before adjusting 
items which are defined on page 138. The Directors present this supplemental financial information to provide a consistent view on the 
underlying trading of the group.
The adjusted figures are not a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework, and therefore may  
not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. When reviewing and selecting these adjusting items, the Directors 
considered the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’). A reconciliation of the statutory to adjusted 
figures is provided on page 3, within the Financial Review and within the adjusted performance measures reconciliation on page 139. 3

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Good performance
considering the
very challenging conditions
During a sustained period of structural change in our business,  
we remain focused on delivering against our strategic objectives.  
Led by a strong performance of the i newspaper, adjusted EBITDA  
is in line with expectations. 
Trading
In 2017, we worked hard to combat the 
continued downward pressure on print 
publishing revenue, both in advertising and 
circulation. A key component of our plan 
saw a wholesale modernisation in  
the organisation and operation of our sales 
teams for local markets, as we seek to build 
a class-leading centralised tele-sales 
operation with deep local market 
knowledge. After an initial bedding in 
period, these changes are starting to 
show results.
Statutory revenue reduced from  
£222.7 million in 2016 to £201.6 million in 
2017, of which £9.9 million of the reduction 
related to the sale of 13 titles in the East 
Midlands. The Group reported a loss  
of £78.6 million in 2017, compared to 
£247.3 million in 2016. The loss resulted 
from non-cash asset impairment charges 
of £64.4 million, mark-to-market on the 
bond, as a result of increases in value, and 
exceptional costs. Adjusted operating profit 
was £33.1 million, down from £36.9 million 
in 2016, reflecting the challenging trading 
environment in which the Group operates.
Strategy
As I reported last year, 2017 started with the 
sale of 13 titles in the East Midlands and 
East Anglia to Iliffe Media Limited in 
January 2017. This helped to strengthen  
our balance sheet, reducing net debt  
and increasing liquidity and enabled the 
Group to cancel its revolving credit facility.
We have progressed our Strategic Review 
of our financing options in relation to the 
£220 million 8.625% senior secured notes 
(the ‘Bonds’) which become due on 1 June 
2019 (which we announced on 29 March 
last year). We have updated stakeholders at 
relevant times throughout the intervening 
period and on 2 November 2017 we 
announced the formation of  
an ad hoc committee of Bondholders  
(the ‘Bondholder Committee’) to consider 
in greater detail certain potential 
amendments to the Group's capital 
structure and to the funding arrangements 
for its final salary pension scheme. This 
review is ongoing and the Board is satisfied 
with the continued support of the Group's 
major stakeholders during the review 
process. Any proposal that results from 
these discussions will remain subject to 
negotiation and the consent of relevant 
stakeholders, and there can be no certainty 
that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. 
In the event that consensual amendments 
to the Group’s capital structure cannot be 
agreed with relevant stakeholders, 
alternative options for the restructuring  
or refinancing of the Bonds prior to June 
2019 will be explored as part of the 
ongoing Strategic Review process.
Throughout this period our management 
team remain focused on our key strategic 
aims: growing the Group’s overall audience 
(particularly in the biggest towns and cities 
that we serve), continuing our successful 
growth of the i newspaper and inews.co.uk, 
and seeking to maintain profitability,  
whilst improving customer, reader,  
and staff satisfaction.
Industry issues
We believe strongly in both the protection 
of individuals and bodies through an 
effective press complaints mechanism and 
the rights of a free press which is not 
subject to the oversight of a government, 
or government approved, regulator. 
Together with the majority of our industry, 
we remain whole-heartedly committed  
to IPSO – the Independent Press Standards 
Organisation (along with the vast majority 
of our industry). The industry was forthright 
in its concern over the potential 
introduction of s.40 of the Crime and 
Courts Act 2013 which, if enabled, could 
have operated to make newspaper 
publishers who are not members of a 
statutorily approved body liable for the 
costs of dealing with complaints against 
them – even where those complaints were 
dismissed or shown to have no merit.  
We commended the Government when  
it confirmed that it would repeal this 
measure. It is therefore of great concern 
that, through an amendment to the Data 
Protection Bill, currently making its way 
through Parliament, that the House of 
Lords has sought to reintroduce the same 
penal measures. Our papers are seeking  
to draw the impact that this will have on 
papers of all sizes to the attention of our 
readers and asking them to engage with 
their elected representatives to address 
this issue.
On a more positive note, recruitment is 
underway for 31 local democracy reporters 
following an innovative deal between  
the News Media Association (NMA) and 
the BBC which will see 150 journalists 
employed across the industry to cover local 
democracy reporting. In February 2018, the 
Department for Culture, Media and Sport 
announced a review to preserve the  
future of high quality national and local 
newspapers in the United Kingdom. At  
a time when more people are recognising 
the value of trusted and verified news 
sources, we welcome the review and will 
support the NMA in its engagement with 
the panel of experts to be appointed to 
conduct the review. On 12 March 2018,  
it was announced that Ashley Highfield 
had been appointed to this advisory panel. 7

Dividend
Johnston Press plc, and Johnston 
Publishing Ltd, its largest subsidiary, do not 
have distributable reserves. This restricts 
the Company’s ability to pay ordinary 
dividends. No ordinary or preference 
dividend is proposed for the year.
Board
After serving for nine years, Ralph Marshall 
stepped down as a Non-Executive Director 
at the Annual General Meeting in May. 
Under the terms of the shareholder 
agreement with Usaha Tegas which owns 
10.63% of the Company’s ordinary share 
capital, Jamie Buchan was appointed  
as a Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 June 2017. Ralph’s service over many 
years has been of enormous value to the 
Board and I would reiterate both my 
thanks and those of my colleagues.  
We are very pleased to have welcomed 
Jamie to the Board.
I have continued in the role of Interim 
Chair since the start of 2017 and the 
Company will make an announcement  
at the appropriate time when the position 
changes. I would like to record my thanks 
to Mike Butterworth who has undertaken 
the role of Senior Independent Director  
on an interim basis as well as chairing  
the Audit Committee during this period.
In considering candidates to fill Board 
vacancies, the Nomination Committee  
has regard to the benefits of, and the need 
to encourage, diversity (including gender) 
within the Board’s membership and this is 
a specific consideration of the recruitment 
process and is included in the Committee’s 
Terms of Reference. The Board has 
adopted a written diversity policy for 
this purpose.
The Board regularly reviews both the 
balance of its membership and the issues 
it considers when it meets. The agenda  
for the Board’s meetings continue to be 
structured in such a way as to scrutinise 
both strategic and operational matters and 
the meetings are held in an atmosphere  
of constructive challenge and debate. I am 
satisfied that the Board remains effective.
Employees
In recent years it has become the norm  
to report on the profound changes 
experienced by the Group and, as will 
become clear, 2017 was no different. I have 
once again been struck by the hard work 
and dedication of all employees, which  
has been key in our ability to adapt to  
the changing environment in which we 
operate. On behalf of the Board I would 
like to put on record our grateful thanks  
for the professionalism and application  
of all our colleagues across the Group, 
which is invaluable to the business.
On 28 March 2018, the Group reported  
on its Gender pay gap. In common with 
many organisations we have more men 
than women in senior positions and this 
factor has contributed significantly.
We will address the pay gap over the next 
3-5 years and have already committed  
to a series of actions in this respect. More 
details of our action plan, together with  
the gap data, can be found on our website: 
www.johnstonpress.co.uk
Outlook
Current trading remains very challenging 
and is expected to remain so for the 
remainder of this year. The management 
team are focused on delivering against  
the stated strategic objectives. We continue 
to invest in digital growth, while also 
continuing to look for ways to take cost  
out of the business, in mitigation of print 
revenue declines.

Interim Chairman 8
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The rise of awareness of fake news,  
and lack of transparency in the digital 
advertising supply chain has seen many 
larger advertisers reassessing where they 
invest their advertising spend after years  
of what has arguably been a race to the 
bottom in the blind programmatic digital 
advertising market place. Instead, they  
are now looking for trusted media 
organisations which can provide verified 
content in a safe environment. This 
rebalancing of spend by national 
advertisers will take time. At the local level, 
conditions remain difficult. Following the 
move of classified advertising to the big 
online portals (Autotrader, Indeed, ebay  
et al – the effects of which we still feel,  
with classified revenue down 29% year  
on year), display advertising has been 
shifting online predominantly to Facebook 
(resulting in, print display revenues  
being down 17% year on year). 
The focus in 2017 remained on our 
longer-term objective of returning the 
business back to top-line growth and profit 
growth, through delivery of the stated 
strategic objectives. The aim is to build  
a platform for sustainable growth and 
invest in the acceleration of digital growth 
in 2018. The corporate objectives for  
2017 were: 
1.  Continuing the success of the  
i newspaper,
2.  Digital audience and revenue growth,
3.  Sales model transformation,
4.  Publishing Model evolution (focusing on 
our biggest Cities and towns, and finding 
operational efficiencies for our smallest 
weeklies), and
5.  Growing our contract printing business,
All have shown good momentum,  
as we continue to reset the business:
1. The i newspaper delivered EBITDA  
of £9.3m for 2017,
2. Adjusted digital revenue (ex classifieds) 
was up 13%, audiences increased  
by 13% (and traffic was up by 19%), 
despite headwinds from Facebook 
algorithm changes, 
3. Adjusted total revenue excluding 
classified was up 1.8% for the year,
4. Adjusted newspaper sales revenue  
grew by 2.7%, and we grew audiences  
by 2.5%, and
5. Statutory print contract revenue 
increased by 4.2% to £13.3m.
At the same time we have been 
progressing the Strategic Review process. 
Refer to the Strategic Review of financing 
options section on page 11 for more details.
In 2017 we continued to maintain a 
complete focus on operational efficiency, 
through a combination of on-going active 
portfolio management, completion of the 
salesforce transformation, and tight control 
of the cost base. Total costs (excluding 
exceptionals) reduced by £12.1m in 2017,  
an 8% reduction on prior year excluding  
the impact of full year costs of the i.
Revenue trends from the regional business 
remain challenging, especially within 
classified advertising, which is still feeling 
the impact of the continued structural 
change within the classified marketplace, 
led by companies such as Autotrader, 
Rightmove and Indeed (Jobs). However, our 
entire classified business represented just 
16% of total Group revenue and is set  
to become a considerably smaller part of 
the business in 2018.
The regional advertising business has seen 
the growing impact of small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) using Facebook as 
a route to market to advertise local services. 
The threat posed to advertising print 
revenue by Facebook has to some extent 
been mitigated by the increasing exposure 
of our newsbrands within Facebook 
newsfeeds, alongside our own website 
growth in key markets which can now 
boast audience reach frequently in excess 
of 50% to potential advertisers. This focus 
has helped the Group deliver total 
audience growth to an average of 25.4m 
unique browsers per month, a 13% growth 
on last year. Average page views are up 19% 
on prior year, underpinning a 13% year-on-
year growth in digital advertising solutions 
(excluding the challenged digital classified 
categories, up 3%).
Following a full-year of i ownership and  
a 2% improvement in decline rates across 
the regional business, we saw total adjusted 
revenue decline by 4.5%, from £210.8m to 
£201.2m. Total adjusted revenue including 
the additional 14 weeks of i trading and 
excluding classified was up 1.8%.
Adjusted newspaper sales revenue  
grew by 2.7%, from £76.9m to £79.0m, 
benefiting from the full-year ownership of 
i newspaper. For the like-for-like 38 weeks 
for which i was owned in both periods, 
total newspaper sales revenue was down 
4.9%. Contract print revenue grew by 4.2%, 
from £12.8m to £13.3m.
Despite the positive momentum we have 
created in 2017, we have taken a realistic 
view of the carrying value of our titles, and 
have taken a non-cash impairment charge 
of £59.2m. The quoted market value of  
our bond has increased by £22.8m in 2017, 
resulting in a mark-to-market charge 
against profits. Taken together, and 
including other exceptional costs this  
has resulted in a statutory loss of £78.6m, 
compared to a loss of £247.3m in 2016,  
on statutory revenues of £201.6m in 2017, 
down from £222.7m in 2016. £9.9m of this 
revenue decline related to the sale of East 
Midlands titles in January 2017.
Net debt, excluding the bond mark-to-
market adjustment, was £195.9m at the 
end of 2017, a reduction of £8.6m on  
prior year. A reconciliation of statutory  
net debt to net debt excluding the 
mark-to-market adjustment is provided  
in the Financial Review.
Delivering against
strategic objectives
In what remains a very challenging trading environment, 
the vision of the Company remains to be at the  
heart of communities, providing accurate, relevant  
and timely news and information – free of external 
proprietorial influence. 9
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Highlights in 2017
1. Making a success of i
Strategic Rationale: On acquisition of the 
i newspaper in April 2016, we laid out the 
strategic rationale for acquiring the title, 
which the company determined to be 
transformational for the Group. The 
acquisition significantly helped to diversify 
the Group away from a regionally based  
and local display advertising led business, 
operating in markets experiencing significant 
negative structural and consumer 
behavioural change.
Revenue derived from the i newspaper  
is marked by a greater emphasis on more 
stable circulation income, operating in the 
more predictable daily qualities market,  
at a price point we determined to have 
reasonable elasticity when compared to 
other titles within this market segment.  
It was additionally determined that the scale 
of the Group would be beneficial to the title, 
affording the title greater leverage on key 
contracts, resulting in cost savings and 
investment capacity to improve overall 
editorial quality, both in print and online.
In 2017, under the leadership of editor Oly 
Duff, the i newspaper was short-listed for  
a number of awards from bodies such as  
The British Press Awards, the Foreign Press 
Association and the News Awards, reflecting 
in part the investment in journalism made 
since acquisition.
Profit Growth: Prior to the acquisition in April 
2016, the i contributed operating profits of 
£5.2m to its former owner, Independent Print 
Limited for the year ended 27 September 
2015 (source: Circular to shareholders dated 
2 March 2016). Through a combination of 
revenue improvement actions resulting in 
both circulation and advertising (print and 
digital) revenue increases year on year, and 
targeted cost management, the i was able  
to report an EBITDA run-rate averaging £1m 
per month in the last quarter of 2017 and 
EBITDA for the 52 weeks of £9.3m (no central 
corporate cost allocated), and operating 
profit of £8.7m.
Circulation Revenue Growth: In September 
2017, the cover price of the i increased  
from 50p to 60p on Monday to Friday  
and from 60p to 80p on Saturday. The 
price increase was supported by both  
a marketing campaign and the relaunch  
of the Saturday edition (iWeekend), with 
the Saturday edition attracting 12,000  
new readers when compared to its average 
circulation pre relaunch. Daily circulation 
overall remained at 265,000 (Jan – Dec 17), 
as verified by the Audit Bureau of 
Circulation Data. Market share has risen  
to an average of some 20% for the Monday 
to Friday editions. Circulation revenue 
increased by 21.5% on the prior year,  
on a comparable 38 week period.
Advertising Revenue Growth:  
Under Johnston Press ownership, the 
i newspaper’s market share of main news 
advertisers has seen growth of 2%; from 
20% in the pre-acquisition period of 
January to November 2015 to 22% in 
January to November 2017 (source: ad 
dynamix). i print and digital advertising 
revenue grew 27% in the second half of 
2017, compared to the first half, providing  
a strong advertising revenue platform 
going into 2018. This reflects our efforts  
to establish the i newspaper brand as a 
politically unbiased, independent, quality, 
trusted brand that delivers a largely unique 
audience that all advertisers and their 
agencies should have on their media 
buying schedule.
It has been particularly pleasing that  
the i shared a number of our centrally 
coordinated investigation features,  
taking a national perspective, alongside  
a more localised angle taken by our  
larger regional and city brands.
The growth of inews.co.uk, launched  
in April 2016 following the acquisition, 
continued through 2017. During 2017,  
the website attracted an average of 1.4m 
unique browsers per month, up 45% year 
on year. In 2018 an additional investment 
in digital journalists will be made to further 
accelerate growth of the inews’s digital 
presence, mirroring the additional new 
investment being made to the digital 
offering for Johnston Press’ largest regional 
and city brands. The continued growth  
of inews.co.uk through 2017 has propelled 
the web-site into being one of the Group’s 
leading sites in terms of scale, all within  
18 months of launch.
2. Digital audience and  
revenue growth
In-line with the announced publishing 
strategy that focuses on markets with  
the greatest growth potential, the digital 
strategy for the Group has also been 
aligned around the same core principles 
and brands, helping to concentrate 
resources in markets with the greatest 
digital audience potential. In 2017, unique 
browsers grew to an average of 25.4m  
per month, a 13% increase on prior year. 
Overall page view growth across the 
Johnston Press network has been driven by 
a number of the biggest brands; the Belfast 
News Letter’s monthly page views were up 
48% year-on-year, Yorkshire Evening Post 
(Leeds) up 45%, Sheffield Star up 29% and 
the Edinburgh Evening News up 40%. 
Digital classified revenue, especially in the 
Jobs category, remain a drag on overall 
digital revenue progression, impacting 
publishers across both regional and national 
markets. The total regional print classified 
advertising market (principally jobs, property 
and autos) has declined from £1.9bn  
in 2007 to £320m in 2017, with the 
corresponding increase in Digital classified 
growing from £624m to £1.3bn over the 
same period. In addition, only a relatively 
small percentage of the growing digital 
income has flowed to publishers such as 
Johnston Press, with the majority shifting  
to on-line platforms such as Autotrader, 
Indeed, Linkedin and Rightmove. 10
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Adjusted digital revenue, excluding 
classified grew by 13% in 2017 (total 
adjusted digital revenue grew 3%). We 
delivered 16% growth in our national digital 
advertising, including the 1XL network 
formed and in partnership with Newsquest 
and Mediaforce, and through partnerships 
with companies like Taboola and Facebook.
Growth in some new digital revenue areas 
did not build as fast as we expected. Both 
Video and Facebook advertising required  
us to improve recruitment and training,  
in order to fully exploit the opportunity. We 
have also not completed the development 
and rollout of our full range advertising 
product, which will be an important part  
of maintaining profit margins (third party 
products typically offering significantly  
lower margins).
3. Sales model transformation
Total advertising revenue, on a like-for-like 
basis and excluding classified (like-for-like 
advertising revenue, excluding classified  
has been calculated by comparing the  
38 week period in the current year from 
9 April 2017 to 30 December 2017, to the 
equivalent 38 weeks of the prior year from 
10 April 2016 to 31 December 2016, allowing 
comparability year on year as a result of the 
acquisition of the i on the 10 April 2016) was 
down 4.0% for the year (including classified, 
down 13.5%). Classified advertising 
represented some 15% of total revenue  
in 2017 and are expected to represent 
around 12% of total revenue in 2018. 
Our sales operation has been through  
a significant transformation in 2017 to 
ensure there is the right mix of local  
and central resource and to maintain  
a significant presence of highly qualified 
and well trained experts in the field to 
serve customers face to face, offering  
print advertising solutions and increasingly 
digital advertising services. In 2017  
we invested in our Media Sales Centre 
(tele-sales facilities), moving over 300 sales 
staff into a new city centre location in 
Sheffield, alongside the modern offices 
premises in Leeds and Edinburgh.  
The shift to a centralised call centre 
environment follows the route taken  
by other market leading companies  
within the wider advertising arena such  
as Autotrader and Facebook. Our USP is 
that we have retained highly local market 
knowledge and we lead on our local 
brands. A centralised sales environment, 
supported by leading edge technology 
from Saleforce and Miles33, allows for 
better training and control, ensuring  
all telephone based sales staff are kept 
abreast of the latest market and product 
information in a rapidly evolving SME 
focused, digitally led media landscape. 
Alongside the salesforce transformation, 
we have additionally enhanced sales  
routes to market with improved self-serve 
solutions for SME customers who want to 
interact and manage their needs online.
The large scale transfer of advertising 
customer accounts and rebalancing of 
sales resource (from field to tele-sales) 
impacted sales revenue during the 
transition period. However, we estimate 
that the revenue loss was outweighed  
by the scale of cost savings realised.
4. Publishing model evolution
Through 2017, the business aligned around 
distinct publishing groups, helping to align 
operating plans in editorial, sales, digital 
and the functional support areas. The 
publishing strategy is a natural evolution 
from the disparate and locally managed 
publishing operations, to a centrally 
operated and vertically aligned business. 
However, local editorial decision making 
remains in place, ensuring local character 
and insight is maintained.
The editorial strategy can be summarised 
as; ‘think nationally and act locally’,  
as evidenced by the centrally created 
content produced by advanced content 
hubs, central lifestyle team and central 
investigation team, all aligned to the 
publishing strategy. All the content created 
from the central teams is flowed through 
all the national, regional, city and larger 
weeklies titles, helping to drive audience 
engagement in both print and digital.  
The investment in central teams has driven 
greater efficiency in content production 
and is carefully balanced with an 
imperative of keeping local news reporters 
local and relevant. Johnston Press employs 
849 journalists, with the vast majority 
aligned to individual news brands, focused 
on local news gathering. During the  
latter part of 2017, and into 2018 we have 
commenced hiring more journalists as  
a result of three significant initiatives: the 
BBC Local Democracy Reporters initiative, 
our Digital ‘Powerhouses’ project (that sees 
31 new staff being hired in London, Leeds, 
and Edinburgh), and a ramping up of  
our apprentice programme.
5. Growing our contract  
printing business
The contract printing business once again 
delivered annual revenue growth year  
on year, posting a growth of 4% in 2017, 
increasing revenue to £13.3m, which 
represents 7% of total Group revenue.  
An encouraging performance, particularly 
in light of the contraction in the overall 
market, and achieved through a 
combination of maintaining existing 
contracts and winning new contracts  
to print (amongst others) the Daily Mail 
and the Metro, both at our modern 
Portsmouth plant.
Current trading and outlook
The Group has traded in line with the 
board’s expectations in the first quarter  
of 2018, with Q1 adjusted EBITDA higher 
than prior year. The i is continuing to deliver 
the exceptional growth seen in FY 2017, 
with revenue up 21% year on year in the 
first quarter. 
The first quarter of 2018 has seen us  
deliver increased adjusted EBITDA year  
on year, driven by the i’s continued strong 
performance (especially the relaunched 
Saturday edition, up 4% year on year  
in newspaper sales) and our strategy of 
focusing on our largest Cities and titles. We 
are pleased with the acceleration in growth 
from the i’s website inews.co.uk which, 
having delivered sustained growth in 2017, 
has ramped up further in the first quarter 
of this year (with unique users up 89% year 
on year).
Across our regional portfolio of titles 
national print advertising tracked in line 
with prior year in the first quarter of 2018, 
with advertisers starting to increase spend 
in regional print. This trend is driven by  
a somewhat stronger overall advertising 
market, our ability to precisely target 
audiences using ‘big data’, and improving 
sentiment towards quality print publishers 
in the wake of the Fake News and social 
media trust concerns. 
Classified advertising remains weak, but  
is now a significantly smaller portion of the 
group accounting for just 13% of revenues 
in the quarter, following our investment  
in digital and the i.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT AND OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED 11
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
‘The first quarter of 2018 has seen us deliver 
increased adjusted EBITDA year on year, driven  
by the i’s continued strong performance.’
The trading environment remains 
challenging, notwithstanding early signs  
of some improvement in the national print 
advertising market. Comparatives do get 
harder, and we expect to see continued 
pressure on revenues, and the requirement 
for cost savings. Against this difficult 
backdrop we are focused on maintaining 
our strong margins, driving additional 
growth from i and realising further 
operational and financial synergies.  
During 2018 we will continue to selectively 
invest in the business, with a focus on 
digital, journalists, and content generation.
Whilst operationally the business is 
performing well in challenging markets, 
addressing the Group’s capital structure 
remains a key priority. The Strategic Review 
of financing options is ongoing and 
discussions with our various stakeholders 
are progressing. We will update on this 
matter as we progress through 2018. 
Net debt and liquidity
In January 2017, we reported the sale  
of 13 titles to Iliffe Media for consideration  
of £17m, with the disposal informed by  
the wider publishing strategy of focusing 
on big cities and digital growth towns.  
The improved liquidity derived from the 
disposal has assisted us in reducing net 
debt, though equally critically, afforded us 
investment capacity in our largest brands 
to further increase overall reach in targeted 
markets. Net debt at 30 December 2017 
was £195.9m, a reduction of £8.6m on prior 
year (2016: £204.5m).
Strategic review of  
financing options
Operationally the Group is performing  
well in difficult market conditions. As  
an industry, we have seen the classified 
advertising market suffer enormous 
structural change over the last decade,  
and more recently the display advertising 
market has come under pressure from 
new competitors, particularly Facebook 
and Google. Despite the resulting revenue 
decline, we have maintained an adjusted 
operating margin of just under 17%,  
whilst delivering strong growth from  
the i newspaper. 
We currently face the challenge of 
addressing issues with the Group’s  
capital structure. The major acquisition 
programme in 2005 and 2006 saw peak 
debt levels hit £751 million at the end of 
2006. While net debt at 30 December  
2017 (excluding mark-to-market) stands at 
£195.9 million, this level of debt is now too 
high given the current size of the business 
and represents a constraint on its ability  
to return to growth. 
Last year, the Group announced it had 
commenced a strategic review to assess 
the financing options available to the 
Group in relation to its Bonds which 
become due for repayment on 1 June  
2019. As a key part of this strategic review 
process, the Board has engaged with its 
major stakeholders, including shareholders, 
holders of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and 
The Pensions Regulator. 
The Board subsequently announced that  
it was approaching its largest bondholders 
regarding the formation of an ad hoc 
committee of bondholders which was 
then formed in November 2017. 
Discussions with advisers to the ad hoc 
committee and our other stakeholders  
are in progress. Any proposal that results 
from these discussions will remain subject 
to negotiation and consent of relevant 
stakeholders, and there can be no certainty 
that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. 
In the event that consensual amendments 
to the Group’s capital structure cannot  
be agreed with relevant stakeholders, 
alternative options for the restructuring or 
refinancing of the Bonds prior to June 2019 
will be explored as part of the ongoing 
strategic review process. Resolution of this 
matter remains a key priority for the Board 
as it is currently creating significant 
uncertainty for the business and its 
stakeholders, and detracting from the 
good operational performance of the 
business in 2017 and the strong recent 
progress we have made against our 
strategic objectives. 
Refer to the Viability Statement section  
for further details.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
The Group remains a news publisher, with 
the significant majority of revenue derived 
directly from the selling of newspapers  
or advertising across print and digital 
platforms, with the balance of revenue 
stemming from services based income 
such as contract printing.
The sector as a whole remains under 
pressure from continued and prolonged 
structural change, as consumer habits 
continue to evolve into digital formats, 
alongside those of regional SME advertisers 
looking to promote their services to 
consumers. The twin pressures of changing 
consumer behaviour and competition, 
from companies such as Facebook, for a 
share of regional marketing spend, led the 
Group to pursue a number of strategies to 
decelerate trading declines in the regional 
newspaper sector and shift revenues  
to more stable income streams within  
the national newspaper sector, to more 
stable services based income from contract 
printing and growth of income from the 
premium newsbrands within the Group 
that have the greatest growth potential, 
specifically focusing on accelerating digital 
traffic and revenue growth.
The Group now comprises four key  
revenue areas: Print advertising (37% of the 
Group’s total revenue)
1
, Digital advertising 
(13%)
1
, Newspaper Sales (39%)
1
 and 
Contract Printing (7%)
1
.
Regional newsbrands, excluding  
i newspaper and contract printing, 
represented c.78% of total Group revenue
1
 
(down from 85%
1
 in 2016), operating in  
a total regional print advertising market 
estimated to have declined by -14%
2
 in 
2017, off-set by a 3.6%
2
 increase in the 
market forecast of digital advertising.  
The market forecast for 2018 shows an 
improved decline rate of -9%
2
 from print 
advertising, though marginally softer 
trading from digital at 3%
2
 growth.
National newsbrands, represented within 
the Group by i newspaper, delivered a 
more robust performance, with total print 
declining by 7%
2
 in 2017, coupled with  
a strong digital performance of 16.2% 
market forecast growth. Looking forward 
into 2018, the market for print advertising  
is forecast to decline by 6.2%
2
, with digital 
growth slowing to a 7.5%
2
 growth. Actual 
performance from the i national print 
advertising beat market forecasts in 2017. 
Total digital advertising in the UK grew by 
12.3%
5
 in 2017, dominated by Google and 
Facebook sharing over 60% of the total 
market. Within the display component  
of the market, Google and Facebook 
market share grew to over 65% of total 
display spend across all devices, with the 
significant majority of growth within 2017 
captured by the same two companies. 
Display advertising spend is now 
dominated by mobile display formats at 
56% of total display income, up from parity 
between desktop and mobile in 2016.
In general terms, the national newspaper 
market segment across print advertising, 
digital display advertising and circulation 
revenues within the quality national daily 
market has been more robust than the 
regional segment in which the Group  
also operates and has helped improve  
the overall revenue decline profile of the 
Group
3
 and in line with Group’s strategy  
of moving towards more stable and 
diversified revenues
4
.
Historically circulation revenue 
performance remained relatively  
stable, with volume declines partially 
compensated by the cover price rises 
across both regional and national titles.  
In overall terms circulation volumes will 
remain challenged in 2018, with price 
elasticity amongst regional publishers 
becoming more limited, especially  
on regional daily titles, and moving  
to the point where price rises may not 
compensate overall volume declines as 
consumers continue to access content free 
across digital formats. The rise of digital 
subscriptions within the national quality 
market, where content has a digital 
premium, has not yet delivered material 
income streams where publishers have 
launched services.
The market for contract printing remains 
challenging as volume continues to come 
out of the market as circulation volumes 
across the sector continue to decline, which 
will be further accelerated by a further hike 
in newsprint price rises from January 2018. 
Johnston Press, is one of three major 
printers in the United Kingdom, (alongside 
Trinity Mirror and News UK). In 2017 capacity 
in the market has shrunk, and some smaller 
printers have ceased production, while we 
have been able to flex our capacity to take 
on new business.

Letter fr om the

So me da ys in the newsr oom
can be more challenging than
others. Sometimes you ’re
strug gl ing to ﬁnd ag reat headl ine.
Sometimes you ’re trying to strike
ab alance between inf orming and
entertai ning your readers.
Sometimes you tear up the
paper aga in and aga in as the news
agenda sh ifts. It can make you
feel ab it cynical at times, as you
react to break ing news with your
deadl ine on your mind.
Some da ys you ha ve a

averaged over 1.4m  
unique users per month,  
up 45% year on year 
£9.3m
Exceptional performance 
from the i newspaper – 
delivered EBITDA of £9.3m
A fully 
integrated brand
Acquired by Johnston Press in 2016, i has quickly 
established itself as a trusted media brand, a disruptive 
innovator in the print market – and now in digital too.
In 2017, by introducing new products  
(print as well as digital) and successfully 
leveraging a collection of cross-platform 
assets, i delivered a compelling package  
to the market which led to impressive 
revenue growth.
The new iWeekend print product, an 
88-page package launched in September 
2017, grew Saturday circulation +7%  
(to 274,000, ABC, Dec 2017) despite a  
33% cover price increase. In its first four  
months of existence, iWeekend was also 
responsible for overall circulation growth  
in the Saturday national quality market  
of 1%, reversing market decline (ABC, 
Sep-Dec 17). iWeekend shows that by 
innovating in print as well as digital,  
it is possible to attract new and lapsed 
readers to the quality print market.
i’s editorial content was especially 
compelling in 2017. i published a world 
exclusive in July, revealing the dawn of GM 
babies. The story was followed up by more 
than 1,000 news publishers around the 
globe. i’s Investigations Team delivered  
a week-long series of scoops revealing 
secret cuts to the NHS – and overturned 
closures of hospitals, A&E and maternity 
units. i campaigned successfully on 
dangerous driving (changing the law), 
plastics and press freedom.
 ‘The new iWeekend product, an 88-page

1 Adjusted revenue numbers include i for 52 weeks in 2017 and 38 weeks in 2016. Adjusted measures represent trading results before adjusting items which  
are defined in Note 3. The directors believe that presentation of the Group results in this way is relevant to an understanding of our financial performance and  
this presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the board. A reconciliation of adjusted  
to statutory measures is shown on page 139.
Relevant KPI Reason for choice Performance
Total statutory revenue This new metric is an output measure of  
our three key revenues lines, namely print 
advertising, digital and newspaper sales revenues. 
It includes revenue from assets disposed of.
Total statutory revenue was down 9.5%  
for the year, reflecting the continued 
downward pressure on print advertising  
and newspaper circulation, and £9.9m  
of revenues lost from the disposal of  
East Anglia and East Midlands Titles. 
Total adjusted revenue This metric is an output measure of our three key 
revenues lines, namely print advertising, digital 
and newspaper sales revenues. It represents 
revenue from the continuing business.
Total adjusted revenue was down 4.5%  
for the year, reflecting the continued 
downward pressure on print advertising and 
newspaper circulation. 
Like for like revenue  
(‘LFL revenue’)
This new metric is an output measure of  
our three key revenues lines, namely print 
advertising, digital and newspaper sales 
revenues on a 38 week basis in 2017 and  
2016. This measure removes the effect  
of part year ownership of the i in 2016.
LFL revenue has declined by 8.5% year on 
year over the 38 week period in each year. 
Adjusted circulation 
revenue
This measure reflects the net effect of our 
pricing, sales volumes and customer offer  
for printed newspapers.
The full year impact of the acquisition  
of the i, cover price increases, continuing 
rationalisation and content improvement 
initiatives across the portfolio has 
contributed to a +2.7% increase. 19
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Relevant KPI Reason for choice Performance
Like for like circulation 
revenue (‘LFL  
circulation revenue’)
This new measure reflects the net effect of 
our pricing, sales volumes and customer offer 
for printed newspapers on a 38 week basis in 
2017 and 2016. This measure removes the 
effect of part year ownership of the i in 2016.
LFL circulation revenue has declined by  
4.9% year on year over the 38 week period  
in each year.
Adjusted print advertising 
revenue
Stemming the decline in print advertising, 
which represents 37% of revenues, remains  
a key focus for the business.
Adjusted print advertising revenue 
experienced a 16.5% decline year on year.
Adjusted digital revenue Growing the digital revenues stream is a key 
focus for the business as it invests in new 
digital products and creates growth in 
revenue to replace declining print revenues.
Adjusted digital revenue performance  
saw an improvement of 2.8% year-on-year. 
Statutory Digital revenues declined by  
3.6% in 2017.
Savings in  
regional business
This measure brings together the combined 
effects of cost saving initiatives, and 
identification and implementation of best 
practice across the Group. 
Savings improvement in regional business  
of 53.5% in 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is a key internal 
performance measure and is also a proxy 
measure of cash generation. 
Adjusted EBITDA of £40.1 million was 
achieved in 2017, with £9.3m EBITDA 
contribution from the i newspaper  
acquired in 2016.
Management’s continued focus on costs has 
enabled it to maintain an adjusted EBITDA 
margin of some 19.9% (2016: 20.8%).
Statutory operating loss This new measure reflects the impact 
surrounding impairment of assets, the effect 
of mark-to-market on the Bond, and the new 
cost of exceptional items.
Statutory operating loss was £(51.2)m in  
2017 and £(323.5)m in 2016 largely driven  
by impairments on publishing titles and  
a challenging trading environment.
Adjusted operating profit Measuring operating profit ensures our 
continuing focus on returning to top line growth 
and ensuring strong cost disciplines as the 
business is managed to the right size during its 
transformation from a print to a digital business. 
The year-on-year decline is due to the 
decline in revenue being only partly 
mitigated by operating cost savings.
Print and Digital 
audience (unique users)
Growing digital audience remains a key 
strategic priority as it measures our ability to 
deliver high quality content that resonates 
with our audiences.
Overall audience growth was driven by our 
digital platforms, with average digital audience 
growing from 22.5 million to 25.4 million 
unique users.
Page views also increased year-on-year with 
92.1 million page views in December 2017 
compared to 88.7 million in the prior year.
Excluding the i, print circulation declined  
by 13.8% year-on-year.
Employee health and 
safety accidents
This KPI measures the number of employees 
involved in accidents within our printing and 
publishing operation. This statistic measures the 
effectiveness of our health and safety procedure 
and is a key part of our control environment.
There were no accidents requiring 
notification under the Reporting of Injuries, 
Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences 
Regulations (RIDDOR) in 2017. 20

Mitigating 
activities
Risk rating 
(residual)
1. REFINANCING  
JUNE 2019
Failure to repay, refinance,  
satisfy or otherwise retire the 
bonds at their maturity would  
give rise to a default under the 
indenture and could have a 
material impact on the Group’s 
operations and its ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The Group’s debt comprises a 
£220m high yield bond maturing 
on 1 June 2019. It is not subject  
to any maintenance covenants.
High Increased The Group is exploring options for 
the restructuring or refinancing of 
the Bonds prior to their maturity  
in June 2019 (refer to the Viability 
Statement on page 46).
High
2. PRINT-BASED 
REVENUES
Print advertising and  
circulation revenues continue  
to decline at current levels,  
or accelerate further.
There are continued threats to 
print-based revenues, including from 
competition threats in many markets 
and from changing technology and 
consumer habits, business change, 
reducing customer numbers, 
circulations and paginations. 
Increased uncertainty for businesses 
continues following the referendum 
result in 2016 to leave the  
European Union.
High Increased The Group continues to develop its 
digital advertising offering through 
partnerships, mobile apps and new, 
digital-based products and new 
websites. It has invested in and 
reorganised its sales function to 
ensure a more proactive and 
effective approach and that the 
sales offering is fully understood  
by sales staff and appropriate for 
customer needs.
High
3. NEW REVENUE 
STREAMS
Digital revenues decline, or  
do not grow at the rate needed 
to offset print decline over the 
short to medium term.
The impact of dominant market 
players (particularly Facebook and 
Google) have contributed to a 
slowdown in the growth of digital 
advertising. Increased mobile usage 
has eroded margins. There is a  
need to respond quickly to evolving 
consumer demands.
High Increased Search engine marketing (SEM) 
solutions which include a Facebook 
element are being developed. Mobile 
first sales teams are in place and all 
local digital sales seek to include a 
mobile element. The Group is also 
building out its sponsored content 
offering. The Group has made 
considerable investment in its 
customer database and improving 
customer relationship management.
High
4. PENSION 
SCHEME
The Company is engaged in 
negotiations with the trustees of its 
final salary pension scheme as part 
of the scheme’s triennial review. The 
company agreed with Trustees to 
put its triennial negotiations on hold, 
while it carried out its strategic 
review. An affordable revised 
schedule of contributions dealing 
effectively with the scheme’s deficit 
requires agreement.
High Increased Expert advice is being taken. 
Constructive engagement with 
trustees is ongoing to explain  
the Company’s position. Ongoing 
dialogue with The Pensions 
Regulator to ensure they are  
fully informed. A revised pension 
contributions plan is expected  
to be required as part of the 
Strategic Review.
High
5. LIQUIDITY
The Group is not able to 
generate sufficient cash 
from trading.
The Group has interest costs of 
£19.0m and pension contributions  
of £10.6m. Further downward 
pressure on revenues could reduce 
operating cashflow below the  
level required to service interest  
and pension commitments.
The Group obtains credit from 
suppliers. A reduction in credit terms 
offered by suppliers could negatively 
impact the Group’s liquidity.
High Unchanged The sale of East Anglia and  
East Midlands titles for £15.6m  
net of disposal costs, provided 
additional liquidity to the Group  
in 2017. Including proceeds  
from this disposal, cash at  
bank was £25.0 million as  
at 30 December 2017.

6. COST 
REDUCTION
The Group is required to  
invest in cost reduction and  
is constrained in its ability  
to invest in development.
The need to invest in cost reduction 
limits the Group’s ability to invest  
in the business and requires  
that the Company streamline  
its management and  
reporting structure.
High Increased This is an area of ongoing 
management attention. The Group 
has continued to find operational 
efficiencies as total revenue has 
declined. Clear organisational and 
reporting responsibilities are in place.
Medium
7. DATA 
SECURITY
The Company’s systems and data 
integrity could be vulnerable to 
disruption and/or loss of, or loss of 
access to, data. Poor quality data  
or data which the Company cannot 
lawfully process could limit the 
realisation of marketing and  
business opportunities
The Group is required to comply with 
the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) requirements by 
May 2018.
High Increased The Group has inbuilt ‘strength  
in depth’ for data systems and 
collaborates with third party suppliers 
to protect systems and data.  
Data quality and compliance with 
regulatory change is the subject  
of ongoing management focus, 
monitoring and reporting with 
training for staff concerned.
Medium
8. ECONOMY
The impact of changes in the 
economy and United Kingdom 
economic performance, including 
from Brexit, may have an impact 
on the Group’s operations
The Company is subject to prevailing 
economic conditions and the impact 
of emergent and unexpected events. 
Changes in paper mill capacity and 
demand from overseas has impacted 
short term paper purchase prices.  
It is also subject to conditions in 
particular sectors, e.g. property  
and employment.
Medium Increased The Company seeks to forecast 
forthcoming economic conditions 
through its budgeting process and 
monitoring of prevailing conditions.
Medium
9. INVESTMENT 
IN GROWTH
The Company’s ability to invest  
in new digital product development 
and technology is limited.  
This hinders its ability to stay 
competitive and invest in the  
digital products necessary in  
a rapidly changing environment.
Medium Unchanged The Company seeks to limit the 
impact of these constraints through  
a focus on the areas of highest impact 
to support and promote growth  
of its local display, features and 
entertainments products.

For two centuries The Scotsman 
newspaper has been at the heart  
of Scotland, reporting on politics,

Highlighting its integral role in Scottish 
history, BBC2 aired The Paper Thistle:  
200 Years of The Scotsman, a documentary 
which went behind the scenes at the

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Introduction
This Financial Review provides commentary on the Group’s Statutory and Adjusted (Alternative Performance Measures or APM’s) results 
during the 52-week period ended 30 December 2017 (FY 2016: 52 weeks).
Statutory loss
A statutory loss before tax of £95.0 million (FY 2016: £300.7 million loss), is reported after an impairment charge in the period of £59.2 million 
on publishing titles (FY 2016: £336.9 million), a £1.3 million impairment on digital intangible assets, a £0.8 million impairment charge  
on press equipment in Ireland (FY 2016: £nil), a £3.1 million impairment on other property, plant and equipment, and a fair value loss  
(as market price rose in the period) recorded on the Group’s Bond of £22.8 million (FY 2016: £43.6 million gain), and other exceptional 
costs of £18.0 million (FY 2016: £18.8 million) (see page 139 in APM’s).
Basis of presentation of results
The statutory results are presented for the continuing Group and the prior period comparative excludes the Isle of Man business disposed 
of in August 2016. The East Anglia and East Midlands titles, disposed of in January 2017, are included in the statutory results but removed  
for comparability in the adjusted figures. Continuing statutory results include the i from acquisition date in April 2016, closed titles and 
businesses, exceptional items, impairment of asset carrying values and mark-to-market gains/(losses) on the Group’s Bond.
The Group has initiated a series of restructuring programs to remove cost from the business with the objective of designing a sustainable 
print publishing business model, while at the same time investing in building a digital income stream.
The resulting restructuring project has seen a substantial redesign of each area of the business, including management layers and 
structures, products and services, content creation and our sales routes to market. In streamlining the organisation, a significant 
investment in redundancy has seen more than 2,047 posts closed over the last 4 years. The Group has also sought to reflect its change  
in shape and scale in support areas including making substantial reductions in its property portfolio, technology licences and fleet.  
The speed of its action, both in anticipating and responding to recent changes in the sector has meant that some existing contracts  
no longer reflect the current needs of the business.
In 2017, the Group initiated new changes to its business model, including how it allocated resources to different brands, its mix of field 
and call centre based sales staff, while also adopting a clear policy of downsizing its property portfolio, taking advantage of natural lease 
breaks, typically moving to smaller short term serviced offices in local towns and cities, while maintaining larger hubs in Preston, Leeds, 
Edinburgh, Peterborough, Sheffield and Portsmouth.
To provide investors and other users of the Group’s financial statements with additional clarity and understanding of both the cost of this 
business change program, and the resulting impact on the Group’s underlying trading, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to 
additionally present the Alternative Performance Measures used by management in running the business and in determining 
management and executive remuneration.
Adjusted results include the i for 52 weeks in 2017 and 38 weeks in 2016. The effect of this is shown on page 26.
In preparing commentary on performance, the financial impact of a number of significant accounting and operational items has been 
adjusted to determine the adjusted results included in this Financial Review. The adjusted results provide supplementary analysis of  
the ‘underlying’ trading of the Group.
The Directors assess the performance of the Group using statutory accounting measures and a variety of alternative performance 
measures (‘APMs’). 
A reconciliation of statutory to adjusted figures is provided on page 30, and further disclosure is provided on page 139.
The Group continues to experience an extremely 
challenging trading environment but has benefitted  
from a strong performance of the i newspaper  
and has continued its focus on costs reduction. 24

3 The i newspaper is included in the statutory and adjusted results from the date of acquisition, in April 2016.
Revenue
Total statutory revenue was down £21.1 million (9.5%), of which £9.9 million related to the sale of East Midlands titles and down 16.6% 
excluding the i. Total adjusted revenue was down 4.5% for the year, and down 11.3% excluding the i. Revenue declines reflect the 
continued downward pressure on print advertising and newspaper circulation, partially offset by digital growth and the benefit  
of a full 52 weeks i trading. 
Newspaper sales revenue
The full year impact of the acquisition of the i, cover price increases, continuing rationalisation and content improvement initiatives across 
the portfolio, and has contributed to adjusted newspaper sales revenues of £79.0 million in the year (including the i for 52 weeks of 2017). 
This compares to newspaper sales revenue of £76.9 million in 2016 (including i for 38 weeks), giving year-on-year growth of 2.7%.
Adjusted newspaper sales revenue excluding the i was £55.6 million for 2017 (FY 2016: £62.1 million), a decline of 10.5%, reflecting the 
continued downward pressure on circulation volumes, which are no longer fully offset by price rises.
Contract printing
Contract printing revenue of £13.3 million was up 4.2% year on year with the benefits of winning new printing contracts (including the 
Daily Mail and Metro) outweighing circulation decline in some existing external print contracts.
Printing revenue grew year-on-year 10.4% to £11.2 million while revenue from paper supply fell by 19.8% to £2.1 million as a result of 
circulation volume reduction of customer titles. 
Advertising revenue
Total adjusted advertising revenue was down 12.2% year-on-year (down 15.2% excluding the i), reflecting the continuing shift of advertising 
spend away from print products, to digital and social media services.

The full year benefit of the i, has partially offset the decline in the rest of the Group, with total adjusted revenue down 12.2%, whereas the 
Group excluding the i was down 15.2%.
Adjusted digital advertising excluding classifieds was up 13.2%, while total adjusted digital advertising including classified was up 2.8%.
The first 14 weeks of 2017 benefited from the i, with no comparative revenue in 2016 and had the effect of offsetting decline in existing 
titles in H1 2017. Excluding the i, in H1 2017, total adjusted advertising revenues were down 15.7%.

i Performance
Following the acquisition of the i on 10 April 2016, the Group has seen improving revenue trends and increased profitability as a result of 
management actions to reduce cost and grow revenue (including the benefit of a 10 pence cover price rise on Monday to Friday, and a 
20 pence rise on Saturdays effective from September 2017).
The table below explains the benefit of 52 weeks trading in 2017, against 38 weeks in 2016 to enable a better understanding of run rates, 
and to aid understanding of this impact on Group results, a 38 week like for like period is presented. The 38 weeks reflects the

Asset impairment
The carrying value of assets is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are indications that they might  
be impaired. In light of the severe trading conditions impacting the sector, an impairment review was undertaken which resulted in  
a write-down of £64.4 million (FY 2016: £344.3 million). The impairment is largely a function of taking a more prudent view of the short 
and long-term growth rate, increasing the perpetuity decline rates from a range of -1% to -2% in 2016 to -4% in 2017. The write-down 
reduces the asset carrying value of publishing units to £84.4 million and the carrying value of print presses to £18.7 million at period-end. 
Refer to Note 13 and 14 in the financial statements.
(Loss)/Profit before tax
The Group’s adjusted profit before tax was £14.2 million (FY 2016: £17.4 million). The year-on-year decline of £3.2 million was due to the 
reduction in revenue being only partly mitigated by operating cost savings. The Group’s statutory loss before tax was £95.0 million  
(FY 2016: £300.7 million loss).
Tax
The Income Statement includes a tax credit of £16.4 million (FY 2016: £53.4 million tax credit) which comprises a current tax charge  
of £0.1 million (FY 2016: £0.7m tax charge) and a deferred tax credit of £16.3 million (FY 2016: £54.1 million tax credit). The Statement  
of Other Comprehensive Income includes a £2.0 million deferred tax credit (FY 2016: £6.3 million deferred tax loss) in relation to the 
current tax benefit of pension contributions in excess of net pension financing charges.
The deferred tax credit £16.3 million recognised in the income statement has largely arisen from £59.2 million of impairment charges on 
the Group’s publishing title intangible assets (£10.1 million deferred tax credit) and the disposal of East Anglia and East Midlands 
publishing titles in January 2017 resulting in a deferred tax credit of £3.2 million. £3.9 million of the current year deferred tax credit  
has arisen on the Group’s Bond, due to different accounting treatment applied on the Bond at the Group level in contrast with that 
applied at the subsidiary entity level due to statutory reporting requirements. This was offset by a deferred tax charge of £2.1 million 
recognised in the income statement as a result of certain deferred tax assets being deemed unrecoverable.  28
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
The Group’s effective tax rate was 17.3% for the 2017 financial year (2016: 17.8%). In the period, the effective tax rate was lower than the 
prevailing UK corporation tax rate of 19.25%, largely due to the disallowance of corporate interest restriction amounts, the difference 
between current and deferred tax rates and the impact of deferred tax not recognised overall reducing the effective tax rate by 6.3%. 
This has been partly offset by the deferred tax impact of the disposal of the East Anglia and East Midlands publishing titles disposed  
in January 2017 increasing the effective tax rate by 3.1%.
The Group expects that, subject to the uncertain outcome of the Strategic Review, the effective tax rate will remain relatively consistent 
with the current and prior year and reflect the reduction of UK corporate tax rates over the next few years.
Refer to Note 9 and 23 in the financial statements for further detail.
The Group published its tax strategy on the Group’s website on 14 December 2017, and is available at http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/

No ordinary or preference share dividends were declared or paid in the period, due to restrictions in the Bond terms and insufficient 
distributable reserves. The provisions of the Group’s Bond restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends on the Company’s ordinary 
shares until certain conditions, including that net leverage is below 2.25x adjusted EBITDA, are met.
Disposal
On 17 January 2017, the Group completed the disposal of the entire issued capital of Johnston Publishing East Anglia Limited, which 
owned 13 publishing titles and associated websites in East Anglia and East Midlands (Midlands titles), to Iliffe Media Limited for cash 
consideration of £17.0 million and disposal cost of £1.4 million. Refer to Note 16 to the financial statements for additional disclosure.
Cashflow and net debt
The Group’s net debt decreased to £195.9 million at 30 December 2017, excluding Bond mark-to-market and Bond discounts totalling 
£54.2 million. In the period, a £22.8 million fair value movement loss has been recognised (as a result of an increase in the market value  
of the bond) (FY 2016 £43.6 million gain) (Note 8b of the financial statements). The net debt after mark-to-market adjustments was  
£141.7 million. 
Cash generated from operations of £12.2 million is after payment of £1.4 million in professional fees in relation to the disposal of  
the East Anglia and East Midlands titles (Note 16) and pension contributions of £10.3 million. Cash held at 30 December 2017 was  
£25.0 million, with the increase from the prior period end including disposal proceeds of £17.0 million before fee’s received from  
Iliffe Media Limited (Note 16) and £5.2 million in proceeds from the sale of properties (Note 18).
The Group continues to maintain tight control of working capital and capital expenditure with £4.6 million having been spent on asset 
purchases (FY 2016: £6.1 million), including £1.7 million outlay on digital platforms and other equipment.
Cash interest paid for the full year was £19.0 million on the bond (FY 2016: £19.4 million). The £0.4 million decrease from the prior period 
is attributable to the interest that was paid on overdrafts and loans in the prior year.
We have continued to review our property portfolio to identify markets and centres that have accommodation which no longer meets 
the requirements of the business. Overall we reduced the total number of operating properties within the portfolio to 89 at the end  
of 2017, a reduction of 18 properties in the year. Three UK freehold properties were sold during 2017, and there was a net reduction of  
15 leases, including eight leases that were reassigned or sublet as part of the East Midlands and East Anglia title disposal to Iliffe Media 
Ltd. The Group expects to take advantage of emerging opportunities to rationalise the property portfolio further during 2018.
The Group received cash proceeds of £5.2 million on the properties sold during the period, which included the Sheffield property  
and car park disposal and deferred consideration received on the former Peterborough web press site. In the current year there  
was a change in the estimate for the anticipated total future cost payable for onerous leases and dilapidations, arising from a change  
in the Group’s property strategy. This resulted in an additional provision of £4.4 million being charged.

platforms (2016: £4.6 million) and £0.7 million spent on other infrastructure (FY 2016: £1.6 million).
Strategic Review
The Group’s net debt (excluding mark-to-market) at period end was £195.9 million. The major acquisition programme in 2005 and 2006 
saw peak debt levels hit £751 million at the end of 2006. The Group also operates a defined benefits pension scheme, which was closed 
to future accrual on 30 June 2010. At 30 December 2017 it had a net deficit of £47.2 million. Today only 276 of the 4,959 scheme 
members are current employees of the Group.
Operationally, the Group continues to generate cash and perform well in a very challenging trading environment. In 2017, from the  
cash generated by the operations, the Group paid annual interest of £18.8 million on its Bonds and made pension contributions of  
£10.3 million to the defined benefit pension scheme.
The current size of the business cannot support this level of debt and pension commitments over the longer term.
On 29 March 2017, the Group announced it had commenced a Strategic Review, working with its advisers, Rothschild and Ashurst  
LLP, to assess the financing options available to the Group in relation to the Bonds which become due for repayment on 1 June 2019.  
As a key part of the strategic review process, the Board has engaged with its major stakeholders, including shareholders, holders  
of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and the Pensions Regulator.
The Board subsequently announced that it was approaching its largest bondholders regarding the formation of an ad hoc committee of 
bondholders, which was formed in November 2017. Discussions with advisers to the ad hoc committee and our other stakeholders are  
in progress. Any proposal that results from these discussions will remain subject to negotiation and the consent of relevant stakeholders, 
and there can be no certainty that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. In the event that consensual amendments to the Group’s 
capital structure cannot be agreed with relevant stakeholders, alternative arrangement for the restructuring or refinancing of the Bonds 
prior to June 2019 will be explored as part of the Strategic Review process.
The impact of this matter on the directors determination of the appropriateness of preparing the 2017 financial statements on a going 
concern basis, and their review of the Group’s viability over the medium term is discussed in the ‘Liquidity and going concern’ section  
on page 45 and the ‘Viability Statement’ section on page 46.
Net liabilities position
At the period end, the Group had a net deficit of £93.5 million, a reduction in net assets of £67.4 million on the prior year. The movement 
in the net asset position from the prior year includes: an impairment write-down of £64.4 million, a £23.1 million increase in borrowings 
(which is largely due to the fair value loss of £22.8 million recorded in the period), a reduction in assets held for sale of £16.2 million, 
partially offset by a £20.5 million decrease in the pension deficit and a £9.0 million increase in cash.
Pensions
As at 30 December 2017, the net pension deficit has decreased to £47.2 million from £67.7 million at 31 December 2016. The decrease  
in the deficit is largely a result of £10.3 million of contributions paid during the period, positive returns on pension assets and the benefit 
of applying updated demographic assumptions based on the CMI 2016 model (as compared to the estimate made at 31 December 2016). 
This reflects life expectancy of 19.7 years for a male aged 65, down from 20.1 years in the prior year and in line with the Health Study 
completed in 2015.
Each of the financial assumptions were reviewed in light of market conditions resulting in the application of a discount rate of 2.50% 
(down from 2.70% at 31 December 2016), and a decrease in inflation assumption by 0.10% to 3.30%. These assumptions have partially 
offset the benefit experienced by the mortality rate change discussed above. 30

Reconciliation of statutory and adjusted results
Adjusted operating profit of £33.1 million (FY 2016: £36.9 million) includes the results of the i from the acquisition date and has been 
calculated after adjusting for revenue and cost of sales for closed titles and digital brands. Adjustments made to operating costs include 
restructuring, impairment and other non-trading related costs.
Continuing statutory revenue has been adjusted for disposed and closed titles and digital products to give adjusted revenue.  
The adjustment to revenue is a reduction of £0.4 million in 2017, and £11.9 million in 2016. A detailed reconciliation of the statutory  
to adjusted revenue is shown on page 139.

Factors affecting future group performance
The performance of the Group will continue to be affected by the economic conditions in our markets, cyclical conditions, structural and 
business-specific circumstances and economic trends including employment, property transactions, new car sales and the levels of 
consumer and SME confidence. However, the outlook for the Group will also depend on a number of other factors, including:
• growing new digital revenues in the Group’s existing market segments to offset print revenue decline;
• ability to adapt to customer requirements through new sales propositions and digital advertising channels;
• the impact of new entrants and competitors to the market;
• continually improving existing efficient operations through technology infrastructure and improved processes;
• further re-engineering of the cost base of the business;
• the level of investment required to support digital growth, and restructuring, and its impact on cash generation;
• impact on sterling following Brexit subsequently impacting Euro denominated paper prices;
• conclusion of negotiations with pension scheme trustees regarding annual pension contributions; and
• the outcome of the Strategic Review of the options available to the Group in respect of the repayment of the Bonds in June 2019  
(see Going Concern and Viability Statements on pages 45 to 47). 32

Ensuring sustainable
operations throughout
our business
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
As a significant presence in communities across the country, we continue to ensure that our 
business activities meet with key sustainability and efficiency principles. We look to promote 
corporate social responsibility throughout the Group. The interests of the environment as well  
as the future sustainability of the business have an influence on our operations.
Business ethics
We are ever-conscious of the importance of ensuring the development and implementation of ethical and non-discriminatory policies 
and strategies when dealing with employees, suppliers, subscribers, customers and shareholders.
We strive to operate our business in accordance with a code of ethics and have a range of policies for dealing with a number of key legal, 
compliance and human rights issues, such as anti-bribery requirements, corruption, anti-slavery and conflicts of interest.
An anti-corruption and bribery policy is operated by the Group and commits it to operating in an honest and ethical manner. A zero 
tolerance approach to bribery and corruption applies and we are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our 
business dealings and relationships. Our policy sets out our responsibilities (and the responsibilities of those working for us) in respect  
of bribery and corruption and provides information and guidance (including practical examples of instances of bribery and advice as  
to what is and is not acceptable). The policy provides clear instructions for workers on how to raise concerns and what to do if they are  
a victim of bribery or corruption. We are committed to ensuring that no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a consequence of 
refusing to take part in bribery or corruption, or because of reporting their suspicions in good faith. The Company regularly completes 
anti-bribery due diligence procedures for prospective customers, particularly in its contract print business and has made specific 
undertakings in respect of anti-bribery provisions with some of its largest customers. All our major customers are audited and we have 
discussed our policy on bribery with many of them. Many of the Group’s major procurement arrangements are with long-standing 
counterparties. We discuss our anti-bribery policy with them and these arrangements are generally considered to present a low risk  
for bribery and corruption. As a result, the Company does not implement a formal anti-bribery and corruption due diligence process  
as part of its standard contracting arrangements.
We are members of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) and operate an Internal Editorial Governance Committee 
with the remit of ensuring effective compliance with IPSO guidance and adjudications as well as all other relevant legislation and 
editorial guidance. The Committee regularly reviews relevant policies and procedures; it also feeds back to IPSO on behalf of the Group 
following regular consultation with the Group’s Editorial Board. The editorial policies and procedures help to ensure that the business  
as a whole is able to effectively and consistently deal with relevant editorial issues. This continues to be an important objective for the 
business in addressing its commitment to responsible and ethical journalism. We believe that the low numbers of adjudications upheld 
by IPSO in relation to our publications (zero in 2017) help to demonstrate the effectiveness of our policies and procedures.
We are also focused on prioritising our digital rights and responsibilities, and our ethical conduct, as well as data security and privacy; and 
we strive to tackle challenging issues proactively by seeking to make our communications and processes simple, open and transparent.
Board responsibility
The Executive Directors hold responsibility for ensuring that the business addresses all issues relating to corporate social responsibility. 
They set the tone of the ethical strategy and measures adopted by the business and are assisted and guided by the Company Secretary. 
In particular, the Directors review the Corporate Social Responsibility Statement for the business and monitor key developments in 
corporate environmental, social and governance issues with a view to responding to changes in legislation, regulation and best industry 
practices. Moreover, relevant risks are also regularly assessed by the Board when conducting their ongoing risk analysis of the business.
Responsibility for drafting, reviewing and compliance with the Group’s human resources policies sits with the Group Human Resources 
Director who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. 33

Diversity
We believe in equal opportunity, fairness and respect for all employees and our Diversity Policy promotes this culture. We recognise and 
appreciate the differences of age, gender, gender reassignment, marital or family status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, disability, religion 
and belief, sexual orientation and pregnancy and maternity, and our Diversity Policy commits us to (and has the objective of) eliminating 
discrimination and less favourable treatment and promoting diversity. Specifically, amongst its objectives, our Diversity Policy aims to 
avoid discrimination and less favourable treatment in recruitment, training and promotion, the ending of employment and in making 
reasonable adjustments where required to enable people working for us with disabilities to undertake their roles. 
 
Our approach to diversity benefits our employees, our business, our customers, our suppliers, our shareholders and the communities we 
operate in. We are proud to have a diverse workforce that ensures we remain relevant and engaging within the communities we serve.
The age and gender profiles for our workforce are shown in the table below:

Gender pay reporting legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish statutory calculations every year showing 
how large the pay gap is between male and female employees. The regulations took effect in April 2017 with employers having 12 
months (to April 2018) to publish details of their gender pay gaps on their own website and on the government's online reporting 
service. We fully comply with this legislation and published our Gender Pay Gap Report in March 2018. More information can be  
found on our website www.johnstonpress.co.uk.
The Board operates a separate diversity policy with the objective (amongst others) of ensuring an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to ensure an optimum Board and efficient stewardship. The policy is described more fully in the Nomination Committee 
section of the Corporate Governance Report on page 42.
Car fleet
Our car fleet is partly owned (3%) but predominantly leased (97%), and we continue with the transition towards a fully-leased fleet.  
The leased cars are newer and more efficient in terms of fuel emissions and the transition to a leased fleet has a role to play in improving 
our environmental performance.
We have continued to implement our policy of utilising, where possible, vehicles with lower fuel emissions.
We are also keen to pursue our strategy of providing training initiatives for our car drivers and aim to work with our car fleet insurers  
in order to support future training needs and objectives.
Community involvement
We work hard to nurture the trust and loyalty our customers place in us and are proud of the role our titles continue to play in  
our communities.
Through fund-raising and awareness initiatives, sponsorship, hard-hitting campaigns, awards ceremonies to recognise and support local 
businesses, and an unfailing dedication to providing the latest news, features, sport and entertainment, our newspapers and websites 
remain at the heart of the communities we serve.
As always, our brands supported dozens of causes and championed numerous campaigns throughout 2017.
Employee involvement
We employ around 2,000 people in the UK and our aim is to attract, retain and engage the best people. We aim to be a great place  
to work and continued activity to embed our values, mission and purpose throughout 2017.
Our latest YourSay employee survey, which was first run in January 2013, was conducted in late 2017. Our senior leaders are making 
tangible improvements within their teams on the back of the survey findings and we will continue to build on this in 2018. We always 
aim to take a transparent approach to internal communications and engagement, including within our Editorial and Commercial 
transformation programmes. Key priorities included identifying and developing leadership talent at all levels and succession planning. 34
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Strategic Report
Our expectations in terms of managers’ and employees’ behaviour and standards are set out in our Value Statements, Personnel Policies 
and Procedures, Employee Handbook, Codes of Conduct and Contracts of Employment. Our grievance and whistleblowing procedures 
allow any employee to report behaviour that is contrary to our policies or is in any way of concern to them and we communicated the 
support available around whistleblowing periodically throughout the year.
We recognise a number of trade unions at an operating company level and remain committed to communication and consultation 
with our employees during times of change.
A diverse workforce adds clear value for our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve and we fully support  
the principle of equal opportunity for all. Our Disability Access policy is included in our Personnel Policies and Procedures manual.  
As part of our ongoing Health and Safety audits and property maintenance programmes, we seek to provide suitable access and 
working environments to ensure that we do not discriminate against disabled employees or customers.
Environmental policy
We continue to review our operations with a view to minimising any impact upon the environment. Our Portsmouth and Dinnington 
print sites’ environmental management systems are certified to the international ISO 14001 standard.
Our Dinnington site achieved this certification in 2015 and had a successful recertification audit to the new 14001:2015 standard in 2017. 
Our Portsmouth site will recertify to the new standard in early 2018, closely followed by our other print site at Carn in Northern Ireland.
Energy consumption and carbon footprint
We encourage staff to adopt a number of key measures with the aim of driving down, where possible, our overall energy consumption 
levels. Such measures include discouraging non-essential travel by staff thereby helping to reduce our carbon footprint; improving  
our car fleet in order to strive towards greener transport as well as ensuring that waste levels are monitored and kept to appropriate 
standards and in line with key performance indicators.
In 2017, we reduced consumption of gas by 32% and electricity consumption by 8%, including consumption by the i. The i was acquired 
in April 2016 and accordingly data has been incorporated from the date of acquisition. This has resulted in increases in some absolute 
numbers due to the full year impact on 2017. The reduction in gas and electricity consumption is due to our continued property estate 
rationalisation including downsizing and moving into more energy efficient premises. In addition, energy efficient projects continue  
to be implemented at our print sites resulting in reduced consumption.
Our indirect greenhouse gas emissions increased by 151 tonnes (2.5%) in the year. Emissions associated with the inclusion of the i,  
for a full year, resulted in an increase of 783 tonnes. Like for like indirect emissions therefore fell by 631 tonnes (16%).
We have continued to participate in phase 2 of the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme, and also operate 
Climate Change Agreements for our two larger print sites.
A breakdown of our energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions during 2017 is set out on page 35.
Supply chain
Paper sourcing and sustainable forestry
We are committed to maximising our use of newsprint from sustainable renewable sources, carrying the Forest Stewardship Council 
certification. 72% of newsprint is supplied from UK-based paper mills (up from 70% in 2016), reducing transportation and its associated 
carbon footprint. Virtually all of the remainder is sourced from the near continent. All UK mills are supplying newsprint containing 100% 
recycled newsprint recovered from kerbside collection points and wholesaler returns.
As a member of the Newspaper Industry Materials Committee, which is part of the News Media Association (NMA), we also participate in 
both environmental and energy saving initiatives in the manufacture and supply of materials needed for the production of newspapers. 
We also support the Two Sides campaign, a pan-European body responsible for the promotion and responsible use of paper products. 
This promotes the use of sustainable and reusable products in the newspaper industry.
Contracted printing and product distribution services
We contract out the printing of magazine supplements and some newspapers, and the distribution by road of printed products.  
We require our key contractors in these areas to measure and report the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with  
the operations they undertake on our behalf. Wherever possible we prefer to work with suppliers that are independently certified  
to a recognised environmental management system standard.
Waste management and recycling
We always strive to ensure that our actual supply of recycled paper is higher than the government guidelines and the reported 
industrywide statistics. We recycle all our paper and non-paper waste stream through audited environmental companies. These 
processes have been in place for several years and are in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act and Hazardous Waste 
Regulations and are ISO 14001 accredited. We also comply with the packaging waste regulations in the disposal of non-hazardous 
materials used in the packaging of our products.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED 35

Redundant IT equipment is collected for recycling in line with the relevant regulations. This process is carried out by our partners  
who are ISO 27001 and ISO 14001 compliant as well as being ADISA (Asset Disposal and Information Security Alliance) 2 accredited.

Strategic Report
Health and safety
We are committed to providing safe working conditions for all our employees, visitors and contractors, and we are proud to report that 
our safety performance continues to demonstrate one of the lowest reported accident figures in our industry.
In 2017, we achieved an accident rate of 0.7%, which was the same as the previous year – see table below.
Over the last six years we have significantly reduced our accident rate from 2.6% of all employees involved in accidents down to this 
year’s 0.7%. Likewise we have reduced our RIDDOR reportable accidents from 18 six years ago, to going the full year in 2017 without any 
reportable accidents. This is our second complete year in the whole business without any RIDDOR reportable accidents and without  
any days lost from accidents. However, regrettably a RIDDOR reportable accident subsequently occurred in February 2018.
We believe that our focus on addressing the causes of accidents – and our insistence on adhering to best practice and procedures –  
has played a significant part in our improved performance in recent years. Although we are proud of this achievement, our work will 
continue to ensure every effort is made to maintain this record. We have Health and Safety Committee meetings throughout key 
operational areas and these are chaired by each area’s senior representative and the local health and safety managers, who ensure all 
actions are effectively completed. Members from the Group health and safety team also attend local safety meetings. This is monitored 
by the Group Health, Safety and Compliance Director.
The Board has overall responsibility for health and safety and receives regular reports in this regard with operational responsibility 
delegated to the Chief Executive Officer. In addition, we have a Group Health and Safety Committee made up of representatives from 
key areas across the business and chaired by the Company Secretary.
The Committee, in conjunction with the Group Health, Safety and Compliance Director, instructs and reviews audit visits, monitors 
compliance with Group policies, ensures those policies are kept up-to-date and encourages best practice. The Group Health and Safety 
team coordinates independent audits of all our main sites and works closely with the local health and safety managers and each of the 
site Health and Safety Officers to ensure effective performance and this, once again, has helped all sites to improve their scores in our 
rolling programme of internal audit inspections.
Our consistent reporting processes have now been in place for more than 10 years allowing performance over time to be measured  
and ensuring that every accident is reported and any identified actions are completed. This is a key part of our control environment.

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In 2017 the Board focused on
the Company’s Strategic Review
of refinancing options, as well as
strategic priorities for its operations
This report forms part of the Directors’ Report which can be found on pages 60 to 64. The Company has continued in its commitment  
to comply with the principles of the 2016 United Kingdom Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) as published by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Although the Company has sought to comply with the relevant main and supporting principles set out in the Code 
throughout the period ended 30 December 2017, there are a number of specific areas where it has not done so due to the particular 
circumstances that the Company is operating within, and those areas are explained in the Corporate Governance Report starting  
on page 40 (the ‘Governance Report’). I was appointed as Interim Chair following the resignation of Ian Russell, the former Chairman,  
at the end of 2016 and my appointment has meant the Company has not complied with the Code provision that at least half the Board 
(excluding the Chairman) should consist of independent Non-Executive Directors. The steps we are taking to address this are laid out in 
the Governance Report. The Board and Executive Management monitor compliance with the Code and details of the Group’s internal 
controls can be found on page 44. A public consultation on a draft revised version of the Code was launched in December 2017 and ran 
until February 2018. The Company will seek to comply with the revised Code, where practicable, once it is in operation.
During 2017 the Board has focused on the Company’s Strategic Review of refinancing options which was announced in March 2017.  
It has also closely monitored key strategic priorities for its operations and the risks associated with them as the transformation of the 
Company and its provision of local media services continues. The Company consulted with many of its largest shareholders on a range  
of issues at various stages of the year. The agreements governing the Group’s debt structure include various information requirements  
to holders of its bonds which we complied with throughout the year. In January 2017 we reported the cancellation of a revolving credit 
facility under an agreement with the relevant lenders. The Governance Report is intended to give shareholders some detail of the 
structures which the Company has operated under in the past year. We remain committed to the principles of good governance and,  
as a Board, seek to regularly review not only the effectiveness of our Board and committees but also the wider corporate governance 
framework within which we operate. We do so with the aim of ensuring that the Group as a whole is managed effectively and 
transparently. The report which follows provides more detail of the workings of the Board, including the matters reserved to it and to the 
evaluation process which we use to review (and where necessary improve its effectiveness).
Our revised Remuneration Policy was put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2017. Following shareholder consultation prior 
to the shareholder vote, the Company announced on 15 May 2017 that certain undertakings would be made as to how that policy would 
be operated. The policy was subsequently passed, receiving support from just under 68% of our shareholders. A significant vote against  
was also recorded in respect of another resolution proposed at the Annual General Meeting (to authorise the grant of performance share 
plan (‘PSP’) awards without performance conditions). We have undertaken to shareholders that any future PSP awards will be subject to 
performance conditions measured over a three-year period. The Company undertook to continue its ongoing dialogue with shareholders  
at the appropriate time to further understand the reasons behind the results in respect of these resolutions. The Board currently proposes 
that no PSP awards will be made in 2018. You can find the Company’s remuneration policy on our website, and our report on the 
implementation of the policy is contained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 59.
The Audit Committee maintains its central role in monitoring the Group’s systems of internal controls and risk framework and a separate 
report on the work of the Audit Committee can be found on pages 48 to 50.
The views of both our shareholders and other providers of capital are welcomed on governance issues and play an important role  
in shaping our structures and our reporting of them. We aim to reflect their feedback and advice in our reporting.
We will continue to seek to ensure that the Board has an appropriate mix of skills and experience. This will remain a paramount 
consideration when recruiting new Directors to the Board at the appropriate time and is a key measure in ensuring that our  
governance structures remain appropriate for the Group. The Group continues to strive to reflect the communities in which we  
work and to have regard to the benefits of a diverse workforce. We always seek to provide information on this, and details of many  
of our other community and social initiatives can be found in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report on pages 32 to 36.

Directors’ Governance
The role of the Board
The Board, in its commitment to effectively operate and lead the Company, held nine Board meetings in 2017. Where necessary,  
the Chairman meets privately with the Non-Executive Directors before scheduled Board meetings. If unable to attend a meeting, 
Directors are encouraged to give their views and comments on matters to be discussed to the Chairman in advance. Attendance  
at meetings throughout the year by each of the Directors is shown in the table on page 41. All Directors are encouraged to share  
the benefit of their knowledge and experience, and the Board’s evaluation process assesses their contribution each year.
Throughout the year the Board has played a key role in monitoring and evaluating the development of the Group’s strategy. The 
Company’s business model is described on pages 14 to 17. The Board reviews the performance of management in meeting the agreed 
objectives and goals and monitors appropriate remuneration levels. The Group’s management development and succession plans  
are scrutinised by the Board to ensure that the skills and competencies of management correspond to the Group’s requirements.  
At least one Board meeting each year is wholly devoted to strategy and to the consideration of a plan for the long-term growth and 
development of the Group. This is reviewed and discussed as appropriate at the other Board meetings held during the year. During  
2017 the Board’s principle area of focus has been undertaking and managing the conduct of the Company’s strategic review of 
financing options for the Group (the ‘Strategic Review’).
The Board’s primary task is to ensure that the Company (and its wider group of subsidiaries) have sufficient financial resources and talent 
in order to meet its core objectives by:
• the Strategic Review;
• reviewing and approving the overall Group strategy and direction;
• approving the financial statements, as well as revenue and capital budgets;
• setting, implementing and maintaining audit processes and risk management policies, to ensure the effective operation  
of the Company;
• the approval of material agreements and projects; and
• reviewing and approving of remuneration policies.
• in addition to the normal agenda at Board meetings, which is described below, the Directors usually consider one or more 
operational or special topics at each meeting. During the last 12 months such topics have included:
• business risks;
• regulatory trends and developments;
• significant acquisitions and disposals;
• sales transformation projects;
• strategy for paid for newspapers;
• business and website development;
• development plans for major titles;
• advertising revenues;
• display advertising;
• property portfolio;
• strategy for information technology;
• digital revenues and publishing;
• talent and human resource requirements;
• the Company’s final salary pension scheme;
• new product offers;
• Board Committee terms of reference;
• asset disposal plans and future industry developments;
• acquisition and integration of the i newspaper;
• disaster recovery plans; and
• health and safety.
The authority of the Directors is specified in relevant legislation and in the Company’s Articles of Association which include powers 
concerning the issue and buy back of the Company’s shares, subject to the authority of its shareholders. At its Annual General Meeting in 
2017 the Company sought authority to make purchases of its own shares. Board members also have respective commitments to the 
Audit, Nomination, Strategic Review and Remuneration Committees. In 2017 there were three scheduled meetings of the Audit 
Committee, five Nomination Committee meetings, four meetings of the Strategic Review Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee held eight meetings.

1 Resigned on 22 May 2017. Attended all Board and Committee meetings prior to his resignation.
2 Missed one Audit Committee meeting and one Remuneration Committee meeting (both arranged at short notice) due to pre-existing and conflicting personal  
or business arrangements.
3 Joined the Board on 1 June 2017 . Attended all Board and Committee meetings following his appointment with the exception of one Nomination Committee 
meeting due to a pre-arranged conflicting business commitment.
During the year, the Company kept the membership of the Board and Committees under review. Following Mr Marshall’s departure 
from the Board at the Annual General Meeting, and Mr Buchan’s subsequent appointment, Mr Buchan joined the Nomination 
Committee. Although the Company believe that the current mix of individuals is appropriate and that the Committees work well,  
it is looking at how committee membership may be reviewed as part of the ongoing process of Board renewal.
Board responsibilities
The Board maintains a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for discussion and decision making, including future 
strategy, acquisitions and disposals, dividend policy, approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, capital expenditure and contractual 
commitments in excess of certain limits, trading and capital budgets and Group borrowing facilities. The schedule was most recently 
reviewed during 2015. At each of its scheduled meetings during the year, the Board considered and scrutinised management reports 
from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer which also feature contributions from their senior direct reports (the 
‘Executive Report’). Each Executive Report addresses performance against a number of key strategic objectives as well as providing 
additional information regarding business performance and market and other key issues. The minutes of the Board and Committee 
meetings are circulated to all Board members. The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timelines and quality of 
information provided to it. Day-to-day management of the Group, including implementation of strategy and operational decisions 
relating to digital and print publishing, online products, printing and human resources, are delegated to management. The Executive 
Management Committee, consisting of the Executive Directors and eight other senior managers (all of whom are men) from across  
the Group, meet weekly to review performance and consider operational issues.
The Board acknowledges the division of responsibilities for running the Board and managing the Company’s business. Camilla  
Rhodes became Interim Chairman on 1 January 2017. On appointment as Interim Chairman, Ms Rhodes met the independence  
criteria stipulated by the Code. The Company continues to monitor the situation and anticipates appointing a permanent Chairman  
as part of, or shortly after, the process of completing the Strategic Review. The Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, 
for setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring that adequate time is available for discussion of all agenda items, in particular strategic 
issues as well as ensuring effective communication with shareholders. It is also primarily the Chairman’s responsibility to promote  
a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of Non-Executive Directors in particular and ensuring 
constructive relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. There were no significant changes to the external commitments 
of the Chairman during the year.
As part of their role, Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. In addition to at least  
one Board meeting each year being dedicated to strategy, key strategic objectives are reported to the Board in the Executive Report  
and they also receive regular reports and presentations on key strategic initiatives and issues. They satisfy themselves on the integrity  
of financial information and that internal controls and systems of risk management are robust and defensible. The work and reports  
of the Audit Committee are used to assist the Board in this process. Through the Remuneration Committee they are responsible for 
determining appropriate levels of remuneration of Executive Directors and, through the Nomination Committee, have a prime role  
in appointing and, where necessary, removing Executive Directors and in succession planning.
Mike Butterworth served as Senior Independent Director on an interim basis throughout the year following the appointment of Camilla 
Rhodes as interim Chair. The Senior Independent Director is available to address any concerns that shareholders may have that have  
not been resolved through the normal communication channels of the Chairman or Executive Directors. During 2017, the Audit and 
Strategic Review Committees were chaired by Mike Butterworth. Throughout the year both the Nomination Committee (on an interim 
basis), and the Remuneration Committee were chaired by Camilla Rhodes. The terms of reference of each of the Board’s Committees 
were reviewed by the Board during 2017 and the terms are displayed on the Company’s website. Membership of each Committee is 
noted on pages 38 to 39. 42
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Governance
Board balance and independence
Throughout the period ended 30 December 2017, the Company complied with the requirement of Code provision B.1.2 for smaller 
companies (as ‘smaller company’ is defined in the Code) in that it had at least two independent Non-Executive directors (Kjell Aamot  
and Mike Butterworth). In previous years the Company has complied with Code provision B.1.2 as if it were not a smaller company  
(with at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) consisting of independent Non-Executive Directors. Of the Company’s current  
six Directors, two are Executive and the remainder Non-Executive, of whom two (Kjell Aamot and Mike Butterworth) are regarded as 
independent. Camilla Rhodes, although considered to be independent by the rest of the Board, is currently acting as Interim Chairman. 
Jamie Buchan was appointed to the Board as the nominee Director of Usaha Tegas which owns 10.63% of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital. He is therefore not regarded as independent. He does not serve on any of the Audit, Remuneration or Strategic Review 
Committees. The terms of reference of each of the Audit and Remuneration committees require their members to be independent 
Non-Executive Directors as determined by the Board. Members of the Strategic Review Committee may either be Executive Directors  
or independent Non-Executive Directors. Ms Rhodes was previously an independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and was 
appointed as Interim Chairman after Ian Russell, the previous Non-Executive Chairman resigned from the Board on 31 December 2016  
due to an acute illness in his family. In 2017 the Company undertook a process (supervised by the Nomination Committee) to seek  
to appoint a new Chairman. As at the date of this report, no appointment has been made and due to the ongoing Strategic Review,  
the Board has suspended the recruitment process. Details of each Director are provided on pages 38 to 39. The terms and conditions  
of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during office hours and  
will be available for at least 15 minutes prior to the Company’s Annual General Meeting at the place where that meeting is held.
Board Committees
The reports of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee can be found on pages 48 to 50 and 51 to 59 respectively.
Nomination Committee
Reporting to the Board, the Nomination Committee’s duties include regularly reviewing the structure, size and composition of the 
Board, seeking suitably skilled and experienced candidates as Non-Executive Directors with sufficient time to devote to the role and 
overseeing all Board appointments. In doing so the Committee also considers the Company’s succession planning for Executive 
Directors and senior managers, to ensure that adequate plans are in place to protect against the loss of key staff, as well as reviewing the 
composition of the Board and its committees. The Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the management succession plans 
currently in place. The membership of the Nomination Committee dropped from five members to four at the start of the year following 
Ian Russell’s resignation as a Director. The Committee is chaired by Ms Rhodes, the Company’s Interim Chairman and Mike Butterworth, 
Kjell Aamot and Jamie Buchan are all members. Mr Buchan joined the Committee on appointment as a director on 1 June 2017, Ralph 
Marshall was a member of the Committee until he stepped down as a director on 22 May 2017. Mr Buchan is not (and Mr Marshall was 
not) considered to be independent by the Board and therefore the Committee’s membership does not comply with Code provision  
B.2.1 which states that a majority of members of the Nomination Committee should be independent non-executive members. Due to 
the ongoing Strategic Review, the Board suspended the process for renewal of its membership and anticipates appointing of a new 
Chairman as part of, or shortly after, the process of completing the Strategic Review. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Committee and its terms of reference are available on the Company’s website.
In considering candidates to fill Board vacancies, the Nomination Committee has regard to the benefits of and the need to encourage, 
diversity (including gender) within the Board’s membership; this is a specific consideration of the recruitment process and is included in  
the Committee’s terms of reference. The Company operates a diversity policy which commits it to equal opportunity, fairness and respect 
for all and opposes discrimination on grounds of gender, gender reassignment, age, marital or family status, race, nationality, ethnic origin, 
disability, religion or belief or sexual orientation, or other factors that are immaterial to a person’s ability to do their job. The Board adopted  
a diversity policy in January 2017 which provides set measurable objectives for diversity amongst Board members (including a target  
for female Board membership of 25% by 2019). The Nomination Committee is responsible for the implementation of this policy and 
monitoring progress towards the achievement of its objectives. Once the requirements of a vacant role have been determined, the 
Committee may appoint external recruitment consultants to assist with the search who will also consider diversity in identifying suitable 
candidates. External recruitment consultants engaged for this purpose have no other connection with the Company.
Strategic Review Committee
The Board established a Strategic Review Committee in October 2017. The Committee’s role is to act on behalf of the Board in relation  
to the Strategic Review of the Group. The Committee’s terms of reference require its members to be either executive, or independent 
non-executive directors (which for these purposes can include the Chairman). The Committee is chaired by Mike Butterworth, interim 
Senior Independent Director. Camilla Rhodes (interim Chairman), Ashley Highfield (Chief Executive Officer) and David King (Chief 
Financial Officer) are also members. The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee and the Committee has written  
terms of reference. The Committee met five times in 2017 and is authorised to do anything that it considers necessary, expedient  
or appropriate in connection with the Strategic Review.

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Disclosure Committee
The Disclosure Committee (which is not a committee of the Board) meets on an ad hoc basis when required and its primary role  
is to evaluate whether information communicated to it by members of staff of the Company or the wider Group or otherwise in the 
Company’s possession constitutes inside information. The membership of the Committee consists of the Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and Group Business Development Director.
Induction and professional development
The Company has an induction programme that it makes available to new Directors. This can be tailored to specific requirements and 
includes visits to a range of the Group’s operations where appropriate, and meetings and discussions with senior management and advisers.
All Board members have access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense on any matters relating to their 
responsibilities as Directors and as members of the various Committees of the Board. The assistance of the Company Secretary  
is available to all Directors for all matters connected to their duties. Directors receive regular reports from Executive Management.  
They are also sent regular updates on industry-related issues.
Training
Training is undertaken by Directors during the year on an individual basis according to their needs on industry-specific governance  
and technical issues. The Company encourages Non-Executive Directors to visit at least two of the Group’s operational centres each  
year. During site visits they receive a presentation and a tour of the relevant business. Individual Directors also make arrangements  
to attend a range of seminars presented by professionals throughout the year. When the Non-Executive Directors meet without the 
Executive Directors present, the balance of skills on the Board (which includes training needs) is one of the standard topics for them  
to consider, both individually and collectively.
Board performance evaluation
Under the provisions of the Code, evaluation of the boards of FTSE 350 companies (which does not include the Company) should be 
conducted externally every three years. The Board undertook an externally facilitated evaluation during 2014. In subsequent years the 
Board has undertaken a rigorous evaluation of its own performance and that of each of its Committees. As in preceding years, in 2017 
this involved the completion of a self-assessment questionnaire by the Directors, covering the performance of the Board, individual 
Directors, the Company Secretary and Board Committees. Other topics included the conduct of meetings, the provision of  
information, relationships, strategy, training, progress against the outcomes from the 2016 self-assessment evaluation exercise  
and the overall effectiveness of the Board. The composition and chairmanship of each Committee was reviewed together with  
its fulfilment of its role as outlined in its terms of reference, its reporting and overall performance.
The topics which the evaluation exercise addressed provided the Board with an analysis of the performance of its key duties and, as has 
been the case with previous evaluation exercises, identified a number of specific areas where change could be beneficial to the Company 
and to the conduct of the Board and/or one or more Committees. These have been used to prepare an action plan for the Board and  
is being used to assist in the planning of the Board’s business. In particular, the Board agreed to monitor the need to recruit additional 
non-executive directors given changes to its composition during 2016 and 2017 and the Strategic Review, to hold additional meetings  
on special topics when required and to make changes to the presentation of certain information to the Board. The Board also agreed to 
make an additional site visit during the course of 2018. Although specific areas were identified for change, overall the process was positive 
and confirmed the effectiveness of the Board and relevant Committees as well as the contributions of individual Directors. As a separate 
measure, the Non-Executive Directors meet without the Chairman present at least annually to review his or her performance.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Board encourages and seeks to build a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional  
shareholders and other providers of capital. As part of this process, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make  
twice-yearly presentations to institutional shareholders and meet with shareholders and other investors to discuss any issues of  
concern and obtain feedback. In addition, investors can request a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial  
Officer throughout the year to highlight any significant concerns.
In normal circumstances the Chairman contacts the leading investors in the Company on at least an annual basis to address any 
concerns and discuss any issues. The Board receive a report with regard to any discussion with shareholders and also have circulated to 
them the written feedback that follows the full-year and the half-year results presentations. Brokers’ reports and analysts’ briefings, when 
available, are included in the Board papers sent to the Directors in advance of meetings. The Board receives a quarterly update on the 
shareholder register with a summary of the main movements in shareholdings since the previous report. It also receives regular updates 
from the Company’s brokers, Panmure Gordon and Liberum.
Members of the Board offer to meet with institutional shareholders to consider Corporate Governance matters. All the Non-Executive 
Directors are prepared to meet with shareholders to understand their views more fully or to address concerns.
The Company has certain compliance obligations concerning its obligations to providers of its debt and liaises with those providers  
or agents representing them when appropriate. 44

Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to encourage shareholders to attend its Annual General Meeting. It is the policy of the Board that all Directors should 
attend the Annual General Meeting and be available to answer shareholders’ questions unless unable to do so. The Company uses the 
Annual General Meeting to communicate with private investors and encourages their participation. All Directors attended the Annual 
General Meeting in 2017. In 2017, the notice of the Annual General Meeting and related papers were sent to shareholders more than  
20 days before the meeting.
Share capital
Information on the Company’s share capital is provided in Note 25 of the financial statements.
Board re-election
Under the provisions of the Company’s Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting 
after their appointment and thereafter to re-election every three years. The Company is not currently a member of the FTSE 350 Index  
of companies and is therefore not required to comply with provision B.7.1 of the Code which requires all directors of companies in that 
index to be subject to annual re-election. However, the Board considers that it is appropriate that all Directors who wish to continue in 
office to stand for annual re-election (as they have done since 2013), and accordingly the Board has recommended that resolutions will 
be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for the re-election of all of the current Directors who have indicated that they 
wish to continue in office. The Nomination Committee have, following the formal evaluation process described above, considered the 
performance of each of those Directors who wish to stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual General Meeting and are satisfied that 
those individuals’ performance continues to be effective and that they have demonstrated a clear commitment to their roles.
Separately during the course of the year, the Non-Executive Directors met without Camilla Rhodes to review her performance as Interim 
Chair and were satisfied that she had provided the necessary leadership and effectiveness for the role since her appointment and had 
demonstrated an ongoing commitment during her period in office. An equivalent exercise is proposed to be conducted in 2018.
Financial reporting
The Board is committed to presenting appropriate information about the Group’s financial position and seeks to comply with all standards 
issued by the International and UK Accounting Standards Boards relating to the disclosures which are included in this Annual Report.
Internal control
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the Code by establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces and establishing a sound risk management and internal control system. The Board regularly reviews  
the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of approval of this report and which it seeks to ensure is in 
accordance with Guidance on Risk Management and Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting published by the 
Financial Reporting Council. The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such  
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with Provision C.2.1 of the Code, the Board regularly and robustly assesses the principal risks facing the Company and 
reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and system of internal control and did so during 2017 and on an ongoing 
basis. The Code’s requirements have been integrated into the Company’s current risk management process to enable the appropriate 
Board reviews to be undertaken to allow continued compliance. The Board’s monitoring covers all controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management, and is based principally on reviewing reports from management to 
consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, managed and controlled and whether any significant weaknesses or 
emerging issues are promptly remedied or indicate a need for more extensive monitoring. The Board has also performed a specific 
assessment prior to the completion of this Annual Report. This assessment considers all significant aspects of internal control arising 
during the period covered by the report including the work of the Finance Department. The Audit Committee assists the Board (which 
maintains responsibility in this regard) in discharging its review responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, the Board has not identified or been advised of any failings or weaknesses 
which it has determined to be significant in the context of the Group. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has  
not been considered appropriate. The key elements of the ongoing continuous process during the period under review have been:
• Formal Board reporting on a bi-monthly basis of the Group’s performance and on any emerging risks and issues. The Company’s 
management accounts break down the results of the Group’s operations. All significant variations against budget and the previous 
year are fully examined. The day-to-day responsibility for managing each of the Group’s operations rests with experienced senior 
executives and the Group has a clear organisational structure which includes appropriate delegation of authority (which was 
reviewed in 2015 and is due to be reviewed again in 2018). The Executive Directors ensure that regular contact is maintained with  
all senior executives. The following issues are amongst those formally reserved to the Board:
 Ӳ approval for unbudgeted capital expenditure over £1 million and for other investment decisions;
 Ӳ approval of the annual budget for the forthcoming financial year. This includes detailed and comprehensive budgets covering 
each operating business;
 Ӳ reporting of the key operational departments’ future strategy as part of the operational topics considered at Board meetings 
during the year; and
 Ӳ review by the Audit Committee (with subsequent reporting to the Board) on a six-monthly basis of the work performed by the 
Finance Department (including in respect of internal audit issues with respect to internal financial controls, the programme for which 
is agreed in advance). This work is supported by the Group’s financial accounting centre which ensures a consistent and compliant 
approach to the processing of transactions and ensures a uniform control process across the Group’s operations.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 45
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
The Company has an ongoing process for the detailed internal review of risk which was reviewed and updated in 2017 and which 
formed the basis for ongoing internal monitoring and review of risk. The Group’s key risks are regularly considered by the Executive 
Management Committee and members of that Committee have responsibility for individual risks and the identification of emergent 
risks. The Group Compliance, Health and Safety Director is responsible for the management of the process of risk review and monitoring. 
The Board is provided with regular updates in respect of these. The Audit Committee has an oversight and monitoring role in relation to 
risk management and reviews the form of internal controls which the Company operates. It reports its findings to the Board on a regular 
basis following its meetings. The Board maintains ultimate responsibility for the monitoring and management of risk throughout the 
Group. Due to the changing nature of the Group, the range of risks that it faces and in order to ensure that resources are properly 
deployed to identify, monitor and mitigate risk, the Company has appointed Grant Thornton to provide external support to assist it in 
effective internal audit. The Group has an ongoing process to embed best practice into all the Group’s operations and to deal with areas 
of improvement which come to management’s and the Board’s attention.
In addition, senior management set policies, procedures and standards as detailed in the Group’s policy guidelines. These were reviewed 
in 2015 and tailored versions have been issued to the businesses in the specific locations where applicable.
The guidelines include policies on:
• finance including cash/treasury controls and authorisation levels;
• trading;
• customer service;
• commercial and competition;
• technology;
• property management;
• human resources including pension administration, disability and health and safety;
• environmental issues and energy management;
• legal and regulatory compliance;
• business continuity; and
• anti-bribery measures.
Fair, balanced and understandable report
A key governance requirement of the Group’s financial statements is for the Annual Report and Accounts to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The report has been prepared by the Company’s management and then reviewed by the Audit Committee and 
subsequently the Board. In order to provide comfort to the Audit Committee and the Board, contributors to the report have been 
provided with guidance including that the report should accurately describe the market context of the environment the Company 
operates in and its operational and financial performance. In particular, there is focus on the key risks faced by the Group, the market 
conditions which it operates in and the conduct of the Strategic Review. The content of the report is subject to a verification exercise 
(whereby support from underlying Company records for key information is provided by the relevant departments to those responsible 
for preparing the report and is also made available to the auditors upon their request) and to review by senior management. The Board has 
reviewed the Annual Report and Accounts and the reports of management regarding its preparation and believes that the explanation 
and disclosures set out on pages 1 to 145 provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy, taking into account the markets and the particular circumstances in which the Company operates, 
including the ongoing Strategic Review. Accordingly, having taken into account all matters considered by the Audit Committee and  
the Board and brought to its attention during the year, the Audit Committee and the Board and each of the Directors considers that  
the Annual Report taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides shareholders with the requisite information  
for evaluating the performance and current strategy of the Company.
Liquidity and going concern
As at 30 December 2017, the Group had net debt of £195.9 million (excluding mark-to-market accounting adjustment), comprising cash 
of £25 million and borrowings of £220 million. The borrowings comprise £220 million of high yield bonds (the Bonds), which are 
repayable on 1 June 2019 and are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants. 
On 29 March 2017, the Group announced it had commenced a Strategic Review, working with its advisers Rothschild and Ashurst LLP, 
to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Bonds. As a key part of this Strategic Review process, the Board has 
engaged with its major stakeholders, including shareholders, holders of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and the Pensions Regulator.
On 10 October 2017, the Board announced that it was approaching its largest bondholders regarding the formation of an ad hoc 
committee of bondholders (the ‘Bondholder Committee’) to consider in greater detail certain potential amendments to the Group's  
capital structure. On 2 November 2017, the Group confirmed that the Bondholder Committee had been formed. The main objectives  
of these potential amendments to the Group's capital structure, combined with certain proposed amendments to the Group's pension 
scheme, are to (i) achieve a sustainable level of debt within the Group to enable it to refinance its debt in the future, and (ii) materially 
reduce or eliminate the pension scheme deficit by 2021, whilst preserving the pension scheme members' benefits. On 1 February 2018,  
the date of our last trading update, the Board confirmed that discussions with advisers to the Bondholder Committee were in progress. 46
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Governance
The Group continues to explore these potential amendments to its capital structure with advisers to the Bondholder Committee  
and the Board is satisfied with the continued support of the Group's major stakeholders during the review process. Any proposal  
that results from these discussions will remain subject to negotiation and the consent of relevant stakeholders, and there can be no 
certainty that a formal proposal will be forthcoming. In the event that consensual amendments to the Group’s capital structure cannot 
be agreed with relevant stakeholders, alternative options for the restructuring or refinancing of the Bonds prior to their maturity in June 
2019 will be explored as part of the ongoing Strategic Review process.
The Group has performed a review of its financial resources taking into account, inter alia, the cash currently available to the Group, the 
absence of financial maintenance covenants in the Bonds, and the Group’s cash flow projections for the thirteen month period from the 
date of this report to 1 June 2019, and, based on this review, and after considering reasonably possible trading downside sensitivities and 
uncertainties, the Board is of the opinion that, subject to the material uncertainty surrounding the repayment of the Bonds on 1 June 
2019 (referred to below), the Group has adequate financial resources to meet its operational cash flow requirements for the  
next thirteen months from the date of this report. The directors also anticipate that the Group will remain in a position to meet its 
obligations in respect of the Bonds, including with regard to the payment of interest, in the period prior to their maturity. 
However, given the challenges faced by the newspaper and printing industry as a whole, the current trading experience of the Group, 
and the likely financial position of the Group at the time the Bonds are due for repayment in June 2019, there is material uncertainty 
surrounding the Group’s ability to refinance the Bonds at par in the market on commercially acceptable terms. Failure to repay, 
refinance, satisfy or otherwise retire the Bonds at their maturity would give rise to a default under the indenture governing the Bonds 
dated 16 May 2014, and this possibility indicates a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern and if the Strategic Review does not deliver a solution for the Group it may be unable to realise its assets and 
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, taking into account that (i) the Strategic Review is ongoing, (ii) the Group has adequate 
financial resources to meet its operational cash flow requirements for the thirteen month period from the date of this report, and  
(iii) the Group is, and is anticipated to remain, in a position to meet its obligations in respect of the Bonds in the period prior to their 
maturity, the Directors have concluded it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Viability Statement
Provision C.2.2. of the Corporate Governance Code requires directors to assess the prospects of a business over a period of time  
longer than the 12 months typically required to determine the going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements  
of a business. The directors have previously determined that the period of three years from the balance sheet date is appropriate for  
the purposes of conducting this review. This period was selected with reference to the Group’s strategy and planning cycle. The Board 
formally reviews strategy twice a year, normally in May and September, with a view to informing the subsequent annual budget setting. 
The budget forms year one of the three year plan, with projections for years two and three. A three year plan for the Group covering the 
period 2018 to 2020 was considered by the board initially in September 2017 and, subsequently, in April 2018.
In light of the ongoing Strategic Review to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Bonds, the directors  
have reconsidered the period over which they can reasonably assess the Group’s viability. As noted in the review of Liquidity and Going 
Concern on page 45, there is a material uncertainty surrounding the Group’s ability to refinance the Bonds, which are repayable in full  
on 1 June 2019 and are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants, at par in the market on commercially acceptable terms. 
Failure to repay, refinance, satisfy or otherwise retire the Bonds at their maturity would give rise to a default under the indenture 
governing the bonds dated 16 May 2014, and this possibility indicates a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and if the Strategic Review does not deliver a solution for the Group it may be unable  
to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Given that it is not currently possible to determine the Group’s capital structure beyond June 2019 (which will determine, inter alia,  
the term, cost, financial maintenance covenants (if any) and quantum of any borrowings, and the level of contributions to the pension 
scheme), it is not possible for the Board to comment on the Group's ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due beyond June 2019 and the directors have therefore concluded that it is necessary to shorten the viability assessment period to  
the thirteen month period from the date of this report to 1 June 2019, in line with the period of the going concern review on page 45.  
On this basis, and acknowledging the material uncertainty around the repayment, refinancing, satisfaction or other retirement of the 
Bonds in June 2019, the Board confirms that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 1 June 2019.
Whilst it is not possible for the Board to comment on its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due beyond 
June 2019, as noted above, the Group has continued to produce a three year plan for the Group for the period covering 2018 to 2020  
as part of the Group’s normal strategic planning cycle on the assumption that the Group can secure an appropriate restructuring or 
refinancing of the Bonds on, or before, 1 June 2019.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED 47
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
In setting the annual budget and three year plan for 2018 to 2020 the Board considered the current trading position and the principal 
operating and financial risks and opportunities identified by the Group. In particular:
• The opportunity to invest and grow its audiences and its digital revenue streams;
• The ability of the Group to continue to reduce costs, to mitigate the continuing decline in print-based circulation and advertising 
revenues; and
• The level of capital expenditure required to support investment in growth, and the level of restructuring costs needed to support 
further cost reduction initiatives.
In reviewing its three year plan, the Group conducted sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of the combination of a reduction in 
digital advertising growth rates, an additional decline in other revenue streams and shortfalls in cost savings. As a result of these 
sensitivities the business would be cash consumptive, before taking mitigating actions. The Board has identified a number of mitigating 
actions that could be taken, if necessary, in order to preserve the Group’s liquidity, including reductions in capex, restructuring and 
property disposals. In the three year plan the Group has assumed that there would be no reduction in interest payments and pension 
contributions post June 2019. The future assessments and plans adopted by the Board are subject to  
change and a level of market uncertainty. As a result of the risks and uncertainties faced by the business (including those outlined  
in the Principal Risks & Uncertainties section on pages 20 to 21) the outcomes reflected in its plan cannot be guaranteed. 
The Group’s trading performance in 2017 reflected continuing declines in local print advertising and newspaper sales, being only partially 
offset by a substantial improvement in the performance of the i newspaper (driven by both National print advertising and print 
circulation revenues), strengthening digital revenue (excluding classifieds) and cost savings.
The three year plan for 2018 to 2020 demonstrates that, with no reduction in financing costs and pension contributions (refer to the 
financial review on page 23), the operations remain profitable and cash generative. Whilst declines in local print advertising and local 
newspaper sales revenue are expected to continue over this period, further strong growth in both the profitability of the i newspaper 
brand and digital revenue (excluding classifieds) is expected to continue which, along with additional cost savings, should help  
maintain profitability. 48

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. The Audit Committee’s terms of 
reference include all matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the Code. The terms of reference are considered 
annually by the Audit Committee and are approved by the Board. A copy of the current terms of reference is available on the Company’s 
website.
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein;
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls and the Group’s internal control and risk management systems 
and making proposals to the Board as to the need, or otherwise, for changes to those systems;
• making recommendations to the Board, for a resolution to be put to the shareholders for their approval in a general meeting, on  
the appointment of the external Auditor and the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;
• reviewing and monitoring the external Auditors’ independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking  
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;
• reviewing (with subsequent reporting to the Board) of the conclusions of the Group’s external Auditor in its annual audit and review  
of the half-year results. These reviews include discussion of any control weaknesses or issues identified by the Auditor;
• developing and implementing the Group’s policy on the engagement of the external Auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into 
account relevant guidance regarding provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm;
• reviewing the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting 
or other areas; and
• monitoring the risk assessment process involving all senior managers of the Group’s businesses in addition to the Executive Directors.
The Group’s Risk Matrix is reviewed on a regular basis throughout the year by the local operational and senior management. Risks  
are examined at regular executive meetings both locally and at Group level at the Executive Management Committee. These risk 
assessment sessions are held at each operation and allow for the risk identified to be evaluated and addressed. The results of these 
assessments are addressed in the Executive Directors’ reports to the Board. During 2017, the areas which senior management 
considered included: Group strategy, customer care metrics, talent and human resources, staff engagement, newsprint, editorial 
reorganisation, local advertising sales, national advertising sales, display and classified advertising categories, sales force restructuring  
and its implementation, revenue growth and digital strategy, management resources and reorganisation, newspaper sales, property 
(including disposals and property relocations) and financing requirements.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action or 
improvement is needed and making recommendations on the steps to be taken. The Committee’s Terms of Reference permit  
it to oversee the selection process for appointing a new Auditor should it determine, or it becomes necessary, to do so.
Composition of the Audit Committee
The Committee is normally comprised of three independent Non-Executive Directors.
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee was chaired by Mike Butterworth, a Chartered Accountant, who is considered by the Board 
to have recent and relevant financial experience and expertise for that role, and fulfils the requirement that the Committee includes  
at least one financially qualified member. All Audit Committee members are expected to be financially literate. Camilla Rhodes and  
Kjell Aamot, both of whom hold or have previously held board and/or executive management level posts in major media organisations, 
are also members. Details of each Director can be found on pages 38 and 39.
Membership of the Committee is reviewed at regular intervals by the Chairman of the Committee and the Chairman of the Board  
(who is not normally a member of the Audit Committee, although Camilla Rhodes currently occupies the role of Interim Chair). 49
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Meetings
The Audit Committee is required to meet not less than three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the Group’s financial 
calendar. The agenda is predominantly cyclical and is therefore approved by the Audit Committee Chairman on behalf of his fellow 
members. Each Audit Committee member has the right to require reports on relevant matters of interest in addition to the cyclical items.
The Audit Committee meetings are attended by the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Head of Finance at the invitation of the 
Committee, and the Company Secretary, who acts as secretary to the Committee, with minutes being circulated to all Committee 
members. The Chairman, other non-executive directors and Chief Executive Officer are also invited to attend for relevant sections  
of the Committee’s meetings or if required to do so by the Committee. Towards the close of relevant meetings, all executives (with  
the exception of the Company Secretary) leave in order for the Committee to have appropriate discussion with the external auditor  
(who also attends by invitation). The Audit Committee Chairman also has one or more private meetings with the external audit partner 
during the course of the year to discuss any relevant issues.
The External Auditor is invited to attend each Audit Committee meeting to discuss and agree the audit programme for the forthcoming 
year, together with any proposed non-audit work. In November the external auditors present their audit plan, in April the findings  
from the year-end audit are shared and in July half-year review findings are presented. Any significant non-audit work by the auditor  
is approved by the Committee (or by the Committee Chairman on its behalf) in advance of any engagement letter being signed.
Overview of the actions taken by the Audit Committee to discharge its duties
One of the scheduled meetings in 2017 was held during (and considered) the year-end audit and one was held during (and considered) 
the interim review. Three of the meetings during 2017 considered reports on the Group’s system of internal controls. These, together with 
the system in operation, are described in the internal control section of the Annual Report.
At its third meeting of the year the Committee carried out a review of the Group’s key business risks and amendments to its system of 
reviewing and monitoring risk. The Committee is actively involved in the ongoing review of risk and internal controls by the main Board. 
For additional information see the section on internal control on page 44.
In considering the financial statements for the period ended 30 December 2017, the following significant issues were addressed:
• going concern and longer-term viability statement (see ‘Liquidity and Going Concern’ and ‘Viability Statement’ on pages 45 to 47);
• publishing titles valuation and impairment (in particular whether any impairment was required as a consequence of anticipated 
reduced EBITDA for publishing titles);
• press valuation and impairment (in particular whether any impairment was required as a consequence of the loss of contribution 
from changes relating to contract print arrangements at one print site);
• pension obligations and valuations (including the assumption underlying the valuation of the Company’s pension scheme deficit 
under IAS19);
• alternative performance (non-GAAP) measures (‘APMs’) and in particular the details of reconciliation between figures forming part  
of the statutory results and APMs which are used as the focus for operational discussion in the strategic and operational performance 
summary in the Annual Report;
• changes to relevant accounting standard with the forthcoming introduction of IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments), IFRS 15 (Revenue from 
contracts with customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) being considered;
• internal controls and risk management systems (see ‘Principal Risks and Uncertainties’ on pages 20 and 21 and ‘Internal Control’  
on page 44;
• matters identified relating to prior years and prior period restatements. These related to the calculation of, and disclosures in relation 
to certain matters. Where relevant, the restatements have been reflected in the financial statements and are described in the relevant 
notes thereto; and
• accounting policies and ensuring that these are specific and relevant to the business; and
• in considering the Company financial statements for the period ended 30 December 2017, the following significant issues were 
addressed: the recoverability of intercompany debtors and the valuation of investments in subsidiaries compared to the value  
in use of the Group and adjustments to intercompany balances across the Group.
Papers in relation to each of these topics were presented to the Audit Committee by management, or else addressed in management 
reports to the Audit Committee and also provided to the Auditor for their consideration and opinion. Prior to presenting papers  
in respect of each of these topics, where appropriate, management have consulted members of the Committee, and in particular  
the Chairman of the Committee, and taken account of their views in formulating their position. These papers were subsequently 
discussed at meetings of the Audit Committee which considered the issues raised and, following discussion between the Committee 
members, taking account of the treatment proposed by management and the views of the auditors, made a final recommendation  
on their treatment to the Board as part of its process of approving the Company’s financial statements.
Other matters considered included the receipt and consideration of reports concerning cyber security, information technology 
(including IT systems resilience) the Group’s tax strategy, structural changes to the Group, accounting for the disposal of the Group’s 
former titles in East Anglia and the East Midlands, property (including assets held for sale), intercompany reconciliations, the impairment 
of assets and certain technical updates. 50

External Auditor
At the meeting to review the Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee formally considers the non-audit services provided by the 
Group’s external Auditor and the effectiveness of the audit process. It is the Company’s policy that any non-audit work to be performed 
by the Auditor, where fees on a cumulative basis exceed £50,000 in any financial year, must be approved by the Audit Committee.  
The Group’s policy requires that services and/or advice that require auditing are not undertaken by the external Auditor. If non-audit  
fees for a financial year exceed the audit related fees for a year, then Board approval must be given. Where appropriate, non-audit work 
for which the Auditor is considered is the subject of an appropriate tender exercise.
To assess the effectiveness of the external Auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed the:
• arrangements for ensuring the external Auditor’s independence and objectivity;
• external Auditor’s fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and any variations from the plan;
• robustness and perceptiveness of the Auditor in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
• content of the external Auditor’s reporting on internal control.
The Committee oversaw the appointment of Deloitte LLP in 2002 and has a primary responsibility for the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of the Auditor. The Committee conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Committee’s performance, including the 
external audit process as part of its work during the year. The evaluation was conducted through each member of the Committee (together 
with certain members of senior management who are involved in the Committee’s work) being invited to complete a questionnaire 
regarding the workings of the Committee and in particular its establishment, membership and appointment; conduct of its meetings; 
internal control and risk management systems; oversight of internal control and of the external audit process. The evaluation also addresses 
the skills, experience and training of the Committee, the Committee’s relationship with the Board, and it oversight of business and financial 
reporting and of whistleblowing arrangements. The Committee reviewed the Auditor’s plan for the year, noting the role of the senior 
statutory audit partner and key audit staff, the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit, if there were any conflicts of interest 
and the extent of non-audit services provided by the Auditor. The Company’s Auditor may be engaged to undertake non-audit work  
in limited circumstances when it is considered beneficial, in the opinion of the Committee, that their knowledge and/or expertise are 
deployed by the Company. Non-audit related services provided in 2017 consisted of work supporting a shareholder circular associated  
with the approval of the East Midlands disposal which completed in January 2017 and in respect of consulting services related to sales 
transformation. The fees were £0.3 million and £0.4 million. In 2017 audit fees represented 42% of total fees payable by the Company  
to Deloitte LLP. The Audit Committee has considered their policy in respect of non-audit fees and the appropriateness of Deloitte in 
performing this work and has concluded that Deloitte’s independence is not impaired and appropriate safeguards were put in place  
to ensure independence threats were addressed. The Committee considers that there are clear benefits to the Company in continuity  
of the identity of the external auditor during a period of significant change in the business and while the Strategic Review is ongoing.  
There are no contractual obligations on the Company which would restrict the choice of external Auditor.
Commencing 1 January 2017 the Group appointed KPMG to assist with tax compliance matters. The Committee is satisfied that the 
objectivity and independence of the external audit has been safeguarded.
In December 2017 the Company was advised by the Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) that it had been selected, amongst a number  
of other companies, to be considered as part of a thematic review of the report and accounts of smaller and AIM listed Companies.  
The Company was advised by the FRC that their review would focus on the Company’s disclosures in respect of tax and pensions  
in its Annual Report and Accounts for 2017 (together with any information necessary to give appropriate context). The Company  
has taken account of this review in preparing the relevant disclosures.
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Directors will be proposing the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as external  
auditor at the Annual General Meeting in 2018. In making that recommendation, the Committee considered the performance  
of the external Auditor in previous years and took account of their knowledge of the Group and of the fact that the Group remains  
in a considerable period of change, through which continuity of Auditor was felt to be important. The audit partner rotated at the 
commencement of the 2017 interim review with a new audit partner, Katie Houldsworth, appointed to replace David Bell as senior 
statutory audit partner. This role will continue to rotate every five years, subject to Deloitte LLP’s ongoing appointment. Although  
the Company has no current plans to retender the contract for audit services it reserves the right to do so and will comply with  
a requirement to retender such contract to which it is or may be subject in the future. The Company anticipates that it would do  
so by inviting tenders from a number of suitably qualified and experienced audit providers and would provide those parties with  
access to members of the Committee and to senior members of the Company’s management.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the period ended 30 December 2017. In this year’s report, I will provide 
an update on the remuneration of the Executive Directors over the last twelve months with details of the annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plan (‘LTIP’) outcomes for 2017 plus the usual tables providing additional information on directors’ shareholding and other 
information as required by legislation. Details of directors’ contract dates and terms were provided in last year’s remuneration policy.
2017 Remuneration Policy
The Company's Remuneration Policy (‘the Policy’) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2017. Following 
shareholder consultation prior to the shareholder vote, the Company announced on 15 May 2017 that certain undertakings would be made 
as to how that Policy would be operated.
The Policy is based on a typical UK plc structure which provides for a base salary, modest benefits, a pension contribution, an annual bonus 
and awards of free shares made under the Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) which vest after three years, subject to performance conditions.
As mentioned above, following consultation with our shareholders and taking into account the challenges the Company is facing,  
the Committee agreed to certain undertakings with regard to the operation of the policy, namely:
• No awards of restricted shares would be granted to the Executive Directors over the life of the approved Policy;
• No awards of performance shares would be granted to the Executive Directors in 2017;
• The maximum annual bonus potential would be 120% of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for the CFO; and
• One third of any bonus payable under the new Policy shall be deferred for a period of three years, other than in  
exceptional circumstances.
These undertakings apply as long as the 2017 Policy remains in force, unless otherwise agreed by Company's shareholders.
The Policy was published in the 2016 Annual Report and has not been reprinted in this year’s Annual Report. The 2016 Annual Report  
is available on the Company’s website at http://www.johnstonpress.co.uk/investors/reportsresults-presentations. The undertakings with 
regard to the operation of the Policy were announced by way of a public RNS statement issued by the Company on 15 May 2017.
2017 performance and incentive outcome
The 2017 annual incentive scheme for Executive Directors was structured in a way that maintained focus on financial performance,  
with measures of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted total Group revenue, Media Sales Centre (‘MSC’) revenue,  
and adjusted Digital Advertising revenue. The scheme also included a strategic objective relating to progress during the year by  
the Company towards achieving a sound financial base (the ‘Strategic Objective’). 
Adjusted EBITDA performance was above the threshold target, resulting in a payment for this adjusted measure. Likewise, targets in 
respect of adjusted EBITDA margin, and MSC revenue were also exceeded. However, performance in respect of adjusted total Group 
revenue and adjusted digital advertising revenue were not sufficient to trigger the payment of bonus in respect of those measures. The 
Committee made a careful assessment of the performance by the Executive Directors against the measures used to assess the Strategic 
Objective. They concluded that a payment of 20% out of a possible 25% was merited in respect of that measure.
As a result of this performance over the period, bonuses of 58.0% and 48.3% of salary were earned by the CEO and CFO. In accordance 
with the Policy, one third of the bonus will be deferred for three years. Having taken advice, the Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s current lack of distributable reserves (and therefore its inability to lawfully fund the acquisition of shares in the Company  
in order to satisfy the deferral of bonus in shares) represents exceptional circumstances and, as such, deferral of this element of bonus 
payment for 2017 shall be in cash.
Following the determination by the Committee of the bonus payable in respect of 2017, the Executive Directors voluntarily proposed 
that the remaining two-thirds of that bonus also be deferred in cash until such time as the Committee was satisfied that a sound 
financial base for the Company had been achieved. The Committee has accepted this proposal and as such I can report that all  
of the bonus payable in respect of 2017 has been deferred and that no bonus will immediately become payable.
As part of the terms of his recruitment, the CEO was granted a matching award in December 2014. Part of this award vested and further 
details are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Governance
Implementation of policy and quantum for 2018
Base salaries were last increased on 1 January 2015. No review was conducted in January 2018 and the Committee reserves the right  
to undertake one later in the year if it deems it appropriate.
The Committee believes in the importance of the link between pay and performance. For the bonus structure for 2018, 40% of the 
opportunity will be based on EBITDA targets, 30% on group and digital revenue targets and 30% on key strategic objectives. The CEO's 
maximum opportunity will be set at 120% of base salary and the CFO's at 100% of base salary.
Given the ongoing Strategic Review being conducted by the Directors relating to the assessment of the financing options open to the 
Group with regard to the £220 million 8.625% senior secured notes, which become due for repayment on 1 June 2019, the Committee 
has decided, as in 2017, that no long-term incentive awards will be made in 2018 prior to a resolution of the Group’s financing options. 
The Committee will keep this under review and may decide that it is appropriate to resume the granting of long-term incentive awards 
post the resolution of the Strategic Review.
There will be an advisory vote on the Remuneration Report at the 2018 AGM and I hope you will be able to support this resolution.
Yours sincerely,
Camilla Rhodes
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Act’) and also in accordance with the requirement of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority. The Remuneration Policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and recent guidance from UK institutional shareholders, the Investment Association and ISS.

The Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ fees were last reviewed in 2008 and have not been increased since then. The current  
fee levels at the start of 2018 are:
• Interim Chairman’s fee of £130,000 p.a.; and

Non-Executive Directors’ fees for 2018 will be payable quarterly in arrears.
Benefits and pension
Benefits are provided in line with the Policy.
Ashley Highfield receives, annually, a pension contribution of 25% of his base salary and is entitled to a match of any individual 
contributions up to 5% of salary. David King receives a pension contribution of 12% of his base salary.
Annual bonus
In 2018, the annual bonus maximum opportunity is 120% of salary for Ashley Highfield and 100% of salary for David King.  
The 2018 bonus will be governed by the rules of the Company's Annual Bonus Plan and Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The bonus metrics and weightings for the two Executive Directors are provided below. Financial measures are based on 
adjusted results.

Strategic objectives 30%
Total 100%
Should the minimum level target not be achieved for adjusted EBITDA, the amount payable in respect of other measures will be  
halved, irrespective of achievement of the relevant targets for those measures. The strategic element is based on further progress  
by the end of the financial year towards the achievement of a sound financial base for the Group.
The targets and strategic objectives themselves are deemed to be commercially sensitive and will not be disclosed prospectively. 
However, the Committee will seek to provide retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them in next year’s 
remuneration report.
One third of any bonus earned will be deferred for a period of three years. The Committee will determine at the relevant time  
whether exceptional circumstances exist permitting any such deferral to be in cash.
Clawback provisions will apply in accordance with the approved Policy.

Membership of the Remuneration Committee
Camilla Rhodes has been Chair of the Committee since the 2013 AGM. The members of the Committee throughout 2017 are  
listed in the table below. All members of the Committee are Independent Non-Executive Directors. No Director plays a part  
in any decision-making directly relating to their own remuneration.
The members of the Committee and their year of appointment to the Committee were:
Name
Year of 
appointment
Camilla Rhodes (Chair) 2010
Mike Butterworth 2016
Kjell Aamot 2016
During 2017, the Committee met on eight occasions. At those meetings, the Committee considered the following topics:
• Executive Directors' base salaries for the coming year;
• The targets and quantum of annual performance-related bonuses for Executive Directors;
• The vesting outcome of the Group’s long-term incentive schemes;
• Performance against the annual bonus plan targets for 2016;
• Corporate governance developments and market trends in remuneration;
• The possible operation of the Performance Share Plan in 2018;
• 2018 Annual Bonus Scheme design.
The Committee has the delegated responsibility for reviewing the Board policy on remuneration for the Executive Management 
Committee (which includes the two Executive Directors) and setting all aspects of remuneration, including the total remuneration 
package for all Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which were reviewed in 2017, set out the responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee and  
are available on the Company’s website and on request.
Advice to the Committee
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interest arising from cross 
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. Other Directors attend meetings when invited by the Committee and 
the Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee. The Group HR Director and its HR Reward Director also 
attend meetings by invitation. No Director plays a part in any decisions about his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year by New Bridge Street (‘NBS’), a trading name of Aon plc. Neither NBS nor 
any other part of Aon plc provided other services to the Company during 2017. NBS attended three of the meetings of the Committee 
during the year and provided advice on a wide range of issues. Total NBS fees incurred for advising the Remuneration Committee in 
2017 were £45,119 excluding VAT. NBS also provided share plan implementation services to the Company. The terms of engagement 
between the Company and NBS are displayed on the Company’s website. NBS are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and are signatories to its Code of Conduct.
The Committee monitors the relationship with external advisers on a regular basis and remains confident that NBS is independent and 
that no conflicts of interest exist.

1 Benefits for the Executive Directors included healthcare insurance, car allowance, telephone and life assurance.
2 One third of bonus is deferred for three years under the Policy. Unless exceptional circumstances apply such deferral will normally be in shares. The Committee is 
satisfied that the Company’s current lack of distributable reserves constitutes exceptional circumstances for these purposes and that one third of the bonus payable 
in respect of 2017 shall be deferred in cash. Following the decision by the Committee to award bonuses in respect of 2017 the Executive Directors have volunteered 
(and the Committee have agreed) that the remaining two thirds of bonus be deferred in cash until such time as the Committee is satisfied that a sound financial 
base for the Company had been achieved. The Committee has accepted this proposal and as a consequence all of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors  
in respect of 2017 has been deferred.
3 The Total (Received Value) column in this table reflects the value of all remuneration for the year which the Executive Directors have received. It excludes the value  
of the 2017 bonus, all of which has been deferred.
4 The Total figure includes a value for long-term incentives which have vested based upon the share price applicable on the date of vesting. Those vested awards have 
not been exercised and in the event of the award being exercised the value of it may be different to the value shown above. The Total figure also includes the earned 
element of the 2017 bonus, even if it has been deferred.
5 Includes fees for interim chairmanship and chairing of the Remuneration Committee.
6 Jamie Buchan joined the Board on 1 June 2017 .
7 Mike Butterworth joined the Board on 1 June 2016. Includes fees for his role as interim Senior Independent Director and Chair of Audit Committee.

Directors’ Governance
The Strategic Objectives measure relates to a bonus objective set for the executive directors for 2017 relating to the achievement of  
progress towards the establishment of a sound financial basis for the Company. In setting criteria to measure progress, the Committee 
acknowledged that it was not anticipated that this objective would be completed in 2017. It therefore set out a number of individual 
criteria and milestones which incentivised the executive directors to explore available options and work with relevant stakeholders  
on potential solutions while at all times having regard to the best interests of the Group as a whole and to all of its stakeholders.  
On 29 March 2017, the Group announced it had commenced a strategic review, working with its advisers Rothschild and Ashurst LLP,  
to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Group’s Bonds. As a key part of this Strategic Review process, the Board 
has engaged with its major stakeholders, including shareholders, holders of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and the Pensions Regulator. 
On 10 October 2017, the Board announced that it was approaching its largest bondholders regarding the formation of an ad hoc 
committee of bondholders (‘the Bondholder Committee’) to consider in greater detail certain potential amendments to the Group's 
capital structure. On 2 November 2017, the Group confirmed that the Bondholder Committee had been formed. The main objectives  
of these potential amendments to the Group's capital structure, combined with certain proposed amendments to the Group's pension 
scheme, are to: (i) achieve a sustainable level of debt within the Group to enable it to refinance its debt in the future, and (ii) materially 
reduce or eliminate the pension scheme deficit by 2021, whilst preserving the pension scheme members' benefits. On 1 February 2018, 
the date of the Company’s last trading update, the Board confirmed that discussions with advisers to the Bondholder Committee were 
in progress.
The Group continues to explore these potential amendments to its capital structure with advisers to the Bondholder Committee  
and the Board is satisfied with the continued support of the Group's major stakeholders during the review process. Having considered 
progress against the criteria which it set, the Committee was satisfied that an award of 20% (out of a potential 25%) of bonus potential 
was merited in respect of the Strategic Objective.
One third of the resulting bonus is deferred for three years under the Policy. Unless exceptional circumstances apply such deferral  
will normally be made in shares in the Company. The Committee is satisfied that the Company’s current lack of distributable reserves 
constitutes exceptional circumstances for these purposes and have agreed that deferral of one third of bonus payable in respect of 2017 
shall be in cash for three years.
Following the decision by the Committee to award bonuses in respect of 2017 the Executive Directors have volunteered (and the 
Committee has agreed) that the remaining two thirds of that bonus shall be deferred in cash until such time as the Committee is 
satisfied that a sound financial base for the Company had been achieved. As such the entire bonus awarded to Executive Directors 
in respect of 2017 has been deferred.
The Remuneration Committee believes the bonus outcome for 2017 is a fair reflection of financial and strategic performance 
during the year.
Long-term incentives vesting in relation to performance ending in 2017
Awards were granted to Executive Directors in 2014 under the Value Creation Plan (‘VCP’). VCP awards were made in the form of 
premium-priced options, vesting based on stretching share price targets measured over a three-year performance period. As the targets 
were not met in 2017, the awards under this plan lapsed in full.
In accordance with his contract of employment as Chief Executive Officer, a matching award was made to Ashley Highfield in  
2014 under the Performance Share Plan, based on a voluntary investment of his 2013 bonus. The award was subject to EPS and TSR 
performance conditions measured over a three-year performance period, with 50% of the total award based on each. The TSR condition 
was not met and therefore this part of the award lapsed in full.
The EPS condition was based on growth in earnings using 2016 as the final year and 2013 as the base year for measurement. Adjusted EPS 
in 2013 was 12.3 pence, calculated using continuing underlying earnings (before exceptional items) of £13.0 million, divided by the number 
of ordinary shares in issue after the 2014 share consolidation. Adjusted EPS in 2016 was 16.6 pence, calculated on the same basis, using 
adjusted earnings of £17.6 million. Growth in EPS over the period, therefore, was 10.4% p.a. (compound); above the maximum vesting  
target for this element. The Committee is satisfied that the growth in EPS has been measured on a like-for-like basis.

Share grants in respect of bonus for 2013 were not made in 2014 because of prolonged restricted period, and were subsequently made on 26 May 2015 at the values 
shown in the table above. In respect of Awards for 2013, the ‘Date of Award’ reflects the date of the payment of the cash element of bonus (with the Deferred Share 
Bonus Award subsequently being made on 26 May 2015). Following an amendment to the scheme rules in 2018, awards may now be exercised up until the fifth 
anniversary of the date of award.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Johnston Press plc is incorporated as a public limited company and is registered in Scotland with the registered number 15382. 
Johnston Press plc’s registered office is Orchard Brae House, 30 Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2HS.
The Directors present the Annual Report and Accounts for the period ended 30 December 2017. References to ‘Johnston Press’, the 
‘Group’, and the ‘Company’, ‘we’ or ‘our’ are to Johnston Press plc or to Johnston Press and its subsidiary companies where appropriate.
Pages 60 to 64, inclusive of this Annual Report, comprise the Directors’ Report that has been drawn up and presented in accordance 
with relevant company law and the liabilities of the Directors in connection with that report shall be subject to the limitations and 
restrictions provided by such law.
Details of significant events since the balance sheet date are contained in Note 32 to the financial statements. An indication of likely 
developments in the business of the Company and details of research and development activities are included in the Strategic Report. 
Information on the Company’s policy for the employment of disabled persons and action taken in relation to employee involvement  
are addressed in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Strategic Report. The Company has no branches outside the 
United Kingdom.
Forward-looking statements
This Annual Report and Accounts contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group. By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
that may or may not occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking 
statements are reasonable as they can be affected by a wide range of variables. The forward-looking statements reflect the knowledge 
and information available at the date of preparation of this Annual Report and Accounts and will not be updated during the year. 
Nothing in this Annual Report and Accounts should be construed as a profit forecast.
Dividends
No interim dividend was paid on the Company’s ordinary shares and the Directors recommend no final dividend for the period.  
The dividend (the ‘Preference Dividend’) payable on the Company’s 13.75% preference shares and 13.75% ‘A’ preference shares (together 
the ‘Preference Shares’) was paid in June 2016. Due to the Company lacking distributable reserves the Preference Dividend was not paid  
in December 2016, June 2017 or December 2017. The Company’s Articles of Association provide that if, as at the date of notice convening 
a general meeting of the Company, the Preference Dividend is in arrears each holder of Preference Shares shall be entitled to attend 
and have one vote on a show of hands, or one vote on a poll for each £1 nominal value of Preference Share capital held by them.
Share capital and capital structure
Details of the issued share capital, together with details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital are shown in Note 25.  
The Company’s issued ordinary share capital was 105,877,777 shares at 30 December 2017 and there were no changes during the period.
As part of the refinancing completed on 28 August 2009, the Company issued warrants over 5.0% of its issued share capital to  
the Group’s lenders at that time, exercisable at any time over the five-year period ended 27 August 2014 (the ‘First Issue Warrants’).  
As part of the refinancing completed on 24 April 2012: (i) the exercise period for the First Issue Warrants was extended to 30 September 
2017 (the ‘Warrant Expiry Date’), (ii) the Company issued further warrants over just under 2.5% of its issued share capital to the Group’s 
lenders at that time (the ‘Second Issue Warrants’) and (iii) the Company undertook that on or before 30 September 2012, and  
subject to receiving all necessary shareholder approvals, authorisations and powers, it would issue further warrants over just under  
an additional 5.0% of its issued share capital as at 23 April 2012 to the Group’s lenders at that time (the ‘Third Issue Warrants’).  
The Third Issue Warrants were subsequently issued on 25 September 2012. Each of the First Issue Warrants, Second Issue Warrants  
and Third Issue Warrants (together the ‘Warrants’) were adjusted in 2014 in accordance with their terms to take account of the capital 
refinancing plan and share capital re-organisation which were both undertaken that year and constituted Adjustment Events under  
the terms of the relevant Warrant Instruments. Each Warrant comprised the right to subscribe for 0.15338 ordinary shares at a price  
of 197.45 pence per ordinary share at any time prior to the Warrant Expiry Date. During the period no Warrants were exercised. At the 
balance sheet date no warrants were outstanding.
The Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings of the Company. Each of the Company’s two classes of redeemable cumulative Preference Shares carry 13.75% interest but do 
not carry voting rights other than when dividends payable in respect of such shares are in arrears. The percentage of the issued nominal 
value of the ordinary shares is 0.91% of the total issued nominal value of all share capital.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general  
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders  
of the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. At its Annual General Meeting  
in 2017 a special resolution was passed by shareholders authorising the Company to make purchases of Ordinary Shares in the capital  
of the Company, subject to certain conditions and up to a maximum number of 10,587,777 shares. No acquisition of Ordinary Shares  
was made by the Company during the year or in the period since 30 December 2017.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in Note 29. 61

Directors’ Governance
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED
Employee involvement
It is the policy of the Group to encourage and develop all members of staff to realise their maximum potential. Wherever possible, 
vacancies are filled from within the Group and adequate opportunities for internal promotion are created. The Board is committed to  
a systematic training policy and the Company has a comprehensive training and development programme creating the opportunity  
for employees to maintain and improve their performance and to develop their potential to a maximum level of attainment. In  
this way, staff will make their best possible contribution to the organisation’s success. The Group supports the principle of equal 
opportunities in employment and opposes all forms of unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of race, age, nationality,  
religion, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, gender or gender reassignment, marital status or disability. It is also the policy  
of the Group, where possible, to give sympathetic consideration to disabled persons in their application for employment with the  
Group and to protect the interests of existing members of the staff who are disabled.
Going concern
A full description of the Group’s business activities, financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, committed facilities and borrowing 
position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance and material uncertainty, is set out in  
the Strategic Report, particularly the Financial Review (page 23), the Liquidity and going concern (page 45), the Viability Statement  
(page 46) and in the notes to the financial statements. 
Financing policy and derivatives
The Group’s policies are set out in Notes 3, 21 and 31. These also include details of financial instruments and derivatives.
Change of control
Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes due in 2019 issued in May 2014 pursuant to the Notes Indenture (the ‘Bonds’) in the event 
of a change of control of the Group holders of the Bonds will have the right to require the Group to repurchase all or any part of the 
Bonds issued.
Environmental policy
The Board acknowledges that environmental protection is one of the Group’s business responsibilities. It aims for a continuous 
improvement in the Group’s environmental performance and to comply with all relevant regulations. A documented environmental 
policy to monitor performance and to take action where appropriate is in force.
Political contributions
There were no political donations made and no contributions made to non-EU political organisations.
Close company status
So far as the Directors are aware the Company is not a close company for taxation purposes.
Electronic voting
The Company has made provision for shareholders to vote electronically on the Resolutions to be considered at the Annual General 
Meeting and full instructions are included on the Form of Proxy, issued to shareholders with this Annual Report.
Special business
It is intended that five Resolutions (Resolutions 11 to 15) will be proposed as are set out under special business in the notice of this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Resolution 11 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution and the others as Special Resolutions requiring a 
majority of not less than 75% of votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. The full text of each Resolution will be set out in the Notice  
of Annual General Meeting which will be distributed to shareholders shortly.
The purpose of Resolution 11 is to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the Company. Paragraph (i) of Resolution 11 seeks 
authority to allot shares, and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company up to a maximum 
nominal amount representing approximately 33.33% of the existing issued ordinary share capital of the Company. The second part of 
Resolution 11, paragraph (ii) will also allow Directors to allot, including the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (i) of this Resolution, 
ordinary shares in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue to ordinary shareholders up to a maximum nominal 
amount representing approximately 66.67% of the Company’s existing ordinary share capital as at the latest practicable date prior to  
the publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting. The Directors anticipate using this power in connection with employee share 
schemes, and the authority, if approved, will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting in 2019. 63
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
The second resolution, Resolution 12 (which is the first of the four special resolutions), relates to the power given to the Directors to allot 
equity securities for cash without the statutory pre-emption provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) applying. In accordance 
with best practice guidelines, this authority is limited to allotments representing in total up to 5% of the existing issued ordinary share 
capital and to allotments in connection with a rights issue. Your Directors will continue to have due regard to institutional guidelines  
in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance consultation and explanation before making  
any non-pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this authority and in particular they do not intend to allot shares for cash on a non-pre-
emptive basis pursuant to this power in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued share capital of the Company in any rolling 
three-year period without prior consultation with shareholders in each case other than in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment (within the meaning of the Pre-Emption Group 2015 Statement of Principles, or any subsequent version of them) 
which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment (or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is 
disclosed in the announcement of the allotment). The current power (which is limited to 5% and which accords with normal practice), 
expires on the date of this year’s Annual General Meeting. The purpose of the resolution is to renew this power for a further year taking 
account of current institutional guidelines.
Resolution 13 seeks a further power from shareholders to allot equity securities for cash otherwise than to existing shareholders pro-rata 
to their holdings to reflect the Pre-emption Group 2015 Statement of Principles. The power will be limited to the allotment of equity 
securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value equal to 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at the latest 
practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice of Annual General Meeting. This is in addition to the five percent referred to in 
Resolution 12. The Directors will have due regard to the Statement of Principles in relation to any exercise of this power and confirm that 
they intend to use it only in connection with a transaction which they have determined to be an acquisition or offer capital investment 
which is announced contemporaneously with the announcement of the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding six month 
period and is disclosed in the announcements of the issue.
Resolution 14 will, if passed, give authority for the Company to make purchases of its own ordinary shares in the market. The Directors 
have no immediate intention of using such authority and would do so only if they consider it to be in the best interests of shareholders 
generally and that an improvement in earnings per share would result. This Resolution specifies the maximum number of ordinary 
shares which may be purchased (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s existing issued ordinary share capital) and the 
minimum and maximum prices at which they may be bought.
Resolution 15 is to permit the Company to call general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) on not less than 14 days’  
notice as permitted by the Act. The Directors believe that having authority to do so may, in some circumstances, assist with the efficient 
discharge of the Company’s business. The Company intends to continue to provide as much notice as practicable of general meetings 
and would normally use this authority only where it would be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP, the auditor of the Company, have expressed their willingness to continue in office. Upon the recommendation of  
the Audit Committee, resolutions to re-appoint them as the Company auditor and to authorise the Directors to determine their 
remuneration will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM. 64

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and the Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company  
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s and  
the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the financial and corporate governance information included on the 
Company’s website (www.johnstonpress.co.uk). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved  
confirms that:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge the:
1. financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
2. strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
3. Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the 
financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 30 December 2017 and of the group’s loss for the 52 week period  
then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting 
Standard (FRS) 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic  
of Ireland’; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Johnston Press plc (the ‘parent company’)  
and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise:
• the Group Income Statement;
• the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income;
• the Group Statement of Changes in Equity;
• the Group Statement of Financial Position;
• the Group Cash Flow Statement;
• the Company Balance Sheet;
• the Company Statement of Changes in Equity; and
• the related notes 1 to 39.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including  
FRS 102 ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’  
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs 
(UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described  
in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the 
Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC) Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, 
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We 
confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion.

Material uncertainty relating 
to going concern
We draw attention to page 45 in the financial statements, which highlights that there is  
material uncertainty surrounding the Group’s ability to refinance the Bonds at par in the market  
on commercially acceptable terms in June 2019 when they are due to be repaid. Management  
has set out that failure to repay, refinance, satisfy or otherwise retire the bonds at their maturity 
would give rise to a default under the indenture governing the bonds dated 16 May 2014 and  
could have a material impact on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
On 29 March 2017, the Group announced it had commenced a strategic review, working with  
its advisers, to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Bonds. As a  
key part of this strategic review process, the Board has engaged with its major stakeholders.  
Various options are currently being considered, as explained in more detail of page 81 in the 
financial statements.
As stated in Note 1, these events or conditions, along with the other matters as set forth  
in Note 1 to the financial statements, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may  
cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion  
is not modified in respect of this matter.
In response to this we:
• Engaged in regular discussions with the directors on the strategic review and the consideration 
of potential options;
• Assessed the design and implementation of the controls in place to address this key  
audit matter;
• Challenged the appropriateness of management’s forecasts such as checking the mechanical 
accuracy, assessing historical forecasting, performing sensitivity analysis and challenging the 
assumptions applied in management’s forecasts;
• Considered the consistency of management’s forecasts with other financial modelling such  
as the impairment models and the forecasting underlying the viability statement;
• Reviewed the terms of the bond to ensure consistency with the information disclosed; and
• Reviewed the wording of the going concern statement, including the material uncertainty,  
and assessed its consistency with management’s forecasts.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Impairment of publishing titles;
• carrying value of print presses;
• assumptions used in the calculation of the defined benefit pension liability;
• appropriate classification of adjusted items;
• the carrying value of intercompany and investments balances for Johnston Press plc’s company 
only financial statements; and
• appropriateness of the going concern assumption (see material uncertainty relating to going 
concern section above).
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters 
which are the same as the prior year identified with .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was £610,000 which was 
determined on the basis of considering a number of different measures including statutory  
loss before tax, statutory loss before tax before the impact of impairments and the change in  
fair value of the group’s borrowings, and adjusted profit before tax. This is a change from the prior 
year when materiality was determined on the basis of adjusted profit before tax and reflects the 
uncertain market environment for newspaper publishers and significant volatility in the results of 
the group as a result of impairments recognised in respect of intangible and tangible fixed assets 
and the changes in fair value of the borrowings.
Scoping The group consists of a collection of newspapers and print presses, entirely within the UK. Our 
scope includes the trade of all continuing operations and we perform our audit using a single 
audit team. This is detailed further below and is consistent with last year.
Significant changes 
in our approach
This year we have included three new key audit matters. The appropriateness of the going concern 
assumption has been elevated to a key audit matter as a result of the bond repayment date  
in June 2019, which is only 13 months from the date of this report. The appropriate classification  
of adjusted items has been elevated to a key audit matter due to the significant management 
judgement exercised around the presentation of alternative performance measures in this 
industry where significant restructuring is being undertaken. The carrying value of intercompany 
and investments balances for Johnston Press plc’s company only financial statements has been 
elevated to a key audit matter as a result of the effort and time incurred by the company and  
by ourselves in respect of this matter.

Conclusions relating to principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent 
with the knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained  
in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 20 to 21 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 44 that they have carried out a robust assessment of  
the principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 46 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and 
their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the 
group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in 
the audit.
Aside from the impact of  
the matters disclosed in  
the material uncertainty 
relating to going concern 
section, we confirm  
that we have nothing 
material to add or draw 
attention to in respect  
of these requirements.
Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in 
our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters 
included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation  
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
In addition to the matter described in the material uncertainty relating to going concern section, 
we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be 
communicated in our report.
Impairment of publishing titles 
Key audit matter description The group has £84.4 million of publishing titles held as intangible assets at 30 December 2017 
which have been generated through acquisitions of newspapers over the last twenty years. Given 
the uncertain market environment for newspaper publishers, there are inherent uncertainties in 
the modelling of future cash flows which require management to exercise judgement and could 
present the opportunity for manipulation.
Management have undertaken a detailed process to model their forecast cash flows. Key 
assumptions in the impairment model include a detailed cash flow forecast derived from the  
2018 budget and associated two year projections to 2020, a long term decline rate of 4% for all 
Johnston Press local title cash generating units (CGUs) (2016: 1-2% decline), a long term growth 
rate of 0% for the i (2016: 0%), the method of central cost allocation, the estimated decline of 
central costs and a post-tax discount rate of 11% (2016: 11%).
An impairment of £59.2 million has been recognised against intangibles for the year, and a further 
impairment of £4.4 million has been allocated to other fixed assets as a result of the intangibles  
in the South and Northwest CGUs now being fully impaired. The primary reason for further 
impairment in the current year was industry experience and analysis showing further decline  
than previously forecast.
We note that the Scotland and North CGUs have no headroom and, as such, any further unbudgeted 
decline in operational performance would lead to further impairment of publishing titles.
For further detail, refer to the publishing titles accounting policy in Note 3 of the financial 
statements, the critical accounting judgement in Note 4, the detail behind the intangible  
assets impairment review in Note 13 and the Report of the Audit Committee on page 48. 70

Financial Statements
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We evaluated management’s impairment calculations and have challenged their assumptions by:
• Assessing the design and implementation of the controls in place to address this key audit matter;
• Considering the sophistication, integrity and appropriateness of the discounted cash flow 
model used by management;
• Considering the identification of appropriate CGUs;
• Recalculating the discount rates applied to future cash flows, working with our internal 
valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the underlying calculations and assumptions;
• Reviewing and challenging management’s cash flow assumptions by obtaining evidence to 
support the revenue and cost assumptions, including those relating to central cost allocations, 
and by comparing assumed growth/decline rates and forecast cash flows against recent 
trading activity, historic trends and external industry analysis to assess the validity of the 
assumptions made;
• Performing sensitivity analysis based on risks within the cash flows and on the inputs applied 
(including discount rates and growth rates) to view whether reasonable fluctuations in these 
assumptions should be considered in determining the impairment recognised in the year;
• Considering the implied EBITDA multiple from the discounted cash flow model for local and 
national CGUs and comparing to recent market evidence of sales of publishing titles;
• Reviewing the mathematical accuracy of the model; and
• Considering the adequacy of the Group’s disclosure in respect of its impairment testing and 
whether the disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
reasonably possible changes in key assumptions properly reflected the risks inherent in such 
assumptions.
Key observations We concur with the level of impairment taken by management and note that the assumptions 
used in the impairment model, including the discount rate and long term decline rates,  
were acceptable.
Carrying value of print presses 
Key audit matter description The group owns three print presses in Dinnington, Portsmouth and Carn. There has been 
continued decline in printed newspaper circulation and advertising revenue and therefore 
management determined that this represented an indicator of impairment and consequently 
performed an impairment review.
An impairment of £0.8 million was recognised against the Carn press in the year. The closing 
carrying value of the three print presses is £18.7 million.
The directors’ assessment of the value-in-use of these presses involves making assumptions about 
future revenue and cost, short and long-term growth rates, cash generation, the identification of 
appropriate cash-generating units and the applicable post-tax discount rate. Given the uncertain 
market environment for publishers, there are inherent uncertainties in the modelling of future 
cash flows which require management to exercise judgement and could present the opportunity 
for manipulation.
Refer to the critical accounting judgement in Note 4, the property, plant and equipment note  
in Note 14 and the Report of the Audit Committee on page 48.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We evaluated management’s impairment calculations and have challenged their assumptions by:
• Assessing the design and implementation of the controls in place to address this key audit matter;
• Reviewing management’s rationale behind identifying an impairment trigger;
• Confirming that the impairment model used was consistent with the model used for the 
publishing titles, as detailed in the key audit matter above;
• Evaluating whether each print press represented its own CGU;
• Reviewing and challenging management’s cash flow assumptions by challenging growth 
assumptions and obtaining supporting evidence including new contracts;
• Reviewing the mathematical accuracy of the model;
• Comparing forecasted cash flows against recent trading activity, historic trends and external 
industry analysis;
• Evaluating whether it is appropriate to use the same discount rate as used in the impairment 
model for the publishing titles; and
• Reviewing management’s sensitivity analysis, and performing our own sensitivities based on 
risks within the cash flows to conclude whether reasonable fluctuations in these assumptions 
should increase the impairment.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF JOHNSTON PRESS PLC CONTINUED 71
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Key observations We concur with the level of impairment taken by management and note that the model used  
in the print presses impairment was appropriate.
Whilst external industry analysis shows decline in print revenue, we note that there is evidence  
of new contracts having been won over the course of the last year to support the value in use.
Assumptions used in the calculation of the defined benefit pension liability
Key audit matter description The net pension deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and as disclosed in Note 22 of the 
financial statements, has decreased in the year from £67.7 million to £47.2 million. The overall 
decrease in the net pension deficit is partly due to the increase in the fair value of plan assets from 
£547.9m at the beginning of the period to £561.4m at the end of the period. Furthermore, the 
gross pension liability has moved from £615.6 million to £608.6 million in the year. This comprises  
a £1.7 million increase due to changes in assumptions offset by a £8.6 million decrease due to 
benefits paid being more than the interest costs on the gross liabilities.
There is significant judgement involved in the valuation of the retirement benefit obligations, 
particularly in relation to determining the assumptions underlying the valuation of liabilities of the 
scheme, including mortality rates, the discount rate and inflation rates, which could present the 
opportunity for manipulation. Management include pension assumptions as a key source  
of estimation uncertainty in Note 4 of the accounts.
Refer to the valuation of pension liabilities critical accounting policy in Note 3, the disclosures around 
the retirement benefit obligation in Note 22 and the Report of the Audit Committee on page 48.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We evaluated the appropriateness of the principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of 
the Group’s pension commitments prepared by the Group’s actuary by using our internal actuarial 
experts. Our audit procedures included:
• Assessing the design and implementation of the controls in place to address this key audit matter;
• Assessing the methodology used to determine the gross liability;
• Benchmarking and challenging the assumptions for discount rates, mortality rates and inflation 
rates against a relevant comparator group; and
• Performing procedures on the completeness and accuracy of the underlying membership data.
Key observations The assumptions are deemed to be within an acceptable range, albeit at the optimistic end of 
what we would find acceptable.
We note that a lower smoothing parameter (6.5) has been adopted for FY17. A lower smoothing 
factor places more weight on recent years’ mortality experience when deriving projections  
for future longevity improvements. At 30 December 2017, this leads to lower forecast life 
expectancies than a higher smoothing parameter. Standard market practice is to use the  
default factor of 7.5. However, we have agreed that the parameter is appropriate; we would  
find a factor in the range 6.5 to 8.5 acceptable.
Appropriate classification of adjusted items
Key audit matter description The group presents alternative performance measures to provide supplemental information to 
enable users of the financial statements to gain an understanding of underlying trading results  
of the group. Current year items relating to restructuring, acquisitions and disposals, impairment  
of assets, the ongoing strategic review, pensions and the LTIP scheme are material and have  
been treated as adjusting items with regards to their disclosure, as disclosed and discussed  
by management on page 138 onwards. The total impact of these is to move the Group from  
a statutory consolidated loss for the period of £78.6 million to an adjusted consolidated profit  
for the period of £7.3 million.
The classification of items as adjusting is an area of judgement and the appropriateness and 
consistency of the presentation of adjusted measures of performance are attracting increase levels 
of scrutiny from the financial reporting regulators. They could also present the opportunity for 
manipulation, in particular in light of the significant pressures which the industry is currently 
facing. For this reason we have included this as a key audit matter in our audit report for the first 
time this year. 72
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
How the scope of our  
audit responded to the  
key audit matter
We evaluated the appropriateness of the adjustments made to the statutory loss before taxation 
to derive adjusted profit before tax. Our audit procedures included:
• Challenging the appropriateness and classification of these items by looking at a detailed sample 
of these and agreeing them back to supporting documentation;
• Assessing the completeness of any credits to adjusting items;
• Verifying severance and restructuring costs and confirming that these reflect permanent 
reductions in head count and where not settled are supported by appropriate evidence that 
these redundancies were sufficiently communicated prior to year-end;
• Considering the nature and scope of the charges related to the Strategic Review and confirming 
the fees described as adjusting relate to relevant adjusting activities per group policy;
• Reviewing the related disclosure in the Group accounts and assessing consistency with the 
prior period and current best practice; and
• Benchmarking the items which are excluded from the adjusted result measure against  
both peers and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidance and recent 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) FAQs.
Key observations We consider that the rationale for classifying items as adjusting is consistent year on year and  
is in accordance with the group’s accounting policy.
However, we have highlighted to those charged with governance that the inclusion of some  
of these items as adjusting is not in line with common practice. As a result, management have 
enhanced disclosure with regard to the adjusting items to explain why they are relevant for 
inclusion within the adjusting items category.
Carrying value of intercompany and investment balances for Johnston Press plc 
(company only financial statements)
Key audit matter description In 2017 management performed an exercise to re-assess the group intercompany position, and 
made corrections to the netting and grossing of certain balances in individual entity accounts  
in the Johnston Press group of companies. The impact on the Johnston Press plc accounts  
has been considered and management has concluded that the correction of these prior year 
matters is a prior year restatement under FRS102 section 10. The overall result of this exercise has 
been to increase gross intercompany debtors as at 31 December 2016 by £21.5 million, increase  
the provision against intercompany debtors by £21.5 million, increase intercompany payables by 
£9.4 million and increase the loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 by £9.4 million. 
This restatement did not affect the group financial statements.
Further to this, indicators of impairment have been identified in both the current and prior period, 
primarily as a result of the impairments recorded to publishing titles and printing presses within 
the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with FRS 102 section 27, an exercise was 
undertaken to assess the intercompany debtors, including the group relief intercompany  
debtor, and the investment balance for impairment. Management has re-assessed the basis  
of the methodology applied to calculate the value in use of the business, and have applied this 
first to support the recoverability of intercompany debtors, then against the group relief debtor 
and finally against the value of investments in subsidiaries. The impact of this in the prior period 
has been to increase the provision against intercompany receivables by £22.4 million, recognise  
a provision against group relief receivable of £18.5 million and increase the provision against 
investments in subsidiaries by £108.9 million.
Given the effort and time incurred by the company and by the auditors in respect of these 
matters, this is considered to be a key audit matter in the current year.
Refer to Note 33 for full details of both of these prior year adjustments.
How the scope of our  
audit responded to 
the key audit matter
We evaluated management’s updated intercompany reconciliations and have challenged their 
calculations by:
• Assessing the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the intercompany matrix for the 
2016 and 2017 period ends;
• Reviewing the composition of the proposed balances as at the 2016 and 2017 period ends  
and agreeing these positions back to supporting documentation; and
• Assessing management’s presentation and disclosure of the 2016 prior year restatement.
We have evaluated management’s impairment review of the intercompany debtors, group relief 
debtor and investments balances and challenged their calculations by:
• Performing an independent calculation of what we would expect the impairment charges  
to be, based on known audited values and comparing this to management’s calculation; and
• Considering management’s presentation and disclosure of the 2016 prior year restatement.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF JOHNSTON PRESS PLC CONTINUED 73
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Key observations We concur with the methodology applied in reaching the carrying values of the intercompany 
balances, including the group relief receivable, and the investment balances.
We concur with management that the corrections identified relating to the prior year 
intercompany, group relief receivable and investment balances should be corrected as  
a prior year restatement.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £610,000 (2016: £996,000)
Johnston Press plc company only £580,000 (2016: £946,000)
Basis for determining 
materiality
Materiality has been determined by considering a number of different measures including statutory 
loss before tax, statutory loss before tax before the impact of impairments and borrowings and 
adjusted profit before tax (2016: 4.4% of adjusted profit before tax).
Johnston Press plc company only materiality has been set at 95% of group materiality (2016: 95%). 
This reflects 0.3% (2016: 0.7%) of the net liabilities. We consider the net deficit to be an appropriate 
benchmark for the measure of the materiality for the Parent Company on the basis that it is the 
Group’s ultimate parent and is a non-trading company.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
As can be seen on the income statement, there is significant volatility in the results of the group  
as a result of impairments recognised in respect of intangible and tangible fixed assets and  
the changes in fair value of the borrowings. Accordingly we have considered a range of different 
metrics in determining materiality reflecting the uncertain market environment for newspaper 
publishers. £610,000 represents 0.6% of the statutory loss before tax, 7.9% of the statutory loss 
before tax adjusted to remove the impairment and the impact on the results of the change in  
fair value of the group’s borrowings.
We consider the net liabilities to be an appropriate benchmark for the measure of the  
materiality for the Parent Company on the basis that it is the Group’s ultimate parent and  
is a non-trading company.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality  
and ranged between £0.03 million and £0.6 million (2016: £0.02 millon and £0.9 million).
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £31,500 (2016: £50,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the  
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit incorporated the main trading business, Johnston Publishing Ltd, Johnston Publications Ltd, certain head office 
companies as well as the ultimate parent company. These companies (which are the same entities as in the prior year audit) represent  
the principal business units and account for all of the group’s net assets, all of the group’s revenue and all of the group’s profit before tax.
All of our audit work was performed by one team, with no use of component auditors, and was led by the Senior Statutory Auditor. 74

Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there  
is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the 
audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required under 
the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so.
 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material  
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52-WEEK PERIOD ENDED 30 DECEMBER 2017
1. Basis of preparation
Johnston Press plc (‘Johnston Press’ or ‘the Group’) is a public limited liability company incorporated in Scotland under the Companies Act 
2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The registered office is Orchard Brae House, 30 Queensferry Road, Edinburgh, EH4 2HS.  
The principal activities of the Group are described in the Operational Review and Financial Review sections of the Strategic Report.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
These financial statements have been prepared for the 52-week period ended 30 December 2017 (2016: 52-week period ended 
31 December 2016).
The significant accounting policies used in preparing this information are set out in Note 3.
The financial statements have also been adjusted, where appropriate, by new or amended IFRSs described below.
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis (discussed further in the Financial Review) and under the 
historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments, share based payments and defined  
benefit pension obligations that are measured at revalued amounts or fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Going concern
As at 30 December 2017, the Group had net debt of £195.9 million (excluding mark-to-market accounting adjustment), comprising cash of 
£25 million and borrowings of £220 million. The borrowings comprise £220 million of high yield bonds (the Bonds), which are repayable on 
1 June 2019 and are not subject to any financial maintenance covenants.
On 29 March 2017, the Group announced it had commenced a Strategic Review, working with its advisers Rothschild and Ashurst LLP,  
to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Bonds. As a key part of this Strategic Review process, the Board  
has engaged with its major stakeholders, including shareholders, holders of the Bonds, Pension Trustees and the Pensions Regulator.
On 10 October 2017, the Board announced that it was approaching its largest bondholders regarding the formation of an ad hoc 
committee of bondholders (the ‘Bondholder Committee’) to consider in greater detail certain potential amendments to the Group’s  
capital structure. On 2 November 2017, the Group confirmed that the Bondholder Committee had been formed. The main objectives  
of these potential amendments to the Group’s capital structure, combined with certain proposed amendments to the Group’s pension 
scheme, are to (i) achieve a sustainable level of debt within the Group to enable it to refinance its debt in the future, and (ii) materially 
reduce or eliminate the pension scheme deficit by 2021, whilst preserving the pension scheme members’ benefits. On 1 February 2018,  
the date of our last trading update, the Board confirmed that discussions with advisers to the Bondholder Committee were in progress.
The Group continues to explore these potential amendments to its capital structure with advisers to the Bondholder Committee and the 
Board is satisfied with the continued support of the Group’s major stakeholders during the review process. Any proposal that results from 
these discussions will remain subject to negotiation and the consent of relevant stakeholders, and there can be no certainty that a formal 
proposal will be forthcoming. In the event that consensual amendments to the Group’s capital structure cannot be agreed with relevant 
stakeholders, alternative options for the restructuring or refinancing of the Bonds prior to their maturity in June 2019 will be explored as 
part of the ongoing strategic review process.
The Group has performed a review of its financial resources taking into account, inter alia, the cash currently available to the Group, the 
absence of financial maintenance covenants in the Bonds, and the Group’s cash flow projections for the thirteen month period from the 
date of this report to 1 June 2019, and, based on this review, and after considering reasonably possible trading downside sensitivities and 
uncertainties, the Board is of the opinion that, subject to the material uncertainty surrounding the repayment of the Bonds on 1 June 2019 
(referred to below), the Group has adequate financial resources to meet its operational cash flow requirements for the next thirteen months 
from the date of this report. The Directors also anticipate that the Group will remain in a position to meet its obligations in respect of the 
Bonds, including with regard to the payment of interest, in the period prior to their maturity.
However, given the challenges faced by the newspaper and printing industry as a whole, the current trading experience of the Group,  
and the likely financial position of the Group at the time the Bonds are due for repayment in June 2019, there is material uncertainty 
surrounding the Group’s ability to refinance the Bonds at par in the market on commercially acceptable terms. Failure to repay, refinance, 
satisfy or otherwise retire the Bonds at their maturity would give rise to a default under the indenture governing the Bonds dated 16 May 
2014, and this possibility indicates a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and if the Strategic Review does not deliver a solution for the Group it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities 
in the normal course of business.
Notwithstanding this material uncertainty, taking into account that (i) the Strategic Review is ongoing, (ii) the Group has adequate  
financial resources to meet its operational cash flow requirements for the thirteen month period from the date of this report,  
and (iii) the Group is, and is anticipated to remain, in a position to meet its obligations in respect of the Bonds in the period prior  
to their maturity, the Directors have concluded it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. 82
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Restatements
Operating segment note
The operating segment note has been restated to reflect the correct allocation of operating costs between the publishing and contract 
printing segments for the 52 week period ended 31 December 2016. The impact has been to reduce the publishing net segment loss  
by £37.7 million and to increase the contracting printing net segment loss by £37.7 million reflecting operating costs of £34.6 million  
and impairment and write downs of £3.1 million. There is no impact on the Group net segment result.
Provisions
The Group Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2016 has been restated to reflect the correct allocation of onerous  
lease and dilapidations provisions between current and non-current liabilities. The impact has been to reduce short-term provisions  
by £1.4 million and increase long-term provisions by £1.4 million. There is no impact on total liabilities or net liabilities.
Sales ledger credit write-offs
In the current year it was noted that there has been historic releases of sales ledger credit balances made up predominantly of 
overpayments by customers. These should not be released unless six years has passed under the Limitations Act of 1980. Therefore, the 
impact has been to decrease opening 2016 retained earnings by £1.0 million and increase trade and other creditors by £1.0 million at the 
beginning of 2016. Then during 2016 the impact is to increase operating expenses by £0.4m and increase trade and other creditors by 
£0.4 million to a final position at 31 December 2016 of £1.4 million. This has impacted statutory EPS by increasing both the diluted and 
basic Loss per Share from (234.6)p to (234.9)p.
3. Significant accounting policies
Alternative performance measures
The Directors assess the performance of the Group using both statutory accounting measures and a variety of alternative performance 
measures (APMs). The key APMs monitored by the Group are:
• adjusted revenue
• adjusted EBITDA;
• adjusted EBITDA margin %;
• adjusted operating profit;
• adjusted operating profit margin %; and
• cash and net debt (excluding mark-to-market). Refer to Financial Review on page 23 for calculation of net debt 
(excluding mark-to-market).
The business has been through a period of enormous change over an extended period. This has resulted from structural change in  
the sector. Audiences have increased their use of online and mobile platforms to access information and news, resulting in accelerated 
newspaper circulation volume decline. Advertisers have also increasingly sought to use digital services to reach their target audiences. 
Together, this structural shift has resulted in year-on-year declines in the Group’s income.
The Group has initiated a series of restructuring programs to remove cost from the business with the objective of designing a sustainable 
print publishing business model, while at the same time investing in building a digital income stream.
The resulting restructuring projects has seen a substantial redesign of each area of the business, including management layers  
and structures, products and services, content creation and our sales routes to market. In streamlining the organisation, a significant 
investment in redundancy has seen more than 2047 posts closed over the last four years. The Group has also sought to reflect its  
change in shape and scale in support areas including making substantial reductions in its property portfolio, technology licences  
and fleet. The speed of its action, both in anticipating and responding to recent changes in the sector has meant that some existing 
contracts no longer reflect the current needs of the business.
In 2017, the Group initiated new changes to its business model, including how it allocated resources to different brands, its mix of field 
and call centre based sales staff, while also adopting a clear policy of downsizing its property portfolio, taking advantage of natural lease 
breaks, typically moving to smaller short-term serviced offices in towns and smaller cities, while maintaining larger hubs in Preston, 
Leeds, Edinburgh, Peterborough, Sheffield and Portsmouth.
To provide investors and other users of the Group’s financial statements with additional clarity and understanding of both the cost of  
this business change programme, and the resulting impact on the Group’s underlying trading, the Directors believe that it is appropriate 
to additionally present the Alternative Performance Measures used by management in running the business and in determining 
management and executive remuneration.
Although management believes the alternative performance measures are important in considering the performance of the Group, 
they are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to financial information on a statutory basis.  
The adjusted figures are not a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework, and therefore  
may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. When reviewing and selecting these adjusting items, the 
Directors considered the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE 52-WEEK PERIOD ENDED 30 DECEMBER 2017 83
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
A reconciliation between the statutory and the adjusted results is provided under Alternative Performance Measures within the  
financial information. The reconciliation includes explanations each ‘adjusting item’ and why they been adjusted for. An adjusting  
item is one that is judged to require separate presentation to enable a better understanding of the trading performance of the  
business in the period. Items are adjusted if they are significant in value and/or do not form part of ongoing underlying trading.  
They will, in many cases, be ‘one-off’ and include items that span more than one financial period.
Prior year comparatives have been restated so that the adjusted results are presented on a consistent basis between periods. Restated 
figures have been highlighted in the Alternative Performance Measures section. In the opinion of the Directors, disclosing the adjusting 
items provides supplementary information to aid understanding of the Group’s trading performance and also provides a basis of 
comparison between periods.
Refer to Alternative Performance Measures on page 138 for more detail.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and Amendments to IFRS 9
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 but will be early adopted for  
the financial statements of Johnston Press Plc for the 52-week period beginning on 31 December 2017. This is because there is only  
a one-day difference between the mandatory application date and the period beginning date, and the Company therefore considers  
it appropriate to apply the new standard for the year commencing on 31 December 2017. Johnston Press has identified the following 
areas where the adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect and are still in the process of assessing the financial impact of the changes 
detailed below:
• The Group’s borrowings of £220 million 8.625% secured notes due 1 June 2019 have been designated into fair value through  
profit and loss (FVTPL) category under IAS 39. Management expects that this designation will flow through to IFRS 9. However,  
that standard requires that effects of changes in the liability’s own credit risk are presented in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI),  
unless such presentation would result in a greater mismatch in profit or loss than if those amounts were presented in profit or loss. 
Management consider future changes in fair value that relate to own credit risk will be included in OCI in IFRS 9. In contrast under 
IAS 39 those changes were presented in profit and loss. This represents the most significant area of change on transition to IFRS 9  
in the context of the Group. Under IFRS 9 7.2.15, management do not anticipate comparatives being restated.
• The new classification approach in IFRS 9 for financial assets is not expected to have a material impact on the measurement basis  
of our financial assets due to the nature of the business and types of financial assets held; however, this assessment is still ongoing. 
The standard introduces an expected loss model approach to impairment of financial assets, which are principally accounts 
receivable and cash balances held with banks. Management is currently quantifying the financial impact of the new impairment 
model. Initial assessments indicate this is not likely to be material.
• The Group holds a strategic non-controlling interest of 3.53% in Press Association Group Limited. These shares are classified  
as available for sale under IAS 39. Under IAS 39, these were held at cost due to the so-called ‘cost exemption’ in that standard. In IFRS 9, 
these investments are anticipated to be at fair value through profit and loss (assuming Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive 
Income designation not made) with no cost exemption. Management have not quantified the impact and are still in the process  
of assessing the impact of the measurement differences in respect of these investments.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Clarifications to IFRS 15
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ will apply to the financial statements of Johnston Press plc for the 52-week period 
beginning on 31 December 2017. Johnston Press has identified the following areas where the adoption of IFRS 15 will have an effect  
and are currently finalising the quantification of the impact. Revenue streams where a significant impact is not expected have not  
been commented upon below.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and several revenue-related 
interpretations. IFRS 15 is based on revenue being recognised as and when ‘transfer of control’ (of the goods or services provided)  
occurs which is a change from the ‘risks and rewards’ model under the current revenue standards.
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using a fully retrospective application which will include restatement of the prior period comparatives 
under the new standard. Our application will make use of the following practical expedients:
• Contracts which are completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented will not be restated.
• Completed contracts with variable consideration will use the transaction price at the date the contract was completed rather than 
estimates of variable consideration in comparative periods.
• Contract modiﬁcations which occurred before the beginning of the earliest period presented will be reﬂected in aggregate.
• Contracts that are started and completed in the same annual reporting period will not be restated.
• IFRS 15 has been applied to portfolios of contracts which have similar characteristics and where we expect that the ﬁnancial 
statements would not differ significantly had the standard been applied to the individual contracts within the portfolio. Newspaper 
subscription contracts have been considered under the portfolio approach as each agreement will share common characteristics, 
such as performance obligations, contract length and consideration.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE 52-WEEK PERIOD ENDED 30 DECEMBER 2017 85
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
For tax purposes, adjustments to revenue or costs would be brought into account on the first day of the accounting period in which  
IFRS 15 is adopted.
The Group has identified the following areas where the adoption of IFRS 15 will have an effect on the financial statements and are  
still in the process of assessing the overall impact.
It should also be noted that there will be no impact on cash ﬂows with collection remaining in line with contractual terms.
Print and digital subscriptions
Digital subscriptions are offered free of charge with certain print subscriptions. Under IFRS 15 these have been determined to be two 
distinct performance obligations within a single contract. The Group’s existing revenue recognition policy under IAS 18 in relation to 
digital and print subscriptions is to allocate all of the consideration to the print subscription. Under IFRS 15 the stand-alone selling price 
of the digital subscription and the print subscription will have to be estimated and the total subscription value allocated between the 
two distinct performance obligations, although ultimately the revenue recognised will be at the same point in time as under IAS 18.
Although this is unlikely to significantly change the total subscription revenue recognised during the period, the work in assessing this  
is still ongoing. It will most likely change the allocation of revenue between operating segments.
Print subscription vouchers
The Group offers a number of newspaper subscriptions using a ‘paper coupon’ which may be redeemed at local retailers for a 
newspaper. The current accounting policy is to recognise the revenue from print subscriptions over the subscription period. Certain 
publications coupons have an expiration date which extends beyond the subscription period which the consumer has entered into. 
Under IFRS 15 the revenue recognised for these types of subscriptions will be required to be deferred over the period which the  
coupons are expected to be redeemed and key judgements will need to be made over when coupons are expected to be redeemed 
and how many are expected to lapse.
The Group is currently quantifying the impact. It is probable that an element of the subscription revenue will be deferred to later periods 
depending on the level of breakage estimated.
Contract print
The Group enters into a range of contract print arrangements with third parties to perform printing services; promises include the 
provision of inks, paper and delivery of newspapers to a specified warehouse. These contracts often contain elements of variable 
consideration under IFRS 15, such as consideration per newspaper being variable on total number of newspapers printed over the 
contract period and stepped rebate schemes. At inception of the contract there are judgements to be made regarding print volumes,  
as this will impact the price per newspaper that can be recognised.
The Group’s existing revenue recognition policy is to recognise revenue from contract print arrangements during the period, in line  
with volumes produced. With one exception, all customers are billed on a weekly/monthly basis, in line with their contractual pricing,  
for their actual print volumes, which can vary by print job. There is one contract that has annual minimum quantities, and in any contract 
year these minimum volumes are billed on a monthly basis. Revenue above minimum volumes on this contract, is recognised at each 
reporting date. Under IAS 18 this is permissible, however, under IFRS 15 the transaction price of the entire contract over the contractual 
term is estimated at inception of the contract and constrained to the extent that it is highly probable if included in revenue recognised 
does not result in a significant reversal to revenue recognised in future periods.
The Group is still in the process of assessing the impact to the contract print revenue that will be recognised under IFRS 15. The Group 
will be required to make judgements at the inception of the contract on expected print volumes, price per unit, paper costs and rebates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 30 or 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee when  
the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company 
considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient  
to give it power, including:
• the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
• potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
• rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
• any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings. 86
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control 
of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company. Total comprehensive 
income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the members of the Group 
are eliminated on consolidation.
When the Group disposes of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the difference between: 
(i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, and (ii) the previous carrying 
amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the 
subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/permitted by applicable IFRSs).
The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial 
recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, when applicable, the costs 
on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate  
of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group  
in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, including 
publishing titles, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for:
• deferred tax assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 
Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively; and
• non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for  
Sale and Discontinued Operations’, are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less  
costs of disposal.
Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather  
than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group)  
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to 
qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary  
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling 
interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.
Publishing titles
The Group’s principal intangible assets are publishing titles. The Group does not capitalise internally generated publishing titles. Titles 
separately acquired before 1 January 1996 are stated at cost and titles owned by subsidiaries acquired after 1 January 1996 are recorded 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. These publishing titles have no finite life and consequently are not amortised. The carrying value of 
the titles is reviewed for impairment at least annually with testing undertaken to determine any diminution in the recoverable amount 
below carrying value. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use is based on the net 
present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rate is post-tax and reflects current market assessments of time, value of 
money and risks specific to asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Any impairment loss is recognised  
as an expense immediately. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Group Income Statement given these 
assets are not carried at revalued amounts.
For the purpose of impairment testing, publishing titles are allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units and are included 
within the Group’s publishing segment (Note 5). Cash-generating units are determined by grouping assets at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows. Cash generating units are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there  
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount  
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the value of publishing titles and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets in respect of digital activities are amortised using the straight-line method over the expected life of three to five years 
and are tested for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently where there is an indication that the recoverable amount is less than 
the carrying amount. Costs incurred in the development of websites are only capitalised if the criteria specified in IAS 38 are met.
Valuation of share based payments
The Group estimates the expected value of equity-settled share based payments and this is charged through the Income Statement 
over the vesting periods of the relevant awards. The cost is estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes 
calculations are based on a number of assumptions that are set out in Note 29 and are amended to take account of estimated levels  
of share vesting and exercise.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods  
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Print advertising revenue is recognised on publication and circulation revenue is recognised at the point of sale. Digital revenues 
are recognised on publication for advertising or delivery of service for other digital revenues. Printing revenue is recognised when 
the service is provided.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of 
each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency 
for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each period end, monetary 
assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the close of business on the 
last working day of the period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit  
or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit 
or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at historical cost in respect of 
which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated 
at exchange rates prevailing on the period end date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the 
period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment balances are shown at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. In certain cases the 
amounts of previous revaluations of properties conducted in 1996 or 1997 or the fair value of the property at the date of the acquisition 
by the Group have been treated as the deemed cost on transition to IFRS.
For the purpose of annual impairment testing of printing presses, these assets are allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units 
and are included within the Group’s printing segment (Note 5). Cash generating units are determined by grouping assets are at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Cash generating units are tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than 
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the value of publishing titles and 
then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful 
lives. The principal rates employed are:
Freehold land   Nil
Freehold property   2.5% reducing balance
Leasehold property  Term of lease
Computer and IT equipment 20% to 33% straight-line
Other production equipment 6.67% to 33% straight-line
Furniture and fittings  15% reducing balance, 20% straight-line
Motor vehicles   25% straight-line 88
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment continued
Printing presses are depreciated over 25 years on a straight-line basis. Any direct enhancements to the presses are depreciated such  
that these assets are coterminous with the underlying press or their economic useful life if that is determined to be shorter. Ancillary 
press equipment is depreciated over their economic useful life, which ranges between 5 and 15 years on a straight-line basis.
Assets classified as held for sale
Where a property or a significant item of equipment (such as a print press or property no longer required as part of Group operations)  
is marketed for sale, management is highly committed to the sale and the asset is available for immediate sale, the Group classifies that 
asset as held for sale. All assets in this category are expected to be sold within 12 months, as per the criteria of IFRS 5, and have therefore 
been classified as current assets. The value of the asset is held at the lower of the net book value or the expected net realisable sale value.
The Directors have estimated the sale values based on the current price that the asset is being marketed at and advice from 
independent property agents. The actual sale proceeds may differ from the estimate.
Provisions for onerous leases and dilapidations
Where the Group exits a rented property, an estimate of the anticipated total future cost payable under the terms of the operating  
lease, including rentals, rates and other related expenses, is charged to the Income Statement at the point where the unavoidable  
costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Where there is  
a break clause in the contract, rentals are provided for up to that point. In addition, an estimate is made of the likelihood of sub-letting 
the premises and any rentals that would be receivable from a sub-tenant. Where receipt of sub-lease rentals is considered reasonable,  
these amounts are deducted from the rentals payable by the Group under the lease and provision charged for the net amount.
Under the terms of a number of property leases, the Group is required to return the property to its original condition at the lease  
expiry date. The Group has estimated the expected costs of these dilapidations and charged these costs to the Income Statement.  
No discounting has been applied to the provision as the effect of the discounting is not considered material.
Inventories
Inventories, largely paper, plates and ink, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost incurred in bringing materials  
to their present location and condition comprises: (a) raw materials and goods for resale at purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis,  
and (b) work in progress at cost of direct materials, labour and certain overheads. Net realisable value comprises selling price less  
any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are those cash balances held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three 
months or less.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Investments are recognised and derecognised on the trade date in accordance with the terms of the purchase or sale contract and  
are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs.
Available for sale financial assets
Listed and unlisted investments are shown as available for sale and are stated at fair value. Fair value of listed investments is determined 
with reference to quoted market prices. Fair value of unlisted investments is determined by reference to the latest set of audited results. 
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments 
revaluation reserve, with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign 
exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed  
of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in reserves in reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on available for sale equity investments are recognised in the Income Statement when the Group’s right to receive the 
payment is established.
Available for sale equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured and derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of such unquoted equity investments are measured at cost 
less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each period end date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective 
evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future  
cash flows of the investment have been impacted. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly 
for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance  
for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Changes in the carrying value of this allowance are recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance 
of the contractual arrangement.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividend distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved.
Preference shares
All the preference shares carry the right, subject to the discretion and ability of the Group to distribute profits, to a fixed dividend 
of 13.75% and rank in priority to the ordinary shares. Due to the significant impairment that arose during the financial year ended 
31 December 2016 and which extinguished distributable reserves, preference share dividends cannot be paid. Given the discretionary 
nature of the dividend right to be paid in the current year, the preference shares are considered to be equity under IAS 32.
In the event that Johnston Press plc, the holding company, returns to a position in which it has distributable reserves, the Board will 
consider paying all unpaid dividends from such date as when the last payment was made. The Group is under no legal obligation  
to make a payment in respect of prior year dividends.
Borrowings
The borrowings of £220 million 8.625% senior secured notes due 1 June 2019 agreed as part of the June 2014 refinancing are recorded  
at fair value through profit and loss and classified as Level 1 according to IFRS 13. As the borrowings are shown at fair value the associated 
issue costs have been charged to the Income Statement (refer to Note 8c).
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to  
the Group. Assets held under finance leases are recognised at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, the present value  
of the minimum lease payments. The asset is recognised within property, plant and equipment and the corresponding liability to  
the lessor is included within obligations under finance leases. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges which are 
charged to the consolidated income statement and reductions in the lease obligation.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Group Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease. In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. 
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Where the Group is a lessor, rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Operating loss
Operating loss is stated after charging restructuring, impairment, depreciation, amortisation and staff costs but before investment 
income, other finance income, finance costs and the results of discontinued operations.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the Income 
Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the period-end date.
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority. 90

3. Significant accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax-based values used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using 
the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred  
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which 
the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the relevant requirements of IAS 12 are satisfied.
Retirement benefit costs
The Group provides pensions to employees through various schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to the Income Statement as an expense as they fall due.
For the defined benefit scheme, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each period end date. Actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets are recognised in full in 
the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Past service cost is recognised as an expense at the earlier of the date when a plan amendment or curtailment occurs and  
the date when an entity recognises any termination benefits, or related restructuring costs. Net-interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset at the beginning of the period (taking account 
of changes in the net liability or asset over the period due to contributions paid) and is recognised within finance costs.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is recognised in full on the balance sheet 
on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to any surplus assuming the gradual settlement of liabilities over time until all 
members have left the Plan.
There has been a change in accounting policy in the current period to present all of the net defined benefit obligation as a non-current 
liability, which is in line with common practice. The impact on the 31 December 2016 retirement benefit obligation was to move  
£10.3 million from current liabilities to non-current liabilities. This has resulted in no change in the total retirement benefit obligation  
in the prior reporting period.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt  
with below). The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered  
to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Impairment of publishing titles and print presses
Key areas of judgement in the value in use calculation include the identification of appropriate CGUs. The Group has identified its 
publishing and print CGUs based on the geographic regions in which it operates. This is considered to be the lowest level at which  
cash inflows generated are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets and has been consistently applied  
in the current and prior periods.
Other accounting judgements:
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
In the reporting of financial information in the Alternative Performance Measures section of the Annual Report, the Group uses certain 
measures that are not required under IFRS or the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under which the Group reports. 
In the opinion of the Directors, disclosing the key APM’s of adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin %, adjusted 
operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin % and net debt (excluding mark-to-market) provides supplemental information  
to the statutory results reported under IFRS to show the Group’s underlying trading performance. The adjusted results reflect the  
way management and the Directors assess the Group’s performance and involve judgement, which is explained more fully in the 
Alternative Performance Measures section of the Annual Report.
The adjusted figures are not a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework, and therefore may 
not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the period end date that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, 
are discussed below.
Impairment of publishing titles and print presses
The Group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have suffered any impairment 
based on the recoverable amount of its cash generating units. Determining whether publishing titles and print presses are impaired 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which these assets are allocated. Key sources of estimation uncertainty in  
the value in use calculation include the estimation of future cash flows of CGUs affected by expected changes in underlying revenues 
and direct costs as well as corporate and central cost allocations through the forecast period, the long-term growth rates and a suitable 
discount rate to apply to the aforementioned cash flows in order to calculate the net present value.
Determining whether print presses are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of each print site. The value in use  
calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the print sites and a suitable discount rate  
in order to calculate present value. Details of the impairment reviews that the Group performs in relation to other intangible assets  
are provided in Note 13.
Valuation of pension liabilities
The Group records in its Statement of Financial Position a liability equivalent to the deficit on the Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme. The pension liability is determined with advice from the Group’s actuarial advisers and fluctuates based on a number  
of factors, some of which are outside the control of management. The main factors that can impact the valuation include:
• the discount rate used to discount future liabilities back to the present date, determined each year from the yield 
on corporate bonds;
• the actual returns on investments experienced as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation;
• the actual rates of pension increase as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation;
• the forecast inflation rate experienced as compared to the expected rates used in the previous valuation; and
• mortality assumptions based on standard base table adjusted to reflect specific conclusions and conditions based on a study  
of the actual scheme members.
The liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group are determined using methods relying on actuarial 
estimates and assumptions, including rates in increase in pensions, expected returns on scheme plan assets, life expectancies and 
discount rates. Details of the key assumptions are set out in the Group’s accounting policies section above and within Note 22. The 
sensitivity analysis performed within Note 22 allows the users of the accounts to see the impact of potential movements in assumptions. 
The Group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the assumptions. Changes in assumptions  
used may have a significant effect on the Group statement of comprehensive income and the Group statement of financial position.
Going concern
When preparing financial statements, management is required to make an assessment of an entities ability to continue as a going 
concern and prepare financial statements on this basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading  
or has no realistic alternative but to do so. When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt upon the entities ability to continue as a going concern, the entity shall disclose 
those uncertainties. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available 
information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited to, 12 months from the end of the reporting period. Management  
have undertaken an analysis of the trading expectations for the Group as outlined in its three-year plan, including conducting  
reasonable downside sensitivities, considered cash balances held at the end of each period and the current circumstances and  
options that exist in relation to the Bond maturing on 1 June 2019 and the lack of financial maintenance covenants existing.  
Detailed disclosures on the status and material uncertainties existing in relation to the Bond maturity have been included in the 
Directors Report under liquidity and going concern and in the Viability Statement. Based on the review, and as detailed in Note 1,  
the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements on a going concern basis.
5. Operating segments
Information reported to the Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance  
is focused on the two areas of publishing (in print and online) and contract printing. Geographical segments are not presented as  
the Group operates solely in the UK.
Unless otherwise indicated the segment information reported on the following pages does not include any amounts for discontinued 
operations which are described in more detail in Note 10. It has not been adjusted to reflect disposed or closed titles or products. 92

1  Inter-segment sales are charged at market rates.
2  Revenue from sale of goods and services for 2017 was £201.6 million (2016: £222.7 million). There was other operating income in the year of £0.8 million 
(2016: £0.1 million) relating to rental income on sub-let properties, please see Note 6 for more details. This means total revenue as defined by IAS 18 is 
£202.4 million (2016: £222.8 million).
3  Total adjustments presented in the Alternative Performance Measures section of £83.5 million (2016: £364.5 million) consists of impairment and write downs of  
£64.4 million (2016: £344.3 million) and adjustments (excluding impairment and write downs) of £19.1 million (2016: £20.2 million). The prior period comparative 
figures have been re-presented to separately present impairment and write downs, adjustments (excluding impairment and write downs) and operating costs.  
The prior period financial statements disclosed total operating costs of £545.7 million. In the disclosure above this amount has been split into impairment and  
write downs of £344.3 million, adjustments (excluding impairment and write downs) of £20.2 million and operating costs £181.6 million. The total of these amounts 
represents an increase of £0.4 million on the operating costs figure disclosed in the prior period signed financial statements as a result of the sales ledger credits 
write off disclosed in Note 2.
4  Includes depreciation and amortisation.
5  Net segment result for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2016 has been restated to reflect the correct allocation of operating costs between the Publishing 
and Contract printing segments. Refer to Note 2 for more detail.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 3. The segment 
result represents the (loss)/profit earned by each segment without allocation of the share of results of associates, investment income, 
finance costs (including in relation to pension assets and liabilities) and income tax expense or credit. This is the measure reported  
to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The Group, in common with the rest of the publishing industry, is subject to the main holiday periods of Easter, summer and  
Christmas as well as school and bank holidays. Since these fall across both half years, the Group’s financial results are not usually  
subject to significant seasonable variations from period-to-period.

UK corporation tax is calculated at 19.25% (31 December 2016: 20.0%) of the estimated assessable profit for the period. The 19.25% basic 
tax rate applied for the 2017 accounting year was a blended rate, being a mix of 20% up to 31 March 2017 and 19% from 1 April 2017 
(2016: 20%). Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdiction.
The Income Statement includes a tax credit of £16.4 million which comprises a current tax credit of £0.1 million and deferred tax credit 
of £16.3 million. The deferred tax credit has largely arisen from £59.2 million of impairment charges on the Group’s publishing title 
intangible assets (£10.1 million deferred tax credit) and the disposal of the East Anglia and East Midlands publishing titles in January 2017 
resulting in a deferred tax credit of £3.2 million. £3.9 million of the current year deferred tax credit has arisen on the Group’s Bond, due to 
different accounting treatment applied on the Bond at the Group level in contrast with that applied at the subsidiary entity level due to 
statutory reporting requirements. This was offset by a deferred tax charge of £2.1 million recognised in the income statement as a result 
of certain deferred tax assets being deemed unrecoverable.
The tax on actuarial gains/(losses) on the defined benefit pension scheme includes a £1.5 million deferred tax charge to the consolidated 
income statement and a £2.0 million tax charge taken to the Statement of Other comprehensive income.
In November 2017, the UK government introduced new rules with effect from 1 April 2017 which would restrict the deductibility of net 
interest costs. In the current year the £1.8 million impact of these new restrictions was included in the calculation of the current year  
tax charge. Due to uncertainty regarding the Group’s ability to recover the disallowed interest which can be carried forward under  
these rules, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the disallowed amount. Having also assessed the recoverability  
of its deferred tax assets from timing differences, the Group has recognised a deferred tax charge of £2.1 million to derecognise 
temporary differences relating to accelerated tax depreciation due to uncertainty as to the timing of future recoverability.
The Group’s effective tax rate was 17.3% for the 2017 financial year (2016: 17.8%). In the period, the effective tax rate was lower than the 
prevailing UK corporation tax rate of 19.25%, largely due to the disallowance of corporate interest restriction amounts, the difference 
between current and deferred tax rates and the impact of deferred tax not recognised overall reducing the effective tax rate by 6.3%. 
This has been partly offset by the deferred tax impact of the disposal of the East Anglia and East Midlands publishing titles disposed  
in January 2017 increasing the effective tax rate by 3.1%.
The Group expects that, subject to the uncertain outcome of the strategic review, the effective tax rate will remain relatively consistent 
with the current and prior year and reflect the reduction of UK corporate tax rates over the next few years.
At the reporting date the Group has recorded £0.1m of uncertain tax positions where tax could become payable in the future.

The provisions of the Group’s Bond restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends on the Company’s ordinary shares until certain 
conditions, including that net leverage is below 2.25x EBITDA, are met. Although the Board wishes to resume dividend payments  
as soon as is appropriate, no ordinary dividend is declared for the period.
Due to the significant impairment that arose during the financial year ended 31 December 2016 which extinguished distributable 
reserves, preference share dividends cannot be paid. 98

13. Intangible assets continued
Impairment assessment
The Group tests the carrying value of publishing brands held within the publishing operating segment for impairment annually or more 
frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. If an impairment charge is required this is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU but subject to not reducing any asset 
below its recoverable amount. The impairment reviews of the carrying value of the intangible assets, performed during the period, 
resulted in impairment charges recorded against publishing title intangible assets of £59.2 million, corporate digital intangible assets  
of £1.3 million and corporate tangible assets of £3.1 million (refer to Note 14).
The Directors consider that publishing brands have an indefinite economic life. Their economic life will in large part be determined by their 
ability to adapt over time to market requirements in the changing media landscape. The publishing brands are grouped by CGU, being the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. The recently 
acquired i newspaper, which serves a national market, is held in a separate CGU. For the remaining regional brands in the Group it is not 
practicable to review individual publishing rights and titles due to the interdependencies of revenues and cash inflows within the CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are:
• expected changes in underlying revenues and direct costs during the period;
• corporate and central cost allocations;
• growth rates; and
• the discount rate.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts using:
• the Board-approved budget for 2018, and the projections for 2019 and 2020 which reflects management’s current experience  
and future expectations of the markets the CGUs operate in. Changes in underlying revenue and direct costs are based on past 
practices and expectations of future changes in the market by reference to the Groups own experience and, where appropriate, 
publicly available market estimates. These include changes in demand for print and digital, circulation, cover prices, advertising  
rates as well as movement in newsprint and production costs and inflation;
• capital expenditure cash flows to reflect the cycle of capital investment required;
• net cash inflows for future years are extrapolated beyond 2020 based on the Board’s view of the estimated annual long-term 
performance. A long-term decline rate between 0% and 4% reflecting the Groups experience and best estimate of future trends  
has been included for all CGUs. The long-term decline rates used are based on the Directors view of the market conditions for the 
CGU and its titles and brands in their current form; and
• management estimate discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money,  
the risks specific to the CGUs and the risks that the regional media industry is facing. The post-tax discount rate applied to the future 
cash flows for the period ended 30 December 2017 was 11.0% (31 December 2016: 11.0%).
Some CGUs impacted by the impairment charge in the period have limited or no headroom of value in use over the carrying value of 
assets. Therefore, the impairment review is highly sensitive to reasonable possible changes in key assumptions used in the value in use 
calculations. A combination of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions to the CGUs, such as digital growth being slower than 
forecast or the decline in print revenues, could lead to a further impairment.
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
FOR THE 52-WEEK PERIOD ENDED 30 DECEMBER 2017 101
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
A decrease in the long-term decline rate of 1.0% (which has the effect of increasing the decline rate from between 0% and 4% to 
between 1% and 5%), beyond 2020, would result in a further Group impairment of £2.2 million and erosion of £9.0 million of headroom 
in the combined Midlands, Northern Ireland and i CGUs. An increase in the long-term decline rate is possible if the advertising market 
conditions do not improve.
A decrease in the operating profit (after central cost allocation) of 1.0% in each of the three years in the forecast period from 2018-2020, 
would result in a further Group impairment of £0.5 million and erosion of £1.4 million of headroom in the combined Midlands,  
Northern Ireland and i CGUs. A decrease in the operating profit after central cost allocation is possible if revenues or costs do not  
meet forecasted numbers.
An increase in the discount rate of 1.0%, from 11.0% to 12.0% would result in an additional impairment of £2.8 million, and erosion  
of £10.7 million of headroom in the combined Midlands, Northern Ireland and i CGUs. An increase in the risk-free interest rate or risk 
premium could result in a higher discount rate being applied to the impairment assessment.

Digital intangible assets
Digital intangible assets primarily relate to the Group’s local websites, which form the core platform for the Group’s digital revenue 
activities. These assets are being amortised using the straight-line method over the expected life, of three to five years. Amortisation  
for the year has been charged through cost of sales. Digital intangible assets are tested for impairment at each reporting date or  
more frequently where there is an indication that the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount.
Costs incurred in the development of websites are only capitalised if the criteria specified in IAS38 are met.
Disposal of Midlands titles
On 17 January 2017, the Group completed the disposal of the entire issued share capital of Johnston Publishing East Anglia Limited, 
which owned 13 publishing titles and associated websites in East Anglia and the East Midlands, to Iliffe Media Limited for gross cash 
consideration of £17.0 million, less associated disposal costs of £1.4 million.

During the 52-week period ended 30 December 2017, the Group recognised an accelerated depreciation charge of £0.2 million 
(2016: £0.5 million charge). The write-down in the current and prior period arose from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated 
based on fair value less costs of sale as quoted by external valuers.

Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
During the period the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of its print manufacturing plant and related equipment, 
which are used in the Group’s print segment. The Group has three print presses in Dinnington, Portsmouth and Carn. Each print site  
is assessed independently for impairment, as separate CGUs. The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined from value in use 
calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are:
• expected changes in underlying revenues and direct costs during the period;
• growth rates; and
• the discount rate.
The Group prepares discounted cash flow forecasts using:
• the Board approved budget for 2018 and the projections for 2019 and 2020 which reflects management’s current experience and 
future expectations of the markets the CGUs operate in. Changes in underlying revenue and direct costs are based on past practices 
and expectations of future changes in the market. These include changes in internal and external print revenue as well as movement 
in newsprint and production costs and inflation;
• capital expenditure cash flows to reflect the cycle of capital investment required;
• net cash inflows for future years are extrapolated beyond 2020 based on the Board’s view of the estimated annual long-term 
performance. A long-term decline rate of 0% reflecting the Group’s ability to attract new business, to realise decline in existing 
internal and external contracts has been included for all print press CGUs (31 December 2016: 0% growth); and
• management estimate discount rates using post-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time, value of money and 
the risks specific to the CGUs. The post-tax discount rate applied to the future cash flows for the period ended 30 December 2017  
was 11.0% (31 December 2016: 11.0%). The pre-tax discount rate is a range between 5.2% and 12.4% (31 December 2016: 11.9% to 13.0%). 
The post-tax discount rate reflects management’s view of the current risk profile of the underlying assets being valued with regard  
to the current economic environment and the risks that the regional media industry is facing. The present value of the cash flows  
is then compared to the carrying value of the asset to determine if there is any impairment loss.
Impairment charges totalling of £3.9 million have been recognised against property, plant and equipment for the period ended 
30 December 2017. This consists of:
• a £3.1 million impairment charge allocated against corporate assets arising out of the impairment assessment performed over 
the publishing title intangible asset CGUs (refer to Note 13 for details);
• an £0.8 million impairment charge arising out of the impairment assessment performed in relation to the Carn print site CGU. 
As at 30 December 2017 the recoverable amount of the Carn print site CGU is £0.4 million. This is its value in use.
The comparative period included a £5.5 million impairment charge to the Dinnington print site. The impairment charge has been 
included in the Income Statement in exceptional items and arises from Guardian News & Media renegotiating its contract, following  
the transition of The Guardian and Observer newspapers from Berliner to Tabloid format.
The prior year comparative includes a write-down of £1.9 million to record a property at its expected realisable value. The property 
belongs to the Group’s publishing segment and the impairments have been included in the Income Statement in exceptional items.

17. Acquisition of the i newspaper
On 10 April 2016 Johnston Publications Limited, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the principal assets of ‘the i’, part 
of the Independent Group for net consideration of £24.1 million.
The acquisition represented a significant growth opportunity for the Group in terms of national print and advertising revenue. The i is  
a highly regarded newspaper with a clear market position and a loyal readership and the combination seeks to rebalance the Group’s 
revenues towards less volatile circulation revenue. With the considerable digital experience of the Group, the combination with the  
i will allow the Group to grow digital audiences and revenues through the creation of inews.co.uk.

There were no conditions around the deferred payment of £2 million which was paid in April 2017. The purchase consideration was 
attributed to the titles.
Costs of approximately £1.8 million relating to the acquisition were incurred in respect of legal and advisory fees.
The revenue included in the consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the 52-week period to 30 December 2017 
contributed by the i was £30.6 million (£18.5 million for the 38-week period from 10 April 2016 to 31 December 2016). The i also 
contributed EBITDA of £9.3 million (excluding the allocation of corporate overheads) for the 52-week period to 30 December 2017 
(£3.3 million for the 38-week period from 10 April 2016 to 31 December 2016).
There were no acquisitions made in the 52-week period to 30 December 2017.

Assets classified as held for sale consists of land and buildings in the UK and Republic of Ireland that are no longer in use by the Group 
and print presses that have ceased production. Non-current assets are transferred to assets held for sale when it is expected that their 
carrying amount will be recovered principally through disposal and a sale is considered likely. They are held at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less cost of sales. All the assets are being marketed for sale and are expected to be sold within the next year.
On 17 January 2017, the Group disposed of publishing titles with a net book value of £16.0 million to Iliffe Media Ltd. 
Refer to Note 16 for more details on disposal.
In addition to the above, the Group disposed of its freehold property, Telegraph House in Sheffield. The property had a net book value  
of £1.9 million and was disposed on 30 June 2017 for a total consideration of £3.6 million in cash. The disposal has resulted in a gain  
on disposal of £1.37 million after disposal costs. Proceeds on the disposal are to be used for working capital purposes, and to finance  
the move to a new, leasehold site. 106

Trade receivables
The average credit period taken on sales is 38 days (31 December 2016: 41 days). No interest is charged on trade receivables.  
The Group has provided for estimated irrecoverable amounts in accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 3.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customer’s 
credit quality and then defines credit terms and limits on a by-customer basis. These credit terms are reviewed regularly. In the case  
of one-off customers or low value purchases, pre-payment for the goods is required under the Group’s policy. The Group reviews  
trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, that the credit quality of  
these amounts at the period end date has not deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and so considers the amounts 
recoverable. Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, payment plans are in place to further reduce 
the risk of default on the receivable.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £5.9 million (31 December 2016: £7.3 million) 
which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in  
credit quality and the Group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The Group does not hold any security over these balances. 
The weighted average past due period of these receivables is 25 days (31 December 2016: 26 days).

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date credit was initially granted up to the balance sheet date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large 
and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables
Impaired trade receivables are those that have been provided for under the Group’s bad debt provisioning policy, as described in the 
accounting policy in Note 3. The ageing of impaired trade receivables is shown below.

However, following the inception of new finance leases during the year, finance leases are now considered material and are disclosed separately. Therefore the 
finance lease liability has been re-presented in the prior period to borrowings and the associated finance lease disclosure comparatives have been added for 
comparability with the new current year disclosures. There were no finance leases in year ended 2 January 2016. There is no effect on EPS.

Characteristics of the Group’s pension-related liabilities
The Johnston Press Retirement Savings Plan
The Johnston Press Retirement Savings Plan is a defined contribution Master Trust arrangement for current employees, operated  
by Zurich. Contributions by the Group are a percentage of basic salary. Employer contributions range from 1% of qualifying earnings,  
for employees statutorily enrolled, through to 12% of basic salary for Senior Executives. Employees who were active members of the 
Money Purchase section of the Johnston Press Pension Plan on 31 August 2013 transferred from the Johnston Press Pension Plan  
to the Johnston Press Retirement Savings Plan from 1 September 2013.
The Johnston Press Pension Plan (‘the Plan’)
The Johnston Press Pension Plan is a defined benefit pension plan closed to new members and closed to future accrual. There was  
a defined contribution section of the Johnston Press Pension Plan which was closed in August 2013 and members’ defined contribution 
benefits were transferred to the Johnston Press Retirement Savings Plan.
The Plan operates under trust law, applying in the relevant parts of the United Kingdom, and the assets of the Plan are held separately from 
those of the Group. The Plan is managed and administered by independent Trustees on behalf of the members. Trustees have a duty to act 
in the best interests of the members and must act in accordance with the Plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and UK pensions legislation.
There are seven Trustees, four are appointed by the Company (including an independent professional trustee as Chairman) and three  
are nominated by members of the Plan.
A valuation of the Johnston Press Pension Plan as at 31 December 2012 was commissioned by the Trustees and took account of  
the 2014 Capital Refinancing Plan.
In conjunction with the 2014 Capital Refinancing Plan, the Plan Trustees and the Group entered into a Pension Framework Agreement, 
agreeing, inter alia, to the following:
• On implementation of the Capital Refinancing Plan in June 2014, the secured guarantee provided in favour of the Plan Trustees by 
the Group and certain of its subsidiaries in relation to any default on a payment obligation under the Johnston Press Pension Plan 
was removed. In return for the removal of this security and the aforementioned guarantee, an unsecured cross-guarantee was 
provided on implementation of the Capital Refinancing Plan by the Group and certain of its subsidiaries in favour of the Plan Trustees 
in relation to any default on a payment obligation under the Plan. Each claim made under the unsecured cross-guarantee is capped 
at an amount equal to the aggregate Section 75 (s.75) debt of the Johnston Press Pension Plan at the date any claim made by the 
Plan Trustees falls due.
• The deficit as at the 31 December 2012 valuation date will be sought to be addressed by 31 December 2024 by entry into a recovery 
plan (see below).
• Settlement of previously incurred Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levies and s.75 debts.
• The Plan was entitled to receive 25% of net proceeds from business or asset disposals up to and including 31 August 2015 exceeding 
£1 million in a single transaction or £2.5 million over the course of a financial year, subject to certain permitted disposals, conditions  
in relation to financial leverage and other exceptions set out in the Framework Agreement.
• The Group would also pay additional contributions to the Plan in the event that the 2014/2015 PPF levy and/or the 2015/2016 PPF  
levy was less than £3.2 million, equal to the amount the levy falls below £3.2 million, up to a maximum of £2.5 million.
• Additional contributions would also be payable to the Johnston Press Pension Plan in the event that the Group satisfies certain 
conditions in relation to financial leverage.
As part of the 31 December 2012 triennial valuation, this Pension Framework Agreement was reflected in the valuation documentation 
of the Plan, and subsequently it was submitted to The Pensions Regulator.
The Pension Framework Agreement and the required level of contributions are subject to review as part of the triennial valuation 
as at 31 December 2015.
Discussions are currently ongoing between the Trustees and the Company. The statutory deadline for sign off of the valuation was 
31 March 2017 and the Trustees have informed the Pensions Regulator (tPR) that the valuation has not been signed off due to ongoing 
discussions with the Company. The Trustees and the Plan’s advisers have met with tPR and had regular conference call updates over the 
course of the year to keep tPR updated on the progress of the discussions.
In the meantime, the Schedule of Contributions and Recovery Plan dated 29 July 2014 remain in force. Under these, the Group will pay 
the following annual contributions to the Plan: £10.6 million in the year to 31 December 2018 increasing by 3% per annum with a final 
payment of £12.7 million in the year to 31 December 2024.
Difference between funding valuation and IAS19 valuation
A funding valuation is carried out every three years by a qualified actuary on behalf of the Board of Trustees, the purpose of which 
is to determine the money that needs to be put into the Plan.
IAS19 is an accounting rule covering employee benefits under which the deficit shown on the balance sheet of the financial statements 
is determined. 110
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
22. Retirement benefit obligation continued
Difference between funding valuation and IAS19 valuation continued
The purpose of the funding valuation is therefore different to the IAS19 valuation. And the approach to each of these valuations  
is different too, meaning the funding and IAS19 deficits are different:
• The IAS19 accounting standard requires all companies to assess their liabilities by assuming that future investment returns  
will be in line with yields on high-quality corporate bonds.
• The Plan invests in a range of assets which are expected to deliver higher returns than the yields currently available on corporate 
bonds. The Trustees can take account of these higher expected returns in setting the liabilities under the funding valuation.
• Other assumptions used differ between the IAS19 and funding valuations. The Trustees are required to use prudent assumptions 
for funding whereas IAS19 requires best estimate assumptions.
Whilst discussions with the Trustees on the latest triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2015 are ongoing, the latest estimate 
of the funding deficit is £45.9 million at 30 June 2017. This compares with the IAS19 deficit at the same date of £53.1 million.
Maturity profile
The weighted average term of the liabilities (known as ‘the duration’) is 16 years.
The table below shows the split of the Defined Benefit Obligation by member type at 30 December 2017:
Defined benefit obligation at 30 December 2017 £000
Deferred pensioners 300,416
Pensioners 308,196
Total 608,612
Risks
The Plan exposes the Group to a number of risks, the most significant of which are described below:
Interest rate risk The IAS19 liabilities are calculated using a discount rate based on the yields available on AA corporate bonds.  
A reduction in bond yields (and hence the discount rate) will increase the Plan’s liabilities.
The Plan invests in Liability Driven Investment (LDI) assets to hedge the majority of this risk – see Investment 
Strategy below.
Inflation risk Pension increases in payment and revaluation of deferred members’ benefits before retirement are linked  
to inflation. Higher levels of inflation will lead to higher liabilities.
The Plan’s LDI investments provide a hedge against the majority of this risk – see Investment Strategy below.
Pension increases in payment and deferred revaluation are both subject to caps which limit the inflation risk to an 
extent. And the Plan offers members the option of a Pension Increase Exchange at retirement, where members can 
give up future increases on some of their pension for an immediate, one-off uplift to the initial pension. This further 
reduces the level of inflation risk.
Investment risk Whilst the IAS19 liabilities are calculated by reference to AA corporate bond yields, the Plan invests in a range of 
different asset classes with the aim of balancing the objectives of targeting investment growth and managing risk.
The Plan’s assets include some growth assets that are expected to perform better than corporate bonds in the 
long-term, but the value of these assets will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. To limit this risk, the Trustees 
invest in a diverse portfolio of instruments across various markets.
The mismatch between assets and liabilities does mean there will be some short-term volatility between asset and 
liability values. The Plan’s LDI investments limit the extent of this volatility – see Investment Strategy below. All else 
being equal, if the returns are less than the discount rate then the deficit will increase.
The Trustees will monitor and review the investment strategy with respect to the liabilities in conjunction with each 
actuarial valuation. The investment strategy will be set with consideration to the appropriate level of risk required  
for the funding strategy as set out in the Plan’s Statement of Funding Principles.
Longevity risk Increases in life expectancy will lead to higher liabilities.
The Company will keep the life expectancy assumptions under review, taking into account the results of the 
medically underwritten health study, information from the Trustee’s actuary on the Plan’s actual mortality 
experience and mortality trends in the wider population.

IFRIC 14
Under the Rules of the Plan the Group has an unconditional right to any surplus assuming the gradual settlement of liabilities over  
time until all members have left the Plan.
Therefore under IFRIC 14 the Group is neither required to reflect any additional liabilities in relation to deficit funding commitments,  
nor restrict any Plan surplus that arises.
IFRIC 14 is currently in the process of being amended and the Company will review its IFRIC 14 position when the amendment 
is published.

to the deferred tax movement in respect of the defined benefit scheme.
During the 2015 period, a medically underwritten study was carried out by KPMG to identify the current health of a sample group of 
existing Plan members, assessed via telephone interviews targeted towards members with the most significant liabilities in the Plan.  
The results of the study continue to be used to inform the mortality assumptions for use in calculating the IAS19 scheme liabilities.

The Volatility Controlled Synthetic Equity is a structure that has been set up to provide volatility controlled exposure to global equity 
markets. The volatility target is 10% and the underlying allocation is split between equity and cash to target this. The fair value of this 
mandate has been determined by the investment manager based on relevant guidance and represents the Net Asset Value of the 
underlying cash and derivatives providing equity exposure.
Insured Benefits are annuities held in the name of the Trustees with various providers. These annuities have been valued using  
the IAS19 assumptions.
Multi Asset Credit represents holdings in pooled investment vehicles investing in a range of credit assets such as loans, high-yield bonds 
and asset backed securities. The investment managers have full discretion in the selection of the underlying assets.
Diversified Growth Funds represent holdings in pooled investment vehicles investing in a range of growth assets such as equities, 
property, commodities, bonds and cash with managers having full discretion in the selection of the underlying assets.
Liability Driven Investment (LDI) consists of investments in the Aberdeen Standard Investments ILPS and State Street LDI funds,  
which use swap-based and gilt-based derivatives to hedge movements in the Plan’s liabilities (discussed in more detail below).

Financial Statements Directors’ Governance Strategic Report
The fair values of the investments in the Multi Asset Credit, Diversified Growth and LDI funds are provided by the investment managers, 
based on the values of the assets underlying these funds. The managers use quoted prices where available and determine the fair value 
of the unquoted investments based on relevant guidance.
The Plan does not directly invest in any of the Company’s own transferable financial instruments or any property occupied by, or other 
assets used by, the Company. The Plan does invest into funds that do have the discretion to purchase Company financial instruments 
(these are pooled funds with large numbers of investors), but the level from time to time would be expected to make up a very small 
proportion of overall Plan assets – significantly below the 5% self-investment threshold for UK pension schemes as set out in the  
Section 40 of the Pensions Act 1995.
Investment strategy
Investment managers are appointed by the Trustees to manage the Plan’s assets. The Trustees agree the strategic investment strategy 
after taking appropriate advice. Subject to the investment strategy laid down by the Trustees, day-to-day management of the Plan’s 
portfolio, which includes full discretion over stock selection, is the responsibility of the investment managers.
Over the course of 2017, the Trustees took a series of decisions regarding the investment strategy, with three main aims: to increase  
the level of interest rate and inflation hedging, to improve the cashflow generation of the Plan’s assets and to manage the equity 
downside risk.
• Between June 2014 and July 2016, the Plan’s liability matching assets were solely invested in a range of leveraged (fixed interest 
and inflation-linked) single gilt funds managed by State Street Global Advisors (SSGA).
• Between August 2016 and February 2017, the Plan’s investment in liability matching assets was increased by introducing an 
allocation in the Aberdeen Standard Investments ILPS fund range alongside the SSGA LDI portfolio. The ILPS fund range provides 
leveraged interest rate and inflation exposure using a mixture of gilt-based and swap-based derivatives. The leverage in the ILPS 
holdings is also used to provide diversified growth exposure on top of the hedging.
• Since February 2017, the SSGA LDI portfolio and the Aberdeen Standard Investments ILPS allocation have broadly hedged the Plan’s 
funded liabilities (as measured on a gilts + 0.5% pa basis).
• The other assets of the Plan are designed to provide growth and income over time, to meet the benefit payments as they fall due. 
Over the course of 2017, the Plan has added more income-focused assets (including investing £56 million into the TwentyFour 
Strategic Income Fund) and has added protection to the equity portfolio (replacing the Fidelity actively-managed physical equity 
funds, with a synthetic equity mandate with downside protection and volatility control).
• Overall, the changes to the investment strategy (both LDI and growth changes) should reduce the level of volatility in the Plan’s 
funding level.
Liability Driven Investments (LDI)
The Johnston Press Pension Plan invests in leveraged Liability Driven Investment (LDI) funds which use swap-based and gilt-based 
derivatives in order to match a proportion of the interest rate and inflation sensitivity of the Plan’s liabilities. The current leverage on 
the LDI mandates is around 2x-3x. This means that every £1 invested in LDI funds hedges £2-£3 of liabilities.
Under these strategies, if interest rates fall the value of the investments will rise to help match the increase in actuarial liabilities arising 
from the fall in the discount rate. Similarly, if interest rates rise, the investments will fall in value, as will the actuarial liabilities because  
of an increase in the discount rate.
If inflation rates rise the value of the investments will rise to help match the increase in actuarial liabilities arising from the rise in the inflation 
rate. Similarly, if inflation rates fall, the investments will fall in value, as will the actuarial liabilities because of a decrease in the inflation rate.
The LDI mandate targets 100% interest rate and inflation hedging of the funded liabilities calculated using a discount rate of 0.5% pa 
above gilt yields. This means that changes in interest rates and inflation will leave the funding level (calculated on a gilts + 0.5% basis)  
broadly unchanged.
At the year end, the total allocation to Liability Driven Investment strategies represented 39.3% of the total investment portfolio. 
This excludes a 7% allocation to a cash fund which sits alongside the leveraged LDI funds with State Street.
The Plan hedges its interest rate risk on a gilts basis whereas the IAS19 discount rate is based on AA corporate bond yields. There is 
therefore some mismatching risk should the yields on gilts and corporate bonds diverge. As a result of this mismatch, the funding 
level under IAS19 remains volatile to changes in corporate bond credit spreads that have not been hedged. 114

Sensitivity analysis of significant assumptions
The following tables present a sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumption showing how the defined benefit obligation 
would have been affected, by changes in the relevant actuarial assumptions that were reasonably possible at the reporting date:

The sensitivities above show the impact on the defined benefit obligation only, and not any offsetting impact on the value of Plan assets 
from the interest rate and inflation hedging strategies.
The sensitivity analysis is based on a change in one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant, therefore 
interdependencies between assumptions are excluded. In line with previous periods, the methodology applied is consistent  
to that used to determine the recognised pension liability.
The inflation assumption sensitivity above factors in the impact of a change in inflation on increases to deferred benefits 
and pensions in payment.
Other pension-related obligations
The Group has agreed to pay the expenses of the Plan and the PPF levy as they fall due.
The Plan has seen an increase in its obligations with respect to historic benefit equalisation for a specific group of members  
(‘the Affected Members’) for the Portsmouth & Sunderland section of the Plan. The Company made an application to the High Court 
(‘the Court’) for a declaration that Normal Retirement Dates (NRDs) for the Affected Members were validly equalised between male  
and female members. A court order dated 19 May 2016 was executed which revised the NRDs and this has been reflected as a past 
service cost of £3.5 million in the Income Statement for 2016.

News Media Association Pension Scheme
The Group is a member of the News Media Association (NMA), it was formerly a member of the Newspaper Society (an unincorporated 
body representing the interests of local newspaper publishers). During 2014 the Newspaper Society incorporated itself as a company 
limited by guarantee and entered into a merger with the Newspaper Publishers’ Association (a body representing the interests of 
publishers of national newspapers). As part of the merger, existing members entered into a deed of covenant in respect of the deficit  
to the Society’s defined benefit pension scheme. The members agreed to make contributions over a period of 25 years to 2038 or until 
such time as the deficit has been addressed, if earlier. The provision has been made on the former since we have no reliable estimate 
about the likelihood of the deficit being addressed before 2038 or, if it was, when this might happen. Applying a discount rate of 12.0%, 
the Group’s best estimate of this at present value is £0.8 million.
News Media Association Pension Scheme liabilities have been included within provisions (Note 24).
Other pension-related liabilities
The closing provision relating to unfunded pensions for senior employees was £0.5 million (31 December 2016: £0.5 million).  
The unfunded pension provision is assessed by a qualified actuary at each period end.
Post-retirement medical benefit pension-related liabilities for former Portsmouth and Sunderland members of £0.1 million  
(31 December 2016: £0.1 million). The post-retirement medical benefits represent management’s best estimate of the liability concerned.
Other pension-related liabilities have been included within provisions (Note 24).

1 In the prior period Intangible included £3.2 million of deferred tax in relation to the East Midlands publishing titles that have been reclassified to assets held for sale 
ahead of their disposal by the Group in January 2017.
The deferred tax movements credited through the Income Statement in the period total £16.3 million. Deferred tax movements  
charged to the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period total £2.0 million. There is no impact of rate changes to  
the deferred tax balances in the current period, as the substantively enacted reduction of the standard rate of corporation tax to 17%  
was reflected in the prior periods, where appropriate.
The £13.3 million deferred tax credit recognised in the income statement relating to intangible assets has largely arisen from  
£59.2 million of impairment charges on the Group’s publishing title intangible assets (£10.1 million deferred tax credit) and the  
disposal of the East Anglia and East Midlands publishing titles in January 2017 resulting in a deferred tax credit of £3.2 million. 116
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

23. Deferred tax continued
The deferred tax credit of £3.9 million relating to the Group’s Bond largely includes £4.3 million deferred tax credit on the Bond fair  
value loss of £22.8 million recorded in the period. A correction to the Bond issue cost treatment has been made in the period, relating  
to the issue costs incurred as part of the Group’s 2014 refinancing. The correction will result in the Bond issue costs being amortised to the 
Income Statement over the term of the Bond, within Johnston Press plc, rather than the initial treatment to take an immediate deduction 
in 2014 when the costs were incurred and paid. The correction gives rise to a £0.8 million prior year deferred tax credit adjustment.
In November 2017, the UK government introduced new rules with effect from 1 April 2017 which would restrict the deductibility of net 
interest costs. Due to uncertainty regarding the Group’s ability to recover the disallowed interest which can be carried forward under 
these rules, no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the disallowed amount. Having also assessed the recoverability of its 
deferred tax assets from timing differences, the Group has recognised a deferred tax charge of £2.1 million to derecognised deferred tax 
assets due to uncertainty as to the timing of future recoverability.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances (before offset) for

Onerous leases and dilapidations
Where the Group exits a rented property, an estimate of the anticipated total future cost payable under the terms of the operating lease, 
including rentals, rates and other related expenses is provided for at the point of exit as an onerous lease. Where exited properties are 
sublet to a third party, an estimate of the expected future rental income is deducted from the provision balance.
Under the terms of a number of property leases, the Group is required to return the property to its original condition at the lease expiry 
date. The Group has estimated the expected costs of leases expiring or expected to be terminated and has also assessed the entire 
portfolio and made provisions depending on the state of the property and the duration of the lease and likely rectification requirements.
In the current year there was a change in the estimate for the anticipated total future cost payable for onerous leases and dilapidations, 
arising from a change in the Group’s property strategy. This resulted in an additional provision of £4.4 million being charged.

The Group has only one class of ordinary shares which has no right to fixed income. Both classes of preference shares carry the right, 
subject to the discretion and ability of the Group to distribute profits, to a fixed dividend of 13.75% and rank in priority to the ordinary 
shares. Given the discretionary nature of the dividend right, the preference shares are considered to be equity under IAS 32. Deferred 
shares and second class deferred shares are not entitled to receive any dividends or distributions.
Share warrants
The Company issued share warrants over a total of 12.5% of its issued share capital to former lenders (with 5.0% issued 28 August 2009, 
2.5% issued 24 April 2012 and 5.0% issued 21 September 2012). Each of the share warrants had the right to subscribe for 0.1533799 
ordinary shares at an exercise price of £1.9745 per share and expired on 30 September 2017. Where warrants were exercised they were 
settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of ordinary shares and received a fixed amount of cash in return and so qualified as 
equity under IAS 39. The Binomial Option pricing model was used to assess the fair value of the share warrants issued in the financial 
year that they were issued. At the balance sheet date no warrants were outstanding.

Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its office properties and motor vehicle fleet. 
Property leases are negotiated for an average of ten years typically, with a break after five years or in regard to smaller offices these  
are negotiated under more flexible terms with an average length of one year. The increase in future minimum lease payments in  
the period is a result of the inclusion of motor vehicle feet in the balance. The Group pays insurance, maintenance and repairs of  
these properties. Leases in the case of vehicles are negotiated over four years and are fixed for the full rental period.

Under the capital refinancing agreement completed on 23 June 2014, the Group and all its material subsidiaries entered into new 
security arrangements in connection with the Bonds issued and the revolving credit facility. The security provided includes fixed and 
floating charges over all or substantially all of the assets of certain members of the Group and share security over shares of certain 
members of the Group. Whilst the Bonds remain outstanding, the revolving credit facility was cancelled on completion of the sale 
of the East Anglia and the East Midlands titles to Iliffe Media Limited (refer Note 16).
Contingent liabilities
Iconic Newspapers Limited
On 1 April 2014, the Group entered into a sale agreement with Iconic Newspaper Limited for the sale of the trade and assets of the Group’s 
regional newspapers in the Republic of Ireland, including its Donegal titles, for £7.1 million. As a condition to the sale, Johnston Press plc agreed 
to provide a guarantee in respect of the performance of certain obligations of the entities within the Group making the disposal of the trade 
and assets up to a maximum aggregate limit of £3 million. That guarantee was effective for up to 36 months following completion of the sale. 
The Group was not called upon to make any payments under the guarantee and the guarantee expired on 31 March 2017.
Iliffe Media
On 17 January 2017, the Group entered into a sale agreement to dispose of certain publishing titles to Iliffe Media (Note 16).
As a condition of the sale, Johnston Press plc will incur costs associated with the refurbishment of property included within assets 
disposed of to Iliffe Media Ltd. The maximum obligation that the Group can possibly incur is £0.2 million and no provision has been 
included in the Group Statement of Financial Position.

Group Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme. This has been approved by the Inland Revenue and allows options to  
be granted to eligible employees who save amounts deducted from post-tax income monthly under arrangements with the relevant 
plan managers for a period of either three, five or seven years. The Savings-Related Share Option Schemes up to and including 2010 are 
operated by Computershare Plan Managers. The 2013 scheme is operated by Yorkshire Building Society and under a change in HMRC 
rules is for a period of three or five years. The right to exercise is at the discretion of the employee within six months following the end  
of the period of saving. 120

of 1.2 years (2016: 0.6 years).
The above options were granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the invitation being sent to employees  
on 1 September 2009, 1 September 2010 and 30 August 2013, respectively. The revised Sharesave Scheme was approved at the  
Annual General Meeting in May 2017. A discount of 20% to the average mid-market price was applied to the issues granted in 2009.  
No discount was applied to the 2010 issue and a discount of 10% was applied to the 2013 issue. There were no options granted under 
the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme in either 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017.
Performance Share Plan
The Group makes awards to Executive Directors and certain senior employees on an annual basis under the Performance Share  
Plan (PSP). No options were granted in 2017. The awards vest after three years if certain performance criteria are met during that  
period. If the scheme conditions are met at the vesting date participants have 10 years from the date of grant to exercise the option.  
All options granted are nil-cost options.
The vesting of the shares is on the basis that two performance conditions are met, being EPS and TSR on a 50:50 basis, on the  
same basis as the previous PSP awards. The fair value of the TSR/market-based condition of the award has been determined  
using a Stochastic model. The Black-Scholes model has been used to value the EPS/performance-based condition of the award.

The Group did not undertake any related party transactions during the current or preceding period to associated parties.
Transactions with Directors
There were no material transactions with Directors of the Company during the year, except for those relating to remuneration 
and shareholdings, disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
For the purposes of IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures, management below the level of the Company’s Board are not regarded

31.  Financial instruments
a) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the 
return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. Refer to the Strategic Review for further details.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalents  
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed  
in Note 25 and in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
b) Gearing ratio
The Board of Directors formally reviews the capital structure of the Group when considering any major corporate transactions. As part of 
these reviews, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Based on the recommendations 
of the Board, the Group will seek to balance its overall capital structure when appropriate through new share issues and share buy backs 
as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt. The Board judges that the gearing ratio of the Group to not be 
sustainable in the long-term. On 29 March 2017 the Group announced it had commenced a Strategic Review, working with its advisers 
Rothschild and Ashurst LLP, to assess the financing options open to the Group in relation to the Bonds. Refer to the Liquidity and Going 
Concern and Viability Statement sections in the Corporate Governance Report for further details.

f) Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s treasury function supports the business and monitors and, with Group finance, manages the financial risks relating to 
the operations of the Group through assessment of the exposures by degree and magnitude of risk. These risks include market risk 
(including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board and guidelines agreed with the Group’s 
lenders that must be operated within. The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial 
instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Group finance function reports regularly to the Executive Directors and the Board. The Group has an Audit Committee, but does 
not have a specific Risk Committee.
g) Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates (refer to section i) and foreign currency 
exchange (refer to section h).
At a Group and Company level, market risk exposures are assessed using sensitivity analyses.
There have been no changes to the Group’s exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures risk. 124
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017

h) Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes certain operational transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise.

Foreign currency sensitivity
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 5% change in pounds sterling against the euro and a 5% change in pounds 
sterling against the US dollar. These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent 
management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The Group does not hedge the euro income or deposits or trade payables because the risk of foreign exchange movements is not 
deemed to be significant.
The Group buys newsprint in sterling through Daily Mail General Trust (DMGT), who source the paper from the UK, Europe and 
North America. Newsprint pricing is inextricably linked to its global commodity status and as a result the Group is exposed 
to foreign currency risk on paper purchases.
The sensitivity analysis of the Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change 
taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period. A positive number indicates  
an increase in profit or loss and other equity where pounds sterling strengthens against the respective currency. For a 5% weakening  
of the sterling against the relevant currency, there is an equal and opposite impact on profit or loss and other equity, 
and the balances below reverse signs.

i) Interest rate risk management
As mentioned in Note 21 (Borrowings), the Group issued 8.625% senior secured notes (Bond) which has fixed the interest costs  
for the Group borrowings and eliminates interest rate risk. As a result the Group no longer has the need to use financial derivatives.
In addition, the Group’s undrawn Revolving Credit Facility which carried a floating interest rate if utilised, was cancelled on the 
completion of the sale of Johnston Publishing East Anglia Limited to Iliffe Media Ltd on the 17 January 2017. Refer to Note 16 for 
further details.
Measurement
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into three levels based on the  
extent to which the fair value is observable. The levels are classified as follows:
• Level 1: fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identified financial assets and liabilities.
• Level 2: fair value is determined using directly observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs.
• Level 3: fair value is determined on inputs not based on observable market data.
The available for sale investments are classified as Level 3 financial instruments. There have been no transfers between the various levels 
of the fair value hierarchy during the period.

j) Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.  
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss  
from defaults. The Group’s policy on dealing with trade customers is described in Notes 3 and 20.
The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored. As far as possible, the aggregate value 
of transactions is spread across a number of approved counterparties.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit 
evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar 
characteristics, the latter being defined as connected entities, other than with some of the larger advertising agencies. In the case of the 
latter, a close relationship exists between the Group and the agencies and appropriate allowances for doubtful debts are in place. The 
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The following table shows the total estimated exposure to credit risk for all of the Group’s financial assets, excluding trade receivables 
which are discussed in Note 20:

k) Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity  
risk management framework for the management of the Group’s short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management 
requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities  
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity risk is further discussed in the Financial Review on page 23 and in the Liquidity and Going Concern and Viability Statement 
sections in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 45 to 47.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the 52 week period ended 30 December 2017
33. Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of accounting and preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets  
the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
Accordingly, the financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 (Financial Reporting Standard 102)  
‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council.  
In December 2017 the Financial Reporting Council released Amendments to FRS102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable  
in the UK and Republic of Ireland. These amendments have been adopted in the 52 week period ended 30 December 2017 but  
are not considered to have had a material effect on the financial statements.
The Company is a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available to it  
in respect of its separate financial statements. Exemptions have been taken in relation to the profit and loss account, share-based 
payments, financial instruments, presentation of a cash-flow statement, intra-group transactions and remuneration of key personnel.
The Company’s result for the period, determined in accordance with the Act, was a net loss after tax of £57.0 million (31 December 2016: 
loss of £654.5 million). The prior period net loss after tax has been restated. Refer below in Note 33 for details. The financial statements 
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments, unlisted investments and share-based payments as 
explained in the principal accounting policies adopted set out below.
The 2017 period was for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2017 with the prior period being for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2016.
Restatements (refer to reconciliations in notes 36, 37 and 38)
Intercompany and investment balances
The Company Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2016 and Company Statement of Changes in Equity for the 52 week period ended 
31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect:
1. Revised methodology applied to the assessment of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries and intercompany debtor 
balances, including group relief receivable. The Directors have reassessed the methodology applied to calculate the value in use of 
the business and applied it first to support the recoverability of intercompany debtor balances, then against group relief receivable 
and finally against the value of investments in subsidiaries. The impact of this revised methodology on the financial statements for  
the period ended 31 December 2016 has been to increase the provision against intercompany receivable balances by £22.4 million, 
recognise a provision against the group relief receivable of £18.5 million and increase the provision against investments in subsidiaries 
by £108.9 million. This increases the net loss after tax and net liabilities by £149.8 million.
2. The balance sheet at 31 December 2016 presented net intercompany receivable and payable balances relating to the flow through  
of dividends across a number of group companies up to the Company. In light of the revised methodology for calculating the value in 
use of the business, the Directors have investigated the flow of the dividends and have determined the correct accounting treatment 
is to record increases in the Company’s intercompany receivable and intercompany payable balances. The impact of this restatement 
on the financial statements as at 31 December 2016 has been to: increase creditors: amounts falling due within one year by £6.4 million, 
increase the net loss after tax by £6.4 million (being the £6.4 million increase in the gross debtors: due within one year which has been 
provided against in full) and increase net liabilities by £6.4 million.
3. The balance sheet at 31 December 2016 presented gross intercompany receivable balances of £3.0 million and corresponding 
intercompany payable balances of the same amount. In light of the revised methodology for calculating the value in use of the 
business, the Directors have investigated the nature of the intercompany balances and have determined the correct accounting 
treatment is to present these balances net rather than gross in the balance sheet. The impact of this restatement on the financial 
statements as at 31 December 2016 has been to: decrease creditors: amounts falling due within one year by £3.0 million, decrease  
the net loss after tax by £3.0 million (as the £3.0 million decrease in the gross debtors: due within one year had previously been 
provided against in full), and decrease net liabilities by £3.0 million.
4. The Directors have investigated the nature of the intercompany balances and have determined the correct accounting treatment  
as 31 December 2016 is to reinstate certain balances in the financial statements of the Company and the relevant subsidiaries.  
The impact of this restatement on the financial statements as at 31 December 2016 has been to:
a. increase creditors: amounts falling due within one year by £5.9 million, increase the net loss after tax by £5.9 million, and to 
increase net liabilities by £5.9 million; and
b. increase debtors: amounts falling due within one year by £18.5 million, which has been fully provided against. As such there 
has been no impact on net loss after tax or net liabilities.
Bond issue costs
Previously issuance costs of £8.0 million, incurred by the Company in raising the Group’s 8.625% Senior Secured Notes (the bond) 
entered into on 16 May 2014, were incorrectly written off in the period ended 3 January 2015. The financial statements for the period 
ended 31 December 2016 have been restated to reflect the correct accounting treatment. This is to capitalise the issuance costs  
of £8.0 million when incurred and to amortise them over the life of the bond, which is repayable in full on 1 June 2019. The impact  
of the restatement on the financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2016 has been to:
• Reduce creditors – due within one year by £1.6 million. This consists of the capitalised bond issuance costs debtor of £1.6 million, 
presented as a reduction in intercompany creditors (Note 36). This represents the component of the amortised cost of the bond 
issuance debtor due to be amortised in the 52 week period ended 30 December 2017;
• Reduce creditors – due after more than one year by £2.7 million. This consists of the capitalisation of the bond issuance costs debtor  
of £2.7 million (Note 36). This represents the component of the amortised cost of the bond issuance debtor due to be amortised after 
the 52 week period ended 30 December 2017; and
• Increase reserves by £4.3 million. This consists of an increase in retained earnings as at 2 December 2016 of £5.8 million reinstating the 
amortised cost of the issue costs at that date, offset by the amortisation charge in the 52 week period ended 31 December 2016 of 
£1.5 million. This has the effect of reducing the profit after tax for the 52 week period ended 31 December 2016 by £1.5 million. Refer  
to notes 37 and 38 and the Company Statement of Changes in Equity. 130
Johnston Press plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial Statements
33. Significant Accounting Policies continued
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that, subject to the material uncertainty 
described in the Liquidity and Going Concern paragraphs of the Corporate Governance Report on pages 45 to 47, both the Company  
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in Note 1 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements within the section on ‘Going concern’ and in the Viability statement.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed asset balances are shown at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on 
all property, plant and equipment, excluding land, at varying rates calculated to write-off cost over the useful lives. The principal rates 
employed are:
Plant and machinery; 20% straight-line basis
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. Unlisted investments are shown 
at Directors’ valuation. Upward revaluations are credited to the revaluation reserve. Downward revaluations in excess of any previous 
upward revaluations are taken to the Profit and Loss account.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premium payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the Profit and Loss account using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise. Fees incurred in negotiating borrowings are held on the Balance Sheet and amortised to the Profit and Loss account over  
the term of the underlying debt.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax  
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the period end date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred  
at the period end date. Timing differences are differences between the Company’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the  
financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which  
they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected 
to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the period end date.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based benefits to certain employees. These share-based payments are measured at their fair 
value at the date of grant and the fair value of expected shares is expensed to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over  
the vesting period. Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model, as amended to take account of the Directors’ best estimate 
of probable share vesting and exercise.
Dividends
Dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved. In the 
Company’s financial statements, dividends receivable from subsidiaries are recognised as assets in the period in which the dividends 
are approved.
Preference shares
All the preference shares carry the right, subject to the discretion and ability of the Company to distribute profits, to a fixed dividend 
of 13.75% and rank in priority to the ordinary shares. Due to the significant impairment that arose during the financial year ended 
31 December 2016 and which extinguished distributable reserves, preference share dividends cannot be paid. Given the discretionary 
nature of the dividend right to be paid in the current year, the preference shares are considered to be equity under IAS 32.
In the event that the Company returns to a position in which it has distributable reserves, the Board will consider paying all unpaid 
dividends from such date as when the last payment was made. The Group is under no legal obligation to make a payment in respect  
of prior year dividends.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Balance Sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of that instrument.
The Company’s activities and funding structure give rise to some exposure to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign 
currency exchange rates. The Company uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage these exposures.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised directly in the Profit and Loss Account.

The Directors performed an assessment of the recoverability of the investments in subsidiaries balance as at 30 December 2017 and 
determined that the balance was not supportable. As a result an impairment charge of £0.7 million has been recognised in the period 
to write the net book value off to nil.
The Directors have re-assessed the basis of their impairment methodology in 2017 and have completed a re-assessment of the  
carrying value of the investment balances using this updated methodology for the period ended 31 December 2016. The value in  
use of the titles and press assets of the Group have been applied first against the value of intercompany debtor balances, resulting  
in the full impairment of the investment in subsidiaries. This has led to an additional charge for impairment of £108.8 million applied  
in relation to the period ended 31 December 2016. Refer to Note 33 for further details.
In the prior period, the Company disposed of its fully impaired unlisted investment in Mirago plc.

1  In the prior period the News Media Association (‘NMA’) Pension Scheme obligation in the Company only financial statements was disclosed within accruals as  
it was considered immaterial in the company only financial statements and not separately disclosed. However, in the current year management have reassessed  
the balance sheet classification of the NMA Pension Scheme obligation and now consider separate disclosure as a provision material. Therefore the Directors have 
re-presented the prior year amount within provisions for liabilities in the balance sheet in the Company only financial statements. The impact of the prior year 
re-presentation on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2016 has been to increase current provisions by £0.1 million with a corresponding decrease to Creditors: 
amounts falling due within one year and to increase non-current provisions by £0.6 million with a corresponding decrease to Creditors: amounts falling due after 
more than one year.
2  The unfunded ex-gratia pension provision is assessed by a qualified actuary at each period end. Refer to Note 22 for further details. 138

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE (NON-GAAP) MEASURES
Introduction
The Directors assess the performance of the Group using both statutory accounting measures and a variety of alternative performance 
measures (APMs). The key APMs monitored by the Group are:
• adjusted revenue;
• adjusted EBITDA;
• adjusted EBITDA margin %;
• adjusted operating profit;
• adjusted operating profit margin %; and
• cash and net debt (excluding mark-to-market). Refer to Financial Review on page 23 for calculation of net debt (excluding mark- 
to-market).
The business has been through a period of enormous change over an extended period. This has resulted from structural change in  
the sector. Audiences have increased their use of online and mobile platforms to access information and news, resulting in accelerated 
newspaper circulation volume decline. Advertisers have also increasingly sought to use digital services to reach their target audiences. 
Together, this structural shift has resulted in year-on-year declines in the Group’s income.
The Group has initiated a series of restructuring programs to remove cost from the business with the objective of designing a sustainable 
print publishing business model, while at the same time investing in building a digital income stream.
The resulting restructuring projects have seen a substantial redesign of each area of the business, including management layers  
and structures, products and services, content creation and our sales routes to market. In streamlining the organisation, a significant 
investment in redundancy has seen more than 2047 posts closed over the last four years. The Group has also sought to reflect its change 
in shape and scale in support areas including making substantial reductions in its property portfolio, technology licences and fleet.  
The speed of its action, both in anticipating and responding to recent changes in the sector has meant that some existing contracts  
no longer reflect the current needs of the business.
In 2017, the Group initiated new changes to its business model, including how it allocated resources to different brands, its mix of field 
and call centre based sales staff, while also adopting a clear policy of downsizing its property portfolio, taking advantage of natural lease 
breaks, typically moving to smaller short-term serviced offices in local towns and cities, while maintaining larger hubs in Preston, Leeds, 
Edinburgh, Peterborough, Sheffield and Portsmouth.
To provide investors and other users of the Group’s financial statements with additional clarity and understanding of both the cost of  
this business change programme, and the resulting impact on the Group’s underlying trading, the Directors believe that it is appropriate 
to additionally present the alternative performance measures used by management in running the business and in determining 
management and executive remuneration.
Although management believes the alternative performance measures are important in considering the performance of the Group, 
they are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to financial information on a statutory basis. The 
adjusted figures are not a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework, and therefore may  
not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. When reviewing and selecting these adjusting items, the Directors 
considered the guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
A reconciliation between the statutory and the adjusted results is provided under Alternative Performance Measures within the financial 
information. The reconciliation includes explanations each ‘adjusting item’ and why they been adjusted for. An adjusting item is one that 
is judged to require separate presentation to enable a better understanding of the trading performance of the business in the period. 
Items are adjusted if they are significant in value and/or do not form part of ongoing underlying trading. They will in many cases be 
‘one-off’, and include items that span more than one financial period.
Prior year comparatives have been restated so that the adjusted results are presented on a consistent basis between periods. Restated 
figures have been disclosed in footnotes below. In the opinion of the Directors, disclosing the adjusting items provides supplementary 
information to aid understanding of the Group’s trading performance and also provides a basis of comparison between periods. 139

A1 Disposed titles
On 17 January 2017, the Group sold its East Anglia and East Midlands titles to Iliffe Media Ltd. Adjustments made in 2017 in respect  
of these titles relate to revenue earned in the two-week period up to the date of disposal of £0.3 million (2016: £10.2 million). This 
adjustment is necessary in order to present results for the Group’s ongoing business portfolio. A prior year adjustment has been included 
to ensure the adjusted results are presented on a consistent basis between periods. The cost of sales and operating costs associated  
with the adjusted disposed titles revenue has also been adjusted. Refer to Note B below for details.
A2 Closed titles and digital products
As part of the ongoing review of the Group’s business portfolio, titles and products considered to be underperforming or not in line with 
the Group’s strategic objectives have been closed. Revenue relating to the closed titles and products has been adjusted out to provide 
users with a view of the results of the Group’s continuing business portfolio. The prior year comparative figures have been restated to 
exclude revenue for the titles and products closed during 2017, in order to present results for the Group’s ongoing business portfolio.  
The cost of sales and operating costs associated with the adjusted closed titles and digital products revenue has also been adjusted. 
Refer to Note B below for details. Details on the closed titles and products revenue adjustments are set out in the table below:

titles (2016: 13 titles) were closed during the year. Related revenue of £0.1 million 
(2016: £1.0 million) has been adjusted.
Digital brands – 335 Revenue of £0.3 million in the prior period has been adjusted in respect of the 
DealMonster and Business Directory businesses which were closed in 2016.
Motors – 319 The contract with motors.co.uk for online motor sales expired in March 2016. 
Related revenue of £0.3 million in the prior period has been adjusted for.
Total adjusting item 56 1,681
B Cost of sales and operating costs
Adjustments are made for cost of sales and operating costs directly attributable to revenue adjusted in relation to disposed and closed 
titles. This adjustment has been made to ensure adjusted cost of sales expense is presented on a basis that is consistent with adjusted 
revenue (Refer to Notes A1 and A2 above for details on adjusted revenue). Costs adjusted for are set out in the table on page 141.

C Restructuring
Business transformation, restructuring and redundancy-related costs that are incurred in order to streamline individual components  
of the Group’s business, reduce cost and support long-term strategy are recorded as adjusting items. In treating these costs as adjusting 
items, management assesses whether the redundancies relate to a fundamental restructure of individual components of the business. 
The Group adjusts for and reports the cost of each years’ restructuring program to assist the users of the financial statements in 
understanding both the cost of the restructuring programme, and the resulting trading performance in the year. A breakdown  
of the adjustments for restructuring costs is provided in the table below:
52 weeks to 
30 December 
2017
£’000
52 weeks to 
31 December 
2016
£’000 Explanation
Redundancy costs 6,357 5,607 These costs are material and incurred to transform and restructure the 
business cost base resulting in a reduction in headcount. Redundancy costs 
include the employee costs from the point the individual notified that their 
role is at risk, together with the final termination payment for the individual 
made redundant. The Group has consistently applied this policy historically. 
This reflects its impact of the disruption caused to the individual involved  
and the impact on short-term productivity within affected business units.
Adjustments for redundancy costs do not include those incurred in the 
ordinary course of business, which are treated as operating costs, or that  
may lead to a direct replacement being appointed.
Business and sales 
transformation
1,974 2,848 These costs are material, and are incurred in engaging specialist consultants  
to advise on the strategic restructuring of the publishing portfolio, as part  
of the redesign of the business to create a sustainable publishing model. 
Management considers carefully that these costs do not represent costs that 
support the underlying running of the business which would not be adjusted 
items. This item also includes costs incurred to permanently restructure and 
streamline the Group’s field sales operation and move activity into the media 
sales centre (MSC).
Property-related 
restructuring
4,369 432 The Group has incurred property costs as a result of decisions taken to  
reduce head count and streamline its operating locations. An empty property 
provision of £3.2 million (2016: £0.4 million) was charged in the period,  
which includes an additional £1.3 million charge in the period following a 
reassessment of the Irish property provision. The Group no longer occupies 
these properties following the disposal of the Irish operations in 2014  
but retains the head leases, and sublets properties to Iconic. During 2017  
the Group exited leases of 25 properties (2016: 26 properties) covering  
228 thousand square feet (2016: 161 thousand square feet).
A £1.2 million dilapidations provision (2016: nil) has been charged in the  
period following a reassessment of estimates used in determining the 
provision requirements.
Onerous contracts 1,045 412 As a result of the Group’s restructuring activities, aimed at cutting the cost 
base of the Group, certain IT licences, phones and vehicles have become 
surplus to operational requirements following reductions in staff numbers. 
The £0.8 million (2016: £0.4 million) profit and loss impact of these onerous 
costs has been adjusted for.
In addition, during 2017 the Group provided notice that it will return the 
Yorkshire Metro franchise to DMGT during 2018. The £0.2 million (2016: £nil) 
provision recognised at 30 December 2017 for losses expected to be incurred 
through the notice period has been adjusted for.

D Acquisitions/(Disposals)
Acquisition costs and gains and losses on disposal of subsidiaries and properties can be significant in size, irregular in nature and 
fluctuate from period-to-period. Subsidiary and large property disposals and acquisitions are not ordinary trading activities as they relate to 
structural changes to the Group’s business. As a result the gains realised and losses and costs incurred on these items have been treated 
as adjusting items. This is done to provide results that are reflective of the Group’s continuing trading operations. The adjusting items are 
detailed in the table below:

(Gain)/Loss on 
disposals of property
(2,433) 166 Gains adjusted in the current period were realised on sales of properties in 
Sheffield £1.9 million and Peterborough £0.5 million. The adjusted item in the 
prior period largely consists of the loss on sale of the Upper Mounts property 
in Northampton of £0.1 million.
i acquisition 508 1,755 Represents acquisition costs incurred to purchase the i newspaper on 10 April 
2016 and a further one-off contractual payment to ESI in April 2017 and are 
adjusted so as not to distort the Group’s trading results. The payment was 
disclosed in Part V, clause 9 of the ‘Proposed acquisition of the business  
and certain assets of I Circular to Shareholders’ document.
Loss on disposal of 
subsidiary
611 – Represents the loss on sale of Johnston Publishing East Anglia Ltd, which 
included the East Anglia and East Midlands titles, to Iliffe Media Ltd on 
17 January 2017. The loss has been classified as an adjusting item as it is 
individually significant, relates to divestment of titles and is not reflective  
of the Group’s ongoing trading results. The loss represents the differences 
between book value and net proceeds.
The revenue, cost of sales and other costs in relation to the disposed titles  
have also been treated as adjusting items for the two weeks of trading in  
2017 and the prior period comparative. Refer to Notes A1 and B for details.
Other – 617 Represents costs incurred by the Group to assess strategic acquisition and 
divestment opportunities.

E Impairment of assets
Impairment charges relating to non-current assets are non-cash items and can be significant in amount. The Group treats impairment 
charges as adjusting items as they relate to the difference between the remaining carrying value of historic investment costs, and 
estimated future value, and are not part of underlying trading. The valuation is calculated based on judgement of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted using a post-tax discount rate of 11.0% (2016: 11.0%) (refer to Notes 13 and 14), which is a market determined discount 
rate, not the Group’s cost of capital.

F Strategic review
Legal and advisory costs of £3.4 million (2016: £0.7 million) in relation to the strategic review disclosed in the Liquidity and going concern 
and Viability Statement sections of the Corporate Governance Report on pages 45 to 47, have been adjusted for. This includes costs 
incurred on advisers to the Group, and advisers to the ad hoc committees and pension Trustees, which the Group is obliged to fund. 
Costs incurred in relation to this strategic review are non-trading in nature. They are treated as adjusting items to provide improved 
understanding of the ongoing trading performance of the Group.
G Pensions
The Johnston Press Pension Plan (‘the Plan’) is a defined benefit pension plan that closed to new members and future accrual in June 
2010 (for details refer to Note 22). At 30 December 2017, the membership base was as follows:
30 December 2017
Deferred 
members
Pension 
members Total
Plan members employed by the Group 249 27 276
Total Plan members 2,412 2,547 4,959
% of total Plan members employed by the Group 10.3% 1.1% 5.6%
94.4% of the Plan members are no longer employed by the Group. The number of staff working in the business, who are members  
of the Plan has reduced over time, both as the result of restructuring activity, but also resignation and retirement. Costs associated 
with operating the Plan are treated as adjusting items because they are not incurred in running the business, nor in generating its 
revenue, and do not form part of underlying trading. In contrast, contributions made by the Group to the defined contribution schemes 
nominated by the Group’s employees, in respect of their employment by the Group are not treated as adjusting items. This is because 
they are deemed to be part of the cost of employing the Group’s continuing workforce. 144

Defined  
benefit pension 
scheme costs
1,289 953 The Group is required to pay the costs incurred by its trustees in 
administrating the pension plan, which was closed to new members and 
future accrual in June 2010. Given that the vast majority of the members  
of the Plan are no longer employed by the Group, costs associated with 
operating the Plan are treated as adjusting items. The costs include 
£0.6 million (2016: £0.6 million) of ongoing operational costs and £0.7 million  
(2016: £0.4 million) of costs incurred in valuing and managing the Plan.
Pension Protection 
Fund (PPF) levy
270 422 The levy is a charge by the PPF who become responsible for scheme 
members’ pensions if the Group becomes unable to meet its pension 
obligations. This cost is significant and can fluctuate from period to period 
and is material, with historic PPF levy costs being as high as £3.2 million  
in 2013/2014.
The Group has limited ability to influence this cost, which is determined  
by PPF by reference to the balance sheet of Johnston Publishing Limited.
Pension  
equalisation
339 4,055 The 2017 adjustment is the impact of the Scottish pension equalisation 
litigation of £0.3 million, which was concluded and cash settled during 2017.
The prior year amount of £4.1 million is the impact of the Portsmouth and 
Sunderland (P&S) pension equalisation court order and related advisory  
and legal costs. The PSN equalisation had previously been disclosed as  
a contingency risk of up to £8 million.
Both items have been adjusted for to improve the comparability of results 
to assess the on-going performance of the Group.
Total adjusting 
items 1,898 5,430
In 2014, the Group agreed to a schedule of contributions to the scheme. In 2017, the Group paid £10.3 million (2016: £9.7 million) to  
the Plan. As part of the deficit reduction program. These payments are not charged to the Group income statement, in line with IAS19 
Employee Benefits, and so are not adjusting items, and so are not shown here.

Long-term incentive 
plan (LTIP) costs
1,361 1,900 LTIP expenses are material and have been classified as an adjusting item  
from the point at which it was clear that the trigger prices would not be met. 
An amount of £0.8 million (2016: £1.0 million) relating to the Value Creation  
Plan has been charged to the profit and loss account but has been credited 
back to retained earnings as it was not paid out (refer Note 29 for details).
Reset of revolving 
credit facility
– 315 The prior period adjusting item represents professional fees to renegotiate  
the reset revolving credit facility following the acquisition of the i and in 
anticipation of the sale of the East Anglia and East Midlands titles. These costs 
were adjusted for in 2016 as they did not represent costs relating to ongoing 
trading of the Group. The facility ceased in January 2017, when it was cancelled 
following the sale of the East Anglia and East Midlands titles. No related costs 
were incurred in 2017.

I Depreciation and amortisation
The current period operating profit adjusting items includes accelerated depreciation and amortisation of £0.6 million arising  
from a result of a review of the carrying value of the consumer database and £0.3 million on properties. The prior period adjustment 
comprises accelerated depreciation and amortisation of £0.5 million arising as a result of a review of websites held within the Group.
J Net finance expense on pension assets/liabilities
Net pension interest expense of £1.7 million (2016: £0.8 million) required under IAS 19 relating to the net interest on the pension scheme 
liabilities less assets has been adjusted as it does not relate to underlying trading activities. It is a non-cash item under IAS19 Employee 
Benefits. This treatment is consistent with cash pension costs incurred in respect of the closed defined benefit pension scheme (refer  
to section G Pensions).
K Fair value movement of borrowings
The fair value movement on the Group’s Bond required under IAS 39 is volatile. It does not reflect the gross debt outstanding and it  
is treated as an adjusting item to provide the user with clarity of the gross bond liability. Therefore, the fair value loss of £22.8 million, 
resulting from an increase in the bond market value, (2016: gain of £43.6 million) has been treated as an adjusting item.
L Finance cost
An adjustment of £0.4 million has been made in 2017 in relation to the write-off of revolving credit facility issuance costs in 2014 required 
as a result of the termination of the facility in January 2017, following the disposal of the East Anglia and East Midlands titles. The cost 
relating to the period after termination has been treated as an adjusting item as it does not relate to the operating performance of  
the Group.
The prior period includes an adjustment of £0.5 million made in relation to unrecoverable VAT on the 2014 refinancing fees. The 
refinancing costs were treated as adjusting items in 2014, when incurred, as they were material in value and as a result were adjusted.
M Tax credit/(charge)
The taxation impact of the adjusting items of £23.3 million (2016: £57.3 million) has been adjusted for. The derecognition of £2.2 million 
(2016: £nil) worth of deferred tax assets due to the Director’s no longer deeming them to be recoverable has been treated as an  
adjusting item.
