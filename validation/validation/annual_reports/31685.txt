Chairman’s Statement
Sir Michael Heller
Turnover for the year to 30 September 2017 
was £5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the previous year, an increase of 3%. At the 
half-year stage, we reported that sales activity 
had improved modestly compared to the 
previous year and that continued into the 
second half in spite of a challenging market.
Adjusted operating profit was £540,000, 
compared with £430,000 last year, an 
increase of 26%. This profit measure, 
which excludes non-cash IFRS items and 
exceptional non-trading costs, is reconciled 
to statutory operating profit in note 4 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
As management exercised tight control 
to maintain overheads at similar levels to 
the previous year, the increase in sales had 
a significant impact on operating profit.
Statutory pre-tax profit for the year also 
increased to £417,000 compared with 
£244,000 the prior year, an increase of 
71%. Last year’s result included one-off 
property costs of £104,000 relating to a 
property that we have now sold. Adjusting 
for that item would result in an increase 
in statutory pre-tax profit of 20%. 
Contracted recurring revenues, which 
comprise annual software licence fees and 
periodic hosting charges, remained strong 
at 80% of total revenues (2016: 82%). 
Revenues delivered through our hosting 
centre continued to increase and in the year 
under review represented 61% of total 
revenues (2016: 59%).
R&D cash expenditure for the year was 
£901,000 (2016: £982,000) and was 
principally focussed on continued 
enhancements to our key products, 
Quantum VS and Vecta.
As previously reported, we sold our remaining 
surplus freehold property for £1.2 million in 
December 2016. The property’s carrying value 
had previously been adjusted to reflect the 
expected net sale proceeds which, after 
disposal costs, amounted to £1.17 million. 
The process that we started some years ago, 
to dispose of six freehold properties which 
had become surplus to operating requirements, 
has generated more than £7 million of cash 
which has supported distributions to 
shareholders in excess of £11 million 
over the same period.
At the year end our cash balances were 
£6.4 million compared with £5.4 million last 
year. The increase reflects the proceeds 
from the sale of property referred to above. 
Operating cash flows were £580,000 
(2016: £818,000) and dividends paid 
amounted to £635,000 (2016: £631,000).
Net assets at 30 September 2017 were 
£6.4 million compared to £3.2 million at 
30 September 2016. This significant increase 
is principally due to the elimination of the 
deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme 
under IAS 19. Net of deferred tax, the position 
on the scheme has improved by £3.4 million 
during the year due largely to improved 
surrender terms for the scheme’s principal 
asset. This matter is explained further in 
the Chief Executive’s Statement.
The Directors are proposing to pay a final 
dividend of 3.0p per share (2016: 3.0p) 
giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p, 
the same as last year. Total cash dividends 
paid to shareholders will therefore amount 
to £635,000. If approved by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 6 April 2018 
to those shareholders on the register at 
9 March 2018. The shares will be ex-dividend 
on 8 March 2018. 
We announced last year that we are carrying 
out a strategic review of the business. As 
previously reported, uncertainty over the 
pension scheme valuation since March 2017 
has impacted on the strategic review process 
and caused it to take longer than originally 
expected. However, the process is continuing 
now that the actuarial valuation of the scheme 
has been completed. Should the strategic 
review process not result in an acceptable 
offer being made for the Company, the 
Board confirms that it intends to consider 
returning an amount of cash to shareholders 
subject to any constraints on distributable 
reserves and the rules of the Takeover Code. 
However, it should be noted that the 
improvement in the Group’s net asset 
position referred to above positively 
impacts our distributable reserves. The 
Company will update shareholders further 
when it is in a position to do so.
I would like to thank all our members 
of staff and my colleagues on the Board 
for their contribution during the year.
With a strong, cash-generative business 
model and a debt-free balance sheet I remain 
confident that the business is well positioned 
for the future.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Julian Wassell
Revenue for the year was up 3% at 
£5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the year before. We saw slightly higher 
sales activity throughout the year in relation 
to both of our key products, Quantum VS 
and Vecta, and also increased levels of 
professional services activity, for which 
credit should go to our professional 
services team.
Because of the high margin nature of 
the business (our gross margin is typically 
over 90%), this increase in turnover had a 
significant impact on our underlying operating 
profitability, which increased 26% to £540,000 
from £430,000 a year earlier. Continued 
careful management of the cost base meant 
that overheads (as used in the calculation of 
adjusted operating profit) were maintained 
at near identical levels to the previous year. 
Whilst an increase in sales of 3% can result 
in a 26% increase in operating profit, we 
are always mindful that the converse is also 
true and remain vigilant in controlling the 
cost base.
In common with many businesses, we 
are conscious that the UK economy faces 
considerable uncertainty over the coming 
years. Most of our customers are directly 
impacted by Brexit one way or another. The 
majority of them import and are affected by 
the significant exchange rate movements 
that we have experienced over the last 
18 months or so. Different sectors have 
varying views of the future, with some of 
those in the Builders Merchants sector, 
for example, currently feeling more positive 
than some of those who are not directly 
involved in construction. The fact that we 
offer our products into a variety of industry 
verticals within the distribution sector, 
provides our business with a good degree 
of resilience as we are not overly reliant on 
any one sector. However, economic uncertainty 
typically can mean that significant capital 
expenditure decisions can be delayed or 
even cancelled as businesses take a 
“wait and see” approach.
Our consistent strategy for many years has 
been to strengthen the relationship we have 
with our customers by growing the proportion 
of our revenues delivered through our hosting 
centre in Milton Keynes. Last year hit yet 
another record as 61% of our revenues 
were delivered using the hosting model. 
This was up from 59% last year, and, in 
fact, we have seen this figure grow for 
17 out of the last 18 years.
We continue to manage the migration process 
from our legacy applications to Quantum VS 
carefully. At 30 September 2017, we had 
signed 48 customers for Quantum VS 
compared to 40 a year earlier. The decision 
to change ERP solution is a major decision 
for any business, and, whilst we believe that 
Quantum VS provides an excellent solution 
for the majority of the users of our older, 
legacy products, the migration process 
itself inevitably leads to higher levels of 
customer churn than we have historically 
seen. This will continue to be the case. 
Some of the users of our legacy products 
are keen to remain on their current system 
for the foreseeable future and we are geared 
to offer a flexible approach to work with 
them. This often leads to a new long term 
(5 year) contract, which provides them with 
comfort and us with excellent visibility of 
revenues and the ability to plan our resources 
going forwards. Of course, we will seek 
to promote Quantum VS to them at an 
appropriate time in the future.
Our combined CRM and Business 
Intelligence (BI) product Vecta generated 
28% of total revenues during the period 
under review, up from 25% a year earlier. 
We have stated previously that in the medium 
term, we would expect to see the proportion 
of our total revenues represented by Vecta 
to increase due to the fact that its sales 
cycle is much shorter than that for an ERP 
solution, such as Quantum VS, and this 
remains the case.
Strategy
Our principal software products, Quantum 
VS and Vecta, offer clear business benefits 
to our customers helping them to generate 
sales growth or to create efficiencies and 
reduce costs. Quantum VS and Vecta are 
complementary, with many of our 
customers using both.
Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP 
application, which addresses a focussed 
number of verticals within the distribution 
sector, including builders and timber merchants, 
suppliers of fixings and fastenings, industrial 
and security products and electrical 
wholesalers. As noted above, our long-term 
strategy is to manage the migration of 
customers from our four legacy applications 
(Merchant, Charisma, Esprit and The Business 
Programme) to Quantum VS, whilst identifying 
and exploiting new business opportunities 
in our target vertical markets.
Summary
•  Revenue for the year was up 3% at 
£5.11 million compared with £4.96 million 
the year before. We saw slightly higher 
sales activity throughout the year in 
relation to both of our key products, 
Quantum VS and Vecta. 
•  This increase in turnover had a significant 
impact on our underlying operating 
profitability, which increased 26% to 
£540,000 from £430,000 a year earlier.
•  Contracted recurring revenues represented 
80% of total revenues during the year, 
compared with 82% last year.
•  Cash balances amounted to £6.4 million 
at 30 September 2017, up from £5.4 million 
the previous year.
Last year hit yet another 
record as 61% of our 
revenues were delivered 
using the hosting model. 
This was up from 59% last 
year, and, in fact, we have 
seen this figure grow for 
17 out of the last 18 years. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4
“ Quantum VS is a comprehensive ERP application, 
which addresses a focussed number of verticals 
within the distribution sector.”
Strategy continued
Vecta is an extremely powerful combined 
CRM and BI product which drives sales 
growth for businesses in a range of verticals 
much wider than those addressed by 
Quantum VS. 
Our strategy remains to exploit the space 
between the major CRM products, which 
typically do not deliver sales analysis as 
standard, and pure BI tools. 
We continue to invest in the long-term future 
of our key products through significant levels 
of R&D. During the year to 30 September 2017 
our R&D expenditure was £901,000 
(2016: £982,000). This represented 18% 
of total revenues (2016: 20%).
Business model
All of our software products are supplied 
under long-term contracts. In the case of 
Quantum VS and our legacy products these 
are typically of five years initial duration; in 
the case of Vecta it is typically three years. 
Contracts for ERP applications can be either 
in the form of traditional on-site licencing 
arrangements or hosted service level 
agreements. In the case of Vecta, which is 
only offered as a cloud-based service, new 
contracts are exclusively hosted service level 
agreements. These contracted recurring 
revenues represented 80% of total revenues 
during the year, compared with 82% last 
year. Typically, our customer relationships 
extend well beyond the initial contract period. 
The recurring revenue model gives us good 
visibility of revenues and strong cash flows 
as charges are mainly invoiced annually 
in advance. 
The remainder of our revenues arise 
from initial software licence fees, initial 
hosting service charges and the provision 
of professional services. We also supply 
a small amount of low-margin 
computer hardware.
Financial review
Revenue for the year was £5.11 million 
compared with £4.96 million last year, an 
increase of 3%. Second half revenues were 
£2.57 million (2016: £2.45 million) compared 
with £2.54 million in the first half of the 
year (2016: £2.51 million). 
As noted above adjusted operating profit 
increased 26% to £540,000 (2016: £430,000) 
representing an operating margin of 10.6% 
(2016: 8.7%). Statutory pre-tax profit was 
£417,000 (2016: £244,000).
Adjusted operating profit is used by 
the Board and management to monitor 
the performance of the business on a 
day-to-day basis and it is the headline 
profit figure in the management accounts. 
It excludes interest receivable, any gains 
and losses on property transactions, 
one-off exceptional items and a number 
of non-cash items which arise under 
IFRS (including defined benefit pension 
scheme charges and the capitalisation 
and amortisation of development costs). 
A full reconciliation of adjusted operating 
profit to statutory operating profit is 
provided in note 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements. Furthermore, 
as noted in the Remuneration Report, 
adjusted operating profit is the measure 
on which the Directors’ bonus is based.
Cash balances amounted to £6.4 million 
at 30 September 2017, up from £5.4 million 
the previous year. This includes operating 
cash flows of £580,000 and £1.2 million 
cash received from the sale of property. 
Other significant cash items were dividends 
paid of £635,000 and capital expenditure 
of £118,000.
R&D expenditure was £901,000 
(2016: £982,000). Of this £89,000 
(2016: £127,000) was capitalised as 
required by IAS 38. Amortisation of 
previously capitalised R&D expenditure 
amounted to £110,000 (2016: £96,000). 
Accordingly, the R&D charge in the income 
statement is £922,000 (2016: £951,000).
The tax charge for the year was £23,000 
(2016: £86,000) which represents an effective 
tax rate of 5.5%. The main reason for the low 
effective tax rate this year is a prior year 
corporation tax adjustment of £71,000. Of 
this, £61,000 relates to tax refunds received 
in respect of R&D tax relief claimed for the 
2015 and 2016 accounting periods.
Earnings per share was 3.11p compared to 
1.25p last year, an increase of 149%. On a 
fully diluted basis this amounted to 3.09p 
(2016: 1.24p).
Pension
As a result of the significant increase in 
the discontinuance surrender value of the 
defined benefit scheme’s Grouped Funding 
policy, the value of the pension scheme’s 
assets under IAS 19 has increased by 
approximately £3 million this year. This 
factor, coupled with actuarial gains of 
approximately £900,000 resulting from 
updated financial and mortality assumptions, 
has eliminated the deficit of £3.88 million 
(£3.22 million net of deferred tax) that was 
shown in the 2016 balance sheet. In 2017, 
the balance sheet shows a small pension 
surplus under IAS 19 of £240,000 
(£156,000 net of deferred tax), a movement 
of £4.12 million (£3.38 million after deferred 
tax). Of this movement, net of deferred tax, 
£70,000 has been charged in the income 
statement and £3.45 million has been 
credited directly to reserves.
Chief Executive’s Statement continued
Julian Wassell Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 5
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements
As previously announced, the triennial 
valuation of the scheme as at 31 July 2016 
was completed and signed off by the actuary, 
trustees and employer in October 2017. 
On a scheme funding basis, the deficit 
at 31 July 2016 was finalised at £70,000, 
representing a funding level of 99%.
The deficit is expected to have been 
cleared by the 2018/19 scheme year as a 
result of the payment of terminal bonuses 
by the scheme insurer in respect of member 
retirements that will take place over the 
next two years. The formal deficit recovery 
plan does not therefore require the immediate 
payment of cash contributions by the Company. 
However, the Company has agreed with the 
trustees to make a one-off contribution of 
up to a maximum of £118,000, payable on 
or before 31 July 2020, in the event that the 
terminal bonus payments do not cover the 
deficit in full.
Net assets
Net assets per share increased to 50.7p 
(2016: 25.3p). The increase is primarily due 
to the improvement in the position on the 
defined benefit pension scheme.
Property
As previously reported we sold our last 
remaining surplus freehold property in 
December 2016 for £1.2 million. We had 
previously written the property down in the 
balance sheet to reflect the expected net sale 
proceeds which amounted to £1.17 million 
after costs. Following the sale we have 
achieved expected cash cost savings of 
around £20,000 a year.
Outlook
Balancing the migration of customers from 
our legacy ERP products to Quantum VS, 
whilst identifying and converting new business 
opportunities for Quantum VS and Vecta 
remains our principal focus. Wider economic 
factors and uncertainty over Brexit, in particular, 
continue to affect business confidence 
generally and may impact discretionary 
capital expenditure decisions including 
replacement of IT systems. However, the 
strength of our business model built around 
an 80% recurring revenue base, together 
with continued investment in our sales 
team and product development, should 
mean we are well placed to deal with the 
challenges we face over the coming year.
Finally, I would like to thank all of my 
colleagues throughout the business for 
their hard work and commitment during 
the year.

growth for businesses in a range of verticals.”
Key Performance 
Indicators
The following 
financial KPIs 
are used by the 
Board to review 
the performance 
of the business:
Level of software 
related revenues
Revenue from software and 
services increased by 2.7% in FY17.
Sales of software and services 
account for 97% of total Group 
revenues in FY17, with the remainder 
comprising low-margin hardware 
sales and hardware maintenance.
Adjusted operating 
profit margin
Our adjusted operating margin was 
10.6% in FY17 compared with 8.7% 
in FY16.
Adjusted operating margin is calculated 
using operating profit excluding 
one-off property costs, certain non-cash 
IFRS adjustments relating to defined 
benefit pension scheme charges, 
holiday pay accruals and capitalisation/
amortisation of development costs 
and other exceptional non-trading 
items. A reconciliation of statutory 
operating profit to adjusted operating 
profit is shown in note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements. 
Level of contracted 
recurring revenues
Recurring revenues represent 80% 
of total revenues in FY17 compared 
with 82% in FY16.
Recurring revenues underpin our 
business model and principally 
comprise contracted ongoing 
software licences and hosting fees. 
Level and growth 
of hosted revenues
61% of our revenues were delivered 
through our hosting centre in FY17 
compared with 59% in FY16. Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 6
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
Systems and networks EDP’s business operations rely 
significantly on the efficient and 
uninterrupted operation of its 
information technology systems 
and networks.
Our computer network may 
be vulnerable to unauthorised 
access, viruses and other 
disruptive problems.
Any damage or interruption 
to EDP’s networks, however 
caused, could have a material 
adverse effect on the delivery 
of our products and services.
A party that is able to override 
security measures could 
misappropriate proprietary 
information or cause disruption 
to our operations.
We continually review and 
test the security of internal 
systems and networks and 
have developed recovery 
plans in the event of systems 
disruption. We use a third 
party to internally and externally 
scan our network to identify 
any potential vulnerability.
Where reliance is placed upon 
externally provided systems 
and networks we undertake 
regular performance ability 
reviews and ensure that 
contracts provide for an 
appropriate level of 
service maintenance.
Product technology advances The markets in which EDP 
operates are characterised by 
evolving technology, market 
practices and industry standards.
Competitors could develop 
superior products or more 
cost-effective techniques 
which could render our products 
uncompetitive or less acceptable 
to the market. This could result 
in the loss of new revenue 
opportunities, the non-renewal 
of contracts by existing customers 
or the failure of users of our legacy 
applications to migrate to 
Quantum VS.
We have an ongoing 
commitment to research and 
development which allows 
us to identify and adapt to 
any technological and market 
changes that do occur thereby 
ensuring that our products 
continue to meet the demands 
of our customers.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
We operate in a changing economic and technological environment 
that presents risks, many of which are driven by factors that we 
cannot control or predict. The key risks and uncertainties facing 
EDP and the measures taken to mitigate these risks are as follows: Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 7
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report Financial statements
Risk Potential impact Mitigation
External economic factors As with most other businesses 
in the UK, our operations can be 
adversely affected by a significant 
downturn in the economy. The 
UK economy faces considerable 
uncertainty over the coming years 
and most of our customers, the 
majority of whom import and are 
therefore exposed to exchange 
rate movements, are directly 
impacted by Brexit. Furthermore, 
the uncertainties caused by Brexit 
could have a significant impact on 
discretionary capital expenditure 
decisions including IT projects.
Restricted availability of finance 
for businesses and a stagnant 
or recessionary economy could 
have an adverse effect on the 
prospects for EDP, as potential 
customers, particularly in the 
builders and timber merchants 
sectors may scale back their IT 
plans in response to funding 
difficulties and/or reduced 
prospects for their businesses.
We seek to ensure that a 
significant proportion of our 
revenues are derived from 
long-term contracts with our 
customers, that our products 
appeal to businesses operating 
in a range of business sectors 
and that payments for our 
recurring fees are received 
annually in advance.
Competitor activity EDP operates in a 
competitive environment.
New entrants to our marketplace 
and actions taken by existing 
competitors could have an impact 
on our levels of business activity 
and product pricing in the 
market generally.
We endeavour to provide 
excellent customer support 
together with high quality 
products at a competitive 
price in order to develop 
and protect strong 
customer relationships.
Key employees In common with all people-based 
businesses, our success will, to a 
significant extent, be dependent 
on the experience of the Board and 
senior management. The retention 
of the services of EDP’s key 
employees cannot be guaranteed.
The loss of key employees could 
have a material adverse effect 
on EDP.
The failure to retain and develop 
key technical skills and product 
knowledge could hinder EDP’s 
future prospects.
We are continually focused

Environmental information 
The Group’s operations, which are principally software development and hosting, by their nature have a minimal impact on the 
environment. Nevertheless, the Group is committed to minimising the impact of its activities on the environment through initiatives such 
as the provision of fuel-efficient cars to company car drivers and encouraging waste recycling at Group locations. 
Greenhouse gas emissions
During the year ended 30 September 2017 the Group purchased 584,000 kWh (2016: 590,000 kWh) of electricity, the majority of which 
was used at the Group’s hosting centre in Milton Keynes. Using the 2017 conversion factor for grid electricity published by Defra this equated 
to 205 tonnes (2016: 243 tonnes) of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted. This equated to approximately 3.2 tonnes (2016: 3.6 tonnes) 
per Group employee.
The Group also operates a fleet of cars. During the year ended 30 September 2017 the total carbon dioxide equivalent emitted by the 
vehicles, calculated from the manufacturers’ emissions rating for each car, was 68 tonnes (2016: 79 tonnes). This equated to an average 
of 3.0 tonnes per vehicle (2016: 3.6 tonnes).
Employee information
At the end of the financial year, the Group employed 68 people. This figure includes three Executive and two Non-Executive Directors, 
all of whom are male. There are five senior managers, four of whom are male and one female. Of the remaining 58 employees, 42 are male 
and 16 are female.
Employee, social, community and human rights
Our Company values are long established having been set out at the head of our annual report for many years. They are set out below:
• We believe in conducting our business activities with integrity, building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with all our 
customers, providing the highest levels of professional service at every stage.
• We are committed to delivering superior value in our products and services to our customers, on a continuing basis.
• We respect the individuality of each member of our staff fostering an environment where creativity and productivity are encouraged, 
valued and rewarded.
• We are dedicated to creating value for shareholders by performing in a manner which will enhance return on investment.
The Group does not have any other significant environmental, employee, social, community or human rights issues.

The Strategic Report on pages 1 to 8 was approved by the Board on 12 December 2017.

Annual General Meeting 
20 March 2018
Interim results 
May/June 2018
9 10 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
The Directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2017.
Future developments and going concern
An indication of future developments in the Group’s business is given in the Strategic Report and is incorporated in this Directors’ Report 
by reference. A review of the impact of the current economic environment on the going concern assumption is given in the Corporate 
Governance Report.
Financial statements and results
The Group financial statements for the period under review have been prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU. The Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).
The Group income statement for the year to 30 September 2017 is shown on page 26. The Group profit for the year before taxation 
amounted to £417,000 (2016: £244,000), with turnover of £5,108,000 (2016: £4,958,000).
After a tax charge of £23,000 (2016: £86,000), the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders was £394,000 (2016: £158,000).
Dividends
An interim dividend of 2.0p per share was paid on 1 August 2017. The Directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 3.0p per share, 
making a total of 5.0p per share (2016: 5.0p).
Subject to shareholders’ approval, the final dividend will be paid on 6 April 2018 to shareholders whose names appear on the register 
at close of business on 9 March 2018.
Share capital
Details of the issued share capital and the rights attaching to those shares are contained in note 23 to the financial statements. The Company 
holds 1,083,097 ordinary shares in treasury which were purchased by the Company in a previous financial year and represent 8.5% of the 
called up share capital.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, further to the ordinary business to be dealt with, the following resolutions will be considered:
An ordinary resolution will be proposed to give the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares representing 33 1/3% of the issued share 
capital of the Company.
The Directors consider that it would be advantageous for the Company to be in a position to purchase its own ordinary shares. Accordingly, 
a special resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to renew the existing authority to purchase up to 10% of the issued 
share capital of the Company. The Directors intend to seek to renew the authority at each subsequent Annual General Meeting.
Directors
The Directors at the date of this report, all of whom served throughout the year, are shown on page 9. 
The Director retiring by rotation is Mr A.R. Heller and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election.

Mr A.R. Heller was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive Director in 2009. He is a Chartered Accountant and managing director 
of Bisichi Mining PLC, a listed mining company.
Details of Directors’ interests in shares and share options are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 16 to 19. There were 
no changes in the Directors’ interests in shares or share options up to 12 December 2017. There were no contracts of significance subsisting 
during or at the end of the financial year in which a Director of the Company is or was materially interested.

Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance appropriate to its size and structure. The Board recognises its 
responsibility to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate governance and in doing so has given careful consideration to the 
principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) (April 2016 edition) as set out below. The Board acknowledges its 
responsibility for ensuring that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Board structure and meetings
During the year under review the Board of Directors comprised three Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all aspects of its role. 
The Board is responsible for overall strategy and consideration of significant financial and operational matters including the identification 
and assessment of the risks the Company faces. The Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to constructively challenge the 
Executive Directors and help develop proposals on strategy.
In addition to his role as Non-Executive Chairman of the Company, Sir Michael Heller is Executive Chairman of London & Associated 
Properties PLC and Bisichi Mining PLC, both of which are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board met on five occasions during the year and has met on one occasion since the year end. All Directors attended the five Board 
meetings held during the year.
These meetings allow prompt decision making and assist in the control of strategic, financial and operational issues. To enable them 
to carry out their responsibilities, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information.
Directors are able to seek independent advice at the expense of the Company.
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and have a process, which is updated 
when required, for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.
There is an organisational structure in place, with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegated authority, which is incorporated 
within the Group’s policy and procedure directives.
Board approval is required for a number of matters, the most significant of which are:
• published financial statements;
• acquisitions policy; and
• dividend policy.
The following matters require the approval of the Executive Directors:
• capital expenditure and disposals;
• treasury procedures and investment policy; and
• banking arrangements.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Company, which has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the annual report and accounts. This is regularly reviewed by the Board 
of Directors and accords with the revised Turnbull guidance.
A detailed budget is prepared covering all of the Group’s operations. This budget is reviewed and approved by the Board. Detailed monthly 
management accounts are prepared on a timely basis comparing actual performance of the Group with budget and prior year. Any significant 
variances are investigated and appropriate action taken. Management reports are produced regularly and include information on sales, 
gross profit, overheads, cumulative performance, cash flow and treasury matters.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. Together with senior management, the Board has 
identified, evaluated and managed the significant risks facing the Group.
The Board will amend the specific control procedures which are put in place to reduce these risks whenever appropriate in order to meet 
the demands imposed by the business sector in which the Group operates. 13

Audit committee
A description of the composition and activities of the audit committee is given in the Audit Committee Report on page 15.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises Sir Michael Heller, Mr A.R. Heller and Mr J.H. Wassell. The Board considers the structure of the 
remuneration committee to be appropriate given the size of the Company.
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining the remuneration packages and other terms and conditions for the Executive 
Directors. Mr J.H. Wassell is not involved in determining his own remuneration. The Non-Executive Directors serving on the remuneration 
committee are not involved in determining their own individual remuneration. Individual Directors’ remuneration is detailed in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. The remuneration committee held one meeting during the year and was attended by all members.
Nomination committee
The nomination committee comprises Sir Michael Heller, Mr A.R. Heller and Mr J.H. Wassell. The committee is responsible for proposing 
candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard to the balance of skills, experience and knowledge of the Company on the Board, 
how the Board works together as a unit and other factors relevant to its effectiveness. The committee did not formally meet during the 
year as the current composition of the Board is considered by the committee to be appropriate. The Board considers the structure of the 
committee to be appropriate given the size of the Company. All Directors are subject to re-election at a maximum of every three years.
The Board does not have a formal policy on diversity. Appointments to the Board are recommended by the nomination committee on 
the basis of the experience and abilities of the candidate, regardless of gender or race.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position along with the 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position, are described in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 8. In addition note 
20 to the financial statements includes details of the Group’s financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a significant proportion of the Group’s revenues being derived from 
long-term contracts with established customers. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
annual report and accounts.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the Code, the Directors have assessed the future prospects of the Company over a three-year 
period from the date of these accounts. An assessment period of three years was chosen for the following reasons:
• The Group’s software licences and hosting agreements for its ERP software are generally for five years in duration. Other software 
agreements are generally for three years. This means that on average the Group’s average unexpired software contract duration is 
typically two to three years.
• The industry in which the Company operates in is fast moving and subject to technological change. In this context, an assessment 
period in excess of three years is considered inappropriate.
The review was based upon the approved budget for the forthcoming year and built in assumptions consistent with the Group’s overall 
strategy on growth rates for the following two years. The assessment considered, amongst other things, operating profitability, cash 
generation and dividend cover. These metrics were subject to sensitivity analysis which involved adjusting, on a cumulative basis, a 
number of the key assumptions underlying the forecasts.
As part of the review the Directors performed a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company.
Based on the results of this review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year assessment period. 14 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital structure are given in the Directors’ Report and in note 23 to these financial statements.
Internal audit
The Board reviews from time to time whether there is a need for an internal audit function and on its last review concluded that, 
due to the size of the Group and the internal controls that are currently in place, no specific function is required at the present time.
Investor relations
The Group enters into dialogue with both institutional and private shareholders at the AGM and also on an ad-hoc basis during the year. 
All Directors are required to attend the AGM in order, among other things, to ensure they develop an understanding of the views of the 
Company’s shareholders. A separate resolution is held for each issue at the AGM.
It is the Directors’ intention that all shareholders will receive at least 20 working days’ notice of the AGM.
The Group publishes its annual report and accounts and interim report along with other information on its website at www.edp.co.uk.
Compliance
The Group complied with the provisions of the Code throughout the period under review other than as detailed below:
a)  The Group’s Non-Executive Directors have not been appointed for specified terms. The Board considers that because of the requirement 
for the Non-Executive Directors to stand for re-election at least every three years, specified terms are not required. The Code prescribes 
that Non-Executive Directors should be appointed for specified terms (B.2.3).
b)  The Board is aware that the two Non-Executive Directors are not regarded as independent for the purposes of the Code. As a result 
there is no senior independent Non-Executive Director and the Company therefore does not apply Code provisions A.4.1 and A.4.2. 
The Board considers that the structure of the Board is appropriate for the size and complexity of the Company.
c)  The Board considers that it is appropriate to operate a continual, informal evaluation process given the size and complexity of the Company. 
The Code prescribes that the Board should state in the annual report how the performance evaluation of the Board, its committees 
and its individual Directors has been conducted (B.6.1).
d)  The audit committee and remuneration committee are both chaired by the Non-Executive Chairman and as a result the Company does 
not fully comply with Code provisions C.3.1 and D.2.1. The nomination committee has no independent Non-Executive Directors serving 
on it and consequently the Company does not comply fully with provision B.2.1. The Board considers that the structure of the Board 
committees is appropriate for the size and complexity of the Company.
e)  The Non-Executive Chairman, who has served on the Board for over nine years, stands for election every three years rather than every 
year as prescribed by provision B.7.1. The Board considers this is appropriate given the Company’s size and complexity.

Audit Committee Report
The audit committee comprises the two Non-Executive Directors, Sir Michael Heller and Andrew Heller, both of whom are Chartered 
Accountants. The Board considers the structure of the audit committee to be appropriate considering the size and complexity of the Group.
The committee’s terms of reference, which have been approved by the Board, are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The main responsibilities of the audit committee are:
• to monitor the adequacy of the Group’s internal financial controls;
• to take primary responsibility for appointing and re-appointing auditors;
• to review and monitor the scope, results and cost effectiveness of the external audit process;
• to monitor the procedures in place to safeguard the objectivity of the auditor and its independence in relation to non-audit services;
• to review the key assumptions and estimates or judgements that have been applied by management in the published financial 
statements; and
• to consider the need for an internal audit function.
The audit committee meets three times during the year. Meetings are held prior to publication of the annual results and half-year results. 
A meeting is also held just after the year end to review, among other things, the significant judgements and estimates made by management 
in preparing the financial statements. During this meeting the external auditor presents its strategy document. Both members of the 
committee, along with the Chief Executive and Finance Director, attended all meetings. The external auditor attended two meetings.
The committee has concluded that given the size and complexity of the Group there is no current need for an internal audit function.
The committee has considered the following significant accounting issues and areas of estimation and judgement in relation to these 
financial statements:
• We considered the accounting policy, as presented by the Finance Director in a paper prepared for the committee, relating to recognition of 
revenue and whether the established policy was still appropriate for the business. We were content that the current policy was still appropriate. 
We were satisfied that the Group’s internal controls for ensuring that revenues were allocated to the correct period were effective.
• We considered the approach taken by management in updating the key assumptions used in the valuation of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension scheme, following guidance from the independent scheme actuary, and were content that the approach was appropriate.
• We considered the processes put in place by management, as presented by the Finance Director in a paper prepared for the committee, 
for the identification and recording of expenditure on software development which is capitalised and amortised under IAS 38. We were 
satisfied that these processes were appropriate.
The committee has considered the effectiveness and quality of the external audit process. A key element of this is a review of the auditor’s 
formal Audit Strategy Document which is presented to the committee prior to the commencement of the annual audit. This document 
highlights to the committee the auditor’s assessment of audit materiality and the key audit focus areas. It also includes a formal 
assessment of the auditor’s independence.
The Group’s auditors, KPMG LLP, and their legacy predecessors, have been in place since 1965. In line with the audit profession’s own 
ethical guidance the audit engagement partner is rotated every five years. The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to put 
the external audit contract out to tender. It has concluded that currently there is no requirement to conduct a tender process. 
The committee has also reviewed the procedures that are in place to safeguard the objectivity of the auditor and its independence in relation 
to non-audit services. The auditor is excluded from undertaking a range of work on behalf of the Group which includes tax advisory work, 
appraisal or valuation services, management functions, litigation support and accounting and remuneration services. An analysis of the 
fees paid to the auditor in respect of non-audit work is shown in note 6, of which most relates to pensions advisory services. Those staff 
advising the Company on pension matters are excluded from working on the Group audit.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2017.
The Directors’ remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 21 March 2017 
and became effective immediately. Of those shareholders who voted by proxy on this resolution, some 97% voted in favour of the policy. 
The policy will apply until the 2020 AGM unless approval for a change in the policy is sought during this time.
As described in the policy report, the remuneration committee concluded that the pre-existing arrangements for remunerating the 
Executive Directors were an appropriate basis for framing the new policy and has been implemented accordingly.
As we will not be proposing a resolution to approve the Directors’ remuneration policy at the forthcoming AGM, and in accordance with 
The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, we have not included 
a separate Directors’ remuneration policy report within this Remuneration Report. A copy of the current Directors’ remuneration policy, 
which can be found on pages 20 to 23 of the Group’s 2016 Annual Report and Accounts, is on the Company’s website www.edp.co.uk 
or can be obtained by writing to the Company Secretary.
This year the remuneration committee has awarded the Executive Directors bonuses totalling in aggregate £36,000 in respect of the 
current financial year. In accordance with the remuneration policy, the maximum potential bonus pool has been calculated at 10% of 
adjusted operating profit.
The allocation of the total bonus, amounting to 60% of the maximum potential bonus, to the individual Executive Directors, is shown 
on page 17.

* The total remuneration figure for 2013 includes £44,100 in respect of the notional value of share options vesting in the period.
With regard to the maximum bonus that could have been awarded in 2017, this is not set by individual Executive Director. The total amount 
of bonus awarded to the Executive Directors is ordinarily set at 10% of the Group’s adjusted operating profit for the year. This is therefore 
also the maximum bonus that can be awarded to the Executive Directors collectively. The allocation between individual Directors is decided 
on an annual basis taking into account individual and collective performance and level of experience as a Director.
The bonus is awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee. 
The share options that vested in 2013 represented 100% of the total number that could have vested in that year.
The percentage change in the remuneration of J.H. Wassell compared to that of all employees of the Group as a whole is shown below:
Salary Benefits Bonus
J.H. Wassell 0.0% 2 2. 8% * 33.3%
All employees 1.5% * **
*  Benefits comprise the value, for income tax purposes, of private health care and provision of a company car. The increase in the value of J. H Wassell’s 
benefits in 2017 resulted from the general increase in the Company’s premiums payable under the Group private health scheme, an increase in the rates 
at which company cars were taxable in the 2017/18 tax year and the full-year impact of a change during the previous year of the car provided. The value 
of the benefits provided to other employees are also affected by the same factors.
** The bonus scheme is applicable to Executive Directors only.
The salaries of all Group employees excluding the Directors are reviewed annually. At the 1 December 2016 review date employee salaries 
were increased by 1.5%.
In addition individual employee salaries are reviewed in cases of increased responsibility, greater experience or exceptional performance.
The salaries of the Executive Directors were not changed during the year.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
in respect of the annual report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law 
they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

1 Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Electronic Data Processing PLC (“the Company”) for the year ended 30 September 2017 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Company Balance Sheet, Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 2. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2017 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union; 
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit 
opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the Company before 1985. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for more than the 22 financial 
years ended 30 September 2017. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance 
with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited 
by that standard were provided. 
2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and 
include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those 
procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the 
purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that 
opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Group and Parent Company: Revenue recognition (Group revenue £5,108,000, deferred income £1,883,000 2016: revenue £4,958,000, 
deferred income £2,097,000) (Parent Company revenue £2,102,000, deferred income £637,000 2016: revenue £1,980,000, 
deferred income £810,000).
Risk vs 2016: ◄►
Refer to page 15 (Audit Committee Report), pages 31 to 32 (Accounting Policy) and page 42 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – Accounting application: The Group’s contracts with its customers involve the delivery of multiple services. Revenue recognition 
within the Group may require the separate recognition of revenue for each service and as a result there is judgement required over the 
calculation of the relative fair values for each element of the services. This includes elements of upfront recognition and the spreading 
of other revenues over the period of service, resulting in significant deferred income balances. Although the contracts entered into by the 
Group are of limited complexity and variety, there are a large number of transactions to be processed as a result there is a risk that not 
all revenue is recognized in the appropriate period.
• Our response – In this area our audit procedures included: 
• Accounting analysis – determining if several performance obligations exist within a contract that result in more than one component 
of revenue. This was achieved by assessing a sample of contracts using the guidance in the relevant accounting standard. This included 
an assessment of the subjective fair value attributed to each component of revenue within a contract.
• Sector experience – considering the appropriateness and consistency of the Group’s approach to allocating revenue to each 
component of a transaction using our sector knowledge and making an assessment of the margin recognised for each different 
component of revenue. 
• Tests of detail – testing a sample of revenue transactions to assess if revenue was recorded correctly during the period or deferred 
for future periods with reference to customer orders, contractual documentation and details of supply of services.
• Assessing transparency – assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures in respect of amounts recognised as revenue 
and deferred revenue.
• Our results – The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the amount of revenue recognised (in the year and deferred) 
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable). 23

2 Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
Group and Parent Company: Defined Benefit Pension Scheme (Group and Parent Company net asset: £240,000, 
2016: net liability £3,883,000).
Risk vs 2016: ◄►
Refer to page 15 (Audit Committee Report), page 33 (Accounting Policy) and pages 44 to 47 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – Subjective valuation – The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme. The closed scheme has an extremely small 
number of members (in terms of active and deferred members, and also those currently receiving pensions). An assessment of the 
underlying valuation of the scheme requires significant estimates to be applied, and, due to the small membership, a small change 
in certain of these estimates could have a material effect on the Group’s results and financial position.
• Our response – In this area our audit procedures included;
• Benchmarking assumptions – comparing the Group’s assumptions to market data as well as, with the support of our own actuarial 
specialist, our own assessments in relation to key inputs such as inflation rates, discount rates, increases in pay, increases in pension 
payments, increases for deferred pensioners and, in particular, mortality rates. 
• Assessing valuer’s credentials – evaluating the competence and independence of the external actuary who calculates the IAS 19 
valuation with reference to their experience, qualifications and credentials.
• Tests of detail – comparing the asset valuations used in the IAS 19 valuation to the surrender value provided by the insurer.
• Assessing transparency – assessing the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in relation to the assumptions applied in determining 
the defined benefit liability. 
• Our results – The results of our testing were satisfactory and we found the net defined benefit asset (2016: liability) recognised 
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
Group and Parent Company: Capitalised development costs (Group and Parent Company costs capitalised £89,000, 
2016: £127,000).
Risk vs 2016: ◄►
Refer to page 15 (Audit Committee Report), page 32 (Accounting Policy) and page 41 (financial disclosures).
• The risk – Accounting treatment – The capitalisation criteria are inherently judgmental and there is a risk that qualifying projects may 
not be identified. There is also the risk that projects not meeting the relevant criteria are capitalised. Further, there is also a risk that 
development costs attributable to such projects may be misstated as they relate largely to developer’s time which is required to be 
captured and appropriately allocated to specific development projects. 
• Our response – Our audit procedures included;
• Testing application – analysing current year’s expensed costs to identify projects that have not been capitalised and obtaining and 
corroborating, for example by reference to publicly available information, such as product and upgrade release dates, the Group’s 
explanations for why such costs have not been capitalised.
• Sector experience – for qualifying projects, considering the Group’s assessment of their future technical and financial prospects 
by reference to our knowledge of the Group’s business and our experience of the industry.
• Reperformance – critically assessing the costs capitalised under such projects by reperforming the Group’s calculation of staff 
costs attributable to qualifying projects, with reference to timesheets and payroll data where appropriate.
• Our results – The results of our testing were satisfactory and we found the development costs capitalised under IAS 38 
to be acceptable (2016: acceptable).
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £21,000 (2016: £12,000), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 5% (2016: 5%).
Materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at £4,400 (2016: £9,000) determined with reference to a benchmark 
of profit before taxation, of which it represents 5% (2016: 5%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected and uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £1,100 (2016: £600) in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 5 (2016: 5) reporting components, we subjected 5 (2016: 5) to full scope audits for Group reporting purposes. These audits 
covered 100% of: total Group revenue, Group profit before taxation and total Group assets. Component materiality levels were set individually 
for each component having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components, and ranged from £1,000 to £8,000 
(2016: £1,500 to £12,000).  24 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
4 We have nothing to report on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement on the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company’s use of that basis for a period 
of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; or 
• the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 13 is materially inconsistent with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
5 We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other information presented in the annual report together with the financial statements. Our opinion 
on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly 
stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely 
on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information. 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Based solely on our work on the other information: 
• we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report; 
• in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and 
• in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report 
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. 
Disclosures of principal risks and longer-term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention 
to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation within the viability statement on page 13 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity; 
• the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and 
• the Directors’ explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including 
any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the viability statement. We have nothing to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or 
• the section of the annual report describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the audit committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate Governance Statement does not properly disclose a departure from the eleven provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.

6 We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
We have nothing to report in these respects. 
7 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 20, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud, other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinion in an Auditor’s Report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud or other irregularities is higher than for one resulting from error, as they may involve collusion, 
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control and may involve any area of law and regulation not just 
those directly affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
8 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an Auditor’s Report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(forming part of the financial statements)
1. Reporting entity
Electronic Data Processing PLC is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in England. 
The principal activity of the Company is the provision of computer software solutions.
The address of the Company’s registered office is 4th Floor, Fountain Precinct, Balm Green, Sheffield S1 2JA.
Statement of compliance
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRS”) as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2017 and 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The principal accounting policies of the Group are set out in note 2. 
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with FRS 101.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement 
and related notes.
2. Significant accounting policies
The significant accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these Group financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and under the historical cost basis except as described 
elsewhere in note 2.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Electronic Data Processing PLC and all its subsidiaries. Such accounts 
are all made up to 30 September 2017.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group 
takes into consideration potential voting rights. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases. Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are 
eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Functional and presentational currency
The financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Group’s presentational currency. The Parent Company’s functional 
currency is sterling. All financial information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
Foreign currency
Sales to overseas customers which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets resulting from sales denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
The Group’s revenues derive from a number of sources which are described below. All revenue excludes value added tax and any sales 
between Group companies. Revenue relating to future periods is deferred. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The Group’s software revenues derive from its software licensing contracts and software hosting agreements.
Revenue from new software licences, which typically run for between three and five years, is broken down into two components, namely 
an initial licence fee, payable upfront, and periodic charges, which are payable over the licence term. Initial licence fee revenue is recognised 
in full on delivery of the software to the customer following receipt of a non-cancellable contract. The Group considers that at this point its 
primary contractual obligation, the delivery of the current version of the software for use on the customer’s own computer system, has been 
satisifed. The Group considers that at this point a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership of the licence have been 
transferred to the customer. The periodic charges, which reflect the Group’s ongoing requirement to maintain and support the software, are 
recognised on a straight line basis as the remaining risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer over the contract term. 32 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue continued
The Group provides software hosting services through its standard Service Level Agreements (SLA) which also typically run for between 
three and five years. A new SLA has two separately identified fee components: an initial service charge, payable by the customer up front, 
and a periodic service charge, payable annually, quarterly or monthly over the contract term. In the case of an SLA for the Group’s ERP 
software, the initial service charge represents a payment to acquire the software licence along with a charge for the services required to 
install the software and configure the hosted service on a server allocated to the customer. This revenue is recognised once a non-cancellable 
SLA is signed and the customer is provided with access to the software on their hosted server. Periodic service charges are recognised 
evenly over the contract term, reflecting the Group’s obligation to support the software and maintain the provision of the hosted service 
throughout the contract period. In the case of an SLA for the Group’s Vecta hosted service, the initial service charge is attributed to the 
configuration and database preparation services that are provided at the start of the agreement and are deemed to have standalone value 
to the customer. This revenue is recognised once a customer is provided with access to their database on the Group’s multi-tenanted 
Vecta server. The periodic charges, which reflect the Group’s obligation to provide the Vecta hosted service throughout the contract 
period, are recognised evenly over time.
Other software related revenues are mainly from the provision of professional services including implementation, training and consultancy. 
This revenue is recognised when the services have been performed. Sales of computer equipment are recognised on delivery to customers 
and equipment maintenance charges are recognised evenly over the period to which they relate.
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs are one-off items of expenditure which in the opinion of the Directors do not directly relate to the underlying trading 
performance of the Group.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Land is not 
depreciated. Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost, or deemed cost, less the estimated residual value of each asset in equal 
instalments over its estimated useful life from the time it becomes operational, at the following rates:
Freehold property   – 1 to 2%
Motor vehicles    – 20 to 33%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 15 to 25%
Software intellectual property rights
Assets are initially carried at cost, including any incidental expenses of acquisition. Following initial recognition, they are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software intellectual property rights are amortised over a period 
of between three and ten years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the software is brought into use.
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in the income statement as incurred. 
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development 
expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, 
future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell 
the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads that are directly attributable to preparing 
the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditure not meeting these criteria is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Capitalised software development costs are amortised over a period 
of between three and seven years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the asset becomes available for use.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have terms of up to 30 days, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance 
for any uncollectable amounts. Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect part or all 
of a debt. Bad debts are written off as identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprise cash on hand and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Investments
Investments at the balance sheet date comprise fixed-term bank deposits which have a maturity at acquisition greater than three months.
Assets held for sale
A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if, at the balance sheet date, its carrying value will be recovered principally through sale 
rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and that sale is highly probable within one year. On initial classification 
as held for sale, non-current assets are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, with any 
adjustments taken to the income statement. The same applies to gains and losses subsequent to remeasurement. 33

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Leasing transactions
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred income
Deferred income represents that portion of licence fees, hosting charges and maintenance contracts taken out by customers but which 
relate to a future period.
Taxes
Tax on the Group’s profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Credit is taken in the accounting period for research and development tax credits, which have been claimed from HM Revenue and Customs 
in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred. Research and development tax credits are accounted for on an accruals 
basis depending on the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims. The credit is presented in the income statement as a deduction 
from the current tax expense to the extent that the entity is entitled to claim the credit in the current reporting period. Any unused credit 
would be recognised as a deferred tax asset if it met the general recognition criteria for deferred tax assets, i.e. it is probable (usually 
considered to be “more likely than not”) that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is provided on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement 
of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax 
asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Employee benefits – pensions
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. The premiums relating to defined contribution schemes 
are charged to the income statement in the period in which they accrue.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, 
and the fair value of the scheme assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions, plan experience and differences between the expected 
and actual return on plan assets are recognised in “other comprehensive income” in the statement of comprehensive income in the year 
in which they occur.
All other movements in the pension asset or liability are recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Share-based payment transactions
The Company operates a share option scheme for certain employees. The fair value of the share options is calculated at the date of grant 
using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value is then recognised as an employee expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
with a corresponding increase in equity.
Equity
The nature and purpose of each reserve included within equity is as follows:
Share capital
The balance classified as share capital includes the nominal value on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 5p ordinary shares.
Share premium
The balance classified as share premium represents the premium paid on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance classified as capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of issued share capital repurchased by the Company.
Treasury shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, 
net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares classified as treasury shares are presented as a 
deduction from equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in 
equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings. 34 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Significant judgements and estimates
Judgements and estimates made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies may have a significant effect on the financial 
statements with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year. The main areas of estimation and accounting judgement are:
Estimates
Employee benefits
The calculation of the deficit or surplus on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
including discount rate, future rate of inflation and future changes in mortality rates. These assumptions are reviewed regularly by the 
Directors with the scheme actuary. Details of the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the key actuarial assumptions 
are provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements
Development costs
The Directors review annually the Company’s software development projects and assess which of those projects qualify for capitalisation 
under IAS 38. This assessment involves a project by project review of all software development undertaken during the year and an assessment 
is made as to whether each project involves the development of new software products or adds significant new functionality to existing 
software products, in which case the costs are considered for capitalisation. Costs are only capitalised once management has assessed 
that the future revenues which will be generated from the new or improved products will be sufficient to justify this accounting treatment.
Revenue recognition
The key area of judgement in respect of revenue recognition is in determining which of its software licencing and hosting revenues should 
be recognised immediately and which should be deferred and recognised over time. This includes making an assessment of the fair value 
of the Group’s ongoing obligation to provide software and hosting support services arising from its customer contracts when determining 
how much revenue should be recognised over time. Similarly, the Directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided 
under its hosting agreements, for instance system configuration and database preparation, are separate components for which revenue 
can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled.
Financial risk management 
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• credit risk;
• liquidity risk; and
• market risk.
This note presents material information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
procedures for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included 
throughout these financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and overseeing of the Group’s risk management framework. The 
Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and 
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in 
market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop 
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investments. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is 
influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and also the markets in which they operate.
The Group is not exposed through a significant volume of sales transactions with any single customer. All new customers are reviewed 
before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment 
that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables on a line by line basis.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing surplus cash in recognised UK-based banks.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group is currently debt free and 
has significant cash resources. It therefore considers the risk to be low at the present time. The Group does not trade in financial instruments. 35
Governance Notice of meeting Strategic report
Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements
2. Significant accounting policies continued
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
The Group has a small number of customers based in the US who are invoiced in US dollars along with a small number of European-based 
customers who are invoiced in euros.
As these revenues represent approximately 2% of total turnover, the Group does not enter into any hedging transactions. All other Group 
sales to overseas customers are denominated in sterling and therefore they do not present a foreign currency risk. The Group does not 
have any significant monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
As the Group has significant cash deposits, changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on the Group’s results.
Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total equity, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence 
and to sustain future development of the business.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
New standards not applied 
The IASB has issued the following standards with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and early adoption has not 
been applied:

Impact of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15, which is applicable to the Company with effect from 1 October 2018, and will therefore be adopted in the financial statements 
for the year ending 30 September 2019, provides a new framework that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance under IFRS. 
The new standard requires entities to apply a five-step model to determine when to recognise revenue, and at what amount. The model 
specifies that revenue should be recognised when (or as) an entity transfers control of goods or services to a customer at the amount to 
which an entity expects to be entitled. Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenue is recognised either over time (in a manner 
that depicts the entity’s performance) or at a point in time (when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer).
IFRS 15 introduces new and specific guidance on assessing whether revenue from a licence of intellectual property is recognised at a 
point in time or over time. The Directors are currently reviewing the Company’s standard software licences in accordance with the new 
guidance to determine whether they provide a right to use its intellectual property (where revenue is recognised at a point in time) or a 
right to access its intellectual property (where revenue is recognised over time).
IFRS 15 also introduces comprehensive guidance on identifying separate components of a transaction. The Directors are reviewing the 
Company’s standard hosting agreements in accordance with this guidance to identify the distinct services promised in a hosting contract 
and to determine the amount of revenue, and its timing, that should be allocated to each of these services.
The review of the impact of applying IFRS 15 on the Company’s reported results is ongoing. Further information on the impact of the new 
standard on the timing of recognition of the Group’s software licensing and hosting revenues will be provided in the 2018 annual report 
and accounts. 36 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Impact of other new standards and interpretations
The Group has a number of operating leases and the Directors are currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ on the 
financial statements.
It is not anticipated that application of the remaining new standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards will have a 
material effect on the Group’s financial statements when first applied.
3. Segmental analysis
The Group has identified its reportable segment based on the financial reports that internally are provided to the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker (CODM). In line with its management structure, the Executive Directors collectively make the key operating decisions and 
review internal monthly management accounts and budgets as part of this process. Accordingly, the Executive Directors collectively are 
considered to be the CODM. The information reported regularly to the CODM presents the Group as a single segment supplying software 
and related services to customers operating in similar markets. The Group’s software products share a common sales, development and 
implementation resource. Consequently the Group has determined that there is one operating segment and therefore one reportable 
segment, Software.
Segment performance is measured based on segment profit before tax excluding IAS 19 defined benefit pension scheme adjustments 
and profits or losses on property disposals or revaluations.

statutory operating profit when assessing the trading performance of the Group. Similarly, significant one-off costs relating to the Group’s 
vacant freehold property, which were incurred prior to its disposal in December 2016, are not considered to be a trading item and are also 
excluded from adjusted operating profit.

Factors affecting future tax charges
Legislation has been passed which reduces the rate of corporation tax to 17% from 1 April 2020. This reduction will reduce the Group’s 
future current tax charge accordingly.
The Group had no unutilised trading tax losses carried forward at 30 September 2017 (2016: £nil).
9. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Parent of £394,000 (2016: £158,000) 
by 12,661,524 (2016: 12,610,976), being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
Basic earnings per share is 3.11p (2016: 1.25p).
Diluted earnings per share
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential 
ordinary shares. The Company has one class of dilutive potential ordinary share which is share options granted to employees under its 
Enterprise Management Incentive Share Option Plan. These shares have been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax of £394,000 (2016: £158,000) by 12,770,174 (2016: 12,742,107),

20. Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, and various items, such as trade receivables, trade payables, etc., 
that arise directly from its operations. There is no material difference between book value and fair value of these financial instruments.
Short-term bank deposits are invested at a variable interest rate based on base rate. This position is constantly monitored by the Board.
The Group also invests surplus cash in fixed-term deposit accounts. Interest rates on these investments are fixed for the duration of the term.
Undrawn committed facilities
At 30 September 2017 the Group had no undrawn committed borrowing facilities (2016: £nil).
Credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting 
date was:

£’000 £’000
Fixed-term deposits — 3,500
Variable-rate cash deposits 6,360 1,902
6,360 5,402
Sensitivity analysis
The majority of cash balances throughout the year are held on deposit at competitive market rates. A 0.25% fluctuation in interest rates on 
all deposits held at the year end would have an approximate impact of £16,000 (2016: £14,000) on finance income with a corresponding 
£3,000 (2016: £3,000) impact on income tax expense.
21. Employee benefits – pensions
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the principal scheme being a grouped personal pension scheme 
through an insurance company. The pension costs of these arrangements were £73,000 (2016: £75,000). Outstanding contributions at the 
end of the year were £13,000 (2016: £13,000). 45

Financial statements
21. Employee benefits – pensions continued
Defined benefit pension scheme
The Group sponsors the Electronic Data Processing PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a funded defined benefit 
arrangement. This is a separate trustee administered fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet long-term pension liabilities for the 
members. The scheme entitles a retired member to receive an annual pension equal to 1/60 of final salary for each year of service that the 
member provided.
The scheme closed to future accrual on 31 August 2014. 
The scheme exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk and longevity risk. A decrease in corporate 
bond yields, a rise in inflation or an increase in life expectancy would result in an increase to scheme liabilities. This would detrimentally 
impact the balance sheet position and may give rise to increased charges in future income statements.
The last full actuarial valuation of the scheme was performed at 31 July 2016 by a professionally qualified actuary. This scheme funding 
valuation showed a deficit of £70,000 at that date.
The full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was updated on an IAS 19 basis at 30 September 2017 by JLT Benefit Solutions Limited using 
the following assumptions:
2017 2016 2015
Inflation rate 2.3% 2.1% 2.2%
Discount rate 2.6% 2.2% 3.7%
Expected return on assets 2.6% 2.2% 3.7%
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 5.0% 5.0% 5.0%
Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 2.3% 2.1% 2.2%
The discount rate assumption has been set to equal a single discount rate which, when used to discount the projected benefit cash flows 
underlying a pension scheme with a 17-year duration, would give broadly the same result as using a full AA corporate bond yield curve 
to discount the same cash flows.
The Scheme’s assets are invested in insurance policies in which the underlying assets comprise wholly of corporate bonds and the 
expected return on assets is based on the yield available on AA-rated corporate bonds.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 30 September 2017 are 100% of the standard tables S1PMA (males) and S1PFA (females). 
These imply the following life expectancies:
2017 2016
 Years Years
Retiring in 2017 (aged 65 years)  
– Males 22.1 22.1
– Females 23.9 24.4

The Company has reviewed the guidance provided by IFRIC 14 and has concluded that it is not necessary to make any adjustment to the 
IAS 19 results in respect of an asset ceiling or Minimum Funding Requirement as at 30 September 2017. In particular the Company has 
the right to any surplus refunded on discontinuance of the Scheme.

Share options
The Company operates an Enterprise Management Incentive (EMI) Share Option Plan for Directors and other senior employees. Details 
of options granted to current Directors on 30 September 2010 are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. A further 225,000 options 
were granted to other employees on 30 September 2010 and 45,000 options were granted to other employees on 5 February 2013. 
The key terms, exercise price and required service period for these share options are the same as those granted to the Directors.
The fair value of EMI share options calculated at the grant date was 4.5p for those options granted on 30 September 2010 and 9.6p for 
those options granted on 5 February 2013. The main inputs in the calculation were:
Options

Expected option maturity 6.5 years 6.5 years
At 30 September 2017 there were 325,000 outstanding EMI share options which had vested and were exercisable. There were no 
outstanding EMI share options still within the vesting period. No charge has been recognised in the income statement for the year ended 
30 September 2017 in respect of these options as the entire IFRS 2 charge relating to all options granted has been recognised in prior 
periods (2016: £nil).
There are no other share option plans in operation.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
(forming part of the financial statements)
1. Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation 
to the Company’s financial statements. 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). 
The amendments to FRS 101 (2014/15 Cycle) issued in July 2015 and effective immediately have been applied.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRSs), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006. 
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• a cash flow statement and related notes;
• comparative period reconciliations for tangible fixed assets and intangible assets;
• disclosures in respect of capital management; and
• the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 
available in respect of the following disclosures:
• IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ in respect of group settled share based payments; and 
• the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments Disclosures’.
The Company proposes to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements. 
Under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these 
financial statements.
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as described elsewhere in note 1.
Foreign currency
Sales to overseas customers which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction. Monetary assets resulting from sales denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any diminution in value.
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost, or deemed cost, less the estimated residual value of each asset in equal instalments 
over its estimated useful life from the time it becomes operational, at the following rates:
Freehold property   – 1 to 2%
Motor vehicles    – 20 to 33%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – 15 to 25%
Intangible fixed assets
Software intellectual property rights
Assets are initially carried at cost, including any incidental expenses of acquisition. Following initial recognition, they are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Software intellectual property rights are amortised over a period 
of between three and ten years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the software is brought into use. 53

Intangible fixed assets continued
Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in the income statement as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development 
expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, 
future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell 
the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads that are directly attributable to preparing 
the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditure not meeting these criteria is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Capitalised software development costs are amortised over a period 
of between three and seven years on a straight line basis and amortised from the time the asset becomes available for use.
Stock
Inventories are valued at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Trade and other debtors
Trade debts, which generally have terms of up to 30 days, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any 
uncollectable amounts. Provision is made where there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect part or all of a debt. 
Bad debts are written off as identified.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date comprise cash on hand and short-term deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Current asset investments
Current asset investments at the balance sheet date comprise fixed-term bank deposits which have a maturity at acquisition greater than 
three months.
Assets held for sale
A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if, at the balance sheet date, its carrying value will be recovered principally through sale 
rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and that sale is highly probable within one year. On initial classification 
as held for sale, non-current assets are measured at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, with any 
adjustments taken to the income statement. The same applies to gains and losses subsequent to remeasurement.
Leasing transactions
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Deferred income
Deferred income represents that portion of licence fees, hosting charges and maintenance contracts taken out by customers but which 
relate to a future period.
Taxes
Tax on the Company’s profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years.
Credit is taken in the accounting period for research and development tax credits, which have been claimed from HM Revenue and Customs 
in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred. Research and development tax credits are accounted for on an accruals 
basis depending on the level of certainty regarding acceptance of the claims. The credit is presented in profit or loss as a deduction from 
the current tax expense to the extent that the entity is entitled to claim the credit in the current reporting period. Any unused credit would 
be recognised as a deferred tax asset if it met the general recognition criteria for deferred tax assets, i.e. it is probable (usually considered 
to be “more likely than not”) that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is provided on the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes 
and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or 
settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset 
can be utilised. 54 Electronic Data Processing PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017

Pensions
The Company operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes. The premiums relating to defined contribution 
schemes are charged to the income statement in the period in which they accrue.
The Company’s net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit 
that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present 
value, and the fair value of the scheme assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit 
credit method.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions, plan experience and differences between the expected 
and actual return on plan assets are recognised in “other comprehensive income” in the statement of comprehensive income in the year 
in which they occur.
All other movements in the pension asset or liability are recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Equity
The nature and purpose of each reserve included within equity is as follows:
Share capital
The balance classified as share capital includes the nominal value on issue of the Company’s equity share capital, comprising 5p ordinary shares.
Share premium
The balance classified as share premium represents the premium paid on the issue of the Company’s equity share capital.
Capital redemption reserve
The balance classified as capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of issued share capital repurchased by the Company.
Treasury shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, 
net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares classified as treasury shares are presented as a 
deduction from equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in 
equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
Significant judgements and estimates
Judgements and estimates made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies may have a significant effect on the financial 
statements with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year. The main areas of estimation and accounting judgement are:
Estimates
Employee benefits
The calculation of the deficit or surplus on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme is based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
including discount rate, future rate of inflation and future changes in mortality rates. These assumptions are reviewed regularly by the 
Directors with the scheme actuary. Details of the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the key actuarial assumptions 
are provided in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.
Judgements
Development costs
The Directors review annually the Company’s software development projects and assess which of those projects qualify for capitalisation 
under IAS 38. This assessment involves a project by project review of all software development undertaken during the year and an assessment 
is made as to whether each project involves the development of new software products or adds significant new functionality to existing 
software products, in which case the costs are considered for capitalisation. Costs are only capitalised once management have assessed 
that the future revenues which will be generated from the new or improved products will be sufficient to justify this accounting treatment.
Revenue recognition
The key area of judgement in respect of revenue recognition is in determining which of its software licencing and hosting revenues should 
be recognised immediately and which should be deferred and recognised over time. This includes making an assessment of the fair value 
of the Group’s ongoing obligation to provide software and hosting support services arising from its customer contracts when determining 
how much revenue should be recognised over time. Similarly, the Directors make a judgement as to whether certain services provided 
under its hosting agreements, for instance system configuration and database preparation, are separate components for which revenue 
can be recognised upfront at a point in time when the obligation is deemed to have been fulfilled. 55
