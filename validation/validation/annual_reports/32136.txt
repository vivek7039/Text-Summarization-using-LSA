NAVIGATING THE REPORT 
Throughout this document a series of icons

about our business model with details of our 
strategy and risk.
REPORTING PERIOD
This year we are reporting on the 52-weeks to 1 st 
April 20 1 7 compared to last year when we reported 
on a 53-week basis, as every six years an additional 
week is included to ensure that the year-end date 
stays in line with the end of March. To provide a 
meaningful comparison with this year, all ﬁ nancial 
movements are reported on a 52-week basis, 
and excluding the 53rd week last year, unless 
otherwise noted. 
Details of the 53-week comparisons can be 
found in the Financial Review p26. 
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
This report provides alternative performance 
measures (APMs) which are not deﬁ ned or speciﬁ ed 
under the requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards. We believe these APMs 
provide readers with important additional 
information on our business. New for this year, 
we have included a glossary on page 1 33 which 
provides a comprehensive list of the APMs that 
we use, including an explanation of how they are 
calculated, why we use them and how they can be 
reconciled to a statutory measure where relevant. 
PLAN A 
Plan A is integrated throughout this report, 
demonstrating how it is embedded in every part of 
our business. This makes it easier for shareholders 
to see how our sustainability programme is creating 
value in our diff erent divisions. More detailed

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
This is my last Annual Report as Chairman 
after more than six years at M&S. It has 
been an extraordinary honour to serve 
this company. 
Since Steve Rowe became Chief Executive, 
he has set out clear plans to accelerate the 
pace of change across M&S. By simplifying 
the way we do things and by focusing on the 
customer, we have laid solid foundations 
for growth. We repositioned our Clothing & 
Home business, made important decisions 
about the future shape of our UK and 
International store estates, and put in place 
fairer pay and beneﬁ ts for our employees. 
It has been a year of great change outside 
M&S as well. Last summer’s vote to leave 
the European Union has caused inevitable 
uncertainty. Nobody yet knows what the 
long-term eff ect of Brexit will be. Like many 
businesses we have been impacted by the 
depreciation of sterling, but it is our job to 
seize the opportunities ahead and prepare 
for all eventualities. 
We have made some hard decisions. Some 
have led to signiﬁ cant adjustments to our 
proﬁ ts this year and also, in the case of 
repositioning our Clothing & Home business, 
to some short-term reduction in our 
adjusted proﬁ ts. However, these changes 
needed to be made for the long-term 
health of the business. Decisive action and 
strong execution have never been more 
important to compete in a fast-changing 
retail environment. These actions allow us 
to embrace the future from a position of 
strength, well equipped for a digital age 
and with a sustainable business model. 
PERFORMANCE
I believe our food is, without exaggeration, 
among the best in the world. Once again, 
we delivered a good performance in a 
tough market. Sales grew as customers 
responded to the quality of our food and 
the convenience of our stores. We are very 
pleased with the overall performance of 
the Simply Food stores opened during 
the year. The return on capital from the 
format remains compelling. With product 
innovation remaining the backbone of our 
Food business and a strong, but measured, 
store opening programme, we have a clear 
path to growth.
We repositioned our Clothing & Home 
business for sustainable growth by ending 
a damaging cycle of promotions and 
discounts. We also refocused our ranges on 
stylish, wearable, great-quality essentials. 
By implementing a sensible, competitive 
pricing architecture for our customers, 
we have seen encouraging improvements 
in full-price sales. As expected, fewer 
promotions and less discounting resulted 
in lower sales. There is much work still to 
do but we are beginning to see signs of 
recovery. Steve made it clear a year ago 
that this repositioning would have a short-
term negative impact on proﬁ ts but would 
set us up for sustainable performance and 
a stronger business in the long term. A year 
on, we are even clearer that this was the 
right thing to do. 
Our International business had a 
challenging year. However, we announced 
a clear strategy to focus on our strong 
franchise partnerships and our established 
joint ventures, and operate in fewer owned 
markets, by exiting ten owned, loss-making 
markets and 53 stores. 
Overall, adjusted proﬁ t before tax was 
£6 1 3.8m, down 10.3% on last year. However, 
due to charges of £437 .4m, Group proﬁ ts 
fell to £1 76.4m. The main elements of the 
charges relate to the cost of implementing 
the new pay and pensions arrangements, 
and the cost of the International store 
closures. I was Chairman when about half of 
these 53 stores opened and so must accept 
my full share of the responsibility for this 
disappointing result. However, consumer 
behaviour has changed in the intervening 
years. We had already signiﬁ cantly scaled 
back our ambitions in owned markets 
before we announced these closure plans, 
and just as there was a rationale for opening 
the stores then, there is one for closing 
them now. It is essential that we adapt to our 
customers’ changing needs and recognise 
the current realities of the markets in which 
we operate, despite the short-term cost. 
Having the right stores in the right places 
is also why we are reshaping our UK store 
portfolio, as we focus on having less, more 
inspiring Clothing & Home space and 
growing our Food space. At the end of this 
ﬁ ve-year programme we will have increased 
our space overall and employed more 
people. Our stores will be more relevant 
to the changing needs and habits of our 
customers in a digital world. 
This year Steve has set out clear and decisive plans. I will leave an 
M&S that is well equipped for the digital age and totally focused 
on its customers. This more relevant M&S is underpinned by eff ective 
succession planning, good governance and active shareholder 
engagement which have been my focus during my time as Chairman.

 VALUES AND PLAN A
Our values of Inspiration, Innovation, 
Integrity and In Touch run through 
everything we do at M&S. This is a business 
that tries to do the right thing and this is 
demonstrated in many ways, from our Long 
Service Awards to helping disadvantaged 
people into work, to the charity support 
delivered through Plan A. 
This isn’t new; it is part of what has deﬁ ned 
us for over a century. In 1964 Lord Sieff , 
our then Deputy Chairman, spoke about 
our values. “The main purpose of building 
up a great business should not be 
merely to make money,” Lord Sieff  said. 
“A company has its responsibilities, not only 
to shareholders but also to the staff , the 
customers and the whole community in 
which it trades. Unless it gives satisfaction, 
and even happiness to all concerned, 
it will fail in its aims in the long term.” 
His comments are as pertinent as ever 
and this philosophy continues to guide 
the way we do business at M&S.
This year marks the tenth anniversary of 
Plan A. I am extremely proud of the work 
we have done. From becoming a zero 
waste to landﬁ ll business and sourcing 
raw materials more responsibly, to our 
ambitious programmes to support workers 
throughout our global supply chain, we 
have sought to lead the way on truly 
sustainable change. We recently relaunched 
Plan A and the latest version is aimed at 
being even more relevant to customers 
and the communities in which we trade. 
BOARD CHANGES
Since I became Chairman in 201 1 I have 
consistently focused on succession 
planning as one of the most important 
tasks for the Board. Last year, after a 
rigorous process, we appointed Steve as 
Chief Executive, the ﬁ rst internal appointee 
for many years. Steve’s strategy is ﬁ rmly in 
place so this is now the right time for a new 
Chairman to take over as plans for growth 
in the longer term are developed.
After an equally rigorous process led 
by Vindi Banga and our Nomination 
Committee, I will be replaced as Chairman 
by Archie Norman in September. Archie 
brings a breadth and depth of relevant 
experience to M&S and an extensive track 
record in retail and brands. I am delighted 
with Archie’s appointment and I wish him 
great success in this role. 
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS 
AND DIVIDENDS
We know how important our dividend 
is to shareholders. Our policy remains 
progressive, with dividends broadly covered 
twice by earnings. Despite a reduction 
of 10.3% in our adjusted proﬁ ts, we have 
decided to maintain the total dividend per 
share for the year at the same level as last 
year with the proposed payment of a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 1 1.9p per share; this dividend 
remains well covered on a cash basis. 
Given the cash costs associated with our 
strategic change and the uncertain market 
conditions, we consider it is prudent 
not to make additional returns of cash 
to shareholders under our enhanced 
return programme. 
A STRONGER COMPANY
I will leave M&S a stronger company. We are 
now set up to compete, with a modern 
distribution and logistics backbone and 
excellent digital, design and sourcing 
capabilities. I have been committed to 
strong governance throughout my tenure 
and your Board today has a balanced 
breadth of talent, both among the 
executives and the non-executives.
We have worked to increase engagement 
with our shareholders and employees. 
Over the last six years, we have engaged 
our major institutional shareholders in 
depth in our business to ensure as much 
transparency as possible. Now, through 
our Shareholder Panel, we are engaging 
with our private shareholders in an 
unprecedented way. In addition, through 
channels such as my regular meetings 
with the Chair of our Business Involvement 
Groups (BIG), M&S’s network of elected 
employees, and his attendance at our 
Board, we are engaging with our people 
as never before. 
Having focused on these three pillars – 
governance, succession and engagement 
– I believe M&S is now better prepared 
for the further changes ahead. 
There is no business I would have been 
prouder to chair than M&S. I will miss being 
part of it, its values and the place it holds 
in customers’ hearts. My colleagues at 
M&S are the most dedicated I have ever 
worked with and I never fail to be impressed 
by their commitment to the business. 
They want M&S to succeed and they know 
what ‘doing the right thing’ means. 
The last six years have seen profound 
changes in retail and at M&S; technology 
has transformed the way that people shop. 
Under Steve, change will continue unabated 
– it must. To meet the challenges ahead, 
M&S must be bold, ambitious and decisive. 
It must think big and execute eff ectively. 
And, as Lord Sieff  said, it must also give 
satisfaction and happiness to its customers, 
its employees and its communities. 
Finally, I would like to thank our customers, 
our employees and our shareholders for 
their support. It has been an unforgettable 
privilege to be Chairman of M&S and 
I wish the business every success in the 
years ahead.

We are always looking for ways to develop 
our engagement with shareholders. This year 
we introduced our regular Shareholder 
Panel, where a small group of private 
shareholders is invited to participate in 
face-to-face discussions with members 
of the Board and senior management. 
For our large institutional investors and 
investor advisory ﬁ rms, we continue to hold 
our Annual Governance Event. Our 201 6 
event was hosted by the Chairman and 
attended by the Senior Independent Director , 
the committee chairmen, Group Secretary, 
and a senior representative from our 
Plan A team.
Our Customer Insight Unit constantly 
gathers feedback from our customers to 
understand what they want from M&S. Key 
insights are shared with the directors and 
are critical to informing strategy. During 
the year, customer feedback resulted in a 
number of store improvements including 
additional staff  on shop ﬂ oors. We also 
engage with our customers to create 
marketing campaigns that are relevant to 
them, such as Christmas With Love in 201 6 
and the creation of Spend It Well. For more 
on customer insight and engagement, see 
‘Market & Customer Insights’ on pages 6-7 
and 'Engaging Our Customers' on page 25. 
201 7 marks the tenth anniversary of 
Plan A, our social and environmental 
sustainability programme. Central to 
Plan A is our goal of creating a positive 
impact in society and improving people's 
lives, be they employees, customers, 
workers in our supply chain, charity 
partners or local communities around the 
world. Find out more at marksandspencer.

whose educational and social activities 
have enriched the lives of thousands of 
local people. Visit the Archive's website at

The Board’s engagement with the Company’s 
85,000 employees is facilitated through 
our Business Involvement Group (BIG), 
a network of 3,500 elected employee 
representatives from across all parts of the 
business. Local BIG teams regularly feed 
back to National BIG, whose chairman in 
turn represents the collective employee 
voice through regular meetings with the 
Chairman and CEO, plus annual attendance 
at Board meetings. However, employee 
engagement extends far beyond BIG: One 
example from the year was a collaborative 
exercise where we asked our store 
colleagues what we all needed to do 
diff erently to Make Every Moment Special 
for our customers. Through 75 regional 
leadership events and 1,500 events involving 
all our store employees, we found new 
ways to help empower our people to put 
customers at the heart of the business 
(more about this on page 8). Engagement 
can also start in the community: Through 
Marks & Start we off ered work placements 
to over 2,900 disadvantaged people in 
2 0 1 6 / 1 7 . Over 6 5 % of those who c omplet ed the 
programme went on to ﬁ nd work, either with 
M&S or other employers. For further details

STRATEGIC REPORT
UNDERSTANDING OUR CUSTOMERS
Our Customer Insight Unit (CIU) gathers 
feedback through a number of diff erent 
channels, including store exit surveys, 
online surveys and reviews, till surveys, 
the Customer Contact Centre and focus 
groups, to build a comprehensive picture 
of what our customers want from M&S. This 
year, we carried out over 700,000 customer 
interviews, either in person or through 
online surveys. Within CIU, we have created a 
centralised data analytics team to ensure we 
have a single accurate view of our customers. 
Through anonymised data analysis, we can 
better understand how our customers are 
shopping with us by examining purchasing 
behaviours and patterns both in our stores 
and online. By understanding how our 
customers choose to spend their money 
and time at M&S, we can ensure we are 
always working to deliver the products 
and shopping experience they want. 
Our Consumer Barometer gives us a regular 
snapshot of how consumers are feeling 
about their household ﬁ nances and the 
economy in general. Every month we talk 
to 70,000 M&S customers across our key 
customer groups, as well as those who 
don’t shop with us regularly, to take the 
nation’s pulse. 
We overlay this insight with external market 
data, such as weather patterns, travel time 
to our stores, local footfall data and the 
competitor environment, to build a solid 
understanding of our customers and our 
position in the overall retail landscape. 
But gathering this crucial data is only half 
of the equation – it’s how we use it to put our 
customers centre stage that’s important. 
By carefully analysing all the information that 
we have, we can ensure we are in touch with 
consumer attitudes and lifestyles. The data 
allows us to identify patterns and groups of 
customers. By understanding these groups 
in detail, we can build our strategies from 
the customer upwards rather than from 
the boardroom downwards. 
In short, the information allows us to 
do a better job for our most important 
stakeholders – the people who shop with 
us – so that we are more relevant, more 
often. By understanding and knowing our 
customers through careful and detailed 
data analysis, we can put customers right 
at the heart of everything we do.
WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE TELLING US
After holding up reasonably well over 
Christmas, consumer conﬁ dence in 
general dipped in the early months of 201 7 . 
People started to feel a little less certain 
about the wider economic outlook due 
to concern around issues such as rising 
inﬂ ation, the falling pound and uncertainty 
as a result of the UK’s decision to leave 
the European Union. 
When asked about their future spending 
intentions, all consumers – rather than 
M&S customers in particular – said they 
were likely to trim back their discretionary 
spending in the months ahead due to these 
economic concerns. They also said they 
were more likely than before to put their 
money into experiences and events, such 
as trips to the cinema, gym membership 
or meals out, rather than into buying 
consumer goods on the high street. 
Net optimism, a measure of how positive 
people are feeling, increased by 5% over 
the year. In terms of their biggest concerns 
in the immediate future, people cited rising 
food prices, worries about the Brexit 
negotiations and geopolitical uncertainty 
following the American presidential 
election last November. 
But despite all this, consumer conﬁ dence is 
still relatively high compared with the period 
between 2008 and 201 3, when it suff ered 
a prolonged slump due to the credit crisis. 
More of our food shoppers say that they 
would recommend us to family and friends. 
Our Net Promoter Score (NPS), which 
measures customers’ willingness to 
recommend M&S, in Food is up four points. 
In Clothing & Home, while overall NPS was 
broadly level, we saw an improvement in 
ratings from our most frequent customers 
and in our larger stores, so we know 
customers are noticing the diff erence. 
Although our Clothing & Home business 
is still recovering, customers can see we 
are doing the right things. Customers ﬁ nd 
M&S.com easy to navigate and customer 
satisfaction has signiﬁ cantly improved 
over the last year. 
HOW WE USE OUR INSIGHTS
The information we gather gives us 
a crucial insight into the context in which 
we’re trading. Our insights mean nothing 
unless we act on them. We share the 
information with all our business units 
and use the results to help us inform our 
business decisions.
From product development and design, to 
the content we put on our website, to our 
online delivery proposition – they are all 
guided by what our customers tell us.
This year there were many examples of 
how we took insights from our CIU and used 
them to improve our customers’ experience, 
for example:
> We changed the layout of our clothing 
departments because of customer 
feedback that our stores were sometimes 
confusing to shop in. Until this year, we 
organised Womenswear by sub-brand, 
such as per una or Limited Edition. But this 
led to a fragmented shopping experience 
and product duplication where sub-
brands had similar garments. Our stores 
now have clear product departments, with 
the key products for the season brought 
together at the front of the store, leading 
to a more intuitive shopping experience. 
> We have used our insights to increase 
levels of personalisation for our 5.6m 
Sparks members who now receive tailored 
off ers based on their interests and shopping 
habits. We invite them to special Sparks 
events and experiences, such as wine 
tastings or fashion shows, depending on 
MARKET & CUSTOMER 
INSIGHTS
OUR BUSINESS
Our actions are driven by listening to our customers and 
analysing the market to build a rich and robust picture of our 
customers’ shopping habits and outlooks. Everything we do as 
a company is ﬁ ltered through the lens of what we know about 
our customers and every decision starts with them. 07
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
how many Sparks they have and what we 
know they are passionate about. We are 
also being more targeted in our email 
communications by sending customers 
updates speciﬁ cally related to their local 
store and area so they only get the 
information that is most relevant to them. 
> We used quantitative data from 7,000 
customers to guide our investment in 
improving service in our stores. This research 
told us customers wanted to see more 
Customer Assistants in our stores. 
We responded by putting over 3,000 
more colleagues into the departments 
where our customers told us they value 
service most, including Fitting Rooms, 
Bra Fit, Men’s Suits and Footwear.
> We showcase our clothing collections to 
the fashion press twice a year – Autumn/
Winter in May and Spring/Summer in 
November – so our customers get to 
see some of what’s coming next season. 
This year, we responded to feedback that 
customers increasingly want to buy into 
new season trends as soon as they see 
them with ‘See Now Buy Now’ capsule 
collections, enabling customers to 
shop key pieces from the new season 
straight away. 
> The Clothing & Home research panel 
we use for product development has 
a customer interaction every ﬁ ve seconds 
through our dedicated panel of around 
23 1,000 customers. With this we gain 
invaluable feedback on new products 
during design development, so we can 
increase the buys on customer favourites 
and eliminate products that score less 
well at the concept stage, ensuring we 
are shaping collections that most 
resonate with our customers.
> For this year’s Christmas campaign, we 
listened to thousands of customers 
to understand what they want to see 
from M&S at Christmas. The feedback 
we gathered said they wanted us to own 
Christmas in the traditional sense, but in 
a way that was surprising and diff erent. 
So we created the Christmas with Love 
campaign starring the often unsung hero 
of Christmas, Mrs Claus, who epitomised 
the huge eff orts our customers put in to 
making the festive season special.
This is just the beginning. The next few years 
present exciting opportunities. For example, 
since the launch of Sparks in 201 5, nearly 
1.5m people have downloaded our M&S app. 
This combination of technology and loyalty 
is powerful. It brings us closer to our customers 
and will allow us to further enrich our 
proposition. It will allow us to increase 
customer engagement. And it will allow 
us to drive frequency of purchase across 
channels and categories. 
Smart use of data can boost sales and 
therefore create value for everyone: our 
customers, our employees and, ultimately, 
our shareholders.
M&S TODAY
UK FOOD MARKETPLACE
We face stiff  competition across the UK food sector with rising inﬂ ation, recovery 
among the main four supermarkets and the continued growth of the discounters. 
Food retailers and suppliers also face cost headwinds due to rising raw material prices 
and the depreciation of sterling. However, through listening to our customers and 
monitoring the market, we keep on top of changing shopping habits. Consumers remain 
as savvy as ever and relish innovation. They are also doing smaller ‘convenience’ shops. 
These trends play to our strengths.
UK CLOTHING MARKETPLACE
The market remains highly competitive, with retailers facing cost pressures due to 
increasing commodity prices and the impact of the fall in sterling. At the same time, 
households are managing their ﬁ nances carefully due to fears of inﬂ ation and political 
uncertainty. Customers still love treating themselves, but consumer conﬁ dence dipped 
in the early months of 201 7 . Spending on clothing is also coming under pressure as 
consumers spend more on experiences and retailers are vying with cinemas and 
restaurants for spend. However, we believe we can attract consumers by focusing 
on off ering high quality, stylish products that are competitively priced.

STRATEGIC REPORT
OVERVIEW
A year ago, I started in my role as Chief 
Executive by posing a series of questions 
that I hoped would help unlock the future of 
M&S, giving us a platform from which to ﬁ rst 
recover and then to grow. 201 6/1 7 has been 
a year of change as we started to answer 
these questions, which I address below. 
The steps we are taking are making a 
diff erence and we are making progress. 
However, as we said when we set out our 
plan, it has resulted in some short-term 
pain. Some of the action needed has been 
costly and proﬁ ts are down. Clothing & 
Home sales were down year-on-year as we 
reduced promotions and markdown activity. 
We expected this and we still believe we are 
doing the right thing for the future of our 
business. We have seen encouraging signs 
from the increase in full-price Clothing & 
Home sales and in the sales growth during 
the key Christmas trading period. And in 
Food, we continued to grow ahead of the 
market with new stores outperforming 
expectations. 
The business has adapted well as we start to 
build a sustainable foundation for the future. 
We have laid a lot of the groundwork for 
our recovery; however, we are not there yet. 
I want to see consistent delivery over time 
and I want to see us move out of recovery. 
Even as our performance improves, we 
can’t stand still. While we are still focused 
on recovering our business and we have a 
lot more to do, I am also starting to look 
to future growth opportunities, some of 
which I outline at the end of this update.
OUR CUSTOMERS
We asked how we could put customers at 
the heart of everything we do. Due to the 
changes we’ve made, we are now a more 
data-driven organisation where decisions 
are made based on what we know about 
our customers, not what we think we know. 
We conduct more customer listening 
groups than ever before; all trading 
meetings now begin with insight into our 
customers; and, as we celebrate ten years 
of leading the social and environmental 
agenda, we have repurposed Plan A to 
make it more customer-focused. 
Our customer-focused changes are most 
keenly felt in our stores. We invested in 
customer service by recruiting additional 
colleagues into the areas we know are most 
important to our customers. We also rolled 
out our Making Every Moment Special 
in-store service initiative. 
 Read more about Making Every Moment 
Special below
Our new Spend It Well marketing campaign – 
like our Mrs Claus Christmas campaign 
before it – focuses squarely on our 
customers’ lifestyles. It taps into people’s 
emotional connection with M&S and is 
aimed at driving a reappraisal of our brand. 
Life is short so we should Spend It Well. The 
campaign encourages customers to make 
the most of what’s relevant for them today. 
CLOTHING & HOME
We asked how we could recover and grow 
our Clothing & Home business. The answer 
lay in making a series of common sense, 
customer-focused changes to the way we 
do things. In a tough market, I am pleased 
with the progress we are making.
By listening to our customers and simplifying how we do things, 
I believe we have the right strategy in place to make M&S a relevant, 
proﬁ table and truly sustainable retailer.
STEVE ROWE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S 
STRATEGIC UPDATE
OUR BUSINESS
MAKING EVERY MOMENT SPECIAL
Our Making Every Moment Special 
employee engagement programme has 
been transformational for our customers 
and our people alike. Through it, we believe 
we’ve taken customer service to new levels. 
Last summer, we gave over 70,000 store 
colleagues interactive training with the 
objective of putting customers at the heart 
of what we do. We encouraged them to make 
real-time decisions based on individual 
customers’ needs and we removed non-
customer-facing tasks from their daily 
routines, giving them more time to spend 
with customers. The response from 
colleagues has been phenomenal and as 
positive as anything I’ve known in my 28 
years at M&S. Our ‘Customer at the Heart’ 
site on Yammer, our internal social media 
network, contains thousands of examples 
of great service by our colleagues. 
Throughout our 1 33-year history, we have 
learnt that better service leads to better 
sales. Making Every Moment Special shows 
this principle in action. It has become our 
mantra across the business. By empowering 
our people to make customer-focused 
decisions, our sales ﬂ oors are buzzing 
with a renewed sense of purpose. 09
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We made shopping simpler for customers 
by reducing the number of times we launch 
new lines from 1 4 to nine times a year. 
We cut the number of garment options 
by 10%. We are phasing out the Indigo, 
Collezione and North Coast sub-brands. 
These measures enabled us to improve 
availability across our ranges. Previously, 
we acted too much like a ‘fast fashion’ 
company, prioritising frequency over quality 
and taking too many cues from catwalk 
fashions. So we improved our ﬁ ts, fabrics 
and ﬁ nishes, we increased availability and 
we refocused on delivering contemporary 
wearable style and wardrobe essentials. 
Our ranges are now more relevant to what 
customers want from M&S. 
We started off ering better value than ever 
before by reducing prices on 2,400 Clothing 
& Home lines. We simultaneously reduced 
our promotional activity. This put an end to 
confusing pricing which meant our products 
were either too expensive or too heavily 
discounted. Not only have these changes 
given clarity to customers, but they made 
our sales more proﬁ table and boosted our 
full-price market share.
We also made our stores far easier to shop 
in by merchandising more of our clothes 
by product category rather than by brand. 
This change in emphasis reﬂ ected the 
changes we made last year to the way our 
teams design and buy products. Our shops 
are now simpler and more intuitive. They are 
based around customers’ needs. 
We are still in the recovery phase of our plan 
and getting it right is absolutely crucial to 
our success. In May this year, we announced 
a new role to lead this work. Jill McDonald 
will join as Managing Director, Clothing, 
Home & Beauty and will have overall proﬁ t 
and loss accountability for all aspects of 
our Clothing & Home business, from design 
and sourcing through to supply chain and 
logistics. The scope of this role highlights 
the importance we are placing on 
continuing to recover and starting to 
grow Clothing & Home. We are making 
encouraging progress and I believe we 
are on the right path to growth.

STRATEGIC REPORT
 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC UPDATE CONTINUED
FOOD
Convenient. Special. Diff erent. These are 
the reasons why customers love our food. 
These are also the reasons why our Food 
business is on a clear path to sustainable 
growth. We know that selling quality food 
from convenient locations is a winning 
formula: sales from the 30 owned Simply 
Food stores we opened this year are ahead 
of plan. We’ll continue to grow our Food 
business by opening 250 further Food 
stores by 2020. We’re succeeding in 
our aim of making every food moment 
special. Customers love our high levels of 
innovation – we renew around a quarter 
of our range every year – and they love 
the high quality of our products. We won’t 
accept second-rate ingredients. In a world 
where you get what you pay for, it shows. 
This year we extended Collection, our 
top tier range for customers who want 
something extra special. And customers 
know they can trust us on health. It is their 
number one concern when it comes to 
buying food, so we launched 200 new 
products aimed at helping our customers 
to eat well, and extended our Made Without, 
Balanced for You and Eat Well ranges. 
The grocery market continues to be very 
competitive but we will continue to set 
ourselves apart with superior quality, 
innovation and convenient food in 
convenient locations. As we grow our 
Food store presence, our food will be even 
more accessible to more customers. 
OUR PEOPLE
By thinking, working and behaving with 
a truly customer-centric mindset, I believe 
our people are integral to our success. 
Last year I asked what our right cost base, 
shape and structure was, and how this 
would aff ect our people. In April 201 7 , we 
ﬁ nalised the pay and pensions changes 
that I outlined last year and we now reward 
our people in a fairer, more consistent way. 
I am immensely proud that we now have 
pay and beneﬁ t parity across the business. 
Following detailed consultation with our 
National Business Involvement Group of 
elected employee representatives, we now 
off er one of the best reward packages in 
UK retail. 
In November, we outlined further plans to 
simplify the business and lower our costs. 
This resulted in a reduction of roles at our 
Head Offi  ce and the decision to reduce our 
central London offi  ce space as we move 
to more effi  cient ways of working. Some 
of these decisions had a direct impact on 
a number of our employees. But I believe 
our people recognise that we made them 
for the right reasons and that they were 
necessary for our sustainable growth.
I would like to thank all our people for their 
dedication and professionalism in a year 
of signiﬁ cant but necessary change. 
STORE ESTATE AND INTERNATIONAL
Our customers’ shopping habits are 
changing, so I asked whether our UK and 
International store estate is the right shape 
for the future. It is not. Customers’ behaviour 
is evolving, and the pace of change is 
accelerating. Rather than doing one big 
food shop a week, there is a growing trend 
of customers picking up food for now or for 
tonight. Look at how people use technology. 
They’ll browse or buy online and collect in 
store. Or they’ll buy on their smartphone 
for home delivery. Sales on M&S.com now 
account for 1 7% of Clothing & Home sales. 
At the same time, customers want to shop in 
modern stores that off er a great experience. 
Our store portfolio needs to reﬂ ect how 
people live their lives today.
So we announced plans to rebalance our 
UK space to meet changing customer 
needs. The transformation will enable us 
to grow Clothing & Home sales through 
fewer, better stores. Over ﬁ ve years, we will 
change the use of around 25% of our space, 
with more of it being deployed to Food and 
other growth areas. Clothing & Home space 
will reduce by around 10%. Approximately 
30 full-line stores will close, and 45 will be 
converted to Simply Food. 
To be clear, this is neither a withdrawal nor a 
retrenchment. Due to our ambitious Food 
expansion we will have more stores in the 
future, not fewer. But our estate will be the 
shape which meets how our customers 
want to shop at M&S. 
Our International operations have also 
changed. While our franchise business with 
our knowledgeable partners is proﬁ table, 
our owned estate is not. This is unsustainable, 
so we are focusing on our joint venture and 
franchise partnerships and our growing 
online business, and exiting ten of our loss-
making owned markets. The programme is 
on track. We have now closed all ten of our 
stores in China and completed employee 
consultations in the remaining markets. 
We remain a signiﬁ cant player on the global 
stage with a store or online presence in 
55 markets. I believe in an international 
business for M&S and remain committed 
to it.
These changes show that we’re willing to 
adapt to ensure we’re in the best shape for 
our customers.
OUR OPERATING MODEL
Simplicity and accountability are key 
to running an agile and successful 
business. We are therefore changing our 
operating model to give us two clear proﬁ t 
and loss accountabilities – one for our 
Clothing & Home business unit and one 
for our Food business unit. Both sides of 
the business are now responsible for their 
own end-to-end proﬁ t & loss. As part of 
the change, M&S.com has moved from 
being a separate business unit to being 
a sales channel, along with Stores and 
International. All three channels now 
feed into our two business units, with our 
customers at the centre. Underpinning 
these changes is the ongoing drive for 
simplicity in the way we do things.

COSTS 
Cost control remains a top priority. 
Our operating costs were up 3.8% this 
year as we put more colleagues into stores 
and absorbed the costs of our Food store 
opening programme. We funded some of 
this through our Crunch Costs initiative, 
which challenged all of our people to tackle 
unnecessary costs, and from simplifying 
our Head Offi  ce structure. Better buying 
initiatives, such as direct design and food 
packaging optimisation, mitigated the 
currency headwinds we saw on both sides 
of the business. The steps we’ve taken to 
transform M&S led to charges of £437 .4m 
this year. These were largely driven by 
charges for International store closures 
and for the changes to pay and pensions. 
While proﬁ ts were signiﬁ cantly down, 
I continue to believe in good cash 
management, a robust balance sheet and 
a progressive dividend policy. We know how 
important our dividend is to shareholders 
big and small.

OUR CHAIRMAN
Our Chairman, Robert Swannell ,has 
announced that he will step down in 
September. On behalf of all of us at M&S, I 
wish Robert well. He has overseen signiﬁ cant 
change at M&S. Our infrastructure now 
provides a strong platform for growth, and 
Robert has been instrumental in driving 
shareholder engagement, good governance 
and succession planning. He has also been 
a tremendous support to me personally 
over the last year. On behalf of the whole 
business, I would like to welcome Robert’s 
successor, Archie Norman.
LOOKING AHEAD
My priorities for the year ahead are to 
continue to recover and grow Clothing & 
Home and to grow our Food business. I will 
also establish the foundations for new 
paths to growth. In the UK, these will focus 
on areas of market share opportunity in 
Kidswear, Footwear, Home and Beauty. 
Internationally, we will explore new territories 
with our franchise partners. And I will continue 
to develop talent within the organisation. 
It continues to be a privilege to lead this 
fantastic company. Our job as a retailer is 
quite simple: we must off er customers great 
products at the right price in physical or 
digital environments that they enjoy, with 
great service. If we do this, they will come 
back to us for more. 
But to do this year-in, year-out, we must 
constantly adapt. We must adapt both to stay 
in tune with our customers’ needs and in the 
way we sell our products. Shopping habits 
won’t stop changing, so neither must we. 
As Chief Executive, I want to make M&S agile 
and ﬂ exible enough to change with our 
customers. I want to see the end of big 
transformation programmes followed by 
years of standing still, followed by yet more 
transformation. Remaining relevant should 
be a continuous process.
By simplifying how we do things and really 
listening to our customers, we’ve already 
become more agile this year. By rationalising 
our Clothing ranges and reshaping our store 
portfolio, we’ve started to put this agility 
into practice. In doing this, we’ve built a solid 
foundation for growth. We must never stop 
adapting our business for our customers.
Nothing makes me prouder of the work our 
teams do than hearing from our customers 
and what they love about M&S. Those 
customers are the reason we’re here. They 
will remain at the heart of everything we do.

1 LISTEN & RESPOND 2 STRATEGY & PLANNING 3 DEVELOP & DESIGN
Activities: By fostering talent and 
encouraging entrepreneurialism among 
our people, we can continue to develop 
high quality products for our customers. 
Our product developers are experts in their 
ﬁ elds, whether they are food technologists 
or experienced tailors. Our food innovation 
sets us apart and with talent ranging from 
Michelin-trained chefs to Masters of Wine, 
our Food team is among the best in the 
business. We now design 68% of our 
clothing ranges in-house and buy our 
clothes by product category rather than 
sub-brand.
Outcome: The talent in our Food team 
underpins the innovation that our 
customers love. By developing and 
designing clothing in-house, we have 
reduced product proliferation, designed 
ranges characterised by a more consistent 
colour palette and reﬁ ned our quality 
through improved ﬁ t, upgraded fabric 
and better ﬁ nishes. 
Activities: Effi  cient implementation of our 
strategy is key. This year, changes to our 
organisational structure saw us streamline 
our senior management team and bring 
each channel’s merchandising operations 
together, increasing effi  ciency. We also 
revised our operating model, which will 
give our two business units – Clothing & 
Home and Food – clear proﬁ t and loss 
accountability. Through our Smarter 
Working programme, we created a new 
technology hub which will roll-out 
signiﬁ cant technology improvements 
to increase our digital savviness across 
the business. 
Outcome: Successfully implementing our 
strategy allows us to improve our ﬁ nancial 
performance through increased proﬁ ts 
and strengthened cash ﬂ ow.
Activities: Our customers are at the heart 
of everything we do, and our strategy 
today is more customer-focused than ever 
before. By understanding what drives their 
behaviour, both within M&S and externally, 
we can ensure we work to deliver the 
products and experiences that customers 
want. This year we strengthened the data 
and analytics team within our Customer 
Insight Unit (CIU), which gathers and 
interprets customer data, as well as a 
wealth of external sources. The CIU then 
ensures that its insights are used across 
our business units. Through the CIU, we can 
understand each customer’s needs and 
relationship with M&S – wherever and 
however they shop. 
Outcome: By listening to customers and 
responding to what they tell us, we can 
create products and shopping experiences 
that are relevant to them.

Activities: We constantly evolve how we sell 
our products to suit customers’ changing 
lifestyles. Customers today are increasingly 
looking for deeper engagement with brands; 
they want richer and more meaningful 
experiences. They want moments that matter . 
W e therefore work across departments 
and channels to create great customer 
experiences. For example, our stores are now 
laid out in product areas, more aligned with 
M&S.com, and M&S.com is evolving from a 
purely transactional experience to a place of 
inspiration and personalisation. Our Spend 
It Well campaign reﬂ ects the unique feeling 
that our customers have about M&S and our 
high quality own-brand products. We’re also 
making ‘doing the right thing’ synonymous 
with the M&S brand by committing to all our 
products having a Plan A story to tell by 2020.
Outcome: Our own brand creates value by 
distinguishing us from our competitors and 
our Plan A ambitions make sustainability 
accessible to all.
Activities: A strong, ethical supply chain is 
crucial in creating sustainable value. We work 
with our suppliers to ensure continuous 
social and environmental improvement, 
whether it relates to sourcing cotton or 
ﬁ shing more sustainably. We are committed 
to being more transparent about our supply 
chains, and our interactive Supplier Map 
details all the clothing, home, beauty and 
food factories that supply M&S. All 3,000 of 
our suppliers must adhere to our Global 
Sourcing Principles, which cover working 
conditions and workers’ rights. We comply 
with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice 
(GSCOP) and help build global approaches 
to ethical sourcing through organisations 
such as the Consumer Goods Forum.
Outcome: An eff ective sourcing strategy 
creates sustainable value by driving 
effi  ciencies and margin improvement, 
while using our scale to deliver great 
quality at every price point. 
Activities: We build on our privileged position 
of trust among customers with high levels 
of service. This year our Making Every Moment 
Special employee engagement initiative 
saw 70,000 store colleagues receive training 
in giving better customer service and 
making the shopping experience eff ortless 
for customers. In understanding our 
customers better, we can become more 
relevant more often. We also serve and 
engage with our customers via our Sparks 
loyalty scheme. Through Sparks, they share 
their passions and preferences with us, 
so we can introduce new services, products 
and channels that we know will interest 
them. We also serve and engage with the 
communities in which we operate. 
Outcome: Good service and engaging with 
our customers in a way that is relevant to 
them drives higher sales and customer 
loyalty. This creates long-term sustainable 
value across the business.  14

The January edition of our Adventures in 
Food customer newspaper was all about 
the new ranges, with information on some 
of the more unusual ingredients, tips for 
ways to eat more healthily and recipe 
ideas for creating healthy meals at home. 
Communications went to all stores to 
educate colleagues on the new ranges and 
we hosted tasting events in 50 stores, giving 
customers the chance to try the Nourish 
Bowls and the new wraps and sandwiches. 
We have seen a big change in how our 
customers shop for healthy food. As 
interests have shifted away from dieting, 
consumers are looking for ways to live 
healthier lifestyles every day and 8 1 % of our 
customers tell us that health is their number 
one concern when buying food. We have also 
seen an increase in interest in wheat -free and 
plant -based eating, with vegan products 
being one of the biggest product requests 
we receive from our customers. This isn’t just 
vegetarians and vegans – industry data 
suggests there is a growing number of 
people in the UK who identify as ﬂ exitarian in 
that they eat a largely plant -based diet with 
the occasional addition of meat and ﬁ sh. 
With a 4.5% market share in the on-the-
go lunchtime food market, we saw an 
opportunity for us to add to our Food on 
the Move range by bringing these trends 
to our customers. We also noticed there 
was a gap in the market for vegan-friendly 
lunchtime options. Our product development 
team went on a research trip to California, 
the home of healthy eating, to get ideas and 
inspiration. The big trend in San Francisco was 
for nourish bowls – colourful, wholesome 
salad bowls composed of vegetables, healthy 
grains and protein.
Taking the customer insight, market trend 
data and inspiration from their trip, the 
team developed a new range of Nourish 
Bowls, featuring hearty, wholesome and 
fresh ingredients including edamame, 
black rice, avocado and sweet potato. 
They also developed our ﬁ rst ever vegan 
sandwiches and a range of vegetable wraps, 
made with beetroot, pumpkin or spinach, 
which all contain a portion of vegetables.

We launched the new range in January, 
when consumers are typically looking 
for new ways to eat healthily. Our TV and 
print campaign, Adventures in Wonderfood, 
showcased products from the new ranges 
in a vibrant and exciting way, and this was 
supported by a coordinated campaign 
in our stores and editorial features on 
M&S.com. With its range of new ﬂ avours, we 
introduced the Nourish Bowls to customers 
as part of our lunch meal deal, and ran a 
special promotion for Sparks members with 
10% off  all Eat Well products, which included 
the new Food on the Move products. 
5 BRAND & SELL 
Our buying teams worked with our 
suppliers to source unusual grains and 
on-trend ingredients, such as buckwheat 
and cauliﬂ ower couscous, to bring 
something new and diff erent to our 
customers. The Avocado & Egg Nourish 
Bowl is the ﬁ rst product on the UK high 
street to use sorghum, a protein and ﬁ bre 
rich wholegrain similar to pearl barley, 
while the Edamame & Black Rice and the 
Sweet Potato Nourish Bowls are our ﬁ rst 
vegan Food on the Move salads.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
STRATEGIC REPORT OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We know coats are one of the most 
important product categories for our 
customers when it comes to determining 
their view of M&S. Coats are quick to try 
on during a shopping trip and customers 
want to be able to easily compare the look 
and feel of each item. For Autumn/Winter 1 6, 
we made our coats easier to shop with a 
Coats destination area at the front of our 
stores. The area featured an event zone 
which showcased the key coats of the 
season, with unstructured coats in early 
autumn switching to the warmer pea coats 
as the weather got colder.
The pea coat is a consistently popular 
style and it has joined garments such 
as the trench and the camel coat as 
a timeless classic. It’s also a style that is 
consistently popular with our customers – 
our Winter 1 5 collection featured a classic 
pea coat in two colours that was an instant 
hit and sold out early in the season. As the 
market leader in coats, we know this is a 
style we need to get right. 
We have set out a clear strategy to focus 
on style over fashion trends, and we know 
our customers want a consistent ﬁ t that 
ﬂ atters with good quality fabrics. We also 
know we are at our best when we focus on 
what we are famous for. In order to maximise 
the opportunity, our Womenswear team set 
out to create a collection of pea coats that 
used quality fabrics and styling to deliver a 
range suitable for our broad customer base. 
Following the changes to the structure 
of our Womenswear team, our products 
are now designed and bought by category 
rather than by brand. Our Outerwear design 
team created a collection which took that 
classic shape and updated it with diff erent 
colours and interesting fabrics. Using our 
sub-brands, the team created distinct 
products for our customers. This gave 
the range a clear point of diff erence across 
M&S Collection and the sub-brands; from 
the coats’ length, fabric and colour to styling 
details such as pockets, trims or collar shape. 
At £55, our M&S Collection opening price 
point pea coat gave customers a wardrobe 
classic at a great price, while the per una 
pea coat featured gold military buttons 
and a faux fur collar, as we know per una 
customers like a touch of elegance.

STRATEGIC REPORT
GROUP REVENUE
Total Group revenue, including retail 
sales for owned businesses and 
wholesale sales to franchise partners.
Group revenues were up this year, 
mainly driven by the growth in our 
Food business as we opened new 
stores and an improvement in 
International revenues.
Group PBT before adjusted items was 
down on last year largely due to the 
reduction in Clothing & Home gross 
proﬁ t and the increase in operating 
costs in the year.
GROUP PROFIT BEFORE TAX (PBT) 
AND ADJUSTED ITEMS
Adjusted proﬁ t provides additional 
information on performance, adjusting 
for items considered to be signiﬁ cant 
in nature and/or value.
RETURN ON CAPITAL 
EMPLOYED (ROCE)
Return on capital employed is 
a relative proﬁ t measure of the 
returns from net operating assets. 
The decrease in ROCE primarily reﬂ ects 
the decrease in earnings before interest, 
tax and adjusted items.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS 
PER SHARE (EPS)
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is the 
proﬁ t before the impact of adjusted 
items divided by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue. 
Basic adjusted EPS decreased primarily 
due to the lower proﬁ t generated in the 
year. The weighted average number of 
shares in issue during the period was 
1,623.1m (last year 1,635.9m).
DIVIDEND PER SHARE
Dividend per share declared in respect 
of the year.
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal 
dividend of 1 1.9p per share, resulting 
in a total dividend of 1 8.7p.
FREE CASH FLOW 
(PRE SHAREHOLDER 
RETURNS) 
Free cash ﬂ ow is the net cash generated 
by the business in the period before 
returns to shareholders excluding the 
impact of exchange rates on translation 
of foreign currency denominated 
cash balances.
We delivered free cash ﬂ ow up 8.5% 
on last year mainly due to the impact 
of reduced capital expenditure, 
which was partially off set by weaker 
business performance.

MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
STRATEGIC REPORT
We took action this year to simplify and 
modernise our business in line with our strat egy 
to put our customers at the heart of 
everything we do, keep things simple and 
work as one team. We reduced the number 
of roles in our UK Head Offi  ce by 590 
alongside moving 400 IT and Logistics roles 
out of central London. We also put in place 
a fairer, simpler and more consistent 
approach to pay. The changes, which took 
eff ect in April this year, saw us increase basic 
pay for our Customer Assistants to a level 
well above the National Living Wage and 
move to a single approach for premium 
payments. We also moved to a more 
consistent and sustainable approach to 
pensions for all M&S employees and closed 
the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme to 
future accrual. These changes were made 
following an extensive consultation process 
with all employees through our National 
Business Involvement Group (BIG), 
M&S’s network of elected employee 
representatives, and through town hall 
meetings and listening groups in our stores. 
The feedback gathered in these sessions 
directly inﬂ uenced the outcome, which 
demonstrates the importance of BIG. 
We now have a pay and beneﬁ ts package 
that is among the best in UK retail, which 
means we can both reward our store

apprentices this year. They will gain 
experience in diff erent parts of the business, 
including digital, and will ﬁ nish the 
programme with a recognised qualiﬁ cation. 
The programme will provide the ﬁ rst steps 
to a career in retail. At M&S we want to instil 
an ‘anything is possible’ culture and we have 
great role models in a number of our senior 
team who started their careers in our stores.
A
 Our Marks & Start programme for people 
who face barriers getting into work went from 
strength to strength, helping over 2,900 
people, around half of whom were under 
25, take their ﬁ rst steps into work. 
No business can stand still; we are focused 
on continuous improvement and being 
an agile and ﬂ exible organisation that is 
constantly evolving. Our long-term growth 
will rely on us having talented, dedicated 
people at our core. 
employees appropriately and continue 
to attract the best people to serve our 
customers. While no change is easy, these 
were necessary actions to build a robust 
platform for future growth. We are a more 
relevant and agile company as a result. 
We implemented customer-facing changes 
too. By increasing the number of employees 
in our stores, we can better serve our 
customers. Having more people on the 
shop ﬂ oor has had a discernible impact 
on customer satisfaction levels and our 
people’s engagement levels, creating 
a virtuous circle of improvement. Our 
Your Say survey showed that employee 
engagement increased again to 8 1 %. It also 
highlighted areas where employees want 
to see an improvement – we learnt we 
need to do more to demonstrate the 
opportunities for development and this 
will be a focus in the year ahead. 
In November, we outlined a reshaping of 
our UK store estate. Although this programme 
is in its early stages, over the next ﬁ ve years 
it will lead to change for some of our people. 
Our aim is to redeploy as many aff ected 
colleagues as possible and to create more 
jobs as we continue with our Food store 
opening programme. Through constant 
dialogue we will keep our people informed 
every step of the way – they will be the ﬁ rst 
to know of any changes that are planned.
Our 85,000 colleagues are the heart and 
soul of M&S, and we have put in place a clear 
strategy for our People that underpins 
our business strategy. We want to develop 
and attract great talent at all levels of our 
business. We want a winning culture, a diverse 
and inclusive workforce, and we want a ﬁ t and 
ﬂ exible organisation that allows our people 
to ﬂ ourish. By fostering talent in a structured 
way at every level of M&S – be that on the 
shop ﬂ oor, in our school leaver or graduate 
programmes or at more senior levels, 
our people can realise their full potential.
Our new Retail Apprenticeship programme 
is a prime example of fostering talent. 
Launched in May, we will take on 400 retail 
MAKING EVERY MOMENT SPECIAL 
IN OUR COMMUNITIES
Our people believe in doing the right 
thing, not just saying it. Spark Something 
Good is M&S’s way of helping customers 
and colleagues make a real diff erence. 
This year, we took Spark Something Good 
to another seven cities, with over 4,000 
customers and employees volunteering 
on more than 240 projects. We’re also 
sparking something good by working 
to beat cancer – our colleagues and 
customers raised £3.2m for Macmillan 
Cancer Support through a series of 
activities such as our involvement in 
the World’s Biggest Coff ee Morning in 
stores across the country, and £2.8m 
for Breast Cancer Now.
BE YOURSELF
M&S has always taken employee 
wellbeing seriously. We have an 
established wellbeing programme, 
which includes a dedicated online 
Mental Wellbeing area on our employee 
online portal with tools and materials 
from mental health experts designed 
to support M&S employees and line 
managers alike in both prevention and 
support. We also had a series of activities 
bringing inclusion and wellbeing together 
under Dare to Be Yourself, with a series 
of events led by our expert diversity 
partners representing gender, ethnicity, 
LGBT + and wellbeing looking at research, 
insight and views on the important link 
between wellbeing and inclusion.

HEALTHY CHOICE
We want to lead the market on health 
by off ering customers healthy ways to 
feel great and great ways to feel healthy. 
We extended our Eat Well range, and 
added 4 1 lines to our Made Without range, 
which has trebled in size since 201 5 – 
sales rose 4% and 38% respectively. We 
introduced a wholesome store cupboard 
range with 37 new products across areas 
including dried grains and grain pots. Our 
expert chefs travelled to Japan to bring 
back the knowledge and skills required 
to develop a new collection of exceptional 
sushi using traditional methods and 
specialist ingredients. With specially 
selected Japanese rice, authentic nori 
seaweed, fresh wasabi and soy sauce 
brewed in Japan, it is our most authentic 
sushi range ever and customers love it – 
we have already sold 7 40,000 packs.

A
 TRANSPARENCY
Our sustainability credentials are a key 
part of the M&S diff erence and we need 
to ensure our strong ethical standards 
remain at the forefront of everything we 
do. We published our inaugural Human 
Rights Report which outlines the steps 
we are taking to support and respect 
human rights and our plans for the future. 
We were one of ﬁ rst organisations to 
report against the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights Reporting 
Framework and the highest ranked 
retailer in the Corporate Human Rights 
Benchmark. We also extended the 
reach of our interactive supply chain 
map to include Food, Beauty and 
Home suppliers.
We have had a good year in a diffi  cult 
environment. Sales were up 4.2% and 
our growth outpaced the market. Over the 
year, our market share rose 20bps to 4.5%. 
Our focus this year was on building on 
our strengths of innovation, quality and 
convenience. We made our food more 
accessible by opening 68 new Food-only 
stores, taking the total to 636, including 383 
franchise stores. Between our three formats 
– Foodhall, Simply Food and Food To Go – 
we deliver convenient food in convenient 
locations, with ranges tailored to each 
store’s location and size and off ering the 
most relevant choice for our customers. 
We continue to focus on making the 
shopping experience as special as our food. 
Constantly curious, our development team 
is always trying to push the boundaries of 
innovation. Independent tests prove that 
we are maintaining our lead on quality and 
innovation. We introduced 1,600 new lines 
this year, and from festive Secret Centre 
Cheeses to our Texan-inspired Smokehouse 
BBQ collection, newness accounted for 
a quarter of our entire range. We extended 
our premium Collections range to more 
products for customers looking for 
something extra special. We introduced 
shoppers to exciting new fruits and 
vegetables, including the biggest avocado 
on the UK high street and biancoli, 
a cauliﬂ ower similar in appearance and 
texture to Tenderstem broccoli. We added 
1 4 dishes from Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore 
and Korea to our ever-popular Taste Asia 
range and off ered customers a delicious 
fresh meal in 25 minutes with our 
relaunched Cook range. Our product 
developers are constantly working to 
translate the theatre of restaurant desserts 
into something our customers can enjoy 
at home – hits this year included our 
Chocolate Melting Dome and Chocolate 
& Passionfruit Star.
We know our customers want great value 
every time they shop with us. So we reduced 
the number of promotions we ran and 
focused on delivering competitive prices 
every day alongside simpliﬁ ed promotions. 
We upgraded our popular Dine In off er and 
our Indian Takeaway meal deals, and saw 
sales increases of 7% and 10%, respectively. 
A basket of our opening price point 
Simply products, excluding milk for 
which we pay a premium to our farmers, 
is competitor price-matched to ensure 
we are off ering customers great value on 
everyday essentials.
At Christmas, we improved service for our 
customers with a new Christmas Food to 
Order site and a better in-store collection 
experience – customer satisfaction 
increased by 20%. We hosted Taste of 
Christmas events in 600 stores, off ering 
our customers inspiration and the chance 
to try special and new products to help 
them plan their Christmas dining. 
R
 Customers are increasingly concerned 
about the origin of their food, so maintaining 
the integrity of our food supply chain is 
essential to our success. At M&S we pride 
ourselves on our strong relationships with 
suppliers, from those with large factories 
to smaller craft producers. Our Farm Animal 
Health & Welfare Policy sets out the high 
standards we expect of our suppliers, and 
we have a dedicated team of agriculture 
and ﬁ sheries specialists responsible for 
implementing our agriculture policies 
across our supply base. Our business is 
founded on a long-standing mutual 
trust between us, our suppliers and our 
customers. So if a trusted supplier makes 
a mistake, we believe it is right to stick with 
them, help them to rectify the issues and, 
in turn, make them a more robust business. 
We know our strategy in Food is the right 
one. We will continue to make every food 
moment special with our diff erentiation, 
newness and quality. 
CLOTHING & HOME 
Our priority in Clothing & Home is to recover 
and grow sales. We have focused on 
improving quality, lowering prices and 
streamlining our ranges. Our performance 
is on an improving trajectory as a result.
Sales over the year fell by 2.8% to £3.8bn as 
we reduced our reliance on discounting. 
We grew market share in Lingerie and 
Kidswear, and stabilised our share in 
Menswear. We removed a greater proportion 
of promotions from Womenswear which 
aff ected market share. As we continue our 
journey of improvement, one overarching 
aim underpins everything we do: to get it 
right. Right product. Right price. Right ﬁ t. 
Right availability. Delivered with great 
service. We believe we are on a solid path 
to sustainable growth.

We reduced the number of promotions 
and lowered prices to focus on full-price 
clothing sales. As result full-price sales were 
up 2.7%. We have lowered over 2,400 prices 
since January 201 6, particularly on opening  24

OUR PERFORMANCE CONTINUED
price points, so we are now off ering our 
customers better value every day. We ran 
89 fewer promotions and reduced the 
number of sales in the year from nine to six. 
In 201 7 , we will reduce this further to four. 
At the same time, we increased the number 
of tailored promotions for Sparks members 
so that we continue to reward our loyal 
customers. By removing the noise of 
constant promotional activity and by 
cutting prices, we delivered more consistent 
value and restored our price integrity 
and customers noticed the diff erence. 
For example, when we lowered the price 
of jeggings from £1 9.50 to £1 5, sales rose 
by 35% year-on-year. This resulted in an 
improvement in full-price sales.
We are working hard to improve the style 
and design of our products. In Womenswear, 
this means creating beautiful, high quality 
wardrobe essentials, the area for which M&S 
is famous, in one master colour palette. 
We know ﬁ t is one of the most important 
measures of quality for our customers, 
so we reviewed and updated our block 
patterns to ensure that everything from 
exactly where we put darts to the 
measurements on a neckline means we 
are off ering a consistent, good ﬁ t. In Men’s 
formalwear, we reduced the number of ﬁ ts 
from six to four while increasing the range of 
styles, colours and sizes. This gave clarity to 
shoppers and customer feedback measures 
on quality, ﬁ t and style were all up on the 
previous year. 
Some of our customers told us that M&S 
had become too diffi  cult to shop in, with 
too much product duplication leading to 
confusion about the sub-brands. So we 
are streamlining our ranges by cutting the 
number of sub-brands we sell; Indigo in 
Womenswear and Collezione and North 
Coast in Menswear are being phased out. 
We also trimmed the number of clothing 
lines we off er by 1 2%. At the same time, we 
have increased the depth of our buys and 
improved availability across all Clothing & 
Home departments. The result was more 
consistent ranges with better size and 
colour availability.
It is now a year since we changed the 
structure of our Womenswear team to 
focus on product categories rather than 
brands. We have also simpliﬁ ed how we work 
in Menswear, with an even greater focus on 
product categories that reﬂ ects how our 
male customers shop. Some 68% of our 
products are now designed in-house and 
our simpliﬁ ed structure means our buying 
teams across Clothing & Home can work 
in a more collaborative way. Not only does 
this remove duplication and allow greater 
coordination in our pricing architecture, but 
it leads to effi  ciencies in our supply base. We 
can focus on working with our best suppliers 
and buy bigger volumes and better quality 
fabrics through fewer factories.

 Our improved margin performance is 
a result of better sourcing and less reliance 
on promotions. Whilst there is a risk that 
rising sourcing costs will impact margin 
OVERSEAS GROWTH
In April we opened our new ﬂ agship store 
in Doha with our largest franchise partner, 
Al-Futtaim. The 46,000 sq ft store in the 
Doha Festival City Mall sells fresh food for 
the ﬁ rst time in Qatar. It also features our 
largest international Lingerie department, 
an in-store bakery and a table-waited M&S 
Café, which serves British classics like ﬁ sh 
and chips and afternoon tea. The store is 
the 28th M&S store in the Gulf and the 
third in the city.
growth, our effi  cient buying operation and 
strong focus on costs will help mitigate this.
We increased our focus on product 
categories for which we are best known, such 
as Lingerie, Schoolwear, Bedding and Bath, 
which resulted in market share growth in 
all these categories. We know where our 
strengths lie and these categories provide 
opportunities for growth. From our 
credibility in Food, we will grow our Cooking 
& Dining departments. We will capitalise on 
our number one market share position in 
Schoolwear to grow our school shoes market 
share. We also have a great opportunity in 
Beauty – we sold 21 0,000 of our innovative 
Beauty Advent Calendar in just two weeks, 
highlighting the success of off ering 
something diff erent to our customers. 
Customers are responding positively to 
these changes. As we move through 
recovery to growth, we will continue to 
listen to our customers and to focus on 
contemporary style and wardrobe essentials 
with better products, prices and availability.
INTERNATIONAL
This year we announced changes to our 
International operations that will build a 
more sustainable, proﬁ table and customer-
focused International business for M&S.
International revenues were broadly ﬂ at at 
-0. 1 % at constant currency (up 10.7% on 
a reported basis) while adjusted proﬁ ts grew 
1 5.4% to £64.4m. However, performance 
varied across diff erent parts of the business. 
While our franchise business made a proﬁ t 
of £8 1.9m, our owned business was loss-
making in a number of markets. In our 
franchise business, revenues from 
shipments to our partners declined by 3%, 
due to lower shipments to the Middle East 
as a result of the weak retail market in 
the region, although there was better 
momentum in the second half of the 
year. Shipments to our European partners 
increased, driven by new Food store 
openings in France, while shipments to Asia 
also beneﬁ tted from the expansion of our 
Food business and new store openings.
As we announced in November, our new 
strategy will put our International business 
on a more sustainable footing by focusing 
on our partnership models. International 
opportunities for growth remain in markets 
where M&S’s unique off er resonates with 
customers. The action we are taking will 
make us more customer- and partner-
focused, driving sustainable proﬁ t growth 
overseas in a capital-light way.
Our decision to exit owned stores in ten 
markets will result in the closure of 53 stores, 
the last of which is expected to shut this 
autumn. The aff ected businesses were loss-
making and in markets where there is limited 
opportunity for growth. These closures 
resulted in charges of £1 30.5m, which 
signiﬁ cantly impacted proﬁ ts this year. 
We also simpliﬁ ed our overseas 
multichannel strategy, closing websites 
in very small markets and shifting more 
focus on leveraging our M&S.com platform 
and e-commerce distribution centre to 
fulﬁ l international orders. 
We’ve simpliﬁ ed our International business 
and remain committed to our international 
ambitions. We still sell our products from 
Dublin to Dubai and from Sydney to San 
Francisco. After the reorganisation, we will 
trade in 50 markets with over 400 stores and 
an online presence in 25 markets. We are just 
as focused on our customers internationally 
as we are in the UK – international customer 
satisfaction levels have risen signiﬁ cantly 
year-on-year. The changes will allow us to 
play to our strengths in markets where 
we have strong brand awareness, an 
established store estate and a loyal 
customer base. Going forward, we will 
continue to expand with our trusted 
franchise partners, enabling us to leverage 
their scale, infrastructure and local 
expertise. We will focus on our successful 
joint ventures in India, where like-for-like 
clothing sales grew 9%, and Greece, where 
sales were up 3% on a constant currency 
basis. We also remain committed to our 
established owned business in the Republic 
of Ireland, which this year was aff ected by 
our strategy to reduce promotions and 
discounting. We will expand our popular 
franchised Food business in France. 
In addition, we will continue to reach 
customers through fully localised owned 
and operated websites, via established 
marketplaces such as Myntra in India 
and Zalando in Europe and with our 
franchise partners. 
REACHING OUR CUSTOMERS
In November we outlined plans to reshape 
our UK store estate to ensure it remains 
relevant and convenient for our customers. 
The changing shape of retail and the growth 
in online has inevitably had an impact on our 
space requirements. This year alone, online 
sales rose by 5.6% on a reported basis to 
£836.3m (up 4.9% at constant currency). 
We will reduce our Clothing & Home space 
by around 1 0% over the next ﬁ ve years while  25

LISTENING TO OUR CUSTOMERS
Our Easy Dressing School Uniform, 
created with customer insight and help 
from the National Autistic Society, makes 
dressing for school easier, quicker and 
more comfortable for both parents and 
children. Popular items include the Boy’s 
trousers, which are a ‘pull up’ style, so no 
ﬁ ddly zips or buttons, with the care label 
inside the side pocket for comfort. After 
a customer contacted us about off ering 
clothing for children like her grandson 
who have specialist needs, we worked 
closely with her, her grandson and other 
families on adapting and extending some 
of our bodysuits and sleepwear up to 
age 7-8. The range was very well received 
and we have since introduced more 
products and extended it up to age 1 6.

stores in better locations and through M&S.
com. We are also improving the customer 
experience in store. As part of the 
transformation, we will improve around 25% 
of our Clothing & Home space. More space 
will be deployed to Food and to growth areas 
such as Kidswear and Home. Approximately 
30 full-line stores will close. At the same time, 
we will open 250 new Simply Food stores 
to take our Food business to even more 
customers. This will result in us having more 
stores in more convenient locations with an 
estate that reﬂ ects how our customers want 
to shop with us. 
Our commitment to putting our customers 
at the heart of everything we do has been 
brought to life this year through our Making 
Every Moment Special initiative. It’s about 
knowing our customers and listening to 
what they want. The results have seen 
customer service satisfaction ratings 
improve, and our people are energised – 
Making Every Moment Special has evolved 
into a movement within M&S. We also made 
changes in store that further enabled our 
colleagues to spend more time with our 
customers. We put over 3,000 extra 
employees in key areas; we removed certain 
tasks that were taking colleagues off  the 
shop ﬂ oor; we introduced hosts in some of 
our bigger stores to greet customers; and 
we introduced handheld devices to improve 
the shopping experience. This technology 
gives our store colleagues access to a 
wealth of information that enables them to 
spend more time helping customers, from 
up-to-date stock information to letting 
them assist with activating Sparks off ers.
We also made our stores easier to shop in. 
Following customer feedback, we reduced 
co-ordinated displays and the space given 
to sub-brands. Meanwhile we increased 
space for destination areas, such as Coats 
and Knitwear, and put these to the front 
of the store. We reviewed our ranging to 
ensure better availability and more choice. 
Customers rightly want a similar experience 
of M&S however they shop with us and this 
new approach means the shopping journey 
in store is more aligned to that on M&S.com.
Our drive to improve availability was as 
relevant to M&S.com as it was for our stores 
and there was a signiﬁ cant improvement 
over the year. This omnichannel approach 
means we can be responsive to how and 
where our customers are shopping and 
make best use of stock to ensure customers 
get what they want. 
We have improved the shopping experience 
across all devices over the year as we made 
them easier to use through a series of small 
upgrades and page developments. We know 
our customers like the reliable service that 
shopping on M&S.com off ers – our post-
purchase net promoter scores are at an 
all-time high. 
Online shopping often starts with a speciﬁ c 
item rather than a speciﬁ c retailer so we 
made changes to our pages to make them 
easier for search engines to read and list. 
This helps attract more online shoppers 
to M&S.com – in the two weeks leading up 
to Easter, non-paid revenue from search 
engines was up 29%. We are aligning our 
channels to give customers consistent and 
complementary experiences online and in 
store. For example, promotional activity on 
M&S.com now mirrors what happens in our 
stores. Our online tool for booking a store 
bra ﬁ tting is used by over 1,500 customers 
a day. Shop Your Way remains a crucial nexus 
between our physical and online stores. 
Two-thirds of our online transactions also 
touch a store at some point – whether 
ordering in store or picking up there. Over 
half of all Sparks visits are made via mobile, 
making it a crucial sales and communication 
channel for us. Looking ahead, we will 
focus on improving the speed of our site, 
particularly on mobile, and off ering a 
broader range of delivery options. 
ENGAGING OUR CUSTOMERS
R
 Amid ﬁ erce competition, it is vital that our 
brand remains relevant to our customers. 
Through our marketing activity this year we 
have taken a diff erent approach to engaging 
with customers. It is an approach built on 
what they have told us, rather than what we 
want to tell them. It’s designed to show that 
we understand their lifestyles and what 
matters to them. It’s aimed at reinforcing 
an emotional connection and at sparking 
conversations about M&S and fresh new 
thinking about our brand.
Our new marketing approach focuses on 
the feeling and emotion people get when 
they shop at M&S. We ﬁ rst used it in our 
award-winning Mrs Claus Christmas 
campaign, which had over 22.5m online 
views and resulted in high customer 
engagement. Where previous ads have 
centred on the things we sell, Mrs Claus – 
the tale of Santa’s wife as a skilled behind-
the-scenes operative – was our ﬁ rst ever 
non-product-led campaign. It aimed to tap 
into people’s emotional connection with 
M&S. Through our #lovemrsclaus social 
media hashtag and tie-ins with our Make 
Every Moment Special activity in store, 
Mrs Claus was a key ingredient that lifted 
our Christmas performance.
On the back of the campaign’s success, 
in May this year we introduced our new 
brand proposition. More than a tagline, 
Spend It Well is a call to action, designed 
to inspire and enable our customers to 
make every moment special by focusing 
on the experiences, people and things that 
really matter. The campaign represents a 
commitment to putting customers at the 
heart of everything we do and it is the ﬁ rst 
we have created based on deep customer 
insight. With its signiﬁ cant focus on 
customer experience on and offl  ine, it aims 
to position M&S as an enabler of a life well 
lived. This is also the ﬁ rst time we have 
united both Food and Clothing & Home 
under a single brand philosophy. Spend It 
Well will sit across all digital channels, stores, 
marketing communications and Sparks, 
giving our customers a clear and consistent 
view of M&S. 
Our Sparks membership club is pivotal 
when it comes to giving customers what 
they want and rewarding their loyalty. Nearly 
1.6m members joined this year, taking total 
membership to 5.6m. Sparks analytics 
have given us access to a wealth of insights 
that enable us to be more relevant to our 
customers. We aim to create a personal 
relationship with them, allowing us to tailor 
our off ers and experiences. By doing this 
we have shown that we can encourage 
people to shop more frequently in diff erent 
categories and via diff erent channels, 
and devices, thereby creating shareholder 
value. We are working on making Sparks 
even better. Over the next year we will 
increase levels of personalisation, make the 
scheme easier to use at diff erent customer 
touchpoints, and continue to drive shopper 
behaviour in ways that are relevant to them.
A
 Since we launched Plan A in 2007 , it has 
sparked some fantastic innovations. It has 
made us challenge the way we do things 
and to think diff erently. It has also helped us 
to have a positive impact on communities. 
The new iteration of Plan A comes with a new 
ambition: to increase levels of engagement 
with our customers by addressing the issues 
we know they really care about. We have 
identiﬁ ed three new priorities around 
which all our Plan A activity will be based: 
Wellbeing, Community and Planet. 
The launch dovetailed with our Spend It 
Well campaign; after all, looking after the 
planet and living life to the full are part 
of the same philosophy.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
OUR PERFORMANCE
This year we are reporting on the 52 weeks to 1 April 201 7 compared 
with last year’s 53-week year. To provide a more meaningful 
comparison with last year, all ﬁ nancial movements in this section 
are reported relative to the 52 weeks to 26 March 201 6, unless 
otherwise noted.
During the year we set out our new strategy to put M&S on a more 
sustainable footing and establish the basis for future growth. 
Although we are conﬁ dent that these actions are the right ones to 
recover and grow M&S, they have not come without signiﬁ cant cost. 
As a result, on a 53-week reported basis Group proﬁ t before tax was 
down 63.9% to £1 76.4m (last year £488.8m) and proﬁ t before tax and 
adjusted items was £6 1 3.8m, down 1 1.0% (last year £689.6m). 
OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE
In Food, we continued to outperform a challenging grocery market, 
with revenue up 4.2% to £5.6bn (last year £5.4bn). Driving growth 
through our store opening programme, we opened 30 new owned 
and 38 new franchise Food stores and increased market share by 
20bps to 4.5%. Food gross margin was down 25bps year-on-year due 
to input price pressure as a result of the fall in sterling, and higher 
than anticipated waste. 
Clothing & Home revenue was down 2.8% at £3.8bn (last year £4.0bn), 
as sales were aff ected by our strategy to reduce our reliance on 
promotions and sale activity. However, we are encouraged by the 
increase in full-price sales, which were up 2.7%, and market share 
stabilisation and we are conﬁ dent that we are taking the right action 
for the long-term success of our clothing business. Clothing & 
Home gross margin increased by 105bps to 56.1 % as a result of lower 
discounting and buying margin gains as we continue to leverage 
our direct sourcing capabilities and scale. These factors more than 
off set the signiﬁ cant headwind as a result of the decline in value 
of sterling, which had a signiﬁ cant impact on our cost of goods.
UK operating costs were £3,390m (last year £3,266m), up 3.8%, 
with the primary drivers being the costs associated with investment 
in new space and IT, as we continue to upgrade our systems and 
infrastructure to support future growth.
International operating proﬁ t before adjusted items was £64.4m, 
up 1 5.4% (last year £55.8m). This improvement was due to a 
signiﬁ cant reduction in losses in owned markets; of this, £7m is 
a result of the provision for certain onerous leases taken as an 
adjusted item following our decision to exit owned stores in ten 
countries. Proﬁ ts from our franchise markets were slightly down 
due to lower shipments to our franchise partners in the Middle East 
in the ﬁ rst half of the year. 
Group proﬁ t before tax was down to £1 76.4m (last year £488.8m on a 
53-week basis) as a result of the signiﬁ cant charges associated with 
the implementation of our revised strategy. This included £1 32.5m 
for International store closures and impairments and £1 56.0m 
relating to the closure of our UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme 
and changes to pay and premiums. We also continued to incur 
charges in relation to a provision by M&S Bank for insurance mis-
selling which this year were £44.1 m (last year £50.3m). Of the £437 .4m 
of adjusting items, £80.9m were cash in the year. 
 Further details are on p28 and in note 5 on p103-104. 
Cash generation in the business remains strong with free cash ﬂ ow 
before shareholder returns of £585.4m (last year £539.3m on a 
53-week basis). During the year, we further strengthened our capital 
management disciplines. Capital investment was signiﬁ cantly down 
as we have completed some of our larger infrastructure projects 
and opened fewer full-line stores than last year. Net debt reduced 
by £203.6m during the year to £1.9bn.
We issued a new £300m bond in December, in advance of a $500m 
bond expiry in December 201 7 . We remain committed to a strong 
balance sheet and maintaining an investment grade credit rating. 
Our credit rating is BBB minus. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING 
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS 
Following several years of investment, we now have the 
infrastructure needed for sustainable growth. However, some 
of these investments have not generated the returns we had 
hoped for and some have cost more than they should. We are 
also operating in a marketplace undergoing signiﬁ cant changes. 
While we remain committed to investing in the growth of M&S, 
we need to do this within a tighter investment framework. Under 
this approach, we are already placing a greater emphasis on cash 
payback when assessing investments to help improve the reliability 
of returns. We also plan to reduce the average length of our leases, 
giving us greater ﬂ exibility, and to ensure we have a better mix 
between growth and ‘business as usual’ investments. We believe 
this approach will enable us to prioritise key investments while 
improving returns to our shareholders. 
We recognise the importance of regular dividends and we are 
committed to delivering sustainable shareholder returns. During 
the year we returned £377 .5m to shareholders, which included 
£7 4.5m in the form of a special dividend. Notwithstanding the 
decline in proﬁ ts but after considering the strong cash generation 
characteristics of the Group, the Board decided to maintain the 
full year dividend at 1 8.7p (last year 1 8.7p). 
We believe our strategy to recover and 
grow M&S, alongside our strengthened approach 
to capital management, will deliver proﬁ table, 
sustainable growth for our shareholders.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE
During the ﬁ rst half, we declared a special dividend of 4.6p per 
share. However, given the potential cash costs associated with 
our strategic changes and uncertain market conditions, the Board 
took the prudent decision not to make an additional return of 
cash to shareholders under our enhanced shareholder returns 
programme in the second half.
Despite the fall in proﬁ t, we believe we have the right strategy in 
place to recover and grow M&S and this, alongside our strengthened 
approach to capital management, will deliver proﬁ table, sustainable 
growth for our shareholders.

Group revenues were up 2.2% (up 1 . 1 % on a constant currency basis ). 
UK revenues were up 1 .3% in total with a like-for -like decrease. 
International revenues were up 1 0.7% (-0. 1 % on a constant 
currency basis ).
GROSS MARGIN
UK gross margin was 42.0%. Clothing & Home gross margin was 
ahead of expectations, up c.105bps year-on-year. Buying margin 
increased by 100bps despite currency headwinds as we continued 
to deliver beneﬁ ts from leveraging our direct sourcing capabilities 
through retendering orders, and by moving business to lower-duty 
locations. Reduced discounting beneﬁ ted margin by c.5bps on 
the year with an 1 10bps improvement in the second half, as a result 
of lower stock into sale and better sell through rates.
Food gross margin declined -25bps year-on-year, which was more 
than expected. We generated gains from our ongoing value 
optimisation programme of 70bps. However, these were more 
than off set by an increase in input costs of 80bps, following the 
depreciation of sterling and higher than expected waste.

UK organisation structure
UK operating costs were up by £1 24m (3.8%), with higher 
depreciation accounting for £26m.
Store staff  costs increased by £36m primarily driven by new space 
with the cost of the annual pay review and investments in improved 
store service largely off set by business effi  ciencies. 
Within other store costs, new space drove the increase, with 
occupancy cost inﬂ ation largely off set by effi  ciencies and 
lower depreciation.
Distribution and warehousing costs increased by £44m. A signiﬁ cant 
proportion of this increase was driven by increased capacity to 
support growth in our business, with a new Food depot in Enﬁ eld 
and Clothing & Home warehouse in Bradford. The balance was 
largely attributable to increased food volumes and inﬂ ation.
Marketing costs declined by £23m. This was mostly a result of a 
reduction in activity and the more eff ective use of our marketing 
budget, such as our Christmas campaign where we increased 
customer views while reducing costs, as well as the annualisation 
of the launch of Sparks last year.
Central costs increased by £4 1 m. This was largely driven by an 
increase in IT related operating costs including higher depreciation 
from new merchandising systems. A greater proportion of costs 
are now being expensed as we transition to increased use of cloud 
based software services. As expected, around half of the anticipated 
c.£30m cost savings from our Head Offi  ce restructuring were 
delivered during the year.

During the year, International revenues rose by 1 0.7% driven by 
currency translation, with constant currency sales down 0. 1 %. 
Proﬁ t before adjusted items increased by 1 5.4% to £64.4m.
In our franchise business, shipments to Asia beneﬁ ted from new 
store openings and expansion of our Food business. We saw a good 
performance from Europe, where shipments increased, driven by new 
Food store openings in France. Revenues from the Middle East were 
aff ected by de-stocking and weak retail markets, although the trend 
improved in the second half of the year, with a similar trend in proﬁ ts.
In our retained owned business, constant currency revenues 
increased by 2%. Our joint venture business in India performed well, 
with seven new store openings during the year . Sales in the Republic 
of Ireland and in Hong Kong were aff ected by our strategy to 
reduce discounting. Proﬁ t in retained owned markets improved. 
Lower operating proﬁ ts in Hong Kong were off set by an improved 
performance in the Czech Republic and India. 
International restructuring costs include £7m of lease costs relating 
to stores either closed, or in the process of closing. This contributed to 
the reduction of losses in exit markets. The remaining store closures 
will be largely complete by the end of the ﬁ rst half and we now expect 
to reduce the losses in exit markets by between £20 and £25m in the 
current year . T otal closure costs related to the International strategy 
are expected to be at the lower end of the previously indicated range 
at c.£ 1 50m. The cash costs associated are expected to be c.£ 1 35m, 
with the vast majority incurred in 20 1 7 /1 8.

Group adjusted operating proﬁ t was £6 1 3.8m (last year £684. 1 m).

Group proﬁ t before tax and adjusted items was £6 1 3.8m, down 
1 0.3% on last year (down 1 1 .0% on a 53-week basis ). The decrease 
was primarily due to the reduction in Clothing & Home gross proﬁ t

M&S Bank proﬁ ts were down £9.7m as a result of the reduction in 
interchange fees, and lower interest bearing balances.

During the period, the Group announced changes to our pay and 
pensions arrangements within the UK business. We closed our UK 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme to future accrual eff ective from 
1 April 20 1 7 resulting in a one-off  charge of £ 1 27 .0m. In respect of pay, 
we announced an increase in our base level of pay to £8.50 per hour 
as well as the removal of a number of premium payments. The Group 
has recognised a charge of £23.6m in the year in relation to this. 
The Group anticipates making transition payments to employees 
in relation to the closure of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme, of c. £25m 
(in aggregate) over the next three years. These amounts will be 
recognised within adjusted items as they are incurred.
During the period, following completion of a detailed review of the 
UK organisation, the Group announced proposed changes to its UK 
Head Offi  ce structure. The changes have resulted in a net reduction 
of c.590 Head Offi  ce roles, with restructuring costs in the year of 
£ 1 5.4m inclusive of fees. The Group also announced an 1 8-month 
programme to centralise its London Head Offi  ce functions into one 
building. The Group has recognised a net charge of £8.6m associated 
with this rationalisation. 
In November, the Group announced a strategic programme in 
relation to the UK store estate. As part of this programme, during 
the year ten UK stores were approved for closure resulting in 
closure costs of £47 .3m relating to dilapidations, sub-let shortfalls, 
accelerated depreciation of ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings and impairment 
of assets. The balance of the charges of £4.3m in the period related 
to the ongoing review of assumptions associated with previously 
closed stores. We continue to expect total adjusted items related 
to this programme of c.£350m.
The Group has announced its intention to close its owned stores in 
ten international markets resulting in the recognition of a cost of 
£1 30.5m in the period. The expected closure costs primarily relate 
to redundancy, lease exit and property dilapidations. The closure 
programmes are ongoing in all markets, with the exception of 
China where the ﬁ nal store was closed on 1 April 201 7 . International 
store impairment testing during the year identiﬁ ed a number of 
stores where current and anticipated future performance does not 
support the carrying value of the stores with a resulting impairment 
charge of £9.0m being incurred. Off setting these store impairments 
are credits of £7 .0m relating to the reversal of historic impairments 
against ﬁ ve stores in Ireland and the release of unutilised provisions 
on completion of the exit from the Balkans.
UK store impairment testing during the year has identiﬁ ed a number 
of stores where the current and anticipated future performance 
does not support the carrying value of the stores. As a result, 
a charge of £39.4m has been incurred in respect of the impairment 
of assets associated with these stores. A further charge of £9.4m has 
been incurred in respect of onerous lease provisions associated with 
some of these stores.
The Group continues to incur charges in relation to M&S Bank 
insurance mis-selling provision. The Group’s income from M&S 
Bank has been reduced as a result of a further £44.1 m of charges 
in the year. 
A net credit of £9.8m has been recognised in the year in relation 
to an updated view of the estimated closure costs of legacy 
logistics sites associated with the strategic transition to a single 
tier distribution network.
During the year the Group has reached various legal settlements 
resulting in a net credit of £9.8m.
The cash ﬂ ow impact of adjusted items was £80.9m in the year.
GROUP PROFIT BEFORE TAX 
Group proﬁ t before tax was £1 76.4m, down from £483.3m last year 
(£488.8m on a 53 week basis). The decrease was largely due to the 
impact of the strategic programmes in the year including the 
curtailment costs associated with the closure to future accrual of 
the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme, costs associated with the 
closure of our owned stores in ten International markets and the 
UK store estate. 
TAXATION
The eff ective tax rate on proﬁ t before tax and adjusted items was 
1 9.9% (last year 1 7 .2%). The eff ective tax rate was 34.4% (last year 
1 7 .3%) due to the impact of disallowable adjusted items. The 20 1 7 /1 8 
eff ective tax rate on adjusted proﬁ t before tax is expected to be 
around 2 1 % as a result of the Scottish Limited Partnership structure. 29

UK store environment spend included investment in increasing the

and rebranding our Food halls. Spend was down year-on-year due 
to completion of a number of in-store schemes last year, primarily 
in Lingerie and Kidswear. 
New UK store spend was down as a result of fewer new full-line 
stores opening. During the year, we opened 30 owned Simply Food, 
three full-line stores and two relocations compared to 25 owned 
Simply Food, ﬁ ve full-line stores and two relocations in the previous 
year. Clothing & Home space increased by 0.9%.
International spend was signiﬁ cantly lower as a result of the decision 
to exit stores in 10 markets. Spend in the year was largely focused 
on new stores in India and refurbishment projects in Hong Kong. 
We continue to invest in improving our supply chain and IT 
infrastructure although the total spend has reduced as we have 
completed some of our larger infrastructure projects. During the 
year, we opened a new Food depot in Enﬁ eld as well as investing 
in our warehouse in Bradford. Within M&S.com the reduction in 
capital expenditure reﬂ ects the move towards customer focused 
enhancements which are expensed and away from larger 
infrastructure projects.
Investment in IT comprised of upgrading our in-store wiﬁ  networks 
and investing in additional handheld devices which improve 
effi  ciency and customer service in-store. In addition, as we move 
towards more cloud based software solutions, a larger proportion 
of costs are now being expensed.
Maintenance spend has increased primarily due to investment in 
more energy effi  cient in-store equipment such as lighting.
The proceeds from property disposals mainly relate to the ﬁ nal 
instalment of deferred consideration from the sale of the White City 
warehouse.

The reduction in capital and acquisition expenditure was partially 
off set by weaker business performance, with adjusted operating 
proﬁ t down £94.3m. Working capital was broadly ﬂ at on the year 
with a reduction in Clothing & Home inventory off set by a reduction 
in creditors. Pension funding was up £1 6.9m due to an increase 
to the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t contributions rate following the 201 5 
triennial valuation. Additionally, cash payments associated with 
adjusted items were £1 7 .7m higher in the year driven by the 
International strategy.
The business delivered free cash ﬂ ow pre-shareholder returns 
of £585.4m, an increase of £46.1 m on the prior year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board is accountable for carrying out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks 
facing the Company, including those 
threatening its customers, people, values, 
reputation, business model, operations, 
safety, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. On behalf of the Board, the Audit 
Committee reviews the eff ectiveness of 
the risk management process.
Each business area is responsible for 
formally identifying and assessing its 
risks half-yearly, measuring them against 
a deﬁ ned set of criteria, and considering 
the likelihood of occurrence and potential 
impact to the Group. The Group Risk 
function facilitates a similar exercise with 
members of the Operating Committee, 
before combining these perspectives to 
create a consolidated view. In compiling this 
complete risk proﬁ le, consideration is given 
to risks that are external to our business, 
core to our day-to-day operations, related 
to business change and any other that may 
impact achievement of our future strategy.
The principal risks identiﬁ ed by this process 
form our Group Risk Proﬁ le, which is agreed 
by the Operating Committee ahead of 
ﬁ nal review and approval by the Board. 
In addition to this periodic review, key areas 
of risk are subject to regular oversight and 
challenge by the Operating Committee and, 
where appropriate, by the Board and Audit 
Committee, during the course of the year. 
The directors’ assessment of the long-term 
viability of the Company is also reviewed 
annually, mindful of the principal risks 
faced. Further detail on our approach 
to assessing long-term viability can be 
found on page 3 1.
KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
We continue to challenge and improve the 
quality of risk information generated across 
the business, while maintaining a simple 
and practical approach. Our ways of 
working with the Operating Committee 
have evolved during the year. More detailed 
discussion regarding the nature and extent 
of our principal risks has enhanced our 
understanding in the context of the 
business’s risk appetite, as well as informing 
our consideration of emerging risk areas. 
By completing periodic ‘deep dives’ on 
targeted, connected risks, we can also better 
assess the eff ectiveness of the mitigating 
activities in place and strengthen our 
approach to risk management.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The details of our principal risks and 
uncertainties and the key mitigating activities 
in place to address them can be found on 
pages 32 and 33. We disclose those we 
believe are likely to have the greatest impact 
on our business at this moment in time 
and which have consequently been the 
subject of debate at recent Board or Audit 
Committee meetings. The year 201 6/1 7 has 
been one of change and this is reﬂ ected in 
the year-on-year evolution of the principal 
risks and uncertainties. 
The Company is exposed to a wide range 
of risks in addition to those listed. These are 
monitored for any increase in likelihood 
or impact and to ensure that appropriate 
mitigations are in place. 
While our capacity to inﬂ uence external 
risks is often limited, we recognise the 
importance of operating a business model 
that has the potential to ﬂ ex and adapt 
to a changing environment. For example, 
the consequences of the UK’s decision 
to leave the European Union will directly 
impact our business in a variety of ways. 
While we have already been aff ected by the 
depreciation of sterling, other risks are not 
yet fully quantiﬁ able. Potential risks could 
include trade tariff s, higher taxation and 
limits to the free movement of people; all 
will demand a proactive response as the 
implications are better understood. We have 
created a working group to monitor the 
changing risk proﬁ le. Economic uncertainty 
and socio-political unrest also fall under 
this umbrella of external risk. 
As with any business, we face risks and uncertainties on a daily basis. 
Eff ective risk management is essential to support the achievement 
of our strategic and operational objectives.
RISK MANAGEMENT
OUR PERFORMANCE
RISK APPETITE
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
requires companies to determine their 
risk appetite in terms of the nature and 
extent of the principal risks faced and 
those they are willing to take in achieving 
strategic objectives. In addition to 
assessing whether residual risk is at an 
acceptable level in the context of overall 
risk appetite, the Board has established 
a set of risk appetite statements that 
address key risk areas and speciﬁ c 
operations. The statements articulate 
risk parameters within which the Group 
operates, supported by our policies 
and procedures. In addition to ensuring 
that our risk appetite statements remain 
relevant and evolve with the business, 
we recognise the importance of fostering 
an environment where innovation can 
thrive. Consequently, there are times 
when there may be merit in operating 
outside agreed risk parameters, 
if appropriate approvals and mitigating 
controls are in place. 31
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires 
us to issue a ‘viability statement’ declaring 
whether we believe the Company is able to 
continue to operate and meet its liabilities, 
taking into account its current position 
and principal risks. The overriding aim is to 
encourage directors to focus on the longer 
term and be more actively involved in risk 
management and internal controls. 
The Board is required to assess the 
Company’s viability over a period greater 
than 1 2 months. The increased levels of 
uncertainty within the global economic 
and political environment and the macro-
economic challenges being experienced 
within the retail sector, mean the Board 
continues to believe a three-year period 
is appropriate for business planning, 
measuring performance and remunerating 
at a senior level. Our assessment of viability 
therefore continues to align with this 
three-year outlook.
The process adopted to assess the viability 
of the Company involves collaborative 
input from a number of functions across 
the business to model severe but plausible 
scenarios in which a number of the Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties materialise 
within the period of the three-year plan. 
We have modelled scenarios which group 
together principal risks where we believe 
interdependencies exist between the risks, 
in addition to scenarios where unconnected 
risks occur simultaneously. The scenario 
with the most signiﬁ cant adverse impact 
was reviewed against the current and 
projected liquidity position to conclude on 
the Company’s viability. The assessment 
also took account of additional potential 
mitigations available in the event of further 
downside factors, including a reduction in 
capital expenditure and reduced returns to 
shareholders. The Audit Committee reviews 
the output of the viability assessment in 
advance of ﬁ nal evaluation by the Board.
In assessing viability, the Board considered 
a number of key factors, including our 
business model see pages 1 2 and 1 3, our 
strategy see page 9, risk appetite see 
page  30 and our principal risks and 
uncertainties see pages 32 and 33. These 
have been reviewed in the context of our 
ﬁ nancial plans, speciﬁ cally the annual 
budget and three-year plan. The directors 
also satisﬁ ed themselves that they have 
the evidence necessary to support the 
statement in terms of the eff ectiveness of 
the internal control environment in place to 
mitigate risk. 
In making the statement, the directors 
have applied the following assumptions 
in preparing the scenarios:
> Bonds maturing during the assessment 
period will be repaid through our 
existing bank facilities.
> The actions included in our plan to grow 
sales are not fully realised or are off set 
by lower than expected market growth.
> The actions included in our plans to 
mitigate input cost increases that 
we expect are not delivered in full or 
the input cost increases are greater 
than expected.
> The UK government’s notiﬁ cation of its 
intention to exit the European Union will 
have adverse ﬁ nancial impacts, including 
input cost inﬂ ation from increased tariff s 
and a further weakening in sterling, as 
well as reduced UK consumer spending.
The Board’s assessment is that M&S is a 
viable business. The viability statement 
can be found on page 83.
OUR APPROACH TO ASSESSING LONG-TERM VIABILITY
RISK INTERDEPENDENCY
We recognise that there is signiﬁ cant 
interdependency between our key risks. 
This diagram, based on an extract from 
our current Group Risk Proﬁ le, highlights 
how changes to one risk might impact 
those connected to it. By understanding 
the relationship between our key risks, 
we are better placed to ensure we are 
managing them appropriately and to 
understand our broader risk exposure. 
This is especially important when assessing 
the Company’s long-term viability.
The following is an illustrative 
example of a potential scenario:
In order to drive long-term Proﬁ table 
Growth, we need to ensure that we 
proactively manage a number of our 
principal risks and uncertainties. We must 
off er and deliver a Customer Proposition 
& Experience that is competitive and 
reliable across all channels, keeping pace 
with changing consumer behaviours 
and enabling us to leverage growth 
opportunities as they arise. In addition, 
our Brand needs to evolve with consumer 
lifestyles and attitudes, ensuring that it 
resonates with customers and remains 
relevant as they move from one life stage 
to the next. To be able to realise growth 
opportunities, we need to identify, keep 
pace with and embrace developments in 
Technology. This will enable us to both 
meet and exceed customer expectations, 
while ensuring that our business remains 
innovative, resilient and ﬂ exible. All of these 
aims are ultimately underpinned by the 
strength of our people. Through eff ective 
management of Talent & Succession, 
we can ensure our people are best set up 
for success to deliver business objectives 
as they evolve.

Nr New risk  Evolved from prior year  No material change to risk
Our Group Risk Proﬁ le evolves as changes in circumstances elevate risk, mitigating activities reduce net risk over time, or as new risks emerge. 
As a result of our new strategy, our business has undergone considerable change during the year , aff ecting our people and operations. This has 
signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced the risks reﬂ ected in the Group Risk Proﬁ le, which forms the basis of the principal risks and uncertainties disclosed below.
RISK DESCRIPTION CURRENT CONTEXT MITIGATING ACTIVITIES

CLOTHING & HOME RECOVERY
Our future performance will be impacted 
if we fail to meet customer expectations. 
As we continue to reassert our Clothing & Home 
credentials, we are focused on ensuring that 
product relevance, pricing and quality meet 
customer expectations. Meeting our customers’ 
needs in all respects is key to driving improved 
performance in an increasingly competitive market.
Early signs of improved 
performance are being seen 
in Clothing & Home following 
ongoing eff orts to strengthen 
product style and quality. 
Irrespective of this, there is 
no room for complacency and 
achieving recovery and further 
growth of our Clothing & Home 
business remains a key priority. 
> Clothing & Home strategy and supporting workstreams

FOOD SAFETY AND INTEGRITY
A food safety or integrity related incident 
occurs or is not eff ectively managed. Our brand 
is based on trust and our customers have high 
expectations of both the quality and integrity of 
our food. It is of paramount importance that we 
eff ectively manage safety and integrity, especially 
as we continue to grow our global food business.
While we set our own exacting 
standards, the external 
pressures facing the food 
industry are continually 
evolving. Fraudulent supply 
chain behaviour, supplier cost 
pressures, innovation demands 
and stringent regulatory 
requirements are just some 
of the contributors to this risk. 
> Dedicated Food Technology team responsible for ensuring 
products are safe for consumption through rigorous 
controls and processes.
> Long-established store, supplier and depot auditing 
programme in place.
> Visible response to emerging customer concerns.
> Proactive horizon scanning for future issues, including focus 
on fraud and adulteration. 
> Crisis management plan in place.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Our reputation as a sustainable retailer relies 
on our ability to meet our social responsibility 
agenda and stakeholder expectations. Our 
sustainability credentials have historically been 
a key diff erentiator in the retail market. As our 
peers place greater focus on this and the 
regulatory environment continues to develop, 
it is essential that we continue to evolve our 
aims, maintain strong ethical standards and 
meet stakeholder expectations. 
Our business values and 
practices are being inﬂ uenced 
by a broader range of factors 
than ever before, including 
modern slavery and human 
rights. It is essential that our 
commitment to our ethical 
standards remains at the 
forefront of our behaviours, 
especially during a period 
of signiﬁ cant change. 
> Continued commitment to and development of Plan A 
objectives to allow risks to be identiﬁ ed, mitigated 
and monitored.
> Overarching governance of processes through Plan A leadership.
> Mature supplier ethical auditing programme, including 
independent third party auditors, across our Clothing & Home 
and Food businesses.
> Policy on supplier selection processes.
> Business-wide human rights policy and ownership.
> Updated Global Sourcing Principles to incorporate 
requirements of Modern Slavery Act.

INFORMATION SECURITY (INCLUDING CYBER)
We experience a major information security 
breach. Our business, and society, continues 
to be subject to external threats to security – 
including external hackers and viruses, physical 
security attacks or sensitive data being lost or 
accessed without authorisation.
Experiences across the 
corporate landscape have 
continued to highlight the real 
threat of cyber and physical 
attacks. The external threat 
proﬁ le is ever changing, 
becoming more sophisticated 
and more unpredictable. 
In addition, regulatory 
responsibilities in relation to 
data protection are becoming 
increasingly stringent, including 
the implementation of the 
General Data Protection 
Regulation from 2018. 
> Established security controls, including policies, procedures 
and use of security technologies.

TECHNOLOGY
To support future proﬁ table growth, we need 
to keep pace and develop our technology 
capability. Our business needs to identify, keep pace 
with and embrace developments in technology. 
This will encompass a range of technology demands 
driven by the needs of our customers, deployment 
of tools that promote eff ective and ﬂ exible working 
and maintaining an overarching IT infrastructure 
that enables resilient business delivery.
The ever-increasing importance 
of technology in meeting 
customer needs, successfully 
growing our business and 
supporting our people means 
this remains an area of change 
and focus.
> Digital lab in place developing new technology-
enabled solutions.
> Proactive simpliﬁ cation of IT infrastructure through clearly

MARGIN
Sourcing or cost pressures impact our margin 
performance. While our business continues to 
face challenging foreign currency headwinds, 
other factors place signiﬁ cant pressure on margin 
performance. These include the availability of raw 
materials and pricing strategies in the context of 
the overall retail market. 
Ongoing sourcing and 
cost pressures are placing 
increasing focus on our margin 
performance and the need 
to further evolve our sourcing 
strategies and ways of working 
in response to this.

Our brand needs to evolve with consumer 
lifestyles and attitudes for us to successfully 
attract and retain customers. We need to ensure 
that we recruit, engage and retain customers 
through the ongoing relevance of the M&S brand. 
To drive future performance 
and leverage opportunities, 
our brand needs to stay relevant

We fail to maintain and develop a UK store 
estate that is relevant to future customer 
preferences and supports business performance. 
As consumer behaviours continue to evolve, 
our physical store estate planning must align 
to our business strategy, providing better range 
authority in more convenient locations, while

DIRECTORS' REPORT
As I highlighted earlier in this report, this has 
been a year of considerable change for the 
Company. With the appointment of Steve 
Rowe as CEO, the Board undertook a 
comprehensive review of all aspects of 
the business to ensure clarity around our 
customers and our brand positioning, our 
strategy and business model, our people, 
our store portfolio, our offi  ces and our assets.
This review, and the Board debate 
throughout the year, resulted in a number 
of signiﬁ cant decisions for the business. The 
Board was acutely aware that these would 
aff ect a broad range of our stakeholders. 
While we sought to ensure that our decisions 
were taken in a way that was fair and 
consistent with our values, we recognised 
the importance of balancing these with the 
need to support the long-term future of the 
business. The Board recognised that the 
consequences of its decisions would lead 
to signiﬁ cant adjustments to the business 
and to our ﬁ nancial position this year, but 
we believe that these were essential to 
re-establish the foundations of the business 
to deliver sustainable performance and 
build an organisation that is ﬁ t and relevant 
for the longer term. The Board and Audit 
Committee’s debate and associated 
judgements are covered on pages 40-4 1 
and 48-5 1 of this report.
BOARD ACTIVITIES AND 
CONSIDERATION OF ALL 
STAKEHOLDERS
The tenets of Lord Sieff ’s words about the 
importance of considering a company’s 
responsibilities to a broad stakeholder 
group, which I quoted earlier in the report 
and which pre-date by decades the s.1 72 
directors' duties of the Companies Act 2006, 
have long been core to the M&S culture, 
values and decision-making. 
These were particularly evident in our 
deliberations around the introduction of an 
M&S living wage and the ambition to deliver 
fairer pay for our store colleagues in a way 
that was true and relevant to M&S. This led 
us to go beyond the National Living Wage 
and establish ourselves as one of the best 
employers in the market. We had signiﬁ cant 
debate around the closure of the long-
standing deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme, 
but recognised that this was critical to 
ensure a fairer reward framework for 
all our colleagues. 
We spent a lot of time considering the 
consequences of the closures within our 
international businesses to ensure we could 
establish a structure and format which 
would be stronger and more relevant for 
our customers and markets, and a more 
proﬁ table business with foundations for 
growth. We also reviewed the conﬁ guration 
of our UK store estate to ensure we could 
establish a footprint to meet future 
customer needs. We debated the necessary 
changes and restructuring within our offi  ces 
to support our future plans. In each such 
discussion, the Board carefully considered 
the impact of its decision on our teams, our 
customers, the communities in which we 
trade, our shareholders, our supply base 
and our Plan A aspirations. 
EMPLOYEE AND RETAIL 
SHAREHOLDER VOICE
We are pleased to have established regular 
Board sessions for employee insight. The 
feedback provided during our dedicated 
Board sessions by the chairs of both the 
Business Involvement Group (‘BIG’), which 
represents the interests of all our 85,000 
colleagues across the business, and of our 
Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Pension Scheme, was 
invaluable in ensuring the Board was able 
to fully consider the views of these vital 
stakeholders through the period of change. 
We were grateful for their candid and open 
feedback, which enabled the Board to 
appreciate fully the potential impact on 
those aff ected. 
We also trialled our ﬁ rst Private Shareholder 
Panel. The objective was to give our 
private shareholders additional access 
and information, as is provided to our major 
institutional shareholders. The candour 
and insights provided by these panel 
discussions were helpful in ensuring we 
were listening to this important stakeholder 
group. The success of these trial panels 
led to the formal launch of our Private 
Shareholder Panel, which will form an active 
part of our stakeholder engagement 
programme. Details on this and our broader 
stakeholder engagement are provided on 
pages 44 to 45. This illustrates how we have 
considered, listened and engaged with all 
these stakeholders.
RISK AND CONTROLS
The progress made on our risk debate and 
understanding of risk appetite in previous 
years helped ensure the Board's decision-
making was supported by the right 
discussions and considerations. The 
enhanced level of risk debate and greater 
involvement of the Operating Committee 
was also critical in ensuring that appropriate 
monitoring and mitigations were embedded 
to support the proposals under discussion. 
The Board spent time debating the market 
environment and the potential impact 
of the vote to leave the European Union. 
It continues to assess the implications of 
Brexit for our customers, communities and 
the business, and the impact of currency 
movements on the business and our 
supply base. 
We also undertook a thorough review 
of our cyber environment to ensure that 
we have appropriate data and information 
governance processes and controls, 
ecommerce defences, proactive security 
and strong incident management 
processes across the business. While the 
Audit Committee will continue to monitor 
business processes and provide assurance 
over controls, the Board considers data 
governance and cyber to be so signiﬁ cant 
that it will review this at least twice a year.
TALENT, DEVELOPMENT 
AND SUCCESSION
In addition to the strategic debate, the 
Board and Nomination Committee also 
focused on ensuring we had the right talent 
in our business to support our plans. Senior 
succession discussions have long featured 
on the Board agenda, but we took this 
substantially further this year to include 
a comprehensive review of our people

capabilities and speciﬁ c development 
needs against the future requirements 
of our business. The Board reviewed 
assessments for over 100 of our senior 
leaders in the business and discussed their 
leadership qualities, strengths, areas for 
development, and medium and long-term 
succession plans to ensure that we 
have the right skills, career paths and 
understanding of our talent to support 
our future business growth. 
As highlighted earlier, following the 
appointment of Steve Rowe as CEO and 
the announcement of our plans to build a 
simpler and more relevant M&S, I considered 
it was the right time to deal with my own 
succession and for the business to appoint 
a new Chairman. So, in December 201 6, 
I informed the Board that I intended to 
retire as Chairman during 201 7 after six 
years in the post. 
I am grateful to Vindi Banga, our Senior 
Independent Director, for leading such 
a rigorous process for the Nomination 
Committee to appoint my successor. We are 
delighted that Archie Norman will succeed 
me in September 201 7 . Overviews of the 
recruitment process undertaken by the 
Nomination Committee and the induction 
programme being undertaken by Archie 
are provided on page 39. This programme 
is extremely comprehensive and will 
ensure that he has an extensive insight 
into our business, our colleagues and 
stakeholders prior to taking up his 
appointment as Chairman.
When I joined M&S as Chairman I made it 
clear that I regarded eff ective succession 
planning as a vital responsibility for both 
me and the Board. I am delighted that with 
Steve and Archie's appointments this aspect 
has been successfully achieved in a rigorous 
way. I know that succession planning and the 
development of talent at M&S will remain 
very high priorities of the Board. 
BOARD OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING
The Audit Committee played a key role 
in ensuring that there was appropriate 
challenge and governance around the 
accounting treatment of the decisions 
taken in the year and ensuring robust risk 
management, controls and assurance 
processes were in place. The Committee 
continues to closely monitor the 
management of our cyber and data 
governance processes, health and safety 
and business continuity plans for our 
UK and international operations. The 
Committee’s activities, considerations 
and judgements are set out on 
pages 48 to 50.
Fairness and pay has featured strongly in 
the Board’s debate this year. To support 
leadership and talent within our business, 
the Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
our remuneration framework, measures and 
targets. This review was particularly topical 
given the Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy (BEIS) Green Paper on corporate 
governance reform earlier in the year. The 
Committee held a number of discussions 
with shareholders on framework design 
during the year. It also reviewed and 
updated the Remuneration Policy to ensure 
it remains both in line with best practice 
and relevant to our business. It will be put 
forward for formal shareholder approval 
at the AGM in July 201 7 . The Committee’s 
activities and its considerations on 
remuneration, along with our Remuneration 
Policy, are outlined in detail on pages 54 
to 78.
In line with the requirements of the 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
was independently evaluated during the 
year. We were pleased that, overall, the 
Board has made signiﬁ cant progress since 
the last external review in 201 5, especially in 
relation to the quality of Board debate and 
decision-making, Board papers and process. 
The ﬁ ndings of the review and the action 
plans for the year ahead are set out on 
page 42 of this report.
We have had to take some bold and tough 
decisions to ensure M&S is set up for the 
future. The Board made these changes as 
they are the right and relevant thing to do. 
From a strong core set of well-established 
timeless values, we have sought to ensure 
fairness, integrity and rigour with each 
decision for all our stakeholders. We 
recognise that the business has had to 
deliver a signiﬁ cant scale of change 
this year, but the feedback from our 
stakeholders and the early progress we are 
seeing encourages us to continue to be 
bold, conﬁ dent, remain on the front foot, 
and embrace the challenges ahead.
ROBERT SWANNELL CHAIRMAN
Over the next few pages we look at the Board, its 
role, performance and oversight. As in previous 
years, we provide detail on the Board activities 
and discussions during the year (pages 4 1 and 42), 
the actions arising from these and the progress 
made against them. We also provide insight on: 
director independence; eff ectiveness and our 
Board evaluation; succession planning; and 
induction and ongoing development. 
Governance at M&S is an important element of 
our Board environment. To support how we do 
business and how we serve our stakeholders it 
needs to be relevant, authentic and meaningful. 
In line with previous years, we have used the key 
themes of the Code to articulate the Board’s 
activities during the year:
> Leadership and eff ectiveness – pages 36 to 43 
and 46 to 47 .
> Accountability – pages 30 to 33 within the 
Strategic Report and pages 48 to 52 in the 
Directors’ Report.
> Our stakeholders: how we listen and engage – 
pages 44 to 45.
> Remuneration – pages 54 to 78.
Information on the governance of our Pension 
Scheme is provided on page 53.
The required governance and regulatory 
assurances are provided throughout this report 
reﬂ ecting their relevance to the business. We 
provide insight into how governance supports and 
protects the M&S business and our stakeholders 
in a practical way. Where information would 
previously have been located within the Directors’ 
Report, and has now been incorporated into 
the Strategic Report, a list of page references is 
available within the ‘Other Disclosures’ section 
on page 79.
Every year we review and benchmark our 
Governance Framework against best practice. 
The framework sets out the roles, accountabilities 
and expectations for our directors and our 
structures. This format has been adopted widely 
across the business and can be viewed at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (the 
"Code") is the standard against which we measured 
ourselves in 2016/1 7 . A copy of the Code is available 
from the Financial Reporting Council’s website. 
We are pleased to conﬁ rm that we complied 
with all of the provisions set out in the Code 
for the period under review. 
To keep this report interesting and engaging, 
we continue to focus on the key insights from 
the business; however, further detail on how 
we comply with the Code can be found in our 
Corporate Governance Statement, available 
at marksandspencer.com/thecompany.

Committees complies with the Code.

of duties between Chairman and CEO roles,

> Auditor appointment We disclose our external 
auditor appointment policy on our website.
> Internal Audit Details on the Internal Audit 
function are provided within this report.

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
The Board reviews the independence of 
its non-executive directors as part of its 
annual Board Eff ectiveness Review. 
The Chairman is committed to ensuring 
the Board comprises a majority of 
independent non-executive directors 
who objectively challenge management, 
balanced against the need to ensure 
continuity on the Board.
None of the non-executive directors 
has served more than six full years 
on the Board.
The Board considers that all of the 
non-executive directors bring strong 
independent oversight and continue 
to demonstrate independence. The Board 
recognises the recommended term within 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
It is mindful of the need for suitable 
succession, and therefore maintains 
a clear record of the time each non-
executive has served the Company 
and the skill set that each provides.

CHAIRMAN RECRUITMENT
CHAIRMAN INDUCTION PROCESS
SUCCESSION & 
INDUCTION
LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
In December 201 6 we announced that, 
after six years in the role, Robert Swannell 
intended to retire from the business in 201 7 . 
Robert committed to continue in his role 
until his replacement had been identiﬁ ed 
and had joined the business.
Following this announcement we 
commenced the process to recruit and 
appoint a new Chairman. The search was 
undertaken by the Nomination Committee  
(the "Committee") and led by myself as the 
Senior Independent Director. Steve Rowe 
was fully involved in the entire process.
The Committee had a number of 
discussions to scope out the key skills, 
experience, characteristics and 
requirements for the role. We then invited a 
selection of recruitment ﬁ rms to participate 
in a selection process focusing on a series 
of key questions in order to identify 
the appropriate executive recruitment 
consultants to support our search. We 
received very thorough and comprehensive 
responses from each ﬁ rm and, following 
further discussions, selected JCA. Aside 
from assisting with recruitment, JCA has 
no other connection to the Company.
Given the public proﬁ le of M&S the 
Committee did not consider it necessary 
to use open advertising for this role. The 
announcement of Robert’s retirement had 
been made to the market in December and 
interested parties were able to contact 
either myself or other Committee members.
A structured timetable was adopted for 
the process and regular Committee 
discussions and updates held throughout. 
From a detailed understanding of our 
requirements and speciﬁ cation of the role, 
JCA put together an extensive range of 
potential candidates for the Committee’s 
consideration. After much debate, this was 
narrowed down to a strong short list for 
interview. Shortlisted candidates met with 
the same members of the Committee to 
ensure consistency. Steve Rowe also spent 
signiﬁ cant time with the ﬁ nal candidates. 
The Committee members and Steve were 
unanimous in their ﬁ nal selection of the 
new Chairman.
On 5 May 201 7 we were pleased to 
announce the appointment of Archie 
Norman as Non-Executive Chairman with 
eff ect from 1 September 201 7 . Archie was 
an ideal match to our requirements for a 
strong retail background and signiﬁ cant 
board experience. He is one of the UK’s 
most respected business leaders, with a 
proven track record in retail and business. 
He has been on the board of public 
companies on and off  since 1 986, when 
he became ﬁ nance director of Kingﬁ sher 
at the age of 32. He went on to gain 
experience as both a CEO and chairman of 
a number of well known listed companies 
including Asda and, more recently, ITV. The 
Committee believes he is well placed to 
support Steve and the team as they deliver 
the plan that is already underway. 
VINDI BANGA SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
SENIOR SUCCESSION
The Operating Committee recently 
undertook a full talent and succession 
review of the top 1 20 senior roles within 
the business, plus the succession planning 
in place for these roles. As part of this, 
a benchmarking review was undertaken 
by Korn Ferry
*
 for all relevant individuals. 
This supported our talent agenda 
by providing: 
> A thorough benchmarking exercise of 
our talent versus the external market.
> Additional feedback and insights for all 
senior individuals which, combined with 
our perspectives, are leading to robust 
development plans for all our leaders.
> A catalyst for the broader M&S talent 
agenda, enabling us to adapt and 
simplify our talent processes for 
the wider organisation. 
This extensive review was discussed by the 
Board as part of an ongoing drive to provide 
greater clarity and achieve a common 
understanding of talent within the business, 
and to baseline our talent data at a senior 
level. While it was recognised that there is 
still some room for improvement before 
our talent information is a true reﬂ ection 
of our overall talent health, themes are 
emerging that enable us to strengthen 
our capabilities in the near term.
Ongoing and eff ective talent management 
is key to achieving our strategic and 
operational objectives and this is clearly 
recognised by the Board, as reﬂ ected in the 
Risk Management section on page 33. 
There is work outstanding to embed some 
of the identiﬁ ed core talent processes 
deeply in all parts of the organisation, as 
the principles of our new way of reviewing 
talent represent a cultural shift for M&S. 
These changes, although not always easy 
to make, are important if we are to create 
a sustainable, winning organisation.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
This is a period of crucial 
and profound change for the 
business and it is heartening 
to see how committed the 
Board is to eff ecting change.
ROBERT SWANNELL, CHAIRMAN
BOARD EVALUATION
The assessment of the Board was 
conducted according to the guidance in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
"Code") and was facilitated by Fﬁ on Hague of 
Independent Board Evaluation. Neither Fﬁ on 
Hague or Independent Board Evaluation has 
any other connection with the Company .
STAGE 1
A comprehensive brief was given to 
Independent Board Evaluation by the 
Chairman and Group Secretary in December 
201 6. The assessment team observed 
the main Board and committee meetings 
in December, January and February. 
Access to Board papers was provided 
electronically prior to the meetings via 
a secure portal.
In January and February, detailed interviews 
were conducted with each Board member . 
All participants were interviewed according 
to a clear agenda, tailored for M&S. The 
team also met with the Group Secretary, 
HR Director, Director of Group Finance, 
Head of Internal Audit & Risk, Director 
of Retail, audit partners from Deloitte, 
PwC (remuneration consultant) and 
Makinson Cowell (independent investor 
relations consultants).
STAGE 2
The report was compiled by the 
assessment team based on information 
and views supplied by those interviewed. 
All recommendations were based on best 
practice as described in the Code and 
other corporate governance guidelines.
STAGE 3
Draft conclusions were discussed with the 
Chairman and subsequently with the whole 
Board at its meeting in March, with Fﬁ on 
Hague present. The conclusion of that 
discussion was recorded in the minutes of 
the meeting. Following the Board meeting, 
Fﬁ on Hague gave feedback on the Chairman 
to the Senior Independent Director (Vindi 
Banga), and to the committee chairmen on 
the performance of each committee. In 
addition, the Chairman received a separate 
report with feedback on individual directors.
BOARD REVIEW INSIGHTS 2016/17
The broad message from the directors 
was that Board dynamics and the ﬂ ow of 
information to the Board has improved 
signiﬁ cantly. The Board rated itself as 
satisfactory in its performance on issues 
of Board focus, risk management, Board 
culture, the relationship with senior 
management, meeting schedules and the 
Board support function. Areas for further 
progress included consistency of papers 
and management information, succession 
planning and people development. As a 
result, these areas feature in the Board 
Action Plan for the year ahead. When the 
review was undertaken, Steve Rowe had 
been the CEO for a period of nine months. 
The business had been through signiﬁ cant 
change in that period and it was clear 
from the review that the openness in 
communication was a very positive 
development. The directors felt that the 
Board agenda covered the most important 
topics. However, they felt a review of the 
management information provided to 
the Board would improve the pace of 
the decision-making process. The culture 
of the Board is seen as positive and 
supportive. Board members described 
it as well-balanced, respectful, open, 
challenging and committed. However, it 
agreed that a greater diversity of culture, 
gender and experience might enhance 
the Board's composition.
COMMITTEES
Board committees were also reviewed 
and were considered highly regarded 
in terms of eff ectiveness and decision 
making. Senior managers felt signiﬁ cantly 
challenged by the Audit Committee and 
commented that the Audit Committee 
Chairman is very engaged on the key issues. 
The Remuneration Committee was seen as 
eff ective and considered. Greater visibility 
around remuneration is welcomed.
CHAIRMAN
The Chairman is much appreciated by staff , 
who feel he truly embodies the Company’s 
brand through his employee recognition 
work and his many store visits.

STAGES OF THE BOARD EVALUATION 43
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Board is responsible for the stewardship 
of the Company, overseeing its conduct and 
aff airs to create sustainable value for the 
beneﬁ t of its stakeholders. In performing this 
task, the Board recognises that to promote 
success over the long term it must fulﬁ l its 
wider duty to care for the interests of 
employees, customers and the communities 
in which the Company operates, and whose 
support is required to create sustainable value. 
The Board discharges some of its 
responsibilities directly and others through 
its Board committees and through 
management. The terms of reference 
of the Board and its committees are 
included in our Governance Framework.
The Board agrees, and has collective 
responsibility for, the strategy of the 
Company. For M&S, strategy means the 
development of speciﬁ c actions aimed at 
promoting the long-term sustainable 
growth of the Company by meeting the 
needs of our target customer groups, 
across all our product categories and 
channels. The articulation of our strategy 
will include agreement on how our physical 
and intellectual property and the skills of 
our people should be used, developed 
and enhanced to create competitive 
advantage for the Company. 
The Board delegates the execution of the 
Company’s strategy and the day-to-day 
management and operation of the 
Company’s business to the Operating 
Committee. The Board is responsible for 
overseeing, guiding and holding to 
account management in carrying out 
these responsibilities.
The Board is responsible for ensuring that 
appropriate values, ethics and behaviours 
for the conduct of the Company are agreed 
and that appropriate procedures and training 
are in place to ensure that these are observed 
throughout the Company. 
The Board has discussed and agreed the 
key values of Inspiration, Innovation, 
Integrity and In Touch and these underpin 
the required values, ethics and behaviours. 
Clear terms of reference outline the full 
schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
decision and that of its key committees.
The Board is responsible for: 
> Ensuring leadership through eff ective 
oversight and review. Supported by its 
principal committees – Audit, Remuneration, 
and Nomination – the Board sets the 
strategic direction and aims to deliver 
sustainable shareholder value over 
the longer term.
> Overseeing the implementation of 
appropriate risk assessment systems 
and processes to identify, manage 
and mitigate the principal risks of the 
Company’s business. Much of this work 
is delegated to the Audit Committee.
> Eff ective succession planning at Board 
level and for assessing the processes in 
place to ensure that there is appropriate 
succession planning among senior 
management. Much of this work is 
delegated to the Nomination Committee.
In addition to the other matters referred to 
in its Governance Framework, the Board is 
responsible for speciﬁ c matters relating 
to strategy, ﬁ nance, risk management, 
internal control and audit, legal, reputation 
and public company management. 
These, along with the individual roles of 
the Board members, are covered by the 
Schedule of Matters Reserved to the 
Board in the Marks and Spencer Group plc 
governance framework, and can be found 
at marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
ROLE OF THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES
RESPONSIBILITIES, OVERSIGHT 
& INDEPENDENCE
LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT
Protecting the business from operational, 
ﬁ nancial and reputational risk is an essential 
part of the Board’s role. Both the directors 
and senior management focus on not just 
the short but also the longer term and 
continue to be more actively involved in 
risk management and internal controls, 
an important part of stewardship and 
key to ensuring the long-term viability 
of the business.
The Group Risk Proﬁ le and risk appetite are 
owned by the Board. Their compilation is 
facilitated by Group Risk, using business area 
risk registers and one-on-one interviews 
with Board members and business unit 
directors. Oversight and independence are 
provided in the process through the Audit 
Committee, which ensures that the risks the 
Board include in the Group Risk Proﬁ le continue 
to reﬂ ect the business’s strategic objectives. 
An Internal Audit plan is then mapped to 
the Group Risk Proﬁ le, demonstrating where 
assurance is provided over mitigating activities.
BOARD COLLABORATION
The Group Board and committee structure is provided below and the reports from the 
chairs of the principal committees can be found on the pages 46, 48 and 54. Following the 
appointment of Steve Rowe as CEO, the business's operational processes were reviewed 
and a new framework implemented, with the Operating Committee responsible for 
monitoring, managing and providing executive input to support strategic and operational 
decisions to create strong executive alignment on business priorities and actions. 
Membership of this committee can be found on page 1 1 or on our corporate website.
Although the executive directors sit as part of the Operating Committee to debate 
and understand opinion from key leaders from the business areas, they are ultimately 
responsible for all for decisions on strategy and all non-property investments through 
the Investment Committee, and capital expenditure for the Group’s UK and International 
property portfolio in line with the Group’s strategic goals and business priorities through 
the Property Committee. 
The supporting committees provide oversight and regular updates to the Operating 
Committee and annual assurance updates to either the Audit Committee or Group Board. 
All committees have clear terms of reference and approval thresholds set and approved 
by the Group Board.

We are always looking for ways to develop 
our engagement with shareholders. This year 
we introduced our regular Shareholder

shareholders is invited to participate in 
face-to-face discussions with members 
of the Board and senior management. 
For our large institutional investors and 
investor advisory ﬁ rms, we continue to hold

The Board’s engagement with the Company’s 
85,000 employees is facilitated through 
our Business Involvement Group (BIG), 
a network of 3,500 elected employee 
representatives from across all parts of the 
business. Local BIG teams regularly feed 
back to National BIG, whose chairman in 
turn represents the collective employee 
voice through regular meetings with the 
Chairman and CEO, plus attendance 
at our Board. However, employee 
engagement extends far beyond BIG: one

“The main purpose of building 
up a great business should 
not be merely to make money. 
A company has its responsibilities,

which it trades. Unless it gives 
satisfaction, and even happiness

INTRODUCTION 
During the year the focus of the Nomination 
Committee (the "Committee") was on the 
search for a new Chairman to succeed me 
and the succession of non-executives and 
senior individuals within the business. 
As outlined on page 39, the Chairman 
search was led by Vindi Banga and I did 
not participate in the process. 
In September, following her maternity leave, 
Laura Wade-Gery, Executive Director, Multi-
channel, left the business. Her responsibilities 
were allocated to the other executive 
directors, and the business now operates 
with a smaller executive Board. Laura was 
instrumental in modernising our ecommerce 
and multi-channel capabilities, and we wish 
her the very best for the future. 
The Committee maintains a well-deﬁ ned 
speciﬁ cation for each appointment, with 
a clear understanding of the attributes 
and values required to help the eff ective 
functioning of the whole Board. It considers 
the combination of skills and experience 
required to fulﬁ l the Board’s purpose. As 
Chairman of the Committee, I take an active 
role in overseeing the progress made 
towards improving diversity and women’s 
representation on both the Operating 
Committee and among its direct reports.
The business has a framework with clearly 
identiﬁ ed individuals capable of covering 
key management roles on an interim or 
permanent basis. These individuals receive 
the necessary coaching to ensure they have 
the required skills to provide any critical 
support when needed. Development for 
directors and high performing individuals 
below Board level is an essential area of 
focus. Coaching and mentoring is provided 
to develop and enhance speciﬁ c skill sets, 
and the Committee believes the beneﬁ ts 
of this approach are critical for developing 
our own talent for the future.
The Committee continues to take a more 
active interest in talent management, in 
particular ensuring that initiatives are 
in place to develop the talent pipeline 
and to promote diversity in Board and 
executive appointments.

We are introducing new initiatives to broaden and develop

BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY
Since the launch of the Board Diversity 
Policy in 201 2, the Board has made progress 
in broadening the diversity of the Board 
and senior management. The policy 
continues to drive the beneﬁ ts of a diverse 
Board and workforce across the business. 
The ambitions and objectives set out in 
the policy remain relevant targets against 
which to measure our progress.
  For further information on employee 
diversity, including gender, ethnicity 
and age, see p24 of our Plan A Report 
marksandspencer.com/plana2017.
BOARD DIVERSITY: PROGRESS UPDATE
Maintain a level of at least 30% female 
directors on the Board over the short 
to medium term.
As highlighted earlier in the report, one 
change to the Board was made during the 
year to 1 April 201 7 , with the resignation of 
Laura Wade-Gery. Despite the reduced size 
of the Board, the percentage of women 
on the Board remains on target at 30% 
at the time of publication. The charts on 
page 38 provide a clearer picture of our 
Board diversity.
The Board remains committed to maintaining 
at least a 30% female representation on the 
Board, while ensuring that diversity in its 
broadest sense remains a central feature. 
However, the Nomination Committee will 
continue to recommend appointments 
to the Board based on merit, measured 
against objective criteria and the skills and 
experience the individual off ers.
The Board is also committed to strengthening 
the pipeline of senior female executives 
within the business and has taken steps to 
ensure that there are no barriers to women 
succeeding at the highest levels within M&S.
Assist the development of a pipeline of 
high-calibre candidates by encouraging 
a broad range of senior individuals within 
the business to take on additional roles 
to gain valuable board experience. 
During the year , the Board continued to focus 
on strengthening the pipeline of executive 
talent in the Company . It remains committed 
to building on existing programmes while 
introducing new initiatives to broaden and 
develop the strong talent which exists 
across the business. 
Key initiatives include: 
> A comprehensive talent review presented 
to the Board annually , mapping successional 
candidates and opportunities across all 
senior roles within the business.
> A thorough approach to talent 
development through initiatives including 
the Korn Ferry Leadership Development 
Review, and Development Centres for 
high potential talent. 
> The Leadership Development Service has 
been in place for four years and continues 
to identify and partner key senior talent 
across the business, broadening their 
skill sets and experience to prepare them 
for future opportunities. This has been 
supported through greater boardroom 
exposure, non-executive and Trustee 
roles outside of M&S, involvement in 
senior pipeline programmes and 
participation in mentoring schemes. 
> Access to international business 
school training. 
> Senior management mentoring and 
coaching schemes and non-executive 
director sponsored lunches and breakfasts. 
Consider candidates for appointment 
as non-executive directors from a wider 
pool, including those with experience 
outside traditional listed boards.
Although no new appointments were made 
during the year, the Nomination Committee 
continued to discuss the successional needs 
of the Board in respect of its non-executive 
directors. Lists of potential candidates are 
compiled with assistance from executive 
search agencies and comprise candidates 
from a range of diff erent industries and 
backgrounds. Those subsequently identiﬁ ed 
for interview are measured against criteria 
set at the start of the search process. The 
Chairman also meets informally with a 
range of people introduced by third parties 
or through direct approaches. Although we 
do not currently openly advertise our non-
executive director positions, we appreciate 
the beneﬁ t of this approach and will keep 
this under review.
Ensure long lists of potential non-executive 
directors include 50% female candidates. 
The Board remains committed to ensuring 
that high-performing women from within the 
business and from a variety of backgrounds, 
who have the requisite skills, are given greater 
exposure to the nomination committees of 
FTSE 1 00 companies. All long lists for potential 
future non-executive director appointments 
will include at least 50% female candidates.
Only engage executive search ﬁ rms who 
have signed up to the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct for Executive Search Firms 
on gender diversity and best practice. 
The Board continues to support the ten 
principles of the Voluntary Code 
of Conduct for Executive Search Firms on 
gender diversity and best practice and is 
committed to only engaging executive 
search ﬁ rms who are signatories to this 
code. During the year, we worked closely 
with Egon Zehnder and JCA and maintained 
our focus on the targets and ambitions 
around female representation on the 
Board. The Board conﬁ rms that neither 
Egon Zehnder nor JCA has any other 
connection with the Company.
Report annually against these objectives 
and other initiatives taking place within 
the Company which promote gender 
and other forms of diversity. 
The Board has made strong progress against 
the key policy objectives during the year, 
as reported above. In addition, the business 
has continued to promote diversity through 
a range of key initiatives:
> The annual Board evaluation process 
includes an assessment of the Board’s 
diversity including gender, helping to 
objectively consider its composition 
and eff ectiveness. 
> Five employee-led diversity networks that 
focus on making M&S an inclusive place 
to work for women and men (Gender 
Equality Network), minority ethnic groups 
(BAME at M&S), lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender people (LGBT + at M&S), 
parents (Parents Net), and people 
with disabilities and health conditions 
(The Buddy Network). These deliver 
large-scale awareness-raising events 
promoting inclusion and equality, 
as well as mentoring, coaching, 
roundtable discussions with senior 
leaders and regular communication 
across the business.
> Continued involvement in the government -
backed 30% Club, an organisation 
committed to increasing female 
representation on UK boards. 
> Continued involvement running Business 
in the Community (BITC) mentoring 
circles which help us to promote and 
develop BAME (Black, Asian and minority 
ethnic) talent pipelines. 
> Active involvement in key campaigns 
including LGBT + Pride celebrations, 
International Women’s Day, Black History 
Month, National Inclusion Week, and World 
Disability Day, raising awareness and our 
proﬁ le as an inclusive employer.
> A number of programmes to help people 
in our communities, including Marks & Start 
and Marks & Start Logistics, are successfully 
helping young people, the homeless, lone 
parents and those with disabilities to ﬁ nd 
work in our stores and distribution centres.
Report annually on the outcome of the 
Board evaluation, the composition and 
structure of the Board as well as any issues 
and challenges the Board is facing when 
considering the diverse make-up of 
the Company. 
We continue to regard the Board evaluation 
process as an important means of monitoring 
our progress. Full details of the 201 6/1 7 
Board evaluation and the Action Plan are on 
page 42. We remain committed to getting 
the right balance of internal versus external 
hires and work towards understanding and 
managing the challenges we face, such as:
> International management experience 
reﬂ ective of the customers and 
communities we serve.
> Any challenges women face in reaching 
regional management positions and 
above within the business. 48

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
REPORT
ACCOUNTABILITY
The Committee has played a key role in ensuring 
appropriate challenge and governance around 
accounting treatment, risk management and control 
and assurance process.
ANDY HALFORD CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
INTRODUCTION 
As Chairman of the Audit Committee 
(the "Committee"), I am pleased to present 
the Committee’s report for the year ended 
1 April 201 7 .
Through this report I aim to share some 
of the Committee's discussions from the 
boardroom, off ering insight into its essential 
role in protecting the interests of our 
shareholders through ensuring the integrity 
of the Company's published ﬁ nancial 
information and the eff ectiveness of the 
Internal Audit process. Our report will 
provide an overview of the signiﬁ cant issues 
the Committee has assessed during the year 
and will off er the Committee's view of the 
Annual Report as a whole, including the 
methodology behind its assessment of the 
narrative reporting as an accurate reﬂ ection 
of the ﬁ nancial statements.
The report also shares some of the 
executive updates that were presented to 
the Committee by diff erent areas of the 
business during the year. These updates are 
essential in telling us how diff erent risks are 
managed and mitigated throughout the 
business, and assists the Committee in 
understanding the progress being made 
towards the strategic plan. They also 
provide the Committee members with 
an opportunity to share their own extensive 
experience with the presenters, utilising 
their independent perspective to add 
value through robust challenge, discussion 
and debate.
The report will also update you on our 
assessment of the eff ectiveness of our 
statutory auditor, Deloitte, and explain 
our policy relating to any non-audit work 
it was engaged to complete and the fees 
it received for doing so. 
The expertise of the Committee members 
is considered as part of the annual review of 
the Committee's eff ectiveness. The Board 
is satisﬁ ed that the Committee possesses 
relevant sectoral competence and 
appropriate levels of independence, and 
that its members off er a depth of ﬁ nancial 
and commercial experience across various 
industries. It is further satisﬁ ed that Andy 
Halford possesses recent and relevant 
ﬁ nancial experience and the requisite 
competence in accounting.
Audit Committee activities during 201 6/1 7:
> Maintained focus on the audit, assurance 
and risk processes within the business, 
as well as oversight of ﬁ nancial and other 
regulatory requirements.
> Reviewed the Group’s systems of internal 
control and risk management, and any 
changes in accounting policies and 
impact on its ﬁ nancial statements.
> Provided oversight of particular business 
risks, including those relating to ethical 
sourcing and animal welfare.
> Provided increased oversight of the risks 
and controls pertaining to cyber security.
> Monitored the ﬁ nancial reporting 
process, the statutory audit of the 
Group’s ﬁ nancial statements and the 
independence of the statutory auditor.
> Discussed and reviewed adjusted items 
that may impact business performance.
> Reviewed the mitigating controls over 
the Group’s principal risks and assessed 
the level of assurance provided.
> Continued to support assurance 
mapping across the Group, with 
particular focus on strategic priorities.
> Continued to monitor and respond to 
the changing regulatory environment, 
particularly in respect of implementation 
of the EU Audit Regulation and Directive.
Members of senior management are 
invited to attend Committee meetings 
as and when their specialist technical 
knowledge is required. The Committee 
also meets privately, without management 
present, before each meeting. Additionally, 
separate private sessions attended by the 
lead audit partner from Deloitte and the 
Head of Internal Audit & Risk are held after 
each meeting. As Committee Chair, I also 
regularly meet on a one-to-one basis with 
the Chief Finance Offi  cer, Director of Group 
Finance, Head of Internal Audit & Risk and 
other members of senior management. 
I also meet with the lead audit partner 
in advance of Committee meetings. 
Scheduling meetings in this way enables 
me to better understand any key issues 
and areas of concern, and allows suffi  cient 
time to facilitate meaningful discussion 
during the subsequent meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee receives detailed updates 
from one or more business areas at each 
meeting. These updates are planned on a 
rolling 1 2-month basis. Additional matters 
identiﬁ ed by Internal Audit as requiring the 
Committee’s attention are included in 
the agendas of subsequent meetings. An 
overview of some of the updates presented 
during 201 6/1 7 is provided below:
MANAGEMENT OF INTERNAL
CONTROL FAILURES
The Audit Committee receives updates on 
internal control matters at each meeting. 
This regular monitoring of the internal 
control framework allows timely 
identiﬁ cation of issues and formal tracking 
of remediation plans. Instances where the 
eff ectiveness of internal controls was 
considered insuffi  cient were discussed 
during the year, either by the Audit 
Committee or the full Board. These 
have included controls over market 
updates, third party oversight and IT asset 
management. As part of the annual review 
of internal control, the Audit Committee 
again considered these matters, ensuring 
that the agreed actions were being 
implemented to support a programme 
of maintaining and improving internal 
control. Following its review, the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
that, although the matters identiﬁ ed were 
important, they had been addressed at 
the time of its review, with suitable controls 
now in place.

AUDIT COMMITTEE UPDATES
INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND 
COMMITTEE ACTION PLAN
The Committee's performance was 
reviewed externally this year by Fﬁ on Hague. 
Feedback was positive, particularly relating 
to the open debate encouraged during 
meetings. It is regarded as thorough and 
eff ective, and provides the Board with a high 
level of assurance that audit matters are 
dealt with appropriately. Areas in which it 
was felt improvements could be achieved 
were discussed by the Committee for 
inclusion in its 201 7 /1 8 action plan. 
The Committee made good progress on 
the 201 6/1 7 action plan by reviewing 
controls over and assessing the levels 
of assurance provided in respect of the 
Group’s principal risks, supporting risk 
assurance mapping across the Group, 
increasing its oversight of cyber security 
risks and monitoring regulatory change. 
The action plan for 201 7 /1 8: 
> Review the eff ectiveness of Internal 
Audit in line with the Chartered Institute 
of Internal Audit requirements and 
monitor any key ﬁ ndings.
> Continue to oversee the Company-wide 
risk and assurance mapping.
> Continue to monitor oversight of data 
governance and information security 
risk ahead of the implementation of 
the General Data Protection Regulation 
in May 201 8.
> Oversee the reﬁ nement of the internal 
control environment.
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED 50
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Audit Committee has assessed 
whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether 
management has made appropriate 
judgements and estimates.
Throughout the year, the Finance team has 
worked closely with Deloitte to ensure that 
the business is transparent and provides 
the required level of disclosure regarding 
signiﬁ cant issues considered by the 
Committee in relation to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, as well as how these issues 
were addressed, while being mindful of 
matters that may be business-sensitive. 
This section outlines the main areas of 
judgement that have been considered by 
the Committee to ensure that appropriate 
rigour has been applied. All accounting 
policies can be found in note 1 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements. Where further 
information is provided in the notes to 
the ﬁ nancial statements, we have included 
the note reference. 
Each of the areas of judgement to the right 
has been identiﬁ ed as an area of focus 
and therefore the Committee has also 
received detailed reporting from Deloitte.
PRESENTATION OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Committee gave consideration to the 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements 
and in particular the use of alternative 
performance measures and the presentation 
of adjusted items in accordance with the 
Group accounting policy. This policy states 
that adjustments are only made to reported 
proﬁ t before tax where income and charges 
are signiﬁ cant in value and/or nature. 
The Committee received detailed reports 
from management outlining the 
judgements applied in relation to the 
disclosure of adjusted items. In the current 
year, management has included in this 
category: the reduction in M&S Bank income 
for the impact of the M&S Bank provision 
for ﬁ nancial product mis-selling; signiﬁ cant 
charges arising in relation to changes to pay 
and pensions; net costs associated with the 
implementation of strategic programmes in 
relation to UK organisation, UK logistics, UK 
store estate and the closure of International 
owned businesses; impairments of the 
carrying value of UK and International stores 
(including associated onerous leases); and 
legal settlements. This was an area of focus 
for the Committee in the current year due to 
the number and value of these items 
(£437 .4m charge) and the recent guidelines 
on the use of alternative performance 
measures issued by the European Securities 
and Markets Authority. 
In addition, the prior year was a 53-week 
statutory reporting period so consideration 
had been given to the balance of 52-week 
and 53-week metrics for the prior year 
reported throughout the Annual Report. 
The 52-week measures have been quoted 
where relevant to ensure meaningful 
comparison with this year’s 52-week period. 
Following detailed review and active 
discussion with management, the 
Committee has concluded that the 
presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements 
is appropriate. 
 See note 5 on p103
IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, BRANDS, 
TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Committee has considered the 
assessments made in relation to the 
impairment of goodwill, brands, tangible 
and intangible ﬁ xed assets, including land 
and buildings, store assets and software 
assets. The Committee received detailed 
At the request of the Board, the Committee 
has considered whether, in its opinion, 
the 20 1 7 Annual Report and Financial 
Statements are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and whether they provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
The structure of the report continues 
to focus strongly on the key strategic 
messages in the Strategic Report. It was 
therefore important for the Committee 
to ensure that this emphasis did not dilute 
the overall transparency in the disclosures 
made throughout the report, which we 
know our stakeholders ﬁ nd useful, and that 
the messages presented by the business 
are both clear and reﬂ ective of the 
Company as a whole.
A broad outline of the structure of the 
Annual Report was given to the Committee 
early in the planning process, along with a 
similarly broad indication of its content. 
The Committee received a full draft of 
the report two weeks prior to the meeting 
at which it would be requested to provide 
its ﬁ nal opinion. Feedback was provided by 
the Committee in advance of that meeting, 
highlighting the areas it was felt would 
beneﬁ t from further clarity. The draft 
report was then amended to incorporate 
this feedback prior to being tabled at the 
May Audit Committee meeting for ﬁ nal 
comment and approval.
The Committee was provided with a list of 
the key messages included in the Annual 
Report, highlighting which were positive 
and which were reﬂ ective of the challenges 
from the year. A supporting document was 
also provided, speciﬁ cally addressing the 
following listed points, highlighting where 
these could be evidenced within the report.
When forming its opinion, the Committee 
reﬂ ected on the information it had received 
and its discussions throughout the year. 
In particular, the Committee considered: 
IS THE REPORT FAIR? 
> Is the whole story presented and has 
any sensitive material been omitted 
that should have been included? 
> Is the reporting on the business 
performance in the narrative reporting 
consistent with those used for the 
ﬁ nancial reporting in the ﬁ nancial 
statements? 
> Are the key messages in the narrative 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial reporting?
> Are the KPIs disclosed at an appropriate 
level based on the ﬁ nancial reporting? 
IS THE REPORT BALANCED? 
> Is there a good level of consistency 
between the narrative reporting in 
the front and the ﬁ nancial reporting in 
the back of the report, and does the 
messaging presented within each 
remain consistent when one is read 
independently of the other?
> Is the Annual Report properly 
a document for shareholders?
> Are the statutory and adjusted 
measures explained clearly with 
appropriate prominence? 
> Are the key judgements referred to in the 
narrative reporting and the signiﬁ cant 
issues reported in this Audit Committee 
Report consistent with the disclosures 
of key estimation uncertainties and 
critical judgements set out in the 
ﬁ nancial statements? 
> How do the signiﬁ cant issues identiﬁ ed 
compare with the risks that Deloitte 
plans to include in its report? 
IS THE REPORT UNDERSTANDABLE? 
> Is there a clear and understandable 
framework to the report? 
> Are the important messages highlighted 
appropriately throughout the document? 
> Is the layout clear with good linkage 
throughout in a manner that reﬂ ects 
the whole story?
CONCLUSION 
Following its review, the Committee 
was of the opinion that the 2017 Annual 
Report and Financial Statements are 
representative of the year and present 
a fair, balanced and understandable 
overview, providing the necessary 
information for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES 51
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
reports from management outlining the 
treatment of impairments, valuation 
methodology, the basis for key assumptions 
(discount rate and long-term growth rate) 
and the key drivers of the cash ﬂ ow forecasts. 
The Committee has challenged management 
and is satisﬁ ed that these are appropriate. 
The Committee has also understood the 
sensitivity analysis used by management 
in its review of impairments. In addition, 
the business plans detailing management’s 
expectations of future performance of 
the businesses are Board approved. The 
Committee is satisﬁ ed that appropriate 
impairment of tangible and intangible 
assets has been recognised. 
 See notes 5, 14 & 15 on p103-104 & 114-116
INVENTORY VALUATION AND 
PROVISIONING
Inventory provisions include obsolete 
stock, net realisable value below cost and 
stock loss provisions. The Committee has 
examined management papers outlining the 
judgements made regarding provisioning 
for inventory balances and is satisﬁ ed that 
a suffi  ciently robust process was followed 
to conﬁ rm quantities of inventory and that 
net realisable value of inventory exceeds 
its cost at year end.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Committee has reviewed the actuarial 
assumptions such as discount rate, inﬂ ation 
rate, expected return of scheme assets and 
mortality which determine the pension cost 
and the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme valuation, 
and has concluded that they are appropriate. 
The assumptions have been disclosed in the 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
 See note 11 on p108-111
REVENUE RECOGNITION IN 
RELATION TO REFUNDS, GIFT CARDS 
AND LOYALTY SCHEMES
Revenue accruals for sales returns and deferred 
income in relation to loyalty scheme 
redemptions and gift card and credit voucher 
redemptions are estimated based on historical 
returns and redemptions. The Committee 
has considered the basis of these accruals, 
along with analysis of historical returns and 
redemption rates and has agreed with the 
judgements reached by management.
SUPPLIER INCOME
This continues to be monitored closely by 
management and robust controls are in place 
to ensure appropriate recognition in the 
correct period. The Committee is satisﬁ ed 
with management’s conclusion that there 
is minimal risk of material misstatement. 
Enhanced disclosure has been made again 
in the current year through publication of 
the accounting policy and disclosing the 
eff ects of supplier income on certain 
balance sheet accounts.
CLOSURE COSTS FOR INTERNATIONAL 
OPERATIONS (NEW DISCLOSURE)
The Committee has considered the 
assessments made in relation to the estimation 
of closure costs and associated provisions 
for the exit from certain International owned 
markets. The Committee received detailed 
reports from management outlining the 
accounting treatment of the costs, the 
basis for the key assumptions used in the 
estimation of the costs (most notably 
in relation to property exit costs and 
redundancy) and the assessment of 
assets to be impaired. The Committee has 
challenged management and is satisﬁ ed 
that these are appropriate. The Committee 
is satisﬁ ed that appropriate costs and 
associated provisions have been 
recognised.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONTINUED
TENURE
Deloitte was appointed by shareholders 
as the Group’s statutory auditor in 2014 
following a formal tender process. The 
lead audit partner, Ian Waller, has held 
the position for three years. The external 
audit contract will be put out to tender 
at least every ten years.
The Committee recommends that Deloitte 
be reappointed as the Company’s statutory 
auditor for the 201 7 /1 8 ﬁ nancial year. We 
believe the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor and the eff ectiveness 
of the audit process are safeguarded and 
remain strong. The Company has complied 
with the Statutory Audit Services Order for 
the ﬁ nancial year under review.
EFFECTIVENESS
The eff ectiveness of our external auditor 
is assessed in accordance with a process 
agreed by the Audit Committee, which is 
divided into ten structured components 
setting out the key areas of the audit 
process for the Committee to consider. 
This framework also recognises the 
contribution of management in being fully 
engaged with, and thereby enhancing the 
eff ectiveness of, the external audit process. 
It enables the Audit Committee to form 
a view of management's role in an eff ective 
audit process by considering whether 
it believes in a culture of ‘right ﬁ rst time’, 
produces high quality papers, ensures 
robust internal systems and controls are 
maintained, respects and values the 
independent audit process and examines 
any audit adjustments proposed by the 
external auditor with appropriate rigour.
This framework provides a robust process 
for monitoring auditor eff ectiveness and 
can be measured against the ﬁ ndings of 
future external auditor eff ectiveness 
surveys. The approach to the assessment 
is tailored to enable senior management to 
answer detailed questions on the Company-
wide audit process, and provide the 
Audit Committee with suffi  cient detail to 
establish an informed view on the overall 
effi  ciency, integrity and eff ectiveness 
of the external audit. 
Questionnaires were tailored to the 
following target groups:
1. Chief Finance Offi  cer and Director 
of Group Finance: A full questionnaire 
was completed, covering all areas of the 
audit process, while taking account of the 
questionnaires completed by the Directors 
of Finance for Food and Clothing & Home 
and Head of Finance, International.
2. Directors of Finance: Food, Clothing 
& Home and Head of Finance, 
International: Shorter questionnaire, 
focusing on the audit team, planning, 
challenge and interaction with the business. 
3. Audit Committee: A high-level set of 
questions with speciﬁ c focus on the 
planning, execution, value, communication 
and challenge of the audit and audit partner. 
The Committee had access to copies of the 
completed management questionnaires 
(sections 1 and 2 above) to assist with its 
own considerations.
WHAT WAS THE OUTCOME?
Feedback from each of the target groups 
was positive overall, particularly in respect 
of the technical insight and challenge 
provided by the audit team; its level of 
interaction with the business; its strong 
understanding of M&S’s culture and values; 
and the valuable guidance provided for the 
Company’s strategic initiatives. It was felt 
that areas identiﬁ ed during the 201 5/1 6 
review had improved during the year, 
speciﬁ cally the communication between 
the business and Deloitte during the audit 
process; however, it was felt that further 
improvements could still be achieved.
Areas for development identiﬁ ed in this 
year's review were encouraging a more 
joined-up approach during the audit and 
ensuring the timely provision of accurate 
information by M&S to the auditor. 
Additionally, it was felt that further work by 
both M&S and Deloitte would improve the 
effi  ciency of the overseas audit process.

DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Board assumes ultimate responsibility 
for the eff ective management of risk across 
the Group, determining its risk appetite as 
well as ensuring that each business area 
implements appropriate internal controls. 
The Group’s risk management systems are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
 See p32-33 of the Strategic Report for 
more information on our material risks 
 See p30 for further information on our 
risk management processes
The key features of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems 
that ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
ﬁ nancial reporting include clearly deﬁ ned 
lines of accountability and delegation 
of authority, policies and procedures that 
cover ﬁ nancial planning and reporting, 
preparing consolidated accounts, capital 
expenditure, project governance and 
information security, and the Group’s 
Code of Ethics and Behaviours.
The Board has delegated responsibility for 
reviewing the eff ectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control to the Audit 
Committee. This covers all material controls 
including ﬁ nancial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
systems. The Committee is supported by 
a number of sources of internal assurance 
from within the Group in order to complete 
these reviews, in particular:
1. Internal Audit The Group’s primary source 
of internal assurance remains delivery of the 
Internal Audit Plan, which is structured to align 
with the Group’s strategic priorities and key 
risks and is developed by Internal Audit with 
input from management. Recommendations 
from Internal Audit are communicated to the 
relevant business area for implementation 
of appropriate corrective measures, with 
results reported to the Committee.
2. Business presentations Focusing primarily 
on the key risks identiﬁ ed in the Group Risk 
Proﬁ le, management continues to provide 
updates to the Committee on how these 
are managed in individual business areas. 
These are complemented by independent 
reviews conducted by Internal Audit.
3. Other control agencies Responsible 
for maintaining control over critical areas 
of risk, the processes and controls of these 
agencies are tested by Internal Audit & Risk 
during relevant audits. An overview of these 
agencies and the manner in which they 
provide assurance to the Committee is 
indicated in the table below. 
The Group was compliant throughout the 
year with the provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code relating to internal 
controls and the FRC’s revised Guidance on 
Audit Committees and Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting. No 
signiﬁ cant failings or weaknesses were 
identiﬁ ed during the Committee’s review 
in respect of the year ended 1 April 201 7 
and up to the date of this Annual Report. 
Where the Committee identiﬁ ed areas 
requiring improvement, processes are in 
place to ensure that the necessary action 
is taken and that progress is monitored. 
Further details of these processes can 
be found within our detailed Corporate 
Governance Statement which is available to 
view in the Corporate Governance section 
of marksandspencer.com/thecompany.

NON-AUDIT FEES
A robust auditor engagement policy is 
in place and adhered to. It is reviewed 
annually and was updated during the year 
to account for the tighter restrictions 
on work permitted to be undertaken 
by the statutory auditor introduced by 
the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) 
Revised Ethical Standard 2016. The policy 
is disclosed on marksandspencer.com/
thecompany. The business is committed 
to maintaining non-audit fees at a low level. 
The non-audit fees to audit fees ratio for 
the ﬁ nancial year ended 1 April 201 7 was 
0.1 6: 1, compared with the previous year’s 
ratio of 0.1 7: 1. During the year, the Company 
was notiﬁ ed that Deloitte had acquired crisis 
management specialists Regester Larkin 
(RL), which the Company has engaged, 
prior to acquisition, to develop crisis 
management exercises. The fees for RL 
were £32k. Since the bulk of the fees were 
incurred prior to RL ’s acquisition by Deloitte, 
it was decided to complete the project as 
planned and that alternative providers 
would be reviewed for future engagements. 
The majority of the £0.3m in non-audit fees 
paid in total to Deloitte during 201 6/1 7 were 
incurred for assurance services it provided 
during the year. These comprised fees in 
respect of the Half Year review, turnover 
certiﬁ cates, the annual Euro Medium Term 
Note (EMTN) programme renewal, reviews 
of quarterly trading statements, crisis 
management reviews and overseas 
engagements. It is normal practice for such 
assurance services to be provided by the 
Company’s statutory auditor. No additional 
recurring or one-off  non-audit services 
were provided during the year. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the 
Company was compliant during the year 
with both the updated UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the FRC's Ethical 
and Auditing Standards in respect of the 
scope and maximum permitted level of 
fees incurred for non-audit services 
provided by Deloitte. Where non-audit 
work is performed by Deloitte, both the 
Company and Deloitte ensure adherence 
to robust processes to prevent the 
objectivity and independence of the 
auditor from being compromised.
All non-audit work performed by Deloitte 
was put to the Audit Committee for 
consideration and approval, regardless 
of size. Further details on non-audit 
services provided by Deloitte can be 
found in note 4 on page 102.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PENSIONS 
GOVERNANCE
GOVERNANCE
The Group operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme, the Marks & Spencer 
UK Pension Scheme, (the "Scheme") for 
employees with an appointment date prior 
to 1 April 2002. The Scheme closed to future 
accrual from 1 April 201 7 . Employees are 
now eligible to join and are auto-enrolled 
as required by legislation into a deﬁ ned 
contribution pension scheme, Your M&S 
Pension Saving Plan, which is part of a 
mastertrust arrangement managed by 
Legal & General.
The results of the triennial actuarial 
valuation of the Scheme as at 3 1 March 201 5 
revealed a surplus of £204m on a technical 
provisions basis. This represented a healthy 
improvement from a deﬁ cit of £290m as at 
3 1 March 201 2 as a result of agreed recovery 
plan contributions from the Company and 
outperformance of return-seeking assets 
over the period. The Scheme has also been 
hedged against interest rate and inﬂ ation 
risks and has thus been insulated from 
the eff ect of falling real interest rates. 
Scheme funding is closely and frequently 
monitored and Scheme investment risks 
are diversiﬁ ed.
The Scheme, the assets of which are held 
under trust separately from those of the 
Group, is managed by the Board of the 
Pension Trust ("Trustee Board"). The Trustee 
Board comprises four Company-nominated 
directors, including the Chairman, Graham 
Oakley, three member-nominated directors 
and two independent directors. All directors 
are appointed for a ﬁ ve-year term and may 
stand for additional terms.
The Trustee Board operates a number of 
committees including: Management and 
Governance, Investment, and Audit to which 
responsibilities are delegated. The Trustee 
Board is supported by an executive team 
which manages the governance and 
operation of the Scheme.
The Trustee Board has a business plan 
against which progress is measured 
periodically in a similar approach to the 
Group Board. There is also an annual 
Trustee Board Eff ectiveness Review and 
both the Trustee Board and the Investment 
Committee hold annual strategy days which 
help drive the long-term agenda and the 
business plan priorities. Each Trustee Board 
director has an individual training plan, 
which is based on the Pension Regulator’s 
Trustee Knowledge and Understanding 
requirements and tailored to address any 
skill gaps and speciﬁ c committee roles. 
A majority of the Trustee Board members 
hold the Pensions Management Institute 
Award in Trusteeship.
All advisers and suppliers are appointed 
through a rigorous tender process, and 
in respect of investment manager 
appointments are made with advice from 
the Scheme’s appointed investment adviser. 
They are monitored via quarterly reports 
and periodic meetings and there is also a 
rolling programme of both informal and 
formal adviser reviews.
In addition to six-monthly reports from 
EY as covenant adviser, the Trustee Board 
also receives presentations from the Chief 
Finance Offi  cer after the Group’s Half Year 
and Year End results.
The Scheme is a signatory to the UN 
Principles for Responsible Investment 
and the Financial Reporting Council’s 
UK Stewardship Code. It has partnered 
with a specialist engagement service, 
Hermes Equity Ownership Services (EOS), 
to exercise its global equity voting rights in 
accordance with a detailed Trustee Board 
policy, which addresses a range of 
governance, social and environmental 
issues. The engagement of EOS enhances 
the Trustee Board’s stewardship and 
governance oversight of investee 
companies by engaging with companies 
on a global basis. The results of these voting 
and engagement activities are published 
quarterly on the Scheme’s website. 54
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our 201 7 Remuneration Report. 
The Committee has sought to further 
improve our disclosures once again this 
year to provide not only the regulatory 
information we are required to disclose while 
balancing against commercial sensitivities, 
but also the context surrounding pay 
arrangements. Additional context has been 
provided where we believe this will help to 
present a complete picture of the structure 
and scale of the remuneration framework, 
its alignment with the business strategy and 
the rest of the workforce, as well as the 
payments made as a result of business 
performance for this year. 
As highlighted last year, and in line with 
regulations, we are now seeking shareholder 
support and approval for our Remuneration 
Policy at the 201 7 AGM. This year’s summary 
‘Remuneration at a Glance’ highlights not 
only the key elements of the payments 
made to directors this year, but also gives an 
outline of the proposed amendments to the 
Remuneration Policy which will govern pay 
arrangements in the next three years.
As required, this report is split into two 
further distinct sections, the ﬁ rst covering 
our updated Remuneration Policy, and the 
second covering remuneration in action for 
the 201 6/1 7 and 201 7 /1 8 ﬁ nancial years. In 
accordance with regulations, shareholders 
will be requested to vote separately on 
these reports at our AGM in July 201 7 , with 
this Remuneration Overview and the Annual 
Report on Remuneration being subject to 
an advisory vote.
REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK 
CONSIDERATIONS
The Board is committed to ensuring that 
our remuneration framework supports our 
strategy, and provides a balance between 
motivating and challenging our senior 
leaders to deliver our business priorities, 
as set out by our CEO, and strong 
performance while also driving the long-
term sustainable success of M&S. As a 
result, a signiﬁ cant part of performance 
related reward is delivered through shares. 
This ensures that our leaders have 
meaningful long-term investment in 
our business, and that their interests are 
closely aligned with our shareholders. 
The Committee spent a considerable 
amount of time this year liaising with 
many of our shareholders and sharing 
a wide variety of views on remuneration 
generally, including the framework, 
structures, measures and targets. It 
explored a number of options taking into 
account the various perspectives and 
views and considering these against the 
current framework, the current economic 
and market environment, the business 
strategy and progress against the goals 
set out last year.
As we explained in the Annual Report 
last year, we delayed granting the 201 6 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards until 
December 201 6 to ensure the targets set 
were appropriately aligned to the strategic 
review being undertaken by the new team 
following Steve Rowe’s appointment 
as CEO. As the focus of the business plan 
announced in November 201 6 remains 
unchanged and the team has had less 
than one year to start to implement 
much of this, the Committee considered 
that the structure of the current 
remuneration framework continues 
to support this strategy.
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO 
REMUNERATION POLICY
Taking all of the above into account, the 
Committee has therefore decided to 
maintain the principles of the framework 
ﬁ rst introduced in 2010 and approved 
by shareholders in 201 4, but to make 
some minor amendments to incentive 
arrangements to ensure sharper and 
more relevant alignment between senior 
remuneration, the strategic direction 
of the Company, and the interests of 
our shareholders. 
The PSP will continue to be the primary 
long-term incentive plan for executives. 
We are maintaining the overall construct of 
the plan, with the typical award being 250% 
of salary. However, we will be introducing a 
two-year holding period post vesting for all 
long-term incentive awards made from 
201 7 , to ensure greater alignment of our 
leaders' remuneration with long-term 
stakeholder interests. 
Furthermore, we will be reducing the cash 
supplement in lieu of pension contributions 
for new executive director appointments. 
The new threshold will be reduced from 30% 
(for the CEO) and 25% (for all other directors) 
to a maximum of 20% for all future executive 
directors, including the CEO. Contractual 
arrangements for current executive 
directors will remain unchanged at 25%. This 
removes any policy diff erential between the 
CEO and other executive directors.
KEY ELEMENTS OF 2017/18 
REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS
The Annual Bonus Scheme will continue to 
be based on corporate ﬁ nancial targets 
(currently 70%) and individual objectives 
(currently 30%). The maximum opportunity 
will remain 200% of salary. The ﬁ nancial 
measure will continue to be Group PBT 
before adjusted items (Group PBT). The 
individual measures on page 69 highlight 
the importance of collective and customer 
focused measures to support the one 
team behaviours which have the customer 
at the heart of the business, in line with 
the business strategy.
The PSP will be maintained but will also 
now include a two-year holding period 
post vesting as previously outlined. TSR will 
be introduced as a key measure to both 
reinforce alignment of executive interests 
with shareholders, as well as being a relative 
measure of value creation. TSR will replace 
cash ﬂ ow as a measure, and the ﬁ nancial 
measures of EPS and ROCE will be retained 
as measures of proﬁ table and effi  cient 
business performance. 
Each of the three measures will have equal 
weightage; thus TSR will count for a third; 
ROCE will count for a third and up from 
the historical 20%; EPS will count for a third, 
less than the historical 50%.
As in the past, the Committee will have 
oversight into the quality of how the 
outcomes of EPS and ROCE are delivered 
Our remuneration framework is aligned with 
the strategic direction of M&S and the interests 
of our shareholders, with a clear focus on customer, 
simplicity and teamwork.

OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and will exercise discretion as necessary. 
While the Committee believes that 
introducing TSR at this stage provides an 
important measure of the success of the 
new strategy for the executive team, the 
Committee also believes that certain 
strategic and non-ﬁ nancial measures may 
become more signiﬁ cant to M&S to warrant 
consideration for PSP measurements in 
future years. 
Given the continued challenging economic 
and market environment, consumer 
concerns over Brexit, and ongoing currency 
and inﬂ ationary headwinds, the Committee 
has set the 201 7 /1 8 targets at what it 
believes would represent stretching 
business performance. For EPS and ROCE, 
targets have been increased from those 
set for the 201 6 PSP award, which were 
rebased against the new ﬁ nancial plan. 
These increased targets reﬂ ect the plans 
for the business to return to growth in the 
next three years. TSR performance will be 
measured against a bespoke group of 
comparator companies, broadly similar 
to that adopted by other companies in 
our sector. In accordance with standard 
market practice, targets for threshold 
and maximum vesting will be set at median 
and upper quartile performance of the 
Group respectively.
REMUNERATION FOR 2016/17
As referenced earlier in the Annual Report, 
since his appointment as Chief Executive, 
Steve Rowe has set out clear and decisive 
plans to accelerate the pace of change 
to return the business to growth. A huge 
amount of work has already begun to 
implement and deliver this strategy, 
including the investment in Clothing & 
Home pricing and the reshaping of both 
the UK store estate and the International 
business. While these plans have laid the 
groundwork to M&S’s long-term recovery, 
the necessary investment has meant that 
proﬁ ts delivered this year are lower than 
last year, although above consensus 
expectations. However, this was not 
unexpected and our ﬁ nancial plan for 
the year reﬂ ected this. 
The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁ ed 
that incentive payments for the executive 
directors reﬂ ect both the overall ﬁ nancial 
performance of the business and the hard 
work undertaken by the team to achieve this 
in the challenging environment. Total 
payments are around 35% of the maximum 
receivable, of both ﬁ xed and variable pay 
together, if all stretch targets had been 
achieved. This clearly demonstrates the 
philosophy of the executive directors’ 
pay arrangements in action, including 
the rigour of target setting; maximum 
payments will only be payable for 
exceptional performance.
As can been seen on page 56, there is a 
clear and demonstrable link between 
business strategy and payments for 201 6/1 7 
performance to the executive directors. 
The key business priorities are referenced on 
pages 8-1 1 of this report. Executive director 
targets were aligned with these priorities 
and achievement against the key ﬁ nancial 
priorities are shown on pages 1 8-2 1.
ANNUAL BONUS OUTTURN
As highlighted earlier, the year has been one 
of considerable change for M&S. When 
approving payments, the Committee 
considered the overall performance of 
the business and of the executive directors 
against this, as well as against their individual 
targets. Details of the bonus payments to 
each of the executive directors are outlined 
on page 68. Bonus payments ranged from 
37% to 42% of maximum opportunity. Bonus 
payments made to directors reﬂ ected the 
large proportion of collective measures for 
the year, in support of focusing on teamwork 
and simplicity within the pay arrangements.
PSP VESTING 
The PSP awards granted in 201 4 were 
measured for the three-year period up to 
1 April 201 7 against EPS, ROCE and Revenue 
targets. As the threshold targets were not 
achieved, all awards held by executive 
directors will lapse.
SALARY REVIEW
The Committee discussed the annual salary 
review for all executive directors. In line with 
the budget salary increases for the rest of 
the organisation, the Committee approved 
a 2% increase for all executive directors. 
However, as clearly disclosed in last year’s 
report the executive directors have, for the 
second year in succession, chosen to not 
accept this increase. Salaries for the 
executive directors will therefore remain 
at those levels set in July 201 5, apart from 
Steve Rowe, whose salary changed on his 
appointment to CEO in April 201 6.
BOARD CHANGES
In September 201 6, we announced that 
Laura Wade-Gery would not be returning 
to the business following her maternity 
leave. Laura’s remuneration terms, disclosed 
at the time, were in line with the key 
provisions for contract termination as per 
the shareholder approved Remuneration 
Policy. In addition, details in relation to 
outstanding remuneration for Marc Bolland 
following his departure are also provided on 
page 75.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We are grateful to shareholders, shareholder 
representative bodies, regulatory bodies 
and remuneration advisers for their 
engagement, feedback, challenge and 
view on remuneration matters over the 
past year. The Company has been actively 
involved on the subject of executive 
remuneration and stakeholder 
engagement, and earlier this year 
responded to the UK Government’s Green 
Paper on Corporate Governance Reform. 
Stakeholder engagement, including input 
from M&S's Business Involvement Groups 
are key to ensuring we continue to drive the 
transparency around our decisions relating 
to executive pay, provide clarity and quality 
of our performance targets and associated 
disclosures, and ensure the relevance of our 
long-term executive pay incentives and 
their alignment to the performance of the 
business. We are grateful for this ongoing 
dialogue. Together with the rest of the 
Board, I look forward to hearing your views 
on our remuneration arrangements and 
will be available to answer any questions 
you may have at the AGM.

37% and 42% of maximum bonus 
opportunity. This resulted in payments 
ranging from c.£459,000 to c.£600,000, 
with half of all payments being deferred

SUMMARY OF POLICY AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS
Shareholders approved the Remuneration 
Policy at the AGM in 201 4. As such, the 
Company is required to seek approval for 
the new policy at the AGM to be held on 
1 1 July 201 7 . Pages 58 to 65 provide the 
full details of the proposed policy. 
The Committee reviewed the senior 
remuneration framework during the year 
to ensure that it remains 'ﬁ t for purpose', 
providing an appropriate framework to 
fulﬁ l M&S's reward philosophy which is, in 
turn, designed to support and drive the 
business strategy . Changes proposed to the 
policy are minimal as the Committee felt 
the previously approved framework remains 
broadly appropriate. For transparency, the 
table below sets out an overview of the key 
areas of the policy.
MAIN FEATURES OF CURRENT POLICY
> Increases awarded 
are normally in line 
with those elsewhere 
in the business. 
Adjustments in 
excess of this may 
be made where the 
Committee deems 
it appropriate.
> Beneﬁ ts provided at 
a rate commensurate 
with the market and 
currently include 
a car or cash 
allowance, a driver, 
and life assurance 
plus other beneﬁ ts 
provided to all 
employees, including 
employee discount.
> Directors may 
participate in M&S's 
deﬁ ned contribution 
arrangement on the 
same terms as other 
employees, or receive 
a cash supplement 
in lieu of pension 
contributions. Cash 
alternative maximum 
is currently 25% of 
salary for other 
executive directors 
(30% for CEO).
> Maximum opportunity 
of 200% of salary.
> 50% of total bonus 
deferred into shares 
for three years.
> Measured against 
Adjusted Group PBT 
(currently 70% of 
award) and individual 
objectives.
> Clawback and malus 
provisions apply.
> Maximum award 
of 300% of salary.
> Performance 
measured against 
ﬁ nancial targets over 
a three-year period.
> Clawback and malus 
provisions apply.
> Fees reviewed 
annually.
> Comprise basic fee 
plus additional fee for 
extra responsibility of 
Board or committee 
chairman or Senior 
Independent NED.
> In addition, the 
Chairman may be 
entitled to the use 
of a car and driver.
POLICY CHANGE
> Salaries will be 
compared against 
appropriately-sized 
listed companies 
which may be outside 
of the FTSE 25-75 
detailed in the 
previous policy.
> No change. > For current executive 
directors, the 
maximum cash 
allowance will be 
limited to 25% of 
salary for all 
(including the CEO).
> For future 
appointments, the 
cash amount payable 
will be capped at 20% 
of salary for all.
> No change. > A two-year holding 
period post 
vesting will be 
introduced.
> Performance 
conditions may 
include quantiﬁ able 
non-ﬁ nancial/
strategic measures, 
with ﬁ nancial 
measures comprising 
at least 50% of awards.
> Fees will be 
compared against 
appropriately-
sized companies 
which may be outside 
of the FTSE 25-75 
detailed in the 
previous policy.

ELEMENT
PURPOSE 
AND LINK TO 
STRATEGY
This report sets out the Company’s policy 
on remuneration for executive and 
non-executive directors, to be approved 
by shareholders at the AGM on 1 1 July 20 1 7 , 
from which date the policy will apply . The 
policy remains largely unchanged from 
that approved by shareholders in 20 1 4; 
for transparency, where amendments 
have been made these are highlighted. 
Once approved, this policy may operate 
for up to three years.
As previously, the Committee has built in a 
degree of ﬂexibility to ensure the practical 
application of the policy over this period. 
Where such discretion is reserved, the extent 
to which it may be applied is described.
The Company’s policy remains to attract, 
retain and motivate its leaders and ensure 
they are focused on delivering business 
priorities within a framework designed to 
promote the long-term success of M&S, 
aligned with shareholder interests.
Further information regarding the 
implementation of the previous remuneration 
policy is set out on pages 66 to 77 .
OPERATION > Payable in cash.
> Reviewed annually by the 
Committee considering a number 
of factors, including:
–  Salary increases awarded to other 
employees in the wider workforce 
which are typically reviewed 
annually on a similar basis; and
–  Comparable salaries in 
appropriate comparator groups.
> Salaries reﬂect the experience, 
responsibility and contribution of the 
individual and role within the Group.
CHANGE FOR 2017
> Appropriate comparator groups 
may include major retailers and 
similarly-sized listed companies 
which may be ranked outside of 
the FTSE 25-75.
> Directors are eligible to receive 
beneﬁts in line with our policies 
which may include:
–   A car or cash allowance;
–  A driver; and
–  Life assurance.
> Where appropriate, our Global/
Domestic Mobility Policy may apply. 
This may include, but not be limited 
to, travel, relocation and tax 
equalisation allowances.
> Directors are off ered a number of 
other beneﬁts in line with all other 
employees, such as employee 
discount and salary sacriﬁce 
schemes such as Cycle2Work.
> Directors may participate in a Save 
As You Earn Scheme and a Share 
Incentive Plan and any other 
all-employee share schemes on the 
same terms as other employees.
MAXIMUM 
OPPORTUNITY
> While there is no set maximum, 
any increases are normally in line 
with those in the wider workforce.
> Individual adjustments in excess 
of this may be made outside of this 
cycle at the discretion of the 
Committee, where appropriate. 
Such circumstances can include:
–  Where the role scope has changed;
–  Where comparable salaries in the 
external market have changed; or
–  To apply salary progression for 
newly appointed directors.
> While there is no set maximum, any 
beneﬁ ts will be provided at a rate 
commensurate with the market.
> Maximum participation in 
all-employee share schemes is 
in line with local statutory limits.

KEY CHANGES TO THE POLICY
> To further support 
shareholder alignment, a 
two-year holding period 
post vesting will apply to 
any awards granted to 
executive directors after 
the 20 1 7 AGM. 
> Performance conditions 
may now include 
quantiﬁ able non-ﬁ nancial 
or strategic measures. 
Previously, performance 
conditions were limited to 
ﬁ nancial measures only. 
This change will ensure 
strategic alignment of 
the PSP .
> Maximum cash 
payments will be limited 
to 25% for all current 
executive directors and 
to 20% for all future 
executive directors. This 
reduction better reﬂ ects 
pension arrangements 
in the wider workforce.
> Base salaries will be 
compared against major 
retailers and 
appropriately-sized 
listed companies which 
may be outside of those 
ranked FTSE 25-75. 
Previously, the peer 
group comprised FTSE 
25-75 ranked companies.

MAXIMUM 
OPPORTUNITY
PERFORMANCE 
CONDITIONS OPERATION
The Committee reserves the right to 
make any remuneration payments 
notwithstanding that they are not in line 
with the Policy set out above, where the 
terms of the payment were agreed at 
a time when the relevant individual was 
not a director of the Company and, in the 
opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration of the individual 
becoming a director of the Company.
For these purposes, payments include the 
Committee satisfying awards of variable 
remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are 
agreed at the time the award is granted.
Awards granted under the PSP , DSBP , and 
RSP can be made in the form of conditional 
share awards, forfeitable shares, options 
or rights with the same economic eff ect. 
In addition, awards may be settled in cash. 
Awards may incorporate the right to receive 
(in cash and shares) the value of dividends, 
including any dividend tax credit where 
applicable, between grant and vesting on 
the shares that vest. This amount may be 
calculated on a cumulative basis, assuming 
the reinvestment of dividends into shares. 
In the event of a variation of the Company's 
share capital or a demerger, special dividend 
or other event which in the Committee's 
opinion may aff ect the price of shares, the 
Committee may alter the terms of awards 
and the number of shares subject to them. 
The terms of awards may be amended in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules 
(which were approved by shareholders 
on 7 July 201 5).
Any performance conditions applicable 
to PSP and ESOS awards may be amended 
by the Committee if an event occurs 
which causes it to consider that the 
performance condition would not achieve 
its original purpose and the amended 
performance condition is, in the opinion 
of the Committee, no less diffi  cult to 
satisfy but for the event in question.
CLAWBACK AND MALUS
M&S is committed to ensuring its 
remuneration arrangements motivate 
participants to strive for exceptional 
performance while also protecting 
shareholder value from the Company 
taking unnecessary risks. As such, clawback 
and malus provisions apply to the executive 
directors’ incentive arrangements. All share 
awards granted from 201 3 onwards are 
subject to malus provisions. These provisions 
allow the Committee, in its absolute 
discretion, to determine at any time prior 
to the vesting of an award to reduce the 
number of shares, cancel an award or 
impose further conditions on an award in 
circumstances for which the Committee 
considers such action to be appropriate. 
Such circumstances may include, but not 
be limited to, a material misstatement of 
the Company’s audited results.
In addition, clawback provisions were 
introduced in 201 5 and apply to cash 
payments made under the Annual Bonus 
Scheme. Awards made under any of the 
Company’s other executive share schemes 
(including the Performance Share Plan) in 
201 5 and onwards will similarly be subject to 
clawback provisions. These provisions 
enable the Committee, in its absolute 
discretion, to reclaim awards paid to 
individuals for up to three years after the 
respective vesting or payment date (or up 
to two years in the case of PSP awards) 
where speciﬁ ed events occur. The speciﬁ ed 
events include gross misconduct or where 
a material misstatement of the Company’s 
ﬁ nancial statements has occurred. 
Clawback may be eff ected, among other 
means, by requiring the transfer of shares, 
payment of cash or reduction of awards. 61

OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AND 
TARGET SETTING
The Committee reviews annually the 
measures, weightings and targets for the 
incentive arrangements for the executive 
directors. In doing so, the Committee 
considers a number of factors which assist 
in forming a view. These include, but are not 
limited to, the strategic priorities for M&S 
over the short- to long-term, shareholder 
feedback, the risk proﬁ le of the business 
and the macro-economic climate.
The Annual Bonus Scheme is measured 
against a balance of proﬁ tability and 
the delivery of key strategic areas of 
importance for the business. The 
proﬁ tability measure used is Group PBT 
before adjusted items as this is used 
internally to report and assess business 
performance by the Board and Operating 
Committee. Refer to the glossary on pages 
1 33 to 1 34 for the deﬁ nition of Group PBT 
before adjusted items, and to Note 1 of the 
ﬁ nancial statements for a description of 
adjusted items.
The PSP is assessed against a balance of 
measures identiﬁ ed as those most relevant 
to driving both sustainable top-line and 
bottom-line business performance, as 
well as providing value for shareholders. 
This is reﬂ ected in the EPS and ROCE 
measures which focus on a balance of 
proﬁ tability, cost control and the effi  cient 
use of capital investment.
For 201 7 /1 8, relative TSR will be introduced 
to ensure focus on the value delivered to 
shareholders. This is measured against a 
bespoke group of retail companies which 
are believed to provide a balanced portfolio 
of those most likely to be alternative 
investment choices for M&S shareholders. 
Targets are set against the respective annual 
and long-term operating plans taking into 
account analysts’ forecasts, M&S’s strategic 
plans, prior year performance, estimated 
vesting levels and the aff ordability of pay 
arrangements. Targets are set to provide 
a sustainable balance of risk and reward 
to ensure that, while being motivational 
for participants, maximum payments are 
only made for exceptional performance.
REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK FOR 
THE REST OF THE ORGANISATION
M&S’s philosophy is to provide a fair and 
consistent approach to pay. Remuneration 
is determined by level and is broadly aligned 
with those of the executive directors. 
Base salaries are reviewed annually and 
reﬂ ect the local labour market.
All UK employees are eligible to participate 
in the Your M&S Pension Saving Plan on 
the same terms as the executive directors. 
In addition, all UK employees are provided 
with life insurance and employee discount, 
and may choose to participate in the 
Company’s all-employee share schemes 
and salary sacriﬁ ce arrangements.
All employees are eligible to be considered 
to participate in an annual bonus scheme 
which for the majority will be a cash-based 
payment partially determined by Group 
PBT performance. For M&S’s most senior 
executives, part of the bonus is deferred 
into shares for three years.
Around the top 1 20 of M&S’s senior 
executives may be invited to participate 
in the PSP , measured against the same 
performance conditions as executive 
directors. Award levels granted are 
determined to be aligned with market 
practice and reﬂ ect an individual’s level 
of seniority as well as their performance 
and potential within the business.
CONSIDERATION OF WIDER 
WORKFORCE PAY
The Committee monitors and reviews the 
eff ectiveness of the senior remuneration 
policy and has regard to its impact and 
compatibility with remuneration policies 
in the wider workforce.
The Committee is provided throughout 
the year with information detailing pay in 
the wider workforce which gives additional 
context for the Committee to make 
informed decisions. The HR Director advises 
the Committee of the approach which will 
be adopted with the forthcoming UK pay 
review and the Committee then considers 
the executive directors’ pay in line with 
these arrangements.
The HR Director consults on all executive 
director bonus objectives and advises the 
Committee on how, and the extent to which, 
these may be cascaded throughout the 
Company. In approving the budget for the 
annual bonus, the Committee reviews all 
bonus costs for the Company against the 
operating plan. The Committee also reviews 
and approves any PSP awards made to 
executive directors and directors below 
the Board prior to their grant.
The Committee also receives updates on a 
variety of employee engagement initiatives 
which form part of our normal employee 
engagement practices. Employees were not 
consulted on the development of the policy. 
The annual ‘Your Say’ employee survey 
asks employees about the fairness and 
reasonableness of employee pay and 
beneﬁts. Any comments made through 
this survey or through our network of 
elected employee representatives via 
our Business Involvement Groups are 
considered. The Head of Performance & 
Reward annually provides these employee 
representatives with an explanation of the 
Company’s reward principles and director 
pay arrangements during the year, and is 
available to answer questions at this time.
CONSIDERATION OF 
SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Committee is committed to an 
open and transparent dialogue with its 
shareholders on the issue of executive 
remuneration. Where appropriate, 
the Committee will actively engage 
with shareholders and shareholder 
representative bodies, seeking views 
which may be considered when making 
any decisions about changes to the 
directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The Committee seeks the views of the 
largest shareholders individually and 
others through shareholder representative 
bodies when considering making any 
signiﬁcant changes to the Remuneration 
Policy; this may be done annually or on an 
ad hoc basis, dependent upon the issue. 
The Committee annually engages in a 
process of investor consultation, which 
is typically in written format, but may 
be through face-to-face meetings etc., 
if considered useful. The Committee 
Chairman is available to answer questions 
at the AGM and the answers to speciﬁc 
questions are posted on our website.
As part of our socially responsible reporting 
strategy, an annual shareholder meeting is 
normally held and the consideration of 
views on a variety of topics, including 
executive pay, is taken into account.

SERVICE CONTRACTS 
It is the Company’s policy that all executive directors have rolling service contracts that can be terminated by the Company giving 
1 2 months’ notice and the employee giving six months’ notice. The directors’ service contracts are available for shareholder inspection 
at the Company’s registered ofﬁce. 63
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017
OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
TERMINATION POLICY
The Company may terminate the contract 
of any executive director summarily in 
accordance with the terms of their service 
agreement, on payment in lieu of notice of 
a sum equal to salary, beneﬁts and pension 
as per their contractual notice entitlement 
(see page 75). 
The Company can make a series of phased 
payments which are paid in monthly 
instalments, subject to mitigation. This 
mechanism allows for the amount of any 
phased payments to be reduced by the 
income from any alternative position 
secured by the former director during 
the phased payments period.
Service agreements may be terminated 
without notice and without any payments 
in certain circumstances, such as gross 
misconduct. The Company may require the 
individual to work during their notice period, 
or may choose to place the individual on 
garden leave. Such a decision would be 
made to ensure the protection of the 
Company’s and shareholders’ interests 
where the individual has had access to 
commercially sensitive information.
The table below sets out key provisions 
for directors leaving the Company under 
their service contracts and the incentive 
plan rules.
The Company’s policy towards exit payments 
allows for a variety of circumstances 
whereby a director may leave the business. 
In some cases, where deemed suitable, the 
Committee reserves the right to determine 
exit payments, where the director leaves by 
mutual agreement. In all circumstances, 
the Committee does not intend to ‘reward 
failure’ and will make decisions based on the 
individual circumstances. The Committee’s 
objective is that any such agreements are 
determined on an individual basis and are 
in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders at that time, and reﬂect the 
director’s contractual and other legal rights.
CORPORATE EVENTS
In the event of a change of control or 
winding-up of the Company, unvested share 
awards will normally vest on the date that 
the Board notiﬁes participants of such an 
event. The number of shares which may 
vest under awards in these circumstances 
will be subject to any relevant performance 
conditions and, in the case of PSP awards, 
unless the Committee determines 
otherwise, time pro-rating.
In the event of a demerger, special dividend 
or other event which, in the opinion of the 
Committee aff ects the price of shares, 
the Committee may allow some or all of 
an award to vest.

> Payment will be made up to the termination date in line with relevant contractual notice periods.

service at either the relevant year end or on the date of payment, there will be no entitlement to any bonus payment, either in cash 
or shares. The Committee may use its discretion as described below to make a bonus award, which is normally pro-rated for time 
worked during the relevant ﬁ nancial year and based on performance assessed at the end of the bonus period.
> Where a director ceases to be an ofﬁcer or employee of the Group before the end of the relevant vesting period, the treatment 
of outstanding awards is determined in accordance with the plan rules.
> In some circumstances, where a director leaves due to retirement, injury, ill-health, death or the sale of the director’s employing 
company or business out of the Group, or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee and in accordance with the plan rules, 
DSBP awards normally vest in full on cessation; PSP and ESOS awards which have been held for at least 1 2 months normally vest 
when the level of performance has been assessed and agreed at the end of the three-year performance period. The Committee 
may determine these awards vest upon cessation as permitted in the plan rules. In either circumstance, any relevant performance 
conditions would still apply to the PSP and ESOS awards and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, would be time pro-rated 
and subject to the two-year holding period post vesting.
> Where a director has been recruited either to the Company or the Board from overseas, the Company may pay for repatriation.
> The Company may reimburse for reasonable legal fees in the event a director leaves by mutual consent. It may also pay for 
professional outplacement services in these circumstances.

MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
The Remuneration Committee annually 
reviews the senior remuneration framework 
and considers whether the existing incentive 
arrangements remain appropriately 
challenging in the context of the business 
strategy, current external guidelines and 
a range of internal factors including the pay 
arrangements and policies throughout the 
rest of the organisation. In its discussions, 
the Remuneration Committee aims to 
ensure that not only is the framework 
strategically aligned to the delivery of 
business priorities, but also that payments 
made during the year fairly reﬂ ect the 
performance of the business. As illustrated 
on page 56, a signiﬁ cant proportion of the 
performance measures used in the incentive 
schemes are integrated with M&S’s business 
objectives and key performance indicators 
detailed on pages 1 8 to 2 1. 
The diagram below illustrates the extent 
to which each executive director achieved 
the maximum opportunity under the 
Company’s incentive schemes as a result 
of short- and long-term performance to 
the end of the reported ﬁ nancial year 
and summarises the main elements of 
the senior remuneration framework. 
Further details of payments made during 
the year are set out in the single ﬁ gure

SALARY (audited)
When reviewing salary levels, the 
Committee takes into account a number 
of internal and external factors, including 
Company performance during the year, 
external market data and the salary 
review principles applied to the rest 
of the organisation, to ensure a 
consistent approach.
As reported in last year’s report, all 
executive directors were awarded a 
salary increase of 2% for July 201 6 but, 
in support of the proposed new pay 
arrangements being made elsewhere in 
the UK organisation, they chose to decline 
this increase. Further, they also indicated 
that should an increase be awarded for 
July 201 7 , they would be similarly minded 
to decline that increase. 
The Committee noted this intention but 
for completeness, discussed the executive 
directors’ annual salary review during the 
year. All executive directors were eligible to 
be considered for a review and after taking 
into account several factors including the 
average increases to be awarded to the 
wider UK workforce, the Committee 
approved a 2% pay increase. 
All executive directors have again this year 
declined their respective pay increases. 
Their next annual review will be eff ective 
in July 201 8.
The table below details the executive 
directors’ salaries as at 1 April 201 7 
and salaries which will take eff ect

calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the current Transfer Value 
Regulations. The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of the 
assets that the pension scheme would transfer to another pension provider on transferring 
the scheme’s liability in respect of a director’s pension beneﬁ ts. It does not represent sums 
payable to a director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 2016/17 
(audited)
Annual performance for 201 6/1 7 was 
measured against Group PBT (70% of 
awards) and individual performance (30% of 
awards). Group PBT is used in the bonus as 
the Group considers this to be an important 
measure of Group performance and 
is consistent with how the business 
performance is assessed internally by 
the Board and Operating Committee.
Individual performance was measured 
against both collective corporate 
performance and performance aligned 
with the individual’s speciﬁ c areas of 
responsibility. Individual performance 
measures for the year were aligned with the 
key strategic business priorities identiﬁ ed at 
the start of the year. Figure 1 3 provides an 
overview of the key achievements against 
each executive director’s accountabilities 
over the period.
Group PBT outturn for the year was £6 1 3.8m 
which was above the targets set to trigger 
payments under both the corporate and 
individual elements of the Scheme. 
As shown in Figure 1 4 below, this meant 
that executive directors were awarded 
27 .9% of maximum opportunity under the 
corporate element of the Scheme and on 
average c.70% of maximum for individual 
performance.
The Committee reviewed achievement 
to ensure that total payments were 
appropriate in the context of several factors. 
These included M&S’s overall ﬁ nancial 
performance, the outturn of individual 
objectives, the level of bonus payable 
elsewhere in the business, and success 
towards Plan A targets and M&S values 
which underpinned the entire Scheme 
again during the year. 
 See Plan A Report for more detail
The Committee was satisﬁ ed that each 
director continued to ensure that the 
delivery of Plan A commitments and the 
behavioural ways of working supported 
the delivery of the business priorities. 
As such, the Committee determined that 
no adjustments were required against the 
underpin and that the ﬁ nal payments 
calculated were appropriate.
The Committee ensures that targets set 
are the relevant drivers of required annual 
performance. Consequently, some of the 
201 6/1 7 targets are too commercially 
sensitive to disclose as they are not 
disclosed elsewhere in the report. 
M&S remains committed to transparent 
reporting within the context of operating 
in a highly competitive market. The 
Committee will continue to assess the 
commercial sensitivity of targets with the 
aim of disclosing wherever possible, while 
ensuring that any measures set are those 
most appropriate to grow the business.
Figure 1 4 below sets out the Group PBT 
targets comprising 70% of awards and 
illustrates the extent to which each director 
achieved their three individual objectives. 
Total payments shown below directly 
correspond to the ﬁ gure included in the 
single ﬁ gure table on page 66 .

Customer satisfaction over 
the year improved. Net 
Promoter Score (NPS), which 
was the measure for this 
element of bonus, increased 
four points for Food and for 
Clothing & Home remained 
level, although improved 
amongst frequent customers 
and in larger stores. This led 
to a payment against this 
measure of 7 .5%.
Action taken this year to 
simplify the business included 
the successful organisation 
transformation and restructure 
of Head Offi  ce. Role reductions 
were made and there was no 
overall impact on engagement 
scores for this population. 
Employee engagement within 
the total business increased 
to 81%. As a result of this 
performance, including above 
target restructure cost savings, 
maximum payment was made 
under this measure (10%).
Performance impacted by reduction in 
promotional and markdown activity leading to 
below target UK LFL Clothing & Home revenue 
growth of -3.4%. As a result, no payment was 
made against this element.

DEFERRED SHARE BONUS PLAN

Currently 50% of any bonus payment 
is compulsorily deferred into nil-cost 
options/conditional shares. These awards 
vest after three years subject to continued 
employment as well as malus provisions. 
The table opposite provides details of share

As reported at the time, Laura Wade-Gery's 
award vested in full on the date she left

ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME FOR 2017/18
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
the 201 7 /1 8 Scheme, considering the drive 
to continue the new strategic way forward 
for M&S to grow the business. It determined 
that the structure of the 201 6/1 7 Scheme 
remained appropriate and only minor 
amendments were necessary to ensure 
alignment with the delivery of the business 
priorities. The 201 7 /1 8 Scheme is designed 
to continue to focus on putting the 
customer at the heart of the business 
and driving the proﬁ table growth of M&S 
while supporting the one team strategy, 
as has been described to stakeholders.
Performance will again be partially 
measured against collective corporate 
performance as well as performance in 
the individual’s speciﬁ c business area. As in 
previous years, individual performance will 
continue to be measured independently of 
Group PBT performance. However, to 
maintain the important principle that below 
a deﬁ ned level of ﬁ nancial performance no 
bonus will be earned, no individual element 
can be earned unless a ‘threshold’ level of 
Group PBT has been achieved.
As shown below, 70% of awards will once 
again be measured against Group PBT 
under the corporate element. The remaining 
30% of the bonus will be measured against 
individual objectives and will be a mixture of 
collective objectives and measures bespoke 
to each director. The individual element of 
the Scheme will comprise three equally 
weighted objectives identiﬁ ed as those key 
priorities required to support the delivery of 
the strategy. These will focus on LFL sales 
growth improvement, delivering ﬁ nancial 
effi  ciencies, enhancing our customer 
experience and satisfaction and building on 
the beneﬁ ts of the customer loyalty Sparks 
programme and our Plan A initiatives.
The bonus performance targets for 201 7 /1 8 
are deemed by the Board to be too 
commercially sensitive to disclose at 
this time but, where possible, will be 
disclosed in next year’s report.
The Committee will continue to judge 
overall performance against our ecological, 
ethical and behavioural achievements to 
ensure consistency with M&S’s values and 
behaviours. Success towards Plan A targets 
and the M&S values, which all employees 
including executive directors are required 
to uphold, will underpin the entire Scheme. 
The Committee, in its absolute discretion, 
may use its judgement to adjust overall 
ﬁ nal payments accordingly. Where any 
adjustments are made, these will be fully 
disclosed in next year's report.

MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
The Committee believes that long-term 
share awards reward executives for the 
delivery of long-term business goals and 
so makes annual awards under the PSP to 
incentivise executive directors and M&S's 
most senior managers. 
PSP AWARDS MADE IN 2016/17 (audited)
As was disclosed last year, PSP awards made 
for 201 6/1 7 were granted in December 201 6 
shortly after the announcement of the 
Interim results. This was to ensure that 
the measures and targets were aligned 
to the long-term strategic business plan 
developed by Steve Rowe and his leadership 
team. As we communicated to shareholders 
during this period of review, the strategy to 
create a simpler, more sustainable business, 
with the customer at its heart, and operating 
as one team will require several actions. 
These actions will lead to reduced proﬁ ts in 
the short term but will deliver a stronger, 
more sustainable business in the longer 
term. These include an investment in pricing 
in the Clothing & Home business to ensure 
market competitiveness, reshaping the 
UK store estate and restructuring the 
International business. The revised ﬁ nancial 
plan also took account of the signiﬁ cant 
currency impact which has arisen since the 
EU Referendum, which will adversely impact 
proﬁ ts. In approving targets, the Committee 
also considered the consensus forecasts for 
the three ﬁ nancial years over which the Plan 
would operate.
As shown in Figure 1 7 below, performance 
for these awards is measured against EPS, 
ROCE and cumulative free cash ﬂ ow. 
Each performance condition is measured 
independently over the three-year period. 
The balance of measures has been 
designed to drive the proﬁ table, effi  cient 
growth of M&S while also focusing on 
providing returns to shareholders. 
The Committee believes that the targets 
set for the 201 6/1 7 PSP award are very 
stretching in the current environment and 
achievement of these levels of performance 
in 201 8/1 9 would drive substantial value for 
shareholders. The changes made are felt 
necessary to provide suffi  cient realignment 
with the new strategic ﬁ nancial plan to 
ensure the PSP supports and drives the 
desired business performance. Consistent 
with previous years, for achievement of 
threshold performance, 20% of the relevant 
portion of the award will vest increasing 
to 100% on a straight-line basis between 
the achievement of threshold and 
maximum performance.

Figure 1 8 below summarises the award made to each of the executive directors in December 201 6. The maximum award permitted under 
the Plan is 300% of salary although the Committee typically makes awards of 250% of salary to executive directors. For 201 6/1 7 , awards of 
225% of salary were awarded to all executive directors. In approving this award level, the Committee noted that award levels for executives 
have typically been 250% of salary. Upon discussion, the Committee decided that, in recognition of the rebased ﬁ nancial plan and 
associated PSP performance measures, lower awards were appropriate for this particular grant only.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, awards to executive directors will vest on 5 December 201 9, three years after the date of grant, to the 
extent that the performance conditions are met.

When calculating the face value of awards to be granted, the number of nil-cost options/conditional shares awarded is multiplied by the 
average mid-market share price on the ﬁ ve dealing days prior to the date of grant. For this year, the share price was calculated as £3.28, 
being the average share price between 28 November 201 6 and 2 December 201 6.

PSP AWARDS TO BE MADE IN 2017/18 
During the year, the Committee reviewed 
the long-term incentive framework at 
M&S, assessing the extent to which it 
remained appropriate.
As part of these discussions, the Committee 
deliberated on a number of possible 
structures including those outlined in the 
Investment Association's Executive 
Remuneration Working Group report. After 
extensive consideration, it was decided that 
the current structural arrangements remain 
those most appropriate to support the 
delivery of the necessary development 
and performance in M&S. That said, the 
Committee determined that during this 
period, the business must continue to 
ensure a focus on returns to shareholders. 
As such, relative Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) will for this year form one-third of PSP 
awards, although the Committee believes 
that, in future years, other strategic or 
non-ﬁ nancial measures may be more 
appropriate and will consider this for 
future grants.
Relative TSR will be measured against a 
bespoke group of 1 5 companies taken from 
the FTSE 350 General and Food & Drug 
Retailers indices and are believed to be 
appropriately aligned to M&S’s business 
operations to reﬂ ect the value of 
shareholder investment in M&S over the 
performance period (see Figure 22 for 
details of these companies).
The remainder of the award will be 
measured equally against EPS and ROCE. 
The balance of measures has been designed 
to ensure an appropriate focus on all three 
performance metrics.
As noted on the previous page, recognising 
last year's rebased ﬁ nancial plan and 
associated PSP performance targets, the 
Remuneration Committee reduced the 
201 6/201 7 awards to 225% of salary from 
the typical level of 250%. However, the 
Committee is mindful of the need to 
strongly incentivise the CEO and 
management team to deliver the agreed 
strategy. In light of this, and given that EPS 
targets are returning to a growth trajectory, 
the Committee has determined that awards 
in 201 7 should revert to the previous normal 
level of 250% of salary. 
Performance will be measured as shown in 
Figure 21 below, with 20% of awards vesting 
for threshold performance and 100% for 
maximum. In line with the new policy, 
awards will vest three years after the date 
of grant, and must then be held for a further 
two years.

FIGURE 24: SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENTS (audited)
All executive directors are required to hold shares equivalent in value to a minimum percentage of their salary within a ﬁve-year period from 
their appointment date. For the CEO, this requirement is 250% of salary and for other executive directors the requirement is 1 50% of salary. 
Similar guidelines of 100% of salary also apply to directors below board level.
The chart below shows the extent to which each executive director has met their target shareholding as at 1 April 201 7 . For Steve Rowe, 
his 250% shareholding requirement is measured from the date he was appointed CEO.
For the purposes of the requirements, the net number of unvested share awards not subject to performance conditions is included and is 
reﬂ ected in the chart below. The Committee is satisﬁ ed that the current level of shareholding requirement provides an appropriate level of 
investment in M&S for each director. The Committee will continue to keep this issue under review and will amend accordingly if necessary.

REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CONTINUED
COMMITTEE ADVISERS
In carrying out its responsibilities, the 
Committee is independently advised by 
external advisers. The Committee was 
advised by PwC during the year. PwC is 
a founding member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and voluntarily operates 
under the code of conduct in relation to 
executive remuneration consulting in the 
UK. The code of conduct can be found at 
remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
The Committee has not explicitly 
considered the independence of the advice 
it receives, although it regularly reﬂ ects 
on the quality and objectivity of this advice. 
The Committee is satisﬁ ed that any conﬂ icts 
are appropriately managed. 
PwC was appointed by the Committee as 
its independent advisers in 201 4 following 
a rigorous and competitive tender process. 
PwC provides independent commentary 
on matters under consideration by the 
Committee and updates on legislative 
requirements, best practice and market 
practice. PwC’s fees are typically charged on 
an hourly basis with costs for work agreed 
in advance. During the year, PwC charged 
£1 1 6,200 for Remuneration Committee 
matters. This is based on an agreed fee for 
business as usual support with additional 
work charged at hourly rates. PwC has 
provided tax, consultancy and risk 
consulting services to the Group in the 
ﬁ nancial year.
The Committee also seeks internal 
support from the CEO, Group Secretary, 
HR Director and Head of Performance & 
Reward as necessary. All may attend the 
Committee meetings by invitation but are 
not present for any discussions that relate 
directly to their own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews external survey 
and bespoke benchmarking data including 
that published by New Bridge Street (the 
trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited), 
KPMG, PwC and Willis Towers Watson.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The Committee is committed to ensuring 
that executive pay remains competitive, 
appropriate and fair in the context of the 
external market, Company performance 
and the pay arrangements of the wider 
workforce. In collaboration with the 
Head of Performance & Reward, the 
Committee gives employees, through 
employee representatives, the opportunity 
to raise questions or concerns regarding the 
remuneration of the executive directors. 
During the year, employee representatives 
were given the opportunity to discuss in 
detail the directors’ pay arrangements. 
Details of the directors’ pay arrangements 
were discussed in the context of the 
reward framework for the rest of the 
organisation and external factors; 
no concerns were raised. 
SHAREHOLDER CONSULTATION
The Committee is committed to a 
continuous, open and transparent 
dialogue with shareholders on the issue of 
executive remuneration. The Committee 
was represented at the Company’s annual 
Governance Event, held in June 201 6, at 
which major institutional investors and 
representative bodies were provided with 
the opportunity to review and debate 
remuneration with the Committee 
Chairman, Vindi Banga. 
SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT FOR 
THE 2015/16 DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
At the Annual General Meeting on 
1 2 July 201 6, 98.02% of shareholders 
voted in favour of approving the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 201 5/1 6. The 
Committee believes this illustrates the 
strong level of shareholder support for 
the senior remuneration framework.

The appointment and replacement of 
directors is governed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association (the "Articles"), the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the "Code"), 
the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislation. The Articles may be amended by 
a special resolution of the shareholders. 
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act 
2006 and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company 
will be managed by the Board who may 
exercise all the powers of the Company. 
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, 
declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the Board. 
Subject to the Companies Act 2006, the 
Board may pay interim dividends and 
also any ﬁ xed rate dividend, whenever the 
ﬁ nancial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justiﬁ es its payment.
The directors may from time to time 
appoint one or more directors. The Board 
may appoint any person to be a director 
(so long as the total number of directors 
does not exceed the limit prescribed in 
the Articles). Under the Articles, any such 
director shall hold offi  ce only until the 
next AGM and shall then be eligible for 
election. The current Articles also require 
that at each AGM at least one-third of the 
current directors should retire as directors 
by rotation; all those directors who have 
been in offi  ce at the time of the two previous 
AGMs and who did not retire at either of 
them must retire. In addition, a director may 
at any AGM retire from offi  ce and stand for 
re-election. However, in line with the Code 
and the Company's current practice, the 
proposed new Articles will require all 
directors to stand for annual election 
(see resolution 24). All current directors will 
stand for re-election at the 201 7 AGM.
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company has procedures in place for 
managing conﬂ icts of interest. Should a 
director become aware that they, or any 
of their connected parties, have an interest 
in an existing or proposed transaction 
with Marks & Spencer, they should notify 
the Board in writing or at the next Board 
meeting. Internal controls are in place to 
ensure that any related party transactions 
involving directors, or their connected 
parties, are conducted on an arm’s length 
basis. Directors have a continuing duty to 
update any changes to these conﬂ icts.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITIES 
The Company maintains directors’ and 
offi  cers’ liability insurance which gives 
appropriate cover for legal action brought 
against its directors. The Company has also 
granted indemnities to each of its directors 
and the Group Secretary to the extent 
permitted by law. Qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions (as deﬁ ned by Section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in 
force during the year ended 1 April 201 7 
and remain in force in relation to certain 
losses and liabilities which the directors 
(or Group Secretary) may incur to third 
parties in the course of acting as directors 
or Group Secretary or employees of the 
Company or of any associated company. 
OTHER 
DISCLOSURES 80
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHING 
TO SHARES
Subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006, any resolution passed by the 
Company under the Companies Act 2006 
and other shareholders’ rights, shares may 
be issued with such rights and restrictions 
as the Company may by ordinary resolution 
decide, or (if there is no such resolution 
or so far as it does not make speciﬁ c 
provision) as the Board (as deﬁ ned in 
the Articles) may decide. Subject to the 
Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and 
other shareholders’ rights, unissued 
shares are at the disposal of the Board.
POWERS FOR THE COMPANY ISSUING 
OR BUYING BACK ITS OWN SHARES
The Company was authorised by 
shareholders at the 201 6 AGM to purchase 
in the market up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, as permitted under 
the Company’s Articles. No shares were 
bought back under this authority during the 
year ended 1 April 201 7 .
This standard authority is renewable 
annually; the directors will seek to renew 
this authority at the 201 7 AGM. It is the 
Company’s present intention to cancel 
any shares it buys back, rather than hold 
them in treasury. 
The directors were granted authority at the 
201 6 AGM to allot relevant securities up 
to a nominal amount of £1 35,3 1 3,863. This 
authority will apply until the conclusion 
of the 201 7 AGM. At this year’s AGM, 
shareholders will be asked to grant an 
authority to allot relevant securities 
(i) up to a nominal amount of £1 35,394,1 36 
and (ii) comprising equity securities up to 
a nominal amount of £270,788,271 (after 
deducting from such limit any relevant 
securities allotted under (i)), in connection 
with an off er of a rights issue (the Section 
55 1 amount), such Section 55 1 amount to 
apply until the conclusion of the AGM to be 
held in 2018 or, if earlier, on 1 October 2018.
A special resolution will also be proposed 
to renew the directors’ powers to make 
non pre-emptive issues for cash in 
connection with rights issues and otherwise 
up to a nominal amount of £20,309,1 20. 
A special resolution will also be proposed 
to renew the directors’ authority to 
repurchase the Company’s ordinary shares 
in the market. The authority will be limited 
to a maximum of 1 62 million ordinary shares 
and sets the minimum and maximum prices 
which will be paid. 
DEADLINES FOR EXERCISING 
VOTING RIGHTS
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting 
of the Company in respect of which the 
business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, 
or, in relation to corporate members, by 
corporate representatives. The Articles 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy 
forms of not less than 48 hours before the 
time appointed for the holding of the 
meeting or adjourned meeting. However, 
when calculating the 48-hour period, 
the directors can, and have, decided not 
to take account of any part of a day that is 
not a working day.
Qualifying pension scheme indemnity 
provisions (as deﬁ ned by Section 235 of the 
Companies Act 2006) were in force during 
the course of the ﬁ nancial year ended 1 April 
201 7 for the beneﬁ t of the Trustees of the 
Marks & Spencer Pension Scheme, both 
in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. 
PROFIT AND DIVIDENDS
The proﬁ t for the ﬁ nancial year, after

year's AGM, the ﬁ nal ordinary dividend 
will be paid on 1 4 July 201 7 to shareholders 
whose names were on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on 
2 June 201 7 .
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital as at 1 April 201 7 comprised a single 
class of ordinary share. Each share carries 
the right to one vote at general meetings 
of the Company.
During the period, 1,763,039 ordinary shares 
in the Company were issued under the 
terms of the United Kingdom Employees’ 
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme

RESTRICTIONS ON 
TRANSFER OF SECURITIES
There are no speciﬁ c restrictions on the 
transfer of securities in the Company, which 
is governed by its Articles of Association 
and prevailing legislation. The Company 
is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or that may result in restrictions on 
voting rights. 
VARIATION OF RIGHTS
Subject to applicable statutes, rights 
attached to any class of share may be varied 
with the written consent of the holders of at 
least three-quarters in nominal value of the 
issued shares of that class, or by a special 
resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the shareholders.

by the Company on 30 November 2009, 
the £300m Medium Term Notes issued 
by the Company on 6 December 201 1, 
the £400m Medium Term Notes issued by 
the Company on 1 2 December 201 2 and 
the £300m Medium Term Notes issued by 
the Company on 8 December 201 6 to 
various institutions (MTN) and under the 
Group’s £3bn euro Medium Term Note 
(EMTN) programme contain 
an option such that, upon a change of 
control event, combined with a credit 
ratings downgrade to below sub-
investment level, any holder of 
an MTN may require the Company to 
prepay the principal amount of that MTN.
> The $500m US Notes issued by the 
Company to various institutions on 
6 December 2007 under Section 1 44a 
of the US Securities Act contain an option 
such that, upon a change of control 
event, combined with a credit ratings 
downgrade to below sub-investment 
level, any holder of such a US Note may 
require the Company to prepay the 
principal amount of that US Note.
> The $300m US Notes issued by the 
Company to various institutions on 
6 December 2007 under Section 1 44a 
of the US Securities Act contain an option 
such that, upon a change of control 
event, combined with a credit ratings 
downgrade to below sub-investment 
level, any holder of such a US Note may 
require the Company to prepay the 
principal amount of that US Note.
> The amended and restated £1.1 bn 
Credit Agreement dated 1 6 March 201 6 
(originally dated 29 September 201 1 ) 
between the Company and various 
banks contains a provision such that, 
upon a change of control event, unless 
new terms are agreed within 60 days, 
the facility under this agreement will 
be cancelled with all outstanding 
amounts becoming immediately 
payable with interest.
> The amended and restated Relationship 
Agreement dated 6 October 201 4 
(originally dated 9 November 2004 as 
amended on 1 March 2005), between 
HSBC and the Company and relating to 
M&S Bank, contains certain provisions 
which address a change of control of the 
Company. Upon a change of control the 
existing rights and obligations of the 
parties in respect of M&S Bank continue 
and HSBC gains certain limited additional 
rights in respect of existing customers 
of the new controller of the Company. 
Where a third party arrangement is in 
place for the supply of ﬁ nancial services 
products to existing customers of the 
new controller, the Company is required 
to procure the termination of such 
arrangement as soon as reasonably 
practicable (while not being required 
to do anything that would breach 
any contract in place in respect of 
such arrangement).
Where a third party arrangement is so 
terminated, or does not exist, HSBC gains 
certain exclusivity rights in respect of the 
sale of ﬁ nancial services products to the 
existing customers of the new controller. 
Where the Company undertakes a 
re-branding exercise with the new controller 
following a change of control (which 
includes using any M&S brand in respect 
of the new controller’s business or vice 
versa), HSBC gains certain termination 
rights (exercisable at its election) in 
respect of the Relationship Agreement.
The Company does not have agreements 
with any director or employee that would 
provide compensation for loss of offi  ce 
or employment resulting from a takeover 
except that provisions of the Company’s 
share schemes and plans may cause 
options and awards granted to employees 
under such schemes and plans to vest 
on a takeover.
EMPLOYEE INVOLVEMENT
We remain committed to employee 
involvement throughout the business. 
Employees are kept well informed of 
the performance and strategy of the 
Group through personal brieﬁ ngs, regular 
meetings, emails and broadcasts by the 
Chief Executive and members of the Board. 
These take place at key points in the year to 
all Head Offi  ce, distribution centre and store 
management employees. In addition, store 
colleagues can also hear business brieﬁ ngs 
by telephone and there are quarterly CEO/
CFO trading updates broadcast by Skype 
to our store management teams. These 
communications are supplemented by 
various employee publications including 
M&S World magazine, Plan A updates and 
DVD presentations. 
Our Making Every Moment Special 
employee engagement programme was 
launched last summer with two hours of 
training to empower store colleagues to 
put customers at the heart of the business 
and to make decisions based on customers’ 
speciﬁ c needs. The programme engaged 
with 70,000 employees through 75 regional 
leadership events and 1,500 store events, 
taking ideas from colleagues from across 
the business and has had tremendous 
results. 
More than 3,500 employees from across 
every store, distribution centre and Head 
Offi  ce location are elected to our Business 
Involvement Groups (BIG) to represent 
colleagues in two-way communication and 
consultation with the Company. These 
representatives have continued to play a 
key role in a number of business changes 
this year. The National BIG Chair meets with 
the Group Chairman and CEO regularly, as 
well as providing updates to and attending 
Board meetings annually. In addition, 
directors and senior management regularly 
attend the National BIG meetings. They also 
visit stores and discuss matters of interest 
and concern to both employees and the 
business through meetings with local BIG 
representatives, listening groups and 
informal discussions. 
The 22nd meeting of the European Works 
Council (EWC) (established in 1 995) will 
take place in November 201 7 . The EWC 
provides an additional forum for informing, 
consulting and involving employee 
representatives from the countries in the 
European Economic Area. The EWC has the 
opportunity to be addressed by the Chief 
Executive, International Director and other 
senior members of the Company on issues 
that aff ect the European business. 
Share schemes are a long-established and 
successful part of colleagues’ total reward 
packages, encouraging and supporting 
employee share ownership. The Company 
operates both an all employee Save As 
You Earn Scheme and Share Incentive Plan. 
Approximately 25,000 employees currently 
participate in ShareSave, the Company’s 
Save As You Earn Scheme. Full details of all 
schemes are given on pages 1 1 2 and 1 1 3.
There are websites for both pension 
schemes – the deﬁ ned contribution 
Scheme (Your M&S Pension Saving Plan) 
and the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme (the M&S 
Pension Scheme) – which are fully accessible 
to employees and former employees 
who have retained beneﬁ ts in either 
scheme. Employees are updated as 
needed with any pertinent information 
on their pension savings.
In April 201 6, the business launched a 
campaign which engaged all employees 
in putting forward their ideas for how 
M&S could drive down costs and reduce 
ineffi  ciency. The Crunch Costs campaign 
received an overwhelming response with 
colleagues submitting 1,300 ideas from 
stores and offi  ces. So far, the implemented 
ideas have generated savings of £20m, 
which has enabled the business to add 
over 3,000 colleagues to our stores. By 
recognising and celebrating employee ideas 
and contributions, the Company has driven 
high levels of engagement and motivation 
from employees. The most recent results of 
the Your Say employee survey show that the 
employee engagement score has increased 
by three percentage points on the previous 
year, and currently sits at 8 1 %.  82

DIRECTORS' REPORT: GOVERNANCE
Over 1,500 employees took part in 
Wellbeing Goals, a new initiative launched 
to inspire people to take a more holistic 
look at their overall wellbeing and follow 
simple steps each week to improve what 
matters to them, whether from a physical, 
mental, social or ﬁ nancial perspective. The 
business has also taken steps to connect 
the two important agendas of Diversity 
and Inclusion with Wellbeing in a bold 
two-week campaign inviting people to 
Be Yourself at work. This was supported 
by hosted events and colleague videos 
on what it means to be yourself at work 
and how inclusivity at work positively 
impacts wellbeing.
The Company continued to promote its 
free service provided by a conﬁ dential 
team of mental wellbeing specialists, 
LiveWellWorkWell, by distributing wallet 
cards with details of the service across all 
stores and business areas. The Company 
also invested in supporting the Buddy 
Network, a peer-to-peer support group, 
to provide colleagues with a way 
to share experiences and support each 
other in managing physical or mental 
health conditions alongside work.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES 
The Group is committed to an active equal 
opportunities policy from recruitment and 
selection, through training and development, 
performance reviews and promotion 
to retirement. The Company’s policy is 
to promote an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment and victimisation, 
where everyone will receive equal treatment 
regardless of gender, colour, ethnic or 
national origin, disability, age, marital or 
civil partner status, sexual orientation or 
religion. All decisions relating to employment 
practices will be objective, free from bias and 
based solely upon work criteria and individual 
merit. The Company is responsive to the 
needs of its employees, customers and the 
community at large. M&S is an organisation 
which uses everyone’s talents and abilities 
and where diversity is valued. 
M&S was one of the ﬁ rst major companies 
to remove the default retirement age in 
200 1 and has continued to see an increase 
in employees wanting to work past the state 
retirement age. Our oldest employee is 
90 years old and joined the business at 
age 80. 
In April 20 1 7 , the Company once again 
featured in The Times T op 50 Employers 
for Women, highlighting how equal 
opportunities are available for all at M&S. 
Employee-led diversity networks give a voice 
to under -represented groups, provide peer - 
to-peer support and help to inﬂ uence the 
Company to become more inclusive. These 
networks cover gender, ethnicity, disability, 
parents and sexual orientation/gender 
identity. Each network has support from 
a senior sponsor . Throughout the year 
employees have been involved in celebrating 
International Women’s Day, Pride, Black 
History Month and the International Day 
of Persons with Disabilities.
EMPLOYEES WITH DISABILITIES
The Company is clear in its policy that 
people with disabilities should have full 
and fair consideration for all vacancies.
M&S has continued to demonstrate its 
commitment to interviewing those people 
with disabilities who fulﬁ l the minimum 
criteria, and endeavouring to retain 
employees in the workforce if they become 
disabled during employment. M&S will 
actively retrain and adjust employees’ 
environments where possible to allow 
them to maximise their potential and will 
continue to work with external organisations 
to provide workplace opportunities through 
our innovative Marks & Start scheme and 
by working closely with Jobcentre Plus. 
The Marks & Start scheme was introduced 
into the distribution centre at Castle 
Donington in 201 2/1 3, working with Remploy 
to support people with disabilities and 
health conditions into work. 
GROCERIES SUPPLY CODE 
OF PRACTICE
The Groceries (Supply Chain Practices) 
Market Investigation Order 2009 (the Order) 
and The Groceries Supply Code of Practice 
(GSCOP) impose obligations on M&S 
relating to relationships with its suppliers of 
groceries. Under the Order and GSCOP , M&S 
is required to submit an annual compliance 
report to the Audit Committee for approval 
and then to the Competition and Markets 
Authority and Groceries Code Adjudicator. 
M&S submitted its report, covering the 
period from 3 April 201 6 to 1 April 201 7 , 
to the Audit Committee on 1 8 May 201 7 . 
In accordance with the Order, a summary 
of that compliance report is set out below:
M&S believes that it has complied in full 
with GSCOP and the Order during the 
relevant period. No formal disputes have 
arisen during the reporting period. Two 
allegations regarding potential breaches 
of GSCOP were raised by suppliers during 
the relevant period. Neither is being 
pursued and both are considered closed 
by M&S.

POLITICAL DONATIONS
The Company did not make any political 
donations or incur any political expenditure 
during the year ended 1 April 201 7 . M&S has

GOING CONCERN
In adopting the going concern basis for 
preparing the ﬁ nancial statements, the 
directors have considered the business 
activities as set out on pages 2 to 25 as 
well as the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 32 and 33. 
Based on the Group’s cash ﬂ ow forecasts 
and projections, the Board is satisﬁ ed that 
the Group will be able to operate within 
the level of its facilities for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason the Board considers 
it appropriate for the Group to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its 
ﬁ nancial statements.

LONG-TERM VIABILITY STATEMENT
The directors have assessed the prospects 
of the Company over a three-year period

account the business model, strategic 
aims, risk appetite, and principal risks and 
uncertainties, along with the Company’s 
current ﬁ nancial position. Based on this 
assessment, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period under review.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The AGM of Marks and Spencer Group plc 
will be held at Wembley Stadium, Wembley, 
London on 1 1 July 201 7 at 1 1am. The 
Notice of Meeting is given, together with 
explanatory notes, in the Performance 
Overview booklet which accompanies 
this report.
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board is of the view that the Annual 
Report should be truly representative of 
the year and provide shareholders with the 
information necessary to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and 
strategy. This cannot be achieved by merely 
reviewing the ﬁ nal document at the end 
of the preparation process. The Board 
ensured that its requirements were clearly 
communicated from the outset to each of 
the departments involved in the production 
of the Annual Report. 
The Board has advised that the narrative 
reports should contain the key information 
needed by investors and other users of the 
report and should avoid being promotional 
in nature. Furthermore, the narrative reports 
in the front and the accounting information 
in the back of the report should be 
consistent and the teams involved in its 
production work closely together to achieve 
this. For an independent opinion, the Board 
also requested the Audit Committee review 
the Annual Report and provide feedback. 
The Committee’s opinion on whether the 
report is fair, balanced and understandable 
is on page 50.
The directors are also responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report, the 
Remuneration Report and Policy and the 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company 
law requires the directors to prepare 
ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. 
Under that law, the directors have prepared 
the Group and Company ﬁ nancial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the EU. Under company law, the 
directors must not approve the ﬁ nancial 
statements unless they are satisﬁ ed that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
aff airs of the Group and the Company and 
of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group and the 
Company for that period. In preparing these 
ﬁ nancial statements, the directors are 
required to:
> Select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently.
> Make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
> State whether applicable IFRSs 
(as adopted by the EU) have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the ﬁ nancial statements.
> Prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on 
a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
suffi  cient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose, 
at any time and with reasonable accuracy, 
the ﬁ nancial position of the Company and 
the Group and to enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
Remuneration Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may 
diff er from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the current directors, whose names 
and functions are listed on pages 36 and 37 
of the Annual Report, conﬁ rms that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
> The Group ﬁ nancial statements, prepared 
in accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial 
position and proﬁ t or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole.
> The Management Report includes
 a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
> The Annual Report, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model 
and strategy.

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
SEPARATE OPINION IN RELATION TO IFRS AS ISSUED BY THE IASB
As explained in note 1 to the ﬁ nancial statements, in addition to complying with its legal 
obligation to apply IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group ﬁ nancial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
KEY RISKS
The key risks that we identiﬁ ed in the 
current year were:
> Accounting for exit costs of certain 
of the wholly owned international 
businesses
> Presentation of adjusted performance 
measures of the ﬁ nancial statements
> Impairment of UK store assets
> UK Clothing & Home inventory provision
> Retirement beneﬁ ts
> Manual adjustments to reported 
revenue 
> Accounting for supplier rebates
The description of risks below should be 
read in conjunction with the signiﬁ cant 
issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on pages 50 and 51. These 
matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
Within this report, any new risks are 
identiﬁ ed with ! , any risks which are 
the same as the prior year identiﬁ ed with 
 and any risks which have increased 
compared with the prior year are identiﬁ ed 
with .
MATERIALITY
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £24.5 million (2016: £30 million), 
based on a calculation of 5% of proﬁ t 
before tax adjusted for certain adjusted 
items due to the nature and signiﬁ cance 
of these adjusted items.
SCOPING
We performed a full scope audit on six 
components of the business representing 
97% of the Group’s revenue, 89% of the 
Group’s proﬁ t before tax and 85% of the 
Group’s net assets.
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR 
APPROACH
Our audit approach is consistent with 
the previous year, with the exception of:
> We have included an additional risk 
in respect of the accounting for the exit 
costs of certain of the wholly owned 
international businesses, given the 
signiﬁ cance of the charge incurred 
during the year and the level of 
estimation uncertainty; and
> Specific audit procedures were performed 
on certain signiﬁ cant balances for China 
and analytical review procedures were 
completed for Greece; in the previous 
year these components were subject 
to full audits. 85

OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 RISK 
!  ACCOUNTING FOR THE EXIT COSTS OF CERTAIN OF THE 
WHOLLY OWNED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES
RISK DESCRIPTION
As set out on page 10 of the Strategic 
Report, management announced their 
proposal to close 53 stores across 10 
international markets over the period 
from November 2016 to October 201 7 . 
The Group has recognised a cost of 
£1 3 1 million in the year in respect of 
exit costs, which is reported as an 
adjusted item in the Group’s alternative 
performance measures.
When calculating the exit costs, management has estimated future settlement and 
exit costs where these are not yet known. The costs recognised in the period primarily 
relate to:
> Property exit costs: estimation 
uncertainty arises in management’s 
assessment of likely exit costs where 
these may diff er from the contracted 
future obligations under lease 
agreements.
> Staff  restructuring costs: in certain 
territories, estimation uncertainty 
arises in the application of local staff  
restructuring and redundancy laws 
where there are a range of possible 
outcomes dependent on factors 
outside the group’s control.
Further detail of these estimates are 
included in the sources of estimation 
uncertainty disclosure in note 1.
Given the magnitude of the exit costs 
and the level of estimation uncertainty, 
we have directed a signiﬁ cant level of 
our senior audit resource to assessing 
the valuation of the costs recorded 
during the year. 
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We have evaluated the assumptions applied in calculating the charge for the year and, where possible, agreed inputs to the cost 
calculations to supporting factual evidence.
Our audit eff ort was focussed on the two key sources of estimation uncertainty described above.
> Property exit costs: we obtained an 
understanding of management’s 
assumptions in deriving estimated exit 
costs for a sample of properties that 
are being closed, assessing these in 
the context of the possible maximum 
obligations under the various lease 
arrangements. This included meeting 
with internal property experts, 
reviewing lease agreements and 
any correspondence with landlords, 
consulting with our own property 
experts in certain local markets, and 
reviewing the actual settlements for 
stores where the exit negotiations 
had concluded.
> Staff  restructuring costs: we evaluated 
the calculations for redundancy 
payments, agreeing the methodology 
applied to local laws and regulations for 
all signiﬁ cant countries. We tested the 
accuracy of the underlying data in these 
calculations on a sample basis. Where 
a range of possible outcomes exists, we 
performed a sensitivity analysis on the 
key inputs to the valuation model and 
consulted with our local experts in those 
countries to validate key assumptions.
Key observations 
The outcome of future exit negotiations 
and other future events gives rise to 
a source of estimation uncertainty. 
We consider the restructuring charge 
recorded in the year to have been 
appropriately calculated. We have 
reviewed the disclosure in note 1 and 
consider it to be appropriate.
As required by the Listing Rules we have 
reviewed the directors’ statement regarding 
the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within 
note 1 to the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
directors’ statement on the longer-term 
viability of the Group contained within the 
“Other disclosures” section on page 3 1.
We have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
> the directors' conﬁ rmation on page 30 
that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
> the disclosures on pages 32-33 that 
describe those risks and explain how 
they are being managed or mitigated;
> the directors’ statement in note 1 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing them and their identiﬁ cation of 
any material uncertainties to the group’s 
ability to continue to do so over a period 
of at least twelve months from the date 
of approval of the ﬁ nancial statements;
> the directors’ explanation on page 3 1 as 
to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the Group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider 
that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the group 
will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary 
qualiﬁ cations or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption 
of the going concern basis of accounting 
and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all 
future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a

  PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED 
PERFORMANCE METRICS 
RISK DESCRIPTION
The presentation of income and costs 
within adjusted measures (to derive 
‘adjusted proﬁ t before tax') under IFRS is 
judgemental, with IFRS only requiring the 
separate presentation of material items. 
Judgement is exercised by management 
in determining the classiﬁ cation of items 
as adjusted. 
In the Group’s reported results, signiﬁ cant 
adjustments have been made to statutory 
proﬁ t before tax of £1 76 million to derive 
adjusted proﬁ t before tax of £614 million. 
Explanations of each adjustment are 
set out in notes 1 and 5 to the ﬁ nancial 
statements, and are summarised in the

In calculating the reported adjusted measures, there are two risks which may result 
in the adjusted proﬁ t measure being misstated and therefore not being reliable to 
users of the ﬁ nancial statements:
> items may be included in the adjustments inappropriately, distorting the reported 
adjusted earnings; and
> items may be omitted from the adjustments which are signiﬁ cant in nature and/or 
quantum to the reported adjusted earnings.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We evaluated the appropriateness of the 
inclusion of items, both individually and 
in aggregate, within adjusted items, 
including assessing the consistency of 
items included year on year and ensuring 
adherence to IFRS requirements and 
latest Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) 
guidance. We also agreed these items 
to supporting evidence.
We assessed all items, either highlighted 
by management or identiﬁ ed through the 
course of our audit, which were regarded 
as signiﬁ cant in nature and/or quantum, 
but included within adjusted proﬁ t to 
ensure that these are not material either 
individually or in aggregate. For all 
adjustments recorded in calculating 
proﬁ ts before adjusted items, we 
discussed the appropriateness of the 
item with the Audit Committee and any 
disclosure considerations.
Key observations 
We are satisﬁ ed that the items excluded 
from proﬁ t before adjusted items and the 
related disclosure of these items in the 
ﬁ nancial statements are appropriate.
 RISK 
  IMPAIRMENT OF UK STORE ASSETS
RISK DESCRIPTION
On 8 November 2016, the Group 
announced that a full review of the UK store 
estate was to be performed. As a result, we 
consider the risk of impairment of UK store 
assets has increased due to the impact of 
decisions resulting from the store review. 
In addition, continuing economic 
uncertainty, depreciation of sterling, 
increases in business rates, the introduction 
of the National Living Wage and the cost of 
the Apprenticeship Levy impact the trading 
performance of the UK store estate. 
As described in the Accounting Policies 
in note 1 and in note 15 to the Financial 
Statements, the Group held £4,838 million 
(2016: £5,027 million) of property, plant and 
equipment at 1 April 201 7 . Included within 
this value are assets which relate to UK 
Stores and in light of the UK store portfolio 
review and trading performance in certain 
stores, there is a risk that the assets held 
in, and associated with, each store are not 
recoverable. Management has performed 
a full impairment assessment for all stores, 
other than those within their shelter period 
(see below), to determine if the carrying 
value of these UK assets is supported. 
This assessment has included, where 
appropriate, the Group’s ongoing strategic 
review of the UK store estate, as described 
on page 10 of the Strategic Report. As 
a result, a total charge of £101 million 
has been recorded in respect of 
impairments and closure provisions.
When a review for impairment is 
conducted, the recoverable amount 
is determined based on value in use 
calculations which rely on the directors’ 
assumptions and estimates of future 
trading performance.
The key assumptions applied by the 
directors in the impairment reviews are:
> forecast periods in the context of 
strategic decisions made to exit 
a location;
> future revenue growth;
> discount rates;
> gross margin; and
> store costs, including the impact 
of the National Living Wage.
The directors consider that each retail 
store constitutes its own cash generating 
unit (‘CGU’), with the exception of the 
outlet stores which are used to clear old 
season Clothing & Home inventories at a 
discount. The outlet stores are considered 
to represent one CGU in aggregate and 
strategic stores are evaluated as part of 
a country-wide impairment review.
The group’s accounting policy sets out 
a relevant shelter period for new stores 
to be taken into account when assessing 
indicators of impairment during initial 
years of trading to enable the store to 
establish itself in the market.

HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We considered the appropriateness of the 
methodology applied by the directors in 
calculating the impairment charges, and 
the judgements applied in determining 
the CGUs of the business. In addition, we 
assessed the design and implementation 
of controls in respect of the impairment 
review process, and considered the 
adequacy of disclosures made in the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
We assessed the impairment models and calculations by:
> checking the mechanical accuracy of 
the impairment models;
> assessing the discount rates applied to 
the impairment reviews with support 
from our internal valuations specialist, 
and comparing the rates to our internal 
benchmark data;
> comparing forecast growth rates to 
economic data; and
> evaluating the information included in 
the impairment models through our 
knowledge of the business gained 
through reviewing trading plans, 
strategic initiatives, minutes of property 
board and investment committee 
meetings, and meeting with regional 
store managers and senior trading 
managers from key product categories 
and our retail industry knowledge.
We assessed the appropriateness of the 
shelter period for each store opened within 
that time frame, and compared the original 
investment case for the store against its 
current trading performance. Where stores 
were trading signiﬁ cantly below the 
original case, we considered the evidence 
available to support future improvements 
in performance, speciﬁ cally by assessing 
the trading plans and actions being taken 
on an individual store basis.
Key observations 
We assessed the level of impairment 
recorded in respect of the UK business 
and are satisﬁ ed that the judgements 
applied by management and the level 
of impairments recorded in the year 
are appropriate.

  UK CLOTHING & HOME INVENTORY 
PROVISION
RISK DESCRIPTION
At 1 April 201 7, the Group held UK Clothing 
& Home inventories of £541 million 
(2016: £583 million). As described in the 
Accounting Policies in note 1 to the 
Financial Statements, inventories are 
carried at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. As a result, the directors 
apply judgement in determining the 
appropriate provisions for obsolete stock 
based upon a detailed analysis of old 
season inventory, net realisable value 
below cost based upon plans for inventory 
to go into sale and stock loss based upon 
the run rate from recent inventory counts. 
We consider the assessment of inventory 
provisions within UK Clothing & Home to 
require the most judgement based on 
the level of inventory held and recent 
trading performance.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We obtained assurance over the 
appropriateness of management’s 
assumptions applied in calculating the 
value of the inventory provisions by:
> checking the eff ectiveness of key 
inventory controls operating across 
the UK business, including those at 1 2 
distribution centres and 1 3 retail stores;
> attending inventory counts at 1 2 
distribution centres and 1 3 retail stores;
> checking for a sample of  individual 
products that invoiced costs have been 
correctly recorded and that the 
allocation of directly attributable costs 
has been correctly calculated;
> comparing the net realisable value, 
obtained through a detailed review of 
sales subsequent to the year-end using 
audit analytics, to the cost price of 
inventories to check for completeness 
of the associated provision;
> performing audit analytics on stock 
holding and movement data to identify 
product lines with indicators of low 
stock turn or signiﬁ cant levels of aged 
stock; and
> meeting with buyers to validate the 
assumptions applied by management 
compared to the current purchasing 
strategy and ranging plans.
We evaluated consumer trends identiﬁ ed 
through benchmarking and external 
market data to challenge the assumptions 
underlying sales forecasts by category to 
assess the completeness of provisions for 
obsolescence.
Key observations 
The results of our testing were satisfactory 
and we concur that the level of UK 
inventory provisions is appropriate.

 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
RISK DESCRIPTION
As described in the Accounting Policies 
in note 1 and in note 1 1 to the Financial 
Statements the Group has a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension plan for its UK employees, 
which is closed to new entrants, and a 
funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme 
in the Republic of Ireland, where no new 
beneﬁ ts have accrued since 31 October 
2013, therefore the key risk relates to the 
UK scheme only.
At 1 April 2017, the Group recorded a 
net retirement beneﬁ t asset of £702 
million (2016: £833 million), being the 
net of scheme assets of £10,135 million 
(2016: £8,515 million), scheme liabilities of 
£9,433 million (2016: £7,682 million) and 
unfunded retirement beneﬁ ts of £9 
million (2016: £9 million). The Group 
net retirement beneﬁ t asset has shown 
signiﬁ cant volatility, as the valuation is 
sensitive to changes in key assumptions 
such as the discount rate, inﬂ ation 
and mortality estimates. In addition, 
curtailment charges have been 
recognised in relation to the closure 
of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme,    
which occurred during the year, to 
future accrual.
The setting of these assumptions is 
complex and an area of signiﬁ cant 
judgement; changes in any of these 
assumptions can lead to a material 
movement in the net surplus. The 
increase/(decrease) in scheme surplus 
caused by a change in each of the key 
assumptions is set out below:
2017
£m
2016
£m
A decrease in the discount 
rate of 0.25% (70) (90)
A decrease in the inﬂ ation 
rate of 0.25% (20) 20
A decrease in the average life 
expectancy of one year 370 300
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We evaluated the directors’ assessment of 
the assumptions made in the valuation of 
the scheme liabilities, and evaluated the 
information contained within the actuarial 
valuation reports for each scheme. We 
assessed the design and implementation 
of controls in respect of the pension 
scheme valuation process.
We tested the membership census data 
used in the valuation of the schemes 
and, with support from our own actuarial 
specialists, we considered the process 
applied by the Group’s actuaries, the scope 
of the valuation performed and the key 
assumptions applied and evaluated their 
expertise. We benchmarked and performed 
a sensitivity analysis on the key variables 
in the valuation model, including:
> inﬂ ation rates;
> mortality rates; and
> discount rates.
We assessed the accounting treatment 
applied to the scheme’s closure to 
future accrual and the resulting 
curtailment charge.
Key observations 
We are satisﬁ ed that all assumptions 
applied in respect of the valuation 
of the scheme assets and liabilities are 
appropriate.
 RISK 
  MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO REPORTED REVENUE
RISK DESCRIPTION
As described in the Accounting Policies in 
note 1 to the Financial Statements, the 
group’s revenue recognition policies 
require the directors to make a number of 
adjustments and estimates in determining 
the reported revenue for the period. 
The most signiﬁ cant adjustments are:
> gift cards, vouchers and loyalty schemes 
– the directors apply an expected 
redemption rate to the total value of gift 
cards, vouchers and loyalty points in 
issue based on historic trends. 
> returns – customers are entitled to 
return most products up to 35 days 
after purchase, giving rise to a risk that 
sales recognised during the period will 
be reversed in the next ﬁ nancial period. 
 
The directors apply judgement in 
determining the provision required for 
returns based on actual sales data and 
recent product return rates. Returns 
from online sales are commonly at 
a higher level than traditional store 
retailing, resulting in this judgement 
becoming more signiﬁ cant in 
determining the level of provision 
required.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We considered each revenue-impacting 
manual adjustment individually, and 
assessed the appropriateness of the 
assumptions and judgements applied 
to each. We assessed the design and 
implementation of controls in respect of 
these revenue judgements, in addition to 
testing the eff ectiveness of key revenue 
controls operating across the UK business.
For the key assumptions used in the gift 
card and voucher, and loyalty scheme 
provisions, we assessed the historic rates 
of redemption and compared these to the 
directors’ judgements. 
We assessed the appropriateness 
of the methodology and inputs used in 
calculating the returns provision. 
Key observations 
We are satisﬁ ed that the key assumptions 
applied in calculating the returns, gift 
card, voucher and loyalty scheme 
provisions are appropriate.

  ACCOUNTING FOR SUPPLIER REBATES
RISK DESCRIPTION
As described in the Accounting Policies 
in note 1 and note 1 7 to the Financial 
Statements, the Group recognises a 
reduction in cost of sales as a result of 
amounts receivable from suppliers, 
primarily comprising contributions in 
relation to promotions in the Food 
business, strategic volume moves and 
some annual volume-based rebates.  
The majority of these contributions tend 
to be small in unit value but high in volume 
and span relatively short periods of time, 
although these can be across the ﬁ nancial 
year end.  There are a small number of 
larger arrangements, which relate to 
multi-year periods.
Judgement is required in determining 
the period over which the reduction in cost 
of sales should be recognised, requiring 
both a detailed understanding of the 
contractual arrangements themselves 
as well as complete and accurate source 
data to apply the arrangements to.
HOW THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT RESPONDED TO THE RISK
We tested that amounts recognised were 
accurate and recorded in the correct 
period based on the contractual 
performance obligations by agreeing a 
sample to individual supplier agreements. 
We also conducted interviews with a 
range of buyers and trading managers. 
In addition, we circularised a sample of 
15 suppliers to test whether the 
arrangements recorded were complete.  
We performed revenue and margin 
analysis to understand detailed trends 
by product category in order to identify 
apparent anomalies which may indicate 
potential rebate income errors.  Such 
anomalies were investigated to assess 
whether they were indicative of a mis-
application of contractual terms or 
other calculation errors.
We also tested a sample of rebates 
recognised pre and post-year end to test 
the completeness and accuracy of 
accrued supplier income at 1 April 201 7 .
Key observations 
The results of our testing were satisfactory.  
We consider the disclosure given around 
supplier rebates to provide an accurate 
understanding of the types of rebate 
income received and the impact on 
the statement of ﬁ nancial position as 
at 1 April 201 7 .
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT CONTINUED

We determined materiality for the 
group to be £24.5 million.
We reported all audit diff erences in 
excess of £1m.
We deﬁ ne materiality as the magnitude of 
misstatement in the ﬁ nancial statements 
that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person would be changed or inﬂ uenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the 
scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be £24.5 million (2016: £30 million), based 
on a calculation of 5% of proﬁ t before tax 
adjusted for certain adjusted items due to 
the nature and signiﬁ cance of these items.
The adjusted proﬁ t used in our determination 
of materiality was £479 million, which is 
£301 million higher than statutory proﬁ t 
before tax of £1 76 million. The items we 
excluded from our determination are listed 
below, and explained further in note 5 
to the ﬁ nancial statements:
> Changes to pay and pensions – 
£156 million
> International store closures and 
impairments – £1 3 1 million
> Strategic programmes – UK organisation 
and logistics – £14 million
The materiality applied by the component 
auditors (see below) ranged from 
£2.5 million to £22.5 million (2016: £2 million 
to £27 million), depending on the scale of 
the component’s operations and our 
assessment of risks speciﬁ c to each 
location.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that 
we would report to the Committee all audit 
diff erences in excess of £1 million (2016: 
£1 million) as well as diff erences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting 
on qualitative grounds. We also report to

We performed a full scope audit on six 
components representing 97% of the 
Group’s revenue, 89% of the Group’s 
proﬁ t before tax and 85% of the Group’s 
net assets.
We continue to adopt a rotational 
approach to visiting the signiﬁ cant 
locations of the Group’s activities.
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining 
an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of 
material misstatement at the group level. 
A summary of the Group’s retail operations 
is set out below (including the UK business).

Retail joint ventures 2 2
Retail franchise operations* 31 33

Based on our assessment we focused our 
Group audit scope primarily on the audit 
work at six wholly owned locations: United 
Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Czech 
Republic, France, China and Hong Kong, and 
the joint venture in India. All of these were 
subject to a full audit, with the exception of 
China where speciﬁ c audit procedures were 
performed on certain signiﬁ cant balances. 
In the prior year, Greece was subject to a 
full audit; however is subject to analytical 
review procedures in the current year 
following changes to the Group’s 
international strategy. Analytical review 
procedures were completed for the current 
year for those locations not subject to full 
audit procedures.
These components were selected to 
provide an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identiﬁ ed above. All other 
wholly owned and joint venture businesses 
were subject to analytical review procedures. 
Whilst we audit the revenues received by 
the Group from franchise operations, which 
ac c oun t for 3 % ( 2 0 1 6 : 3 % ) of t he Gr oup’ s revenue, 
we do not audit the underlying franchise 
operations as part of our Group audit. 
At the parent entity level we also tested
the consolidation process and carried out 
analytical procedures to conﬁ rm our 
conclusion that there were no signiﬁ cant 
risks of material misstatement of the 
aggregated ﬁ nancial information of the 
remaining components not subject to 
a full audit.

The most signiﬁ cant component of the 
Group is its retail business in the United 
Kingdom, which accounts for 89% (2016: 
90%) of the Group’s reported revenue of 
£10,622 million, and generates operating 
proﬁ t of £253 million (2016: £627 million) 
which is off set by operating losses from the 
international segment resulting in a Group 
operating proﬁ t of £253 million (2016: £584 
million). The Group audit team performs 
the audit of the UK business without the 
involvement of a component team. During 
the course of our audit, the Group audit 
team, conducted 1 2 distribution centre and 
1 3 retail store visits in the UK to understand 
the current trading performance and, at 
certain locations, performed tests of 
internal controls and validated levels 
of inventory held.
We operate a programme of planned visits 
to signiﬁ cant locations so that a senior 
member of the Group audit team visits 
each of the components subject to a full 
audit or speciﬁ c audit procedures at least 
once every two years, and the most 
signiﬁ cant of them at least once a year. 
In addition to our programme of planned 
visits, we send detailed instructions to our 
component audit teams, include them in 
our team brieﬁ ngs, discuss their risk 
assessment, attend closing meetings, 
and review their audit working papers.
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit:
> the part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006;
> the information given in the Strategic

ﬁ nancial year for which the ﬁ nancial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the ﬁ nancial statements; and
> the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report have been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
> In the light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and the 
company and their environment 
obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identiﬁ ed any material

OUR DUTY TO READ OTHER 
INFORMATION IN THE ANNUAL REPORT
Under International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland), we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
Annual Report is:
> materially inconsistent with the 
information in the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements; or
> apparently materially incorrect based 
on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
> otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider 
whether we have identified any inconsistencies 
between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider the Annual Report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and whether 
the Annual Report appropriately discloses 
those matters that we communicated 
to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We conﬁ rm 
that we have not identiﬁ ed any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
Responsibilities Statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements and for being satisﬁ ed 
that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology 
and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are eff ective, 
understood and applied. Our quality 
controls and systems include our dedicated 
professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body, in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members 
as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
We are required to comply with the Financial 
Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors and we conﬁ rm that we are 
independent of the Group and we have 
fulﬁ lled our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with those standards. We also 
conﬁ rm we have not provided any of the 
prohibited non-audit services referred to 
in those standards.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about 
the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial 
statements suffi  cient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are 
free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
> whether the accounting policies are 
appr opriat e t o the Gr oup’ s and the Compan y’ s 
circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
> the reasonableness of signiﬁ cant 
accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
> the overall presentation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁ nancial and 
non-ﬁ nancial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited ﬁ nancial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General information
The current ﬁ nancial statements are prepared for the 52-week 
period ended 1 April 201 7 , whereas the prior ﬁ nancial period was the 
53 weeks ended 2 April 201 6.
Basis of preparation 
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations, as adopted by 
the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the ﬁ nancial 
statements, the directors have considered the business activities 
as set out on pages 1 to 33 including the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 30 to 33. Based on the Group’s 
cash ﬂ ow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisﬁ ed that the 
Group will be able to operate within the level of its bank facilities 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Group continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing its ﬁ nancial statements.
The Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership has taken an 
exemption under paragraph 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) 
Regulations 2008 for the requirement to prepare and deliver 
ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with the Companies Act. 
New accounting standards adopted by the Group
There have been no signiﬁ cant changes to accounting under IFRS 
which have aff ected the Group’s results for the current ﬁ nancial 
year. The only changes to the IFRS, IFRS IC interpretations and 
amendments that are eff ective for the ﬁ rst time in this ﬁ nancial year, 
and are applicable for the Group, are the Annual Improvements to 
IFRSs: 201 2-201 4 cycle. These have not had a material impact on 
the Group. 
New accounting standards in issue but not yet eff ective
The following IFRS have been issued but are not yet eff ective:
> IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ replaces all phases of the ﬁ nancial 
instruments project and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement’. The standard is eff ective from 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 201 8 and introduces: 
 –  new requirements for the classiﬁ cation and measurement 
of ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities; 
 –  a new model for recognising provisions based on expected 
credit losses; and 
 –  simpliﬁ ed hedge accounting by aligning hedge accounting 
more closely with an entities risk management methodology. 
  Work is under way to assess the necessary changes to existing 
IT systems that will be required to aid the Group's implementation 
of the standard. The adoption of IFRS 9 is unlikely to have a 
material impact on the consolidated results of the Group. Any 
potential impact of IFRS 9 will be quantiﬁ ed in the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements for the year ending 3 1 March 201 8.
> IFRS 1 5 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is eff ective 
for periods beginning on or after 1 January 201 8. The standard 
establishes a principles based approach for revenue recognition 
and is based on the concept of recognising revenue for 
obligations only when they are satisﬁ ed and the control of 
goods or services is transferred. It applies to all contracts with 
customers, except those in the scope of other standards. 
It replaces the separate models for goods, services and 
construction contracts under the current accounting standards. 
The Group has completed an assessment on the impact of IFRS 1 5 
and it is expected adoption will not have a material impact on any 
of the Group’s revenue streams. 
> IFRS 1 6 ‘Leases’ was issued on 1 3 January 201 6 and is eff ective for 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 201 9. Early adoption is 
permitted if IFRS 1 5 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ 
has also been applied. IFRS 1 6 is not yet endorsed by the EU. 
The standard represents a signiﬁ cant change in the accounting 
and reporting of leases for lessees as it provides a single lessee 
accounting model. As such it requires lessees to recognise assets 
and liabilities for all leases unless the underlying asset has a low 
value or the lease term is 1 2 months or less. The standard may 
also require the capitalisation of a lease element of contracts 
held by the Group which under the existing accounting standard 
would not be considered a lease. Accounting requirements for 
lessors are substantially unchanged from IAS 1 7 .
The Group has established a working group to assess the impact 
of the new standard. Work performed includes assessing the 
accounting impacts of the change, the process of collecting 
the required data from across the business and the necessary 
changes to systems and processes. From work performed to 
date, it is expected implementation of the new standard will have 
a signiﬁ cant impact on the consolidated results of the Group. 
On adoption, lease agreements will give rise to both a right 
of use asset and a lease liability for future lease payables. 
Depreciation of the right of use asset will be recognised in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis, with interest 
recognised on the lease liability. This will result in a change 
to the proﬁ le of the net charge taken to the income statement 
over the life of the lease. These charges will replace the lease 
costs currently charged to the income statement. 
The Group continues to assess the full impact of IFRS 1 6, however, 
the impact will greatly depend on the facts and circumstances 
at the time of adoption and upon transition choices adopted. 
It is therefore not yet practicable to provide a reliable estimate 
of the ﬁ nancial impact on the Group’s consolidated results. 
Alternative Performance Measures
In reporting ﬁ nancial information, the Group presents alternative 
performance measures, “APMs”, which are not deﬁ ned or speciﬁ ed 
under the requirements of IFRS. 
The Group believes that these APMs, which are not considered to be 
a substitute for or superior to IFRS measures, provide stakeholders 
with additional helpful information on the performance of the 
business. The APMs are consistent with how the business 
performance is planned and reported within the internal 
management reporting to the Board and Operating Committee. 
Some of these measures are also used for the purpose of setting 
remuneration targets.
The key APMs that the Group uses include: like-for-like sales; gross 
margin; proﬁ t before tax and adjusted items; adjusted earnings 
per share; net debt; free cash ﬂ ow; and return on capital employed. 
Each of these APMs, and others used by the Group, are set out in 
the Glossary on pages 1 33 and 1 34 including explanations of how 
they are calculated and how they can be reconciled to a statutory 
measure where relevant.
The Group reports some ﬁ nancial measures, primarily International 
sales, on both a reported and constant currency basis. The constant 
currency basis, which is an APM, retranslates the previous year 
revenues at the average actual periodic exchange rates used in 
the current ﬁ nancial year. This measure is presented as a means of 
eliminating the eff ects of exchange rate ﬂ uctuations on the year-
on-year reported results. 
The Group makes certain adjustments to the statutory proﬁ t 
measures in order to derive many of these APMs. The Group’s policy 
is to exclude items that are considered to be signiﬁ cant in both 
nature and/or quantum and where treatment as an adjusted item 
provides stakeholders with additional useful information to assess 
the year-on-year trading performance of the Group. On this basis, 
the following items were included within adjusted items for the 
52-week period ended 1 April 201 7:
> Signiﬁ cant pension charges arising as a result of changes to the 
deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme's rules and practices 97

> Signiﬁ cant restructuring costs and other associated costs arising 
from signiﬁ cant strategy changes that are not considered by the 
Group to be part of the normal operating costs of the business.
>Net gains and losses on the disposal of properties or 
impairments of properties where a commitment to close 
has been demonstrated.
> Impairment charges and provisions that are considered to be 
signiﬁ cant in nature and/or value to the trading performance 
of the business.
> Adjustments to income from M&S Bank due to a provision 
recognised by M&S Bank for the cost of providing redress to 
customers in respect of possible mis-selling of M&S Bank 
ﬁ nancial products.
> Various legal settlements that are signiﬁ cant in value to the 
results of the Group or to a segment. 
Refer to note 5 for a summary of the adjusted items. 
A summary of the Company’s and the Group’s accounting policies 
is given below: 
Accounting convention 
The ﬁ nancial statements are drawn up on the historical cost basis 
of accounting, as modiﬁ ed by ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities 
(including derivative instruments ) at fair value through proﬁ t and loss. 
Basis of consolidation 
The Group ﬁ nancial statements incorporate the ﬁ nancial 
statements of Marks and Spencer Group plc and all its subsidiaries 
made up to the period end date. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the 
accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. 
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiary undertakings are all entities (including special purpose 
entities) over which the Group has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial 
and operating policies. This power is generally accompanied by the 
Group having a shareholding of more than one half of the voting 
rights. Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are 
recorded using the acquisition method of accounting and their 
results are included from the date of acquisition. 
The separable net assets, including property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets, of the newly acquired subsidiary undertakings 
are incorporated into the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements on the 
basis of the fair value as at the eff ective date of control. 
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between Group companies are eliminated. 
Revenue 
Revenue comprises sales of goods to customers outside the Group 
less an appropriate deduction for actual and expected returns, 
discounts and loyalty scheme vouchers, and is stated net of value 
added tax and other sales taxes. Revenue is recognised when goods 
are delivered to our franchise partners or the customer and the 
signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer. 
Supplier income
In line with industry practice, the Group enters into agreements 
with suppliers to share the costs and beneﬁ ts of promotional 
activity and volume growth. The Group receives income from its 
suppliers based on speciﬁ c agreements in place. This supplier 
income received is recognised as a deduction from cost of sales 
based on the entitlement that has been earned up to the balance 
sheet date for each relevant supplier agreement. Marketing 
contributions, equipment hire and other non-judgemental 
ﬁ xed rate supplier charges are not included in the Group’s 
deﬁ nition of supplier income.
The types of supplier income recognised by the Group and the 
associated recognition policies are:
A. Promotional contribution Includes supplier contributions 
to promotional giveaways and pre-agreed contributions to annual 
‘spend and save’ activity. 
Income is recognised as a deduction to cost of sales over the 
relevant promotional period. 
Income is calculated and invoiced at the end of the promotional 
period based on actual sales or according to ﬁ xed contribution 
arrangements. Contributions earned but not invoiced are accrued 
at the end of the relevant period.
B. Volume-based rebates Includes annual growth incentives, 
seasonal contributions and contributions to share economies of 
scale resulting from moving product supply.
Annual growth incentives are calculated and invoiced at the end 
of the ﬁ nancial year, once earned, based on ﬁ xed percentage 
growth targets agreed for each supplier at the beginning of the year. 
They are recognised as a reduction in cost of sales in the year to 
which they relate. Other volume-based rebates are agreed with the 
supplier and spread over the relevant season/contract period to 
which they relate. Contributions earned but not invoiced are 
accrued at the end of the relevant period.
Uncollected supplier income at the balance sheet date is classiﬁ ed 
within the ﬁ nancial statements as follows:
A. Trade and other payables The majority of income due from 
suppliers is netted against amounts owed to that supplier as 
the Group has the right to off set these balances. As such, the 
outstanding supplier income within trade and other payables at 
year end is immaterial.
B. Trade and other receivables Supplier income that has been 
earned but not invoiced at the balance sheet date is recognised in 
trade and other receivables and primarily relates to volume-based 
rebates that run up to the period end.
In order to provide users of the accounts with greater understanding 
in this area, additional balance sheet disclosure is provided in note 1 7 
to the ﬁ nancial statements.
Dividends 
Final dividends are recorded in the ﬁ nancial statements in the 
period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are 
approved and paid. 
Pensions 
Funded pension plans are in place for the Group’s UK employees 
and some employees overseas. 
For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes, the diff erence between the 
fair value of the assets and the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation is recognised as an asset or liability in the statement of 
ﬁ nancial position. The deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation is actuarially 
calculated using the projected unit credit method. 
The service cost of providing retirement beneﬁ ts to employees 
during the year, together with the cost of any curtailment, is charged 
to operating proﬁ t in the year. 
The net interest cost on the net retirement beneﬁ t asset/liability is 
calculated by applying the discount rate, measured at the beginning 
of the year, to the net deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset/liability and is included 
as a single net amount in ﬁ nance income. 
Remeasurements, being actuarial gains and losses, together with 
the diff erence between actual investment returns and the return 
implied by the net interest cost, are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t schemes 
are charged as an expense on an accruals basis.  98

Intangible assets 
A. Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the 
excess of the consideration paid and the amount of any non-
controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the 
identiﬁ able assets and liabilities (including intangible assets) of 
the acquired entity at the date of the acquisition. Goodwill is 
recognised as an asset and assessed for impairment annually or 
as triggering events occur. Any impairment in value is recognised 
within the income statement. 
B. Brands Acquired brand values are held on the statement of 
ﬁ nancial position initially at cost. Deﬁ nite life intangibles are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
Indeﬁ nite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually or as 
triggering events occur. Any impairment in value is recognised 
within the income statement. 
C. Software intangibles Where computer software is not an 
integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software 
is treated as an intangible asset. Capitalised software costs include 
external direct costs of goods and services, as well as internal 
payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated 
with the project. 
Capitalised software development costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their expected economic lives, normally 
between three and ten years. Computer software under 
development is held at cost less any recognised impairment loss. 
Any impairment in value is recognised within the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment 
The Group’s policy is to state property, plant and equipment at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Property is not revalued for accounting purposes. Assets in the 
course of construction are held at cost less any recognised 
impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying 
assets, borrowing costs. 
Depreciation is provided to write off  the cost of tangible non-
current assets (including investment properties), less estimated 
residual values on a straight line basis as follows: 
> Freehold land – not depreciated.
> Freehold and leasehold buildings with a remaining lease term 
over 50 years – depreciated to their residual value over their 
estimated remaining economic lives.
> Leasehold buildings with a remaining lease term of less than 
50  years – depreciated over the remaining period of the lease. 
> Fixtures, ﬁ ttings and equipment – 3 to 25 years according to 
the estimated economic life of the asset. 
Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually. 
Depreciation is charged on all additions to, or disposals of, 
depreciating assets in the year of purchase or disposal. 
Any impairment in value is recognised within the income statement.
Leasing 
Where assets are ﬁ nanced by leasing agreements and the risks and 
rewards are substantially transferred to the Group (ﬁ nance leases) 
the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright, and 
the corresponding liability to the leasing company is included as an 
obligation under ﬁ nance leases. Depreciation on leased assets is 
charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned 
assets, unless the term of the lease is shorter. Leasing payments are 
treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the 
interest is charged to the income statement. 
All other leases are operating leases and the costs in respect of 
operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. The value of any lease incentive received to take on 
an operating lease (for example, a rent-free period) is recognised 
as deferred income and is released over the life of the lease. 
Leasehold prepayments 
Payments made to acquire leasehold land and buildings are 
included in prepayments at cost and are amortised over the life 
of the lease. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes short-term deposits with banks 
and other ﬁ nancial institutions, with an initial maturity of three 
months or less and credit card payments received within 48 hours. 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued on a weighted average cost basis and carried 
at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes all direct 
expenditure and other attributable costs incurred in bringing 
inventories to their present location and condition. All inventories 
are ﬁ nished goods. Certain purchases of inventories may be subject 
to cash ﬂ ow hedges for foreign exchange risk. The Group applies a 
basis adjustment for those purchases in a way that the cost is initially 
established by reference to the hedged exchange rate and not the 
spot rate at the day of purchase.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at 
the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to present value 
where the eff ect is material. 
Share-based payments 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is 
measured at the date of grant. The Group measures the fair value 
of each award using the Black-Scholes model where appropriate. 
The fair value of each award is recognised as an expense over the 
vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate 
of the share awards that will eventually vest. The level of vesting is 
reviewed at each reporting period and the charge is adjusted to 
reﬂ ect actual and estimated levels of vesting. 
Foreign currencies 
The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the weighted 
average of monthly exchange rates for revenue and proﬁ ts. 
The statements of ﬁ nancial position of overseas subsidiaries are 
translated at year end exchange rates. The resulting exchange 
diff erences are booked into reserves and reported in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency 
monetary assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting 
period are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. The resulting 
exchange gain or loss is recognised within the income statement, 
except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying 
cash ﬂ ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
Taxation 
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in 
the income statement, except to the extent it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in 
which case the related tax is recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity.
Provision is made for uncertain tax positions when it is considered 
probable that there will be a future outﬂ ow of funds to a tax 
authority. The provision is calculated using the single best estimate 
where that outcome is more likely than not and a weighted average 
probability in other circumstances. The position is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, to ensure appropriate provision is made for each 
known tax risk. 99

OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Deferred tax is accounted for using a temporary diff erence 
approach, and is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on 
temporary diff erences between the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities in the statement of ﬁ nancial position and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t. 
Deferred tax is calculated based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, applying tax rates and laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the end of the reporting period. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary diff erences. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for 
taxable temporary diff erences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the reversal 
of the temporary diff erence can be controlled by the Group and it is 
probable that the diff erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary diff erences 
that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable 
that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against which the deductible 
temporary diff erences can be utilised. The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
suffi  cient taxable proﬁ ts will be available to allow all or part of 
the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of 
temporary diff erences that arise on initial recognition of assets 
and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s 
statement of ﬁ nancial position when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
A. Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recorded 
initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
Subsequently, this results in their recognition at nominal value less 
any allowance for any doubtful debts. 
B. Other ﬁ nancial assets Other ﬁ nancial assets consist of 
investments in debt and equity securities and short-term 
investments and are classiﬁ ed as either ‘available-for-sale’ or ‘fair 
value through proﬁ t and loss’. Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets are 
initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the ﬁ nancial asset. Financial assets 
held at fair value through proﬁ t and loss are initially recognised at 
fair value and transaction costs are expensed. 
Where securities are designated as ‘fair value through proﬁ t and 
loss’, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included 
in the income statement for the period. For ‘available-for-sale’ 
investments, gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised in other comprehensive income, until the security 
is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time 
the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is included in the income statement for 
the period. Equity investments that do not have a quoted market 
price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably 
measured by other means are held at cost. 
C. Classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial liabilities and equity Financial 
liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁ ed according to the 
substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
D. Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are 
initially recorded at fair value, which equals the proceeds received, 
net of direct issue costs. They are subsequently held at amortised 
cost. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement 
or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for using an 
eff ective interest rate method and are added to the carrying 
amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.
E. Loan notes Long-term loans are initially measured at fair value 
net of direct issue costs and are subsequently held at amortised 
cost unless the loan is designated in a hedge relationship, in which 
case hedge accounting treatment will apply. 
F. Trade payables Trade payables are recorded initially at fair value 
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Generally this 
results in their recognition at their nominal value. 
G. Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recorded at the consideration received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments and hedging activities 
The Group primarily uses interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps 
and forward foreign currency contracts to manage its exposures 
to ﬂ uctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These 
instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the trade date 
and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of 
the reporting period. The method of recognising the resulting gain 
or loss is dependent on whether the derivative is designated as 
a hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either: 
> A hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in 
the cash ﬂ ows of a recognised asset or liability (a cash ﬂ ow hedge). 
> A hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of 
a recognised asset or liability (a fair value hedge). 
> A hedge of the exposure on the translation of net investments 
in foreign entities (a net investment hedge). 
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item are documented, along with the risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions and prospective eff ectiveness testing is 
performed. During the life of the hedging relationship, prospective 
and retrospective eff ectiveness testing is performed to ensure 
the instrument remains an eff ective hedge of the transaction. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. 
A. Cash ﬂ ow hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments that are designated and eff ective as hedges 
of future cash ﬂ ows are recognised in other comprehensive income 
in the hedging reserve and any ineff ective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. If the ﬁ rm commitment or 
forecast transaction that is the subject of a cash ﬂ ow hedge results 
in the recognition of a non-ﬁ nancial asset or liability, then, at the 
time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or 
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement 
of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a 
liability, amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are 
recognised in the income statement in the same period in which 
the hedged items aff ect net proﬁ t or loss. 
B. Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of a derivative 
instrument designated in a fair value hedge, or, for non-derivatives 
the foreign currency component of carrying value, are recognised 
in the income statement. The hedged item is adjusted for 
changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged 
with the corresponding entry in the income statement.  100
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
C. Net investment hedges Changes in the fair value of derivative 
or non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that are designated and 
eff ective as hedges of net investments are recognised in other 
comprehensive income in the hedging reserve and any ineff ective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that 
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income 
statement as they arise. 
D. Discontinuance of hedge accounting Hedge accounting is 
discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, the hedge relationship no longer 
qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting, the forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur or the Group de-designates the 
hedge relationship.
When a cash ﬂ ow hedge is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive 
income is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. 
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
when the forecast transaction is no longer highly probable but is 
still expected to occur, are recognised in the income statement. 
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss recognised in comprehensive income is 
transferred to the income statement for the period. 
When a fair value hedge is discontinued, the fair value adjustment 
to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged 
risk is amortised to the income statement from that date. 
When a net investment hedge is discontinued, the subsequent 
changes in fair value of a derivative (or foreign exchange gains/
losses on recognised ﬁ nancial liabilities) are recognised in the 
income statement. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassiﬁ ed to the 
income statement only on disposal of the net investment. 
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge income statement 
translation exposures. 
Embedded derivatives 
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts 
and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the income statement. Embedded 
derivatives are carried in the statement of ﬁ nancial position at fair 
value from the inception of the host contract. 
Changes in fair value are recognised within the income statement 
during the period in which they arise. 
Critical accounting judgements and sources of estimation 
uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated ﬁ nancial statements requires 
the Group to make estimates and judgements that aff ect the 
application of policies and reported amounts. 
Critical judgements represent key decisions made by management 
in the application of the Group accounting policies. Where a 
signiﬁ cant risk of materially diff erent outcomes exists due to 
management assumptions or sources of estimation uncertainty, 
this will represent a critical accounting estimate. Estimates and 
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future 
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
Actual results may diff er from these estimates. 
The estimates and judgements which have a signiﬁ cant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities are discussed below. 
Critical accounting judgements
Adjusted items The directors believe that the adjusted proﬁ t 
and earnings per share measures provide additional useful 
information for shareholders on the performance of the business. 
These measures are consistent with how business performance 
is measured internally by the Board and Operating Committee. 
The adjusted proﬁ t before tax measure is not a recognised 
proﬁ t measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable 
with adjusted proﬁ t measures used by other companies. The 
classiﬁ cation of adjusted items requires signiﬁ cant management 
judgement after considering the nature and intentions of 
a transaction. 
Note 5 provides further details on current year adjusted items and 
their adherence to Group policy. 
Sources of estimation uncertainty
Useful lives and residual values of property, plant and 
equipment Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of 
property, plant and equipment to their estimated residual values 
over their estimated useful lives, as set out above. The selection 
of the residual values and useful lives gives rise to estimation 
uncertainty. The Group is undertaking a strategic multi-year 
programme in relation to the UK store estate which will result 
in future store closures. The timing of these closures and the 
identiﬁ cation of the speciﬁ c stores that will be impacted are not 
yet known, giving rise to additional estimation uncertainty when 
assessing the residual values and useful lives as at 1 April 201 7 . 
The useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
by management annually. See note 1 5 for further details. 
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant 
and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not 
be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, 
the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
calculations. This method requires the Group to determine the 
appropriate period over which to assess future cash ﬂ ows and 
discount rate assumptions. See notes 1 4 and 1 5 for further details 
on the Group's assumptions and associated sensitivities. 
Post-retirement beneﬁ ts The determination of the pension cost 
and deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation of the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes depends on the selection of certain assumptions 
which include the discount rate, inﬂ ation rate, salary growth, 
mortality and expected return on scheme assets. Diff erences 
arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions 
will be reﬂ ected in subsequent periods. The fair value of unquoted 
investments within total plan assets is determined using fair value 
estimates provided by the manager of the investment or fund. 
See note 1 1 for further details on the impact of changes in the key 
assumptions and estimates and note 1 2 for critical judgements 
associated with the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme interest 
in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership.
Revenue recognition Accruals for sales returns, deferred income 
in relation to loyalty scheme redemptions and gift card and credit 
voucher redemptions are estimated on the basis of historical 
returns and redemptions. These are recorded so as to be allocated 
against revenue in the same period as that in which the original 
revenue is recorded. These balances are reviewed regularly and 
updated to reﬂ ect management’s latest best estimates. However, 
actual returns and redemptions could vary from those estimates. 
International closure costs During the year the Group announced 
its strategy for the International business resulting in the planned 
exit from owned stores in ten international markets. The Group will 
incur signiﬁ cant closure costs associated with the exits which gives 
rise to estimation uncertainty at 1 April 201 7 , most notably in respect 
of the expected costs to exit leases and the expected redundancy 
costs. See note 5 for further details.
Inventory provisioning Inventory provisions are recognised where 
the net realisable value from the sale of inventory is estimated to be 
lower than its carrying value, requiring estimation of the expected 
future sale price. The estimation includes judgement on a number 
of factors including historic sales patterns, expected sales proﬁ les, 
potential obsolescence and shrinkage. 101

2 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identiﬁ ed on the basis of internal reporting on components of the Group that are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. 
The chief operating decision maker has been identiﬁ ed as the Operating Committee. The Operating Committee reviews the Group's internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources across each operating segment. The operating segments are UK and 
International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the Operating Committee.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations. The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer 
owned businesses in Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The Operating Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating proﬁ t. This 
measurement basis excludes the eff ects of adjusted items from the operating segments. The Operating Committee also monitors 
revenue within the segments and gross proﬁ t within the UK segment. To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an 
additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments by sub-category and gross proﬁ t within the UK 
segment by sub-category.

International business of (£19.3m) and impairment costs of (£23.7m) related to the Clothing & Home buying and merchandising systems.
Changes to pay and pensions (£156.0m)
On 25 May 201 6, the Group announced proposals for a fairer, simpler and more consistent approach to pay and premia as well as proposals 
to close the UK deﬁ ned beneﬁ t (DB) pension scheme to future accrual eff ective from 1 April 201 7 . The consultation with employees on these 
changes completed on 2 September 201 6. 
The closure of the UK DB pension scheme to future accrual has resulted in a curtailment charge of £1 27 .0m. As all remaining active members 
of the scheme have transitioned to deferred status, all future pensionable increases will be in line with inﬂ ation (CPI) as opposed to the lower 
1% salary cap applied to active members. Other costs of £5.4m directly associated with the closure, primarily in relation to third party 
advisory costs, have also been incurred. 
The Group considers the curtailment cost and directly associated costs to be an adjusted item on the basis that they relate to a signiﬁ cant 
cost impacting the Group results.
Following the completion of the consultation in respect of pay and premia, the Group has committed to transition payments of £23.6m 
in respect of the removal of premia. The full amount of £23.6m has been recognised as a liability at 1 April 201 7 as the criteria for recognition 
under IAS 37 have been met at this date. 
The Group anticipates making further transition payments to impacted employees in relation to the closure of the UK DB scheme, expected 
to  be c. £25m in total over the next three years. These amounts will be recognised within adjusted items in future years as incurred. 
The premia buyout costs are considered to be an adjusted item as they represent costs that are signiﬁ cant in value to the results of 
the Group. 
Strategic programmes – UK organisation (£24.0m)
During the year, the Group announced the results of a wide-ranging strategic review across a number of areas of the business including 
customer, brand, UK organisation, UK store estate and International. The completion of this review has resulted in the Group incurring 
a number of signiﬁ cant charges. 
On 5 September 20 1 6, following completion of a detailed review of the UK organisation, the Group announced changes to the UK Head Offi  ce 
structure. The changes have resulted in a net reduction of c.590 Head Offi  ce roles achieved through a combination of fewer contractors, 
natural attrition and redundancies and resulted in costs of £ 1 5.4m inclusive of fees. 
On 2 March 201 7 , as part of the ongoing strategic programme, the Group announced an 1 8-month programme to centralise its London 
Head Offi  ce functions into one building. The Group has recognised a net charge of £8.6m associated with this rationalisation, inclusive of 
the impairment and write-off  of assets upon exit of vacated buildings, an expected net sub-let shortfall and the costs of relocation.
These costs are considered to be an adjusted item as they are signiﬁ cant in value and relate to a strategic initiative. As a result, they are not 
considered to be normal operating costs of the business.
Strategic programmes – UK store estate (£51.6m)
The Group has revised its previously announced strategic programme in relation to the UK store estate. As part of this programme, ten UK 
stores were approved for closure in the period, resulting in closure costs of £47 .3m relating to dilapidations, sub-let shortfalls, accelerated 
depreciation of ﬁ xtures and ﬁ ttings and impairment of assets. The balance of the charges of £4.3m in the period relate to the ongoing review 
of assumptions associated with previously closed stores. 
Whilst costs associated with the closure and re-conﬁ guration of the UK store estate will recur across ﬁ nancial years, the Group considers 
that they should be treated as an adjusted item given they are part of a strategic programme and are signiﬁ cant in value to the results of 
the Group. 104

Strategic programmes – International store closures and impairments (£132.5m)
The Group has announced its intention to close its owned stores in ten international markets, resulting in the recognition of a cost of £1 30.5m 
in the period. The expected closure costs primarily relate to redundancy, lease exit and property dilapidations. The closure programmes 
are ongoing in all markets, with the exception of China, where the ﬁ nal store was closed on 1 April 201 7 . The costs are considered to be an 
adjusted item as they are part of a strategic programme and are signiﬁ cant in both value and nature to the results of the Group. 
International store impairment testing during the year identiﬁ ed a number of stores where current and anticipated future performance 
does not support the carrying value of the stores, with a resulting impairment charge of £9.0m being incurred, which is considered 
signiﬁ cant in value to the results of the International segment. Refer to note 1 5 for further details of these impairments.
Off setting these store impairments are credits of £7 .0m relating to the reversal of historic impairments against ﬁ ve stores and the release of 
unutilised provisions on completion of the exit from the Balkans. This impairment reversal and release are considered to be adjusted items, 
consistent with treatment in previous periods when the original charges were recognised as adjusted items.
UK store impairments and onerous lease charges (£48.8m)
The UK store impairment testing during the year has identiﬁ ed a number of stores where the current and anticipated future performance 
does not support the carrying value of the stores. As a result, a charge of £39.4m has been incurred in respect of the impairment of assets 
associated with these stores. A future charge of £9.4m has been incurred in respect of onerous lease provisions associated with some of 
these stores. Refer to note 1 5 for further details of these impairments.
The charges associated with the impairment of stores and associated onerous leases have been classiﬁ ed as an adjusted item on the basis 
of the signiﬁ cant value of the charge in the year to the results of the Group.
M&S Bank charges incurred in relation to the insurance mis-selling provision (£44.1m) 
The Group has an economic interest in M&S Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, by way of a Relationship Agreement that entitles the 
Group to a 50% share of the proﬁ ts of M&S Bank after appropriate deductions. The Group does not share in any losses of M&S Bank and is not 
obliged to refund any proﬁ t share received from HSBC, although future income may be impacted by signiﬁ cant deductions.
Since the year ended 3 1 December 2010, M&S Bank has recognised in its audited ﬁ nancial statements an estimated liability for redress to 
customers in respect of possible mis-selling of ﬁ nancial products. The Group’s income from M&S Bank has been reduced by the deduction 
of our share of the estimated liability in both the current and prior years. The deduction in the period is £44.1 m.
The Group considers this cost to be an adjusted item, despite its recurring nature, as the charges are signiﬁ cant in nature and value in each 
period to the results of the Group. 
UK logistics (£9.8m credit)
A net credit of £9.8m has been recognised in the year relating to an updated view of the estimated closure costs of legacy logistics sites 
associated with the transition to a single tier distribution network. This credit largely arises following a decision to retain two logistics 
warehouses within the network which had previously been identiﬁ ed for closure. This net credit is considered to be an adjusted item, 
consistent with treatment in previous periods when the original charges were recognised as an adjusted item. 
Legal settlements (£9.8m credit)
During the year, the Group has reached various legal settlements resulting in a net credit to the income statement of £9.8m. No further 
detail is provided in respect of these legal settlements due to the requirement to comply with conﬁ dentiality clauses within the agreements.
The settlements are considered to be adjusted items as they are signiﬁ cant in value to the results of the Group or to the segment.

to 1 9% from 1 April 201 7 and 1 7% from 1 April 2020. The Group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the 
reporting period at the rates of 1 9% and 1 7% based on an expectation of when those balances are expected to unwind. This has resulted in 
the recognition of a deferred tax charge of £0.4m in the income statement and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of £1 1.0m in other

8 EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the year.
The adjusted earnings per share ﬁ gures have also been calculated based on earnings before adjusted items that are signiﬁ cant in nature 
and/or value (see note 5). These have been presented to provide shareholders with an additional measure of the Group's year-on-year 
performance.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. The Group has four types of dilutive potential ordinary shares being: those share options granted to employees 
where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the year; unvested shares 
granted under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan; unvested shares granted under the Restricted Share Plan; and unvested shares within 
the Performance Share Plan that have met the relevant performance conditions at the end of the reporting period.

11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group provides pension arrangements for the beneﬁ t of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme 
(a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t (DB) arrangement) and Your M&S Pension Saving Plan (a deﬁ ned contribution (DC) arrangement). 
The UK DB pension scheme operated on a ﬁ nal salary basis and is governed by a Trustee board which is independent of the Group. 
On closure of the UK DB pension scheme, all remaining active members moved to deferred status which resulted in a curtailment charge 
of £1 27 .0m. There will be no future service charge relating to the scheme and no future monthly employer contributions for current service. 
At year end the UK DB pension scheme had no active members (last year 1 1,1 76), 62,655 deferred members (last year 53,589) and 51,198 
pensioners (last year 5 1,047). 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme was carried out as at 3 1 March 201 5 and showed a funding 
surplus of £204m. During the year the Group paid the ﬁ nal contribution of £28m, as agreed at the 201 2 actuarial valuation, in respect of 
beneﬁ ts already accrued by members. In addition, the UK DB pension scheme will continue to receive income from the Scottish Limited 
Partnership. See Note 1 2 for further details.
The DC plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays contributions to an independently administered fund. Such contributions are 
based upon a ﬁ xed percentage of employees’ pay. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions to the 
fund once the contributions have been paid. Members’ beneﬁ ts are determined by the amount of contributions paid by the Group and the 
member, together with the investment returns earned on the contributions arising from the performance of each individual’s investments 
and how each member chooses to receive their retirement beneﬁ ts. As a result, actuarial risk (that beneﬁ ts will be lower than expected) 
and investment risk (that assets invested in will not perform in line with expectations) fall on the employee. At the year end, the deﬁ ned 
contribution arrangement had some 53,66 1 active members (last year 40,71 2) and some 1 2,866 deferred members (last year 8,823).
The Group also operates a small funded DB pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland. This scheme closed to future accrual on 
3 1 October 201 3. Other retirement beneﬁ ts also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement beneﬁ ts.
The total Group retirement beneﬁ t cost was £1 98.4m (last year £86.7m). Of this, £1 48.0m (last year £4 1.0m) relates to the UK DB pension 
scheme including curtailment charges, £45.1 m (last year £40.3m) to the UK DC plan and £5.3m (last year £5.4m) to other retirement 
beneﬁ t schemes. 109

OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
11 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED
By funding its DB pension schemes, the Group is exposed to the risk that the cost of meeting its obligations is higher than anticipated. 
This could occur for several reasons, for example:
> Investment returns on the schemes’ assets may be lower than anticipated, especially if falls in asset values are not matched by similar 
falls in the value of the schemes’ liabilities.
> The level of price inﬂ ation may be higher than that assumed, resulting in higher payments from the schemes.
> Scheme members may live longer than assumed, for example due to advances in healthcare. Members may also exercise (or not exercise) 
options in a way that lead to increases in the schemes’ liabilities, for example through early retirement or commutation of pension 
for cash.
> Legislative changes could also lead to an increase in the schemes’ liabilities. 
In addition, the Group is exposed to additional risks through its obligation to the UK DB pension scheme via its interest in the Scottish 
Limited Partnership (see note 1 2). In particular, under the legal terms of the Partnership, a default by the Group on the rental payments 
to the Partnership or a future change in legislation could trigger earlier or higher payments to the pension scheme, or an increase in the 
collateral to be provided by the Group.

Retirement beneﬁ t deﬁ cit (13.2) (26.9)
Net retirement beneﬁ t surplus 692.8 824.1 
In the event of a plan wind-up, the pension scheme rules provide M&S with an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets assuming 
the full settlement of plan liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, the Trustees have no rights to wind up or change the beneﬁ ts due 
to members of the scheme. As a result, any net surplus in the UK DB pension scheme is recognised in full.
B. Financial assumptions
The ﬁ nancial assumptions for the UK DB pension scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes 
have been updated by independent qualiﬁ ed actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 1 9 ‘Employee Beneﬁ ts’ in order to assess 
the liabilities of the schemes and are as follows:

C. Demographic assumptions
The UK demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme performed as at 
3 1 March 201 5. The UK post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the 
scheme for the period to March 201 5. The speciﬁ c mortality rates used are based on the VITA lite tables. The life expectancies underlying 
the valuation are as follows:
2017 2016
Current pensioners (at age 65) – males 23.2 23.1
 – female 24.7 24.6
Future pensioners – currently in active status (at age 65)  – males N/A

23.6
 – female N/A
1
26.2
Future pensioners – currently in deferred status (at age 65)  – males 24.7 24.1
 – female 27.1 26.4
1. No future pensioners currently in an active status. All employees in the UK DB pension scheme are in deferred status due to the decision to close the scheme to future accrual from 
1 April 201 7 .
D. Sensitivity analysis
The table below summarises the estimated impact of changes in the principal actuarial assumptions on the UK DB pension scheme surplus:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Decrease in scheme surplus caused by a decrease in the discount rate of 0.25% (70.0) (90.0)
Decrease in scheme surplus caused by a decrease in the inﬂ ation rate of 0.25% (20.0) 20.0 
Increase in scheme surplus caused by a decrease in the average life expectancy of one year 370.0 300.0 
The sensitivity analysis above is based on a change in one assumption while holding all others constant. Therefore interdependencies 
between the assumptions have not been taken into account within the analysis.
E. Analysis of assets
The investment strategy of the UK DB pension scheme is driven by its liability proﬁ le, including its inﬂ ation-linked pension beneﬁ ts. 
In addition to its interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership (see note 1 2), the scheme invests in diff erent types of bonds (including

to align movements in the value of its assets with movements in its liabilities arising from changes in market conditions. Broadly, the 
scheme has hedging that covers 92% of interest rate movements and 90% of inﬂ ation movements, as measured on the Trustees’ funding

12 MARKS AND SPENCER SCOTTISH LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
Marks and Spencer plc is a general partner and the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme is a limited partner of the Marks and Spencer 
Scottish Limited Partnership (the Partnership). Under the partnership agreement, the limited partners have no involvement in the 
management of the business and shall not take any part in the control of the partnership. The general partner is responsible for the 
management and control of the partnership and as such, the Partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group. 
The Partnership holds £1.6bn (last year £1.6bn) of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates. The 
Group retains control over these properties, including the ﬂ exibility to substitute alternative properties into the Partnership. The ﬁ rst limited 
partnership interest (held by the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme), entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 
£71.9m until 2022 from the Partnership. The second partnership interest (also held by the Marks and Spencer UK Pension Scheme), entitles 
the Pension Scheme to receive a further £36.4m annually from 201 7 until 203 1.
The partnership liability in relation to the ﬁ rst interest of £396.5m (last year £455.7m) is valued at the net present value of the future 
expected distributions from the Partnership. During the year to 1 April 201 7 an interest charge of £1 2.6m (last year £1 4.7m) was recognised 
in the income statement representing the unwind of the discount included in this obligation. 
The ﬁ rst limited partnership interest of the Pension Scheme is included within the UK DB Pension Scheme assets, valued at £4 1 2.1 m 
(last year £469.5m). It is also included as a liability on the Group's statement of ﬁ nancial position as it is a transferable ﬁ nancial instrument. 
The second partnership interest is not a transferable ﬁ nancial instrument and therefore is not included as a plan asset in accordance 
with IAS 1 9. The associated liability is eliminated on consolidation.
13 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
This year a charge of £10.6m was recognised for share-based payments (last year charge of £1 6.0m). Of the total share-based payments 
charge, £10.9m (last year £9.5m) relates to the Save As You Earn Scheme and a credit of £3.6m (last year charge of £1.1 m) relates to the 
Performance Share Plan. The remaining charge of £3.3m (last year £5.4m) is spread over the other share plans. An additional charge of £1.3m 
was recognised in relation to the Annual Bonus Scheme for 201 6/1 7 under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan. Further details of the operation 
of the Group share plans are provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 78.
A. Save As You Earn Scheme 
The SA YE Scheme was last approved by shareholders in 2007 and shareholder approval is being sought at the 201 7 AGM to renew the 
scheme for a further ten years. Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may off er options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company 
once in each ﬁ nancial year to those employees who enter into an Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) approved SA YE savings 
contract. The Company has chosen to cap the maximum monthly saving amount at £250 which is below the £500 per month allowed 
under HMRC approved schemes. The price at which options may be off ered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive 
dealing days preceding the off er date. The options may normally be exercised during the six-month period after the completion of the 
SA YE contract.

B. Performance Share Plan* 
The Performance Share Plan is the primary long-term incentive plan for approximately 1 20 of the most senior managers within the Group. 
It was ﬁ rst approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM and again at the 201 5 AGM. Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of 
salary, may be off ered. The extent to which an award vests is measured over a three-year period against ﬁ nancial targets which for 201 6/1 7 
included Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Return on Capital Employed and free cash ﬂ ow. The value of any dividends earned on the vested 
shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting. Further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 66 to 78. 
Awards under this plan have been made in each year since 2005. 
During the year, 7 ,569,499 shares (last year 5,850,1 34) were awarded under the plan. The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded 
was 328.0p (last year 533.2p). As at 1 April 201 7 , there were 1 4,8 1 6,764 shares (last year 1 5,7 49,605) outstanding under the plan.
C. Deferred Share Bonus Plan* 
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005/06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 500 of the most senior 
managers within the Group. As part of the Scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which 
will be held for three years. There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment within the 
Group and the value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the deferred period will also be paid on vesting. 
During the year, 1,563,439 shares (last year 1,044,96 1 ) have been awarded under the plan in relation to the annual bonus. The fair value of 
the shares awarded was 355.8p (last year 548.3p). As at 1 April 201 7 , there were 3,033,709 shares (last year 2,586,096) outstanding under 
the plan.
D. Restricted Share Plan* 
The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are 
vital to the success of the business. The plan operates for senior managers below executive director level. Awards vest at the end of the 
restricted period (typically between one and three years) subject to the participant still being in the employment of the Company on the 
relevant vesting date. The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the restricted period will also be paid on vesting. 
During the year, 32 1,229 shares (last year 22 1,68 1 ) have been awarded under the plan. The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded 
was 326.6p (last year 454.4p). As at 1 April 201 7 , there were 888,027 shares (last year 1,285,666) outstanding under the plan.
E. Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn Scheme 
Sharesave, the Company’s SA YE Scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a ten-year period, after 
approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM. The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving to 
€500 per month. The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of €320 per month to align the maximum savings amount to 
that allowed within the UK scheme. The price at which options may be off ered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive 
dealing days preceding the off er date. The options may normally be exercised during the six-month period after the completion of the 
SA YE contract. 
During the year, 324,768 options (last year 1 60,1 1 3) were granted, at a fair value of 66.3p (last year 95.6p). As at 1 April 201 7 , there were 
52 1,837 options (last year 3 1 2,826) outstanding under the scheme.
F. Marks and Spencer Employee Beneﬁ t Trust 
The Marks and Spencer Employee Beneﬁ t Trust (the Trust) holds 2,1 73,101 (last year 4,087 ,837) shares with a book value of £10.7m (last year 
£20.6m) and a market value of £7 .3m (last year £1 6.6m). These shares were acquired by the Trust in the market and are shown as a reduction 
in retained earnings in the consolidated statement of ﬁ nancial position. Awards are granted to employees at the discretion of Marks and 
Spencer plc and the Trust agrees to satisfy the awards in accordance with the wishes of Marks and Spencer plc under senior executive share 
plans described above. Dividends are waived on all of these shares. 
G. ShareBuy
ShareBuy, the Company’s Share Incentive Plan enables the participants to buy shares directly from their gross salary. This scheme does not 
attract an IFRS 2 charge. 
* Nil cost options. For the purposes of calculating the number of shares awarded, the share price used is the average of the mid-market price for the ﬁ ve consecutive dealing days 
preceding the grant date. 114

Impairment testing
Goodwill is not amortised but tested annually for impairment with the recoverable amount being determined from value in use calculations. 
Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) which include the combined retail 
and wholesale businesses for each location. 
The costs in relation to the per una brand are £80.0m (net book value £1 3.4m). The per una brand is a deﬁ nite life intangible asset amortised 
on a straight-line basis over a period of 1 5 years and is only assessed for impairment where such indicators exist. 
The value in use calculations are based on the Group’s latest budget and forecast cash ﬂ ows, covering a three-year period, which have 
regard to historic performance and knowledge of the current market, together with the Group’s views on the future achievable growth 
and the impact of committed cash ﬂ ows. The cash ﬂ ows include ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain the store network, but 
exclude any growth capital initiatives not committed. Cash ﬂ ows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a ﬂ at long-term 
growth rate for the UK and with reference to forecast GDP growth for India. These growth rates do not exceed the long-term growth rates 
for the Group’s retail businesses in these territories. 
While management believes the assumptions used are realistic, it is possible that a further impairment could be identiﬁ ed for per una, 
Bradford or India if any of the above key assumptions were changed signiﬁ cantly. A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of 
these key assumptions with other variables held constant. Management has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes 
in any key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of goodwill or brands to exceed the value in use.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
For impairment testing purposes, the Group has determined that each store is a separate CGU with the exception of outlet stores which are 
considered together as one CGU. Each CGU is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date if any indicators of impairment have been 
identiﬁ ed. The recoverable value of each CGU is determined to be the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. 
The value in use of each CGU is calculated based on the Group’s latest budget and forecast cash ﬂ ows, covering a three-year period, which 
have regard to historic performance and knowledge of the current market, together with the Group’s views on the future achievable growth 
and the impact of committed initiatives. The cash ﬂ ows include ongoing capital expenditure required to maintain the store network, but 
exclude any growth capital initiatives not committed. Cash ﬂ ows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated using a ﬂ at long-term 
growth rate for UK stores and with reference to forecast GDP growth for other territories. These growth rates do not exceed the long-term 
growth rate for the Group’s retail businesses in these territories.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the growth rates of sales and gross proﬁ t margins, changes in the operating cost 
base, long-term growth rates and the risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which speciﬁ c market-related premium adjustments are 
made for each territory. The pre-tax discount rates range from 7% to 2 1 % (last year 7% to 24%).
Where appropriate, fair value less cost to sell is determined with regard to the expected rent and yield for each property and reﬂ ect the 
speciﬁ c characteristics relevant to each property and the location in which it is based. The fair values have been determined with the 
assistance of independent, professional valuers.
During the year the Group has recognised a net impairment charge of £43.4m (gross impairment charge of £47 .5m off set by an impairment 
reversal of £4.1 m) as a result of store impairment testing. The gross impairment charge relates primarily to stores in the UK and Hong Kong, 
with the reversal of impairment relating to stores in Ireland due largely to the movement in the Sterling to Euro currency rate. These 
impairments, including the reversal, have been recognised within adjusted items (see Note 5).
The Group has performed a sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests for its UK store portfolio using various reasonably possible 
scenarios. An increase of one percentage point in the post-tax discount rate would have resulted in an increase to the impairment charge 
of £6.5m. Neither a 2% reduction in year one sales growth nor a 20bps reduction in total UK margin would result in a signiﬁ cant increase to 
the impairment charge.
In addition the Group has recognised additional impairment charges of £27 .3m associated with stores approved for closure during the year, 
£1 3.1 m associated with the exit from owned stores in ten international markets and £5.7m associated with the rationalisation of UK Head 
Offi  ces. Off setting these charges were impairment reversals of £7 .4m following an updated view of the logistics strategy. These net charges 
have been recognised within adjusted items (see Note 5).

Finance leases 
The minimum lease payments under ﬁ nance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page. It is the Group’s policy to lease 
certain properties and equipment under ﬁ nance leases. The weighted average lease term for equipment is three years (last year four years) 
and 95 years (last year 96 years) for property. Interest rates are ﬁ xed at the contract rate. All leases are on a ﬁ xed repayment basis and no 
arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments. The Group’s obligations under ﬁ nance leases are secured by the lessors’ 
charges over the leased assets. 118

Treasury policy
The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Group’s funding requirements and ﬁ nancial risks in line with the Board 
approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities. 
The Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade 
receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these ﬁ nancial instruments is to ﬁ nance the 
Group’s operations. 
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and forward 
currency contracts. The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations and ﬁ nancing. 
It remains the Group’s policy not to hold or issue ﬁ nancial instruments for trading purposes, except where ﬁ nancial constraints necessitate the 
liquidation of any outstanding investments. The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
Financial risk management 
The principal ﬁ nancial risks faced by the Group are liquidity and funding, counterparty, foreign currency and interest rate risks. The policies 
and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: 
(a) Liquidity and funding risk 
The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due. 
> The Group’s funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources off ering suffi  cient headroom, maturity and ﬂ exibility and cost 
eff ectiveness to match the requirements of the Group. 
> Marks and Spencer plc is ﬁ nanced by a combination of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed 
syndicated bank facilities.
> Operating subsidiaries are ﬁ nanced by a combination of retained proﬁ ts, bank borrowings and intercompany loans.
At the year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of £1.1 bn set to mature on 1 5 April 2022. During the 
current ﬁ nancial year, the Group extended the facility by one year. This facility contains only one ﬁ nancial covenant, being the ratio of 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable, to interest plus rents payable. The covenant is measured semi-
annually. The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it. At the year end, these amounted to £1 50m (last 
year £100m), all of which are due to be reviewed within a year. At the balance sheet date, a sterling equivalent of £nil (last year £205m) was 
drawn under the committed facilities and £nil (last year £30m) was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a Euro Medium Term Note programme of £3bn, of which £1.4bn (last year £1.1bn) was in 
issuance as at the balance sheet date. A new £300m bond, set to mature in 2023, was issued under the Euro Medium Term Note programme 
during the ﬁ nancial year.

(b) Counterparty risk 
Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suff er ﬁ nancial loss through default or non-performance by ﬁ nancial institutions with whom 
it transacts. 
Exposures are managed in accordance with the Group’s treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved 
counterparty to minimise the risk of loss. The minimum long-term rating for all counterparties is long-term Standard & Poor’s (A-)/Moody’s 
(A3) ((BBB+/Baa 1 for committed lending banks). In the event of a rating by one agency being diff erent to the other, reference will be made 
to Fitch to determine the casting vote of the rating group. In the absence of a Fitch rating, the lower rating will prevail. Limits are reviewed 
regularly by senior management. The credit risk of these ﬁ nancial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from 
the contracts.

and cash in transit.

(c) Foreign currency risk 
Transactional foreign currency exposures arise primarily from the import of goods sourced from overseas suppliers and also from the 
export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries. The most signiﬁ cant exposure is to the US dollar incurred in the sourcing of clothing 
and home products from Asia. 
Group Treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively based on dynamic forecasts 
from the business. Hedging begins around 1 5 months ahead of the start of the season and is between 80% and 100% hedged nine months 
before the start of the season.
Other exposures from the export of goods to overseas subsidiaries are also hedged progressively over the course of the year before 
they are incurred. As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts 
amounted to £2,023m (last year £1,640m) with a weighted average maturity date of six months (last year ﬁ ve months). 
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts designated in cash ﬂ ow hedge relationships as at 1 April 201 7 will be 
released to the income statement at various dates over the following 1 7 months (last year 1 5 months) from the balance sheet date.
The Group also holds a number of cross-currency swaps to designate its ﬁ xed rate US dollar debt to ﬁ xed rate sterling debt. These are 
reported as cash ﬂ ow hedges. 
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures. As at the balance 
sheet date €26m (last year €nil) and HK$ 1 90m (last year HK$ 1,245m) of derivatives were hedging overseas net assets. 
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist. Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the 
hedging of the Group’s foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised 
in the income statement. The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance resulted in a £2.3m gain (last year £nil) 
in the income statement. As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was £367m (last year £289m). 
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group’s ﬁ nancial 
liabilities, excluding short-term payables and the liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme, is set out below:

The ﬂ oating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR. These rates are for periods between one and 
six months. 
As at the balance sheet date and excluding ﬁ nance leases, the ﬁ xed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.0% (last year 5.3%) 
and the weighted average time for which the rate is ﬁ xed is six years (last year seven years). 
(d) Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar and euro variable rate ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. 
The Group’s policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of ﬁ xed and ﬂ oating rate borrowings to manage this risk. 
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash ﬂ ow 
hedges as appropriate. 
At the balance sheet date, ﬁ xed rate borrowings amounted to £1,734.5m (last year £1,350.0m) representing the public bond issues and 
ﬁ nance leases, amounting to 78% (last year 65%) of the Group’s gross borrowings.
The eff ective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows:

The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to re-designate its sterling ﬁ xed debt to ﬂ oating debt. These are reported as fair value 
hedges. The ineff ective portion recognised in the proﬁ t or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to £0.3m (last year £0.2m) as the 
loss on the hedged items was £0.3m (last year £3.0m loss) and the gain on the hedging instruments was £nil (last year £2.8m gain). The Group 
also holds a number of cross-currency swaps to re-designate its ﬁ xed rate US dollar debt to ﬁ xed rate sterling debt. These are reported as 
cash ﬂ ow hedges. 
Sensitivity analysis 
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange 
and interest rates in relation to the Group's ﬁ nancial instruments. The directors consider that a 2%+/- (last year 2%) movement in interest and 
a 20% +/- (last year 20%) weakening in sterling against the relevant currency represents a reasonably possible change. However, this analysis 
is for illustrative purposes only.
The table excludes ﬁ nancial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged 
with another ﬁ nancial instrument. Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign 
exchange risk is hedged.
Interest rates: the impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reﬂ ects the eff ect on the Group's ﬂ oating rate debt as at 
the balance sheet date. The impact in equity reﬂ ects the fair value movement in relation to the Group's transactional foreign exchange cash 
ﬂ ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date. The impact in equity reﬂ ects the fair value movement in relation to 
the Group's cross-currency swaps.
Foreign exchange: the impact from foreign exchange movements reﬂ ects the change in the fair value of the Group's transactional foreign 
exchange cash ﬂ ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date. The equity impact shown for foreign exchange 
sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments hedging net investments. This value is expected to be fully off set 
by the re-translation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.

The gross ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities set off  in the balance sheet primarily relate to cash pooling arrangements with banks. Amounts 
which do not meet the criteria for off setting on the statement of ﬁ nancial position but could be settled net in certain circumstances 
principally relate to derivative transactions under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements where each party 
has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.
Fair Value Hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments by valuation technique:
> Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
> Level 2: not traded in an active market but the fair values are based on quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable 
levels of price transparency. The Group’s Level 2 ﬁ nancial instruments include interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. Fair value is 
calculated using discounted cash ﬂ ow methodology, future cash ﬂ ows are estimated based on forward exchange rates and interest rates 
(from observable market curves) and contract rates, discounted at a rate that reﬂ ects the credit risk of the various counterparties for 
those with a long maturity.
> Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a signiﬁ cant eff ect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data.  123

The Marks & Spencer DB Pension Schemes holds a number of ﬁ nancial instruments which make up the pension asset of £10,1 35.1 m (last year 
£8,5 1 5.3m). Level 1 and Level 2 ﬁ nancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to £8,690.2m (last 
year £7 ,296.2m). Additionally, the pension scheme assets include £1,444.9m (last year £1,2 1 9.1 m) of Level 3 ﬁ nancial assets. See note 1 1 for 
information on the Group's retirement beneﬁ ts. 
There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy. In addition to the above, the Group has £3.0m (last year £3.0m) 
in unlisted equity securities measured at cost (see note 1 6). 
The following table represents the changes in Level 3 instruments held by the Pension Schemes:

Fair value gain recognised in other comprehensive income 100.6 70.3 
Additional investment/(derecognition) 125.2 55.2 
Closing balance 1,444.9 1,219.1
In the prior year the Group purchased Lima (Bradford) S.à r.l. This resulted in the derecognition of the embedded derivative as the lease 
contract was between subsidiaries of the Group. Gains recognised in the prior year income statement related to the valuation of the 
embedded derivative in the lease contract up until the acquisition date. The fair value movement of the embedded derivative of £2.0m 
loss and subsequent derecognition of the asset (£2 1.7m) was treated as an adjustment to reported proﬁ t in the prior year (see note 5). 
Fair value of ﬁ nancial instruments
With the exception of the Group’s ﬁ xed rate bond debt and the Partnership liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme, there were 
no material diff erences between the carrying value of non-derivative ﬁ nancial assets and ﬁ nancial liabilities and their fair values as at the 
balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Group’s ﬁ xed rate bond debt (Level 1 equivalent) was £2,1 10.7m (last year £1,726.4m); the fair value of this debt 
was £2,236.7m (last year £1,868.3m).
Capital policy
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns 
for shareholders and to maintain an effi  cient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so, the Group’s strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain 
appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure ﬁ nancial stability and ﬂ exibility. To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors 
key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash ﬂ ow to net debt (see note 27) and ﬁ xed charge cover to maintain this position. In addition, 
the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced long-term debt 
maturity proﬁ le. As at the balance sheet date, the Group’s average debt maturity proﬁ le was seven years (last year eight years). During the 
year, the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 (stable) with Moody’s and BBB- (stable) with Standard & Poor’s.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 124

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
C1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company’s accounting policies are the same as those set out in note 1 of the Group ﬁ nancial statements, except as noted below.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. The Company grants share-based 
payments to the employees of subsidiary companies. Each period, the fair value of the employee services received by the subsidiary as 
a capital contribution from the Company is reﬂ ected as an addition to investments in subsidiaries.
Loans from other Group undertakings and all other payables are initially recorded at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received. 
They are then subsequently carried at amortised cost. The loans are non-interest bearing and repayable on demand.
The Company’s ﬁ nancial risk is managed as part of the Group’s strategy and policies as discussed in note 2 1 of the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income 
statement or statement of comprehensive income.
C2 EMPLOYEES
The Company had no employees during the current or prior year. Directors received emoluments in respect of their services to the 
Company during the year of £936,000 (last year £956,000). The Company did not operate any pension schemes during the current or 
preceding year.
C3 AUDITOR’S REMUNERATION
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the Company’s annual audit has been borne by its subsidiary Marks and Spencer plc and has been 
disclosed on a consolidated basis in the Company’s consolidated ﬁ nancial statements as required by Section 494(4)(a) of the Companies 
Act 2006.

(see Note 2)
Where referred to throughout the Annual Report, gross margin is calculated 
as gross proﬁ t before adjusted items on a management basis divided by 
revenue. The gross proﬁ t used in this calculation is based on an internal 
measure of margin rather than the statutory margin, which excludes certain 
downstream logistics costs. This is a key internal management metric for 
assessing category performance.
Adjusted items None Not applicable Those items which the Group excludes from its adjusted proﬁ t metrics in 
order to present a further measure of the Group’s performance. Each of 
these items (costs or incomes) is considered to be signiﬁ cant in nature 
and/or value. Excluding these items from proﬁ t metrics provides readers 
with helpful additional information on the performance of the business 
across periods because it is consistent with how the business performance 
is reported to the Board and the Operating Committee.

Every 6 years an additional week is included within the statutory period to 
ensure that the year end date stays in line with the end of March. The prior 
year statutory ﬁ nancial measures were based on such a 53 week reporting 
period.
In order to provide a meaningful comparison with this year’s 52 week period, 
all ﬁ nancial movements in commentary relative to the prior year are provided 
on a 52 week basis and exclude the 53rd week, unless otherwise noted. The 
Group considers that presentation of comparatives on this basis enables 
stakeholders to more appropriately compare the performance of the 
business year on year. 
The 52 week period for the prior year has been used for management 
incentive purposes.
Balance Sheet Measures
Net debt None Reconciliation 
of net debt 
(see note 27)
Net debt comprises total borrowings (bank, bonds and ﬁ nance lease 
liabilities net of accrued interest), net derivative ﬁ nancial instruments that 
hedge the borrowings and the Scottish Limited Partnership liability to 
the UK pension scheme less cash, cash equivalents and unlisted and 
short-term investments.
This measure is a good indication of the strength of the Group’s balance 
sheet position and is widely used by credit rating agencies.
Capital employed Net assets Refer to deﬁ nition The net total of assets and liabilities as reported in the annual ﬁ nancial 
statement excluding assets and liabilities in relation to investment property, 
net retirement beneﬁ t position, derivatives, current and deferred tax 
liabilities, Scottish Limited Partnership liability, non-current borrowings 
and provisions in respect of adjusted items.
This measure is used in the calculation of Return on Capital Employed.

DUPLICATE DOCUMENTS
Many shareholders have more than one 
account on the share register and receive 
duplicate documentation from us as 
a result. If you fall into this group, please 
contact Equiniti to combine your accounts.
CORPORATE WEBSITE
You can access the corporate website at 
marksandspencer.com/thecompany.
The M&S corporate website provides 
a wealth of useful information for 
shareholders and should be your ﬁ rst port 
of call for general queries relating to the 
Company and its shares. Through the 
website you can also register to receive 
news alerts by email; simply click on 'alerts' 
in the top right corner and enter your details.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the ﬁ nancial 
information on our website. This information 
has been prepared under the relevant 
accounting standards and legislation.
CHANGING YOUR ADDRESS
You should inform Equiniti of your new 
address as soon as possible to avoid missing 
important correspondence relating to your 
shareholding. If you hold 2,500 shares or 
fewer and reside in the UK, this can be done 
quickly over the telephone. Holdings of 
more than 2,500 shares will require a written 
instruction quoting your full name, 1 1-digit 
shareholder reference number (if known) 
and both your previous and new addresses.
SHAREGIFT
If you have a very small shareholding that 
is uneconomical to sell, you may want 
to consider donating it to ShareGift 
(registered charity no. 1052686), a charity 
that specialises in the donation of small, 
unwanted shareholdings to good causes. 
Find out more by visiting sharegift.org 
or by calling +44 (0)207 930 3737 .
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
For the purpose of Capital Gains Tax (CGT), 
the price of an ordinary share on 3 1 March 
1 982 was 1 53.5p, which when adjusted for the 
1 for 1 scrip issue in 1 984, gives a ﬁ gure of 
76.75p. Following the capital reorganisation 
in March 2002, HMRC has conﬁ rmed that the 
base cost for CGT purposes was 372.35p 
(8 1.43%) for an ordinary share and 68.75p 
(1 8.75%) for a B share.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CONTINUED
An increasing number of shareholders 
have been contacting us to report 
unsolicited and suspicious phone calls 
received from purported ‘brokers’ who 
off er to buy their shares at a price far in 
excess of their market value. It is unlikely 
that ﬁrms authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) will contact you 
with off ers like this. As such, we believe 
these calls are part of a scam, commonly 
referred to as a ‘boiler room’. The callers 
obtain your details from publicly available 
sources of information, including the 
Company’s share register, and can be 
extremely persistent and persuasive. 
Shareholders are cautioned to be very 
wary of any unsolicited advice, off ers to 
buy shares at a discount, sell your shares 
at a premium or requests to complete 
conﬁ dentiality agreements with the callers. 
Remember, if it sounds too good to 
be true, it probably is! 
More detailed information and guidance 
is available on the shareholder information 
pages of our corporate website. We also 
encourage shareholders to read the 
FCA’s guidance on how to avoid scams 
at fca.org.uk/consumers/scams. 
An overview of current common 
scams can be found on the Action 
Fraud website actionfraud.police.uk.
