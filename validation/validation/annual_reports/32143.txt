3 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | At a glance Chairman’s statement
The expertise of our people is in high 
demand as customers look for innovative 
ways to defeat new threats to security.
 “Achieving our ambition of 
becoming the chosen partner 
requires a relentless focus 
on meeting the needs of our 
customers both in our home 
markets and overseas.”
Mark Elliott
Non-executive Chairman
Context 
FY17 will be remembered as the year in which many 
of the world’s most newsworthy events were influenced 
by the challenges being created by globalisation and 
a marked return to national politics. Over the summer, I 
engaged in discussions with Non-executive Directors of 
other companies listed on the London Stock Exchange 
about the risks and opportunities presented by Brexit. 
In the United States, where I have spent much of my 
working life, some of the political and economic 
conventions that have been in place for many years 
are being challenged and the Board and I are working 
closely with QinetiQ’s US leadership team to ensure 
that we are responding effectively to the new realities.
In defence and security, we are seeing increasing 
complexity with nations facing multiple global 
threats from both state and non-state actors. In 
this environment, QinetiQ continues to play a vital 
role making connections between technologies, 
across supply chains and internationally to support 
government customers with the rapid development 
of new capabilities to combat these threats. 
In April 2015, we appointed Steve Wadey as CEO of 
QinetiQ. Steve has significant defence sector experience 
and is implementing a strategy to deliver sustainable 
growth founded on a thorough understanding of 
the dynamics in our markets and the needs of our 
customers now and in the future. The Board and I 
are encouraged by the progress that is being made 
by Steve and his leadership team, and the momentum 
that is clearly building in the implementation of our 
strategic priorities.
Performance
In the year to 31 March 2017, we delivered increased 
orders, revenue and profit. We will continue to prioritise 
the delivery of sustainable growth with ongoing capital 
discipline as key elements of QinetiQ’s investment case. 
New CFO 
On 1 March 2017, the Board was delighted to welcome 
David Smith as Chief Financial Officer, following an 
extensive blue-chip career as CFO of both Rolls-Royce 
and of the technology group Edwards, and as CEO of 
Jaguar Land Rover. Our previous CFO David Mellors 
left QinetiQ at the end of 2016 to join Cobham plc. 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank David 
Mellors for his contribution to QinetiQ; he drove 
a significant strengthening of the balance sheet 
providing a solid foundation for our future growth. 
We would also like to thank Dr Malcolm Coffin, 
QinetiQ Group Financial Controller, who assumed 
the CFO role on an interim basis.
4 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategy
Over the last 18 months, Steve and his executive team 
led an Integrated Strategic Business Planning process, 
which was thoroughly discussed in a two-day meeting 
with the Board. In addition to this active involvement 
in the development of future strategy, the Board 
also ensures the effective scrutiny of mergers and 
acquisitions. In FY17, the Group completed the purchase 
of two businesses to support our strategy, Meggitt 
Target Systems in the UK and Canada, and RubiKon 
Group in Australia, its first significant acquisitions since 
2008. I would like to add my personal welcome to the 
employees of these two companies and wish them 
many rewarding years as part of the QinetiQ Group. 
With a significant amount of activity under way to drive 
growth in the UK, in international markets and through 
innovation, the Board is undertaking ‘deep dives’ into 
a number of topics to monitor delivery of the strategy. 
These deep dives are scheduled throughout the year 
with relevant members of QinetiQ’s executive team 
and papers are submitted in advance so the focus 
is on two-way discussion rather than presentations. 
Topics scheduled for FY18 include those related to 
our strategic priorities, progress of the transformation 
of the Company, and focus on our key stakeholders 
– customers, employees and shareholders. 
Governance
In addition to the implementation of the Group’s strategy 
for sustainable growth, an ongoing priority for the Board 
is strong governance and the effective stewardship of 
the Company. During the year, Board members visited 
a number of sites including QinetiQ North America 
in Waltham, MA, and MOD Boscombe Down, where 
a number of activities associated with the Group’s 
strategic priority to modernise UK test and evaluation 
are currently under way. These visits provided the 
opportunity to see at first-hand how we are 
implementing strategy and managing risk.
Employees
The visits have also provided the opportunity to spend 
time with a number of our employees. I never fail to 
be impressed by our scientists and engineers, whose 
expertise is in high demand as customers look for 
innovative ways to defeat new threats to security. 
I’d like to thank all of our employees for their 
ongoing dedication to our customers.
The knowledge and skills of our people are at the 
heart of our business and so development of our 
talent is a vital investment. Equally important is the 
ongoing commitment to the next generation through 
offering apprenticeships and graduate schemes 
and outreach programmes with our local schools. 
Across the Group, our employees have done what they 
do best: acting with integrity, working collaboratively 
and focusing on performance for the benefit of our 
customers – three values that underpin the way we 
work at QinetiQ. We know it’s not just what we do that 
is important but how we do it. In FY18, the Board is 
committing more time to consider how we want our 
culture to evolve to deliver our vision and strategy, how 
we nurture that culture and how our transformation 
can contribute. 
QinetiQ’s leaders play a vital role of delivering day-to-day 
operational performance and driving change. Steve’s 
first decision as CEO was to establish a Leadership 
Community at QinetiQ and bring together the top 100 
leaders every month. Non-executive Directors have 
attended these Leadership Community events during 
the year, contributing to workshops and witnessing how 
leaders are driving the future direction of the Company. 
We will continue to focus on leadership and succession 
planning in FY18.
Customers
Achieving our ambition of becoming the chosen partner 
requires a relentless focus on meeting the needs of our 
customers both in our home markets and overseas. To 
achieve this, we are establishing productive partnerships 
with others – from the largest global companies to 
small businesses and universities – and aim to be open 
and professional in our relationships with our supply 
chain, basing them firmly on mutual respect. 
Shareholders
Along with employees and customers, shareholders 
are key stakeholders in QinetiQ as the owners of the 
Company. This year, Michael Harper, Senior Independent 
Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, 
has consulted shareholders about the new remuneration 
policy to ensure it is aligned to their interests. We also 
enjoyed a constructive dialogue with investors during 
the CFO transition, with a number of them meeting 
David Smith before he joined. We would like to thank 
our investors for their continued support.
Capital allocation
Unlocking QinetiQ’s potential requires focused 
investment in growth coupled with continued capital 
discipline to ensure growing, sustainable returns. In 
recognition of this, our priorities for capital allocation 
are: organic investment complemented by bolt-on 
acquisitions where there is a strong strategic fit; the 
maintenance of balance sheet strength; a progressive 
dividend; and the return of excess cash to shareholders.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.0p per 
share for the year ended 31 March 2017 (2016: 3.8p), 
making the full year dividend 6.0p (2016: 5.7p). 
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the final dividend will be paid on 1 September 2017 
to shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017. 
The full year dividend represents an increase of 5%, 
reflecting our commitment to a progressive dividend. 
Finally, I would like to thank Board members for their 
ongoing counsel. I value their considerable experience 
and the significant contribution that they have made 
this year.

5 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Chairman’s statement Chief Executive Officer’s review
Good operational delivery 
and strategic progress.
 “Our strategy is inherently outward 
looking... we have been building 
positive momentum with its 
implementation during the year.”
Market environment
FY17 was another year in which threats to global 
security from both state and non-state actors 
increased. Governments are seeking help with 
the rapid development of new capabilities to defeat 
emerging threats and ensure they meet their primary 
responsibility to protect and safeguard the lives of their 
citizens. Our expertise in science and engineering is 
particularly relevant in this context; we also play a vital 
role in making connections, be they across technologies, 
domains, supply chains or internationally. 
FY17 performance
During the year we successfully achieved both 
good operational delivery and significant progress 
implementing our strategy. This was evidenced by the 
delivery of organic revenue growth for the first time in 
a number of years. Revenue and operating profit were 
stable in EMEA Services and up in Global Products, 
driven by growth in QinetiQ North America. We will 
continue to prioritise the delivery of sustainable 
growth with ongoing capital discipline.
Strategy
Our vision is to be: “The chosen partner around the 
world for mission-critical solutions, innovating for our 
customers’ advantage.” To realise our vision we are 
implementing our three strategic priorities designed 
to grow the Company by focusing on our primary UK 
customer, on international customers and on innovation. 
Our strategy is inherently outward looking, based on 
the needs of our customers now and in the future, and 
I am encouraged that our customer satisfaction scores 
increased this year. To meet future customer needs, we 
are prioritising the rapid development of new capabilities 
to defeat emerging threats by embracing value-creating 
innovation. We are also driving greater value for money 
for our customers, improving services and delivering 
savings in parallel. To do this we connect supply chains 
and choose the right strategic partners from across 
industry with complementary capabilities to ours so that 
we can offer competitive and market-leading solutions. 
As our total order intake and backlog demonstrate, 
we have been building positive momentum with the 
implementation of this strategy during the year.
UK Defence Test & Evaluation
Our first strategic priority is to lead and modernise 
UK Defence Test & Evaluation (T&E). Delivering strong 
T&E capability is critical to ensuring reliable, flexible 
and affordable delivery of military capability to protect 
national interests. By engaging with our customers, 
we have made positive progress, signing new 
agreements which nearly double our order book to 
more than £2bn and significantly improving revenue 
visibility and therefore the risk profile of our Company.
In September 2016, we secured an 11-year, £109m 
extension to the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) 
Naval Combat System Integration Support Services 
(NCSISS) contract under which we lead the T&E, 
integration and development of mission systems that 
keep the UK’s surface warships at sea and fit to fight. 
This is an excellent example of our strategy in action, with 
a focus on partnership with our customers and across the 
broader supply chain as we look to develop our Portsdown 
Technology Park site as the UK Centre of Excellence for 
maritime mission systems across the entire supply chain. 
In December we signed an 11-year, £1bn amendment 
to the Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA), the 
largest and most significant contract since privatisation, 
which has significant mutual benefits for the MOD and 
QinetiQ. For the MOD, it ensures the UK has world-class 
competitive air ranges and training for test pilots and 
aircrew, and delivers the capability at less cost. For us, 
it provides the platform we need for growth by creating 
more relevant and competitive T&E capability for the UK 
armed forces as well as governments and commercial 
customers around the world.
Our focus during FY18 is to re-price the remaining LTPA 
contract, which is due on 31 March 2018, and to work 
together with the MOD and industry partners to develop 
a long-term vision for the UK’s T&E capabilities. 
Steve Wadey
Chief Executive Officer
6 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The objective of this vision is to deliver future military 
capability for the next decade and beyond, addressing 
current and emerging threats. This will provide a platform 
for growth in the UK T&E market, which we estimate to 
be double that which we currently access, and improve 
our ability to win work with customers outside the UK.
International
At the beginning of FY17, we established an International 
business focused on developing and securing growth 
opportunities in prioritised territories around the world. 
This new International business has been established 
as an ‘enabler’ for the Group, bringing greater coherence 
and focus to our activities internationally in relation to 
both organic and inorganic efforts, and encouraging 
a more global mind-set. 
In December 2016 we acquired Meggitt’s Target Systems 
business, now renamed QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS), 
both to reinforce our core T&E value proposition and 
accelerate the delivery of our strategic priority to drive 
international growth. The business generates 90% of its 
revenues from outside the UK and is well aligned with 
our capabilities in the management of complex exercises 
and provision of test, evaluation and training services, 
thus expanding our core capability overseas. We are now 
uniquely placed to meet growing demand for mid- and 
high-fidelity targets to test defence capabilities against 
a greater diversity of threats. The acquisition also opens 
up new routes to market to promote our wider service 
offerings to QTS’s international customer base.
A key element of our international strategy is to build 
our presence and capability in our home markets 
outside the UK, notably the US and Australia. QinetiQ 
North America delivered very good orders and revenue 
performance in FY17. With growing defence ambitions 
and close to the rapidly evolving Asia Pacific region, 
Australia is a particularly attractive market and our 
business there had a record year for orders. In January 
2017, we also acquired RubiKon Group which brings 
integrated logistics support capabilities to QinetiQ 
Australia. RubiKon strengthens our ability to offer 
integrated whole programme solutions that are often 
required for ‘strategic partner’ style contracts which are 
being used increasingly by the Australian Government.
In FY18 we intend to build on the progress we are 
making in our existing home markets by increasing our 
sales presence in regions such as the Middle East and 
Asia Pacific. Negotiations over the UK’s exit from the 
EU add complexity to our strategy for growth in Europe. 
However, many government relationships for defence 
and security, particularly in Europe, are underpinned 
by bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
Innovation
As customers demand more capability, and as 
the boundaries between defence and commercial 
technologies become increasingly blurred, value-creating 
innovation is vital to maintaining our distinctiveness in the 
marketplace. Technical innovation has been at the heart 
of QinetiQ’s success to date, and will remain a key source 
of growth into the future. However, turning creativity and 
technical innovation into tangible value for our customers 
increasingly requires innovative thinking across the 
broader range of activities. 
In FY17, we established business winning campaigns 
supported by Internal Research and Development 
(IRAD) to drive commercial innovation, new processes, 
and innovative business models. For each campaign 
we consider the people, investments and partnerships 
we need to be successful. For example, to support 
the campaign to exploit our world-class capability 
in secured navigation receivers, we signed a global 
alliance agreement with Rockwell Collins, the 
market leader in secure military GPS receivers. 
We have identified more than 30 growth campaigns in 
pursuit of material opportunities, all of which are worth 
tens of millions of pounds and in some cases more. 
We are not going to win every campaign, but the scale 
of the total opportunity is significant over a five to 
10-year time period. We will pursue these campaigns 
with vigour in FY18, as well as extending our focus 
to more international markets.
Transformation
We are on track to transform QinetiQ to improve 
customer focus and competitiveness. During the year 
we successfully introduced a new operating model based 
on matrix working to improve our responsiveness and 
operational effectiveness. We have also driven £20m 
of productivity savings that we have reinvested in 
business winning and IRAD to support our future growth. 
I appreciate that this period of significant change has 
been difficult for many of our employees, and this is 
reflected in our engagement score which fell last year 
although employee turnover remains low. Moving into 
FY18, supporting and developing the culture required 
to deliver our transformation is a particular goal.
Air accident
In July 2016, an air accident involving a contracted-in 
Yak aircraft operating in support of the Empire Test 
Pilots’ School (ETPS) sadly resulted in the death of an 
RAF pilot and serious injury to the contractor pilot. We 
are actively supporting the subsequent official inquiries 
and will respond to all recommendations made.
Outlook – FY18 
In EMEA Services, revenue under contract for FY18 is 
in line with the prior year, and the division is expected 
to deliver modest revenue growth this year although 
the lower baseline profit rate for single source contracts 
represents a continued headwind for operating margins. 
The Group’s Global Products division has shorter order 
cycles than EMEA Services and its performance is 
dependent on the timing of shipments of key orders. 
As a result of its contracted orders and pipeline of 
opportunities, as well as the anticipated full year 
contribution from the Target Systems acquisition, 
the division is expected to continue to grow in FY18. 
FY18 cash flow will reflect increasing investment, with 
capital expenditure of £80m to £100m, to support the 
amendment to the Long Term Partnering Agreement 
announced in December 2016.
Overall for FY18, we are maintaining expectations for 
steady progress excluding the non-recurring benefits 
in FY17, supported by revenue growth and consistent 
with our strategy.
Outlook – longer term
Rapidly changing dynamics in defence and security 
markets are presenting both opportunities and 
challenges for our industry. We are well placed to 
help customers both develop capabilities to defeat 
new threats and achieve greater value for money by 
improving services and delivering savings in parallel. 
The initial progress we have made, combined with our 
ongoing assessment of the market environment, and, 
in particular, feedback from customers reinforce that 
we have the right strategy in place to drive future growth. 
Over the longer term this strategy will create and 
sustain value for all our stakeholders. Our customers 
will benefit from better products and services, increased 
responsiveness, and improved value for money. 
Our shareholders will benefit because we will deliver 
sustainable growth in revenue, operating profit, and 
high-quality earnings. And our employees will benefit 
because they will be able to utilise their experience 
more widely across QinetiQ, working in integrated 
teams and enhancing professional satisfaction.

Our unique position in the market
Our customers are predominantly government 
organisations in our home markets of the UK, 
US and Australia, with a growing international 
and commercial presence.
Our customer relationships and domain 
know-how have been developed over 
many years of working in partnership. 
We occupy a unique position in the market 
and collaborate with prime contractors, service 
providers and a broad-based supply chain 
that includes specialist firms.
Sustaining our business model
As a company whose reputation and 
achievements are centred on our people, our 
future success is primarily dependent on our 
ability to recruit, develop, engage and retain 
exceptional employees.
Our business model is robust and sustainable 
because our knowledge base is constantly 
refreshed as we learn from experience, 
understand emerging customer needs and 
invest in our future. This enables us to both 
sustain existing capabilities and create new 
ones to ensure we respond to customer 
needs and stay ahead of the competition.
As a people and knowledge-based business, 
our capital requirements are relatively low. Our 
principal use of capital is investment in organic 
growth and, in particular, capital expenditure 
to modernise our facilities as a platform for 
that growth.
How we generate revenue
We deliver advantage to our customers 
when and where it really matters through 
the provision of advice, services and 
technology-based products often 
combined in unique ways.
We operate two divisions:
 – EMEA Services generates revenue 
through the provision of advice and 
services, particularly test and evaluation. 
The division is underpinned by long-term 
contracts providing good visibility of 
revenue and cash flows.
 – Global Products delivers products and 
solutions supported by research and 
development which is often funded by 
customers. The division is technology- 
based and has shorter order cycles so 
can have a more variable revenue profile. 
Within our two divisions, our business units are 
aligned to customer domains and all deliver a 
combination of services, advice and products.

9 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Our business model Market overview
Several trends impact the 
markets we operate in.
Defence and security markets 
are changing rapidly. A number 
of emerging themes result 
in both challenges and 
opportunities for our industry.
Our strategy has been developed 
and will continue to be refined 
to respond to these themes.
Three key themes across our markets driving strategy:
1
Increasing global 
threat complexity
2
Partnering  
for innovation
3
Value for money  
in defence
1.  Increasing global 
threat complexity 
We live in a time of unprecedented uncertainty.  
Threats to our security are becoming more numerous, 
more diverse and more intense. It is not possible to 
separate foreign affairs, defence and homeland security; 
national security challenges are complex and demand 
whole-of-government responses. In the last few years 
alone there have been multiple geopolitical concerns 
including instability in the Middle East and the 
associated displacement of refugees, terrorist attacks 
in Europe, Brexit, rising tensions with Russia including 
the recent deployment of NATO forces to Poland 
and the Baltic States, concerns about North Korean 
aggression, and the continued threat from cyber attack.
The next five years will see 
rising tensions with and between 
countries... An ever-widening 
range of states, organisations, 
and empowered individuals 
will shape geopolitics. 
Source: National Intelligence Council “Global Trends”.
Our response:
In this dynamic market we aim to act with pace and 
agility to stay ahead of the competition and meet 
customer needs.
We are fortunate to have a solid foundation to build  
on because our strengths are particularly well matched 
to emerging themes in global markets. These include 
greater use of autonomy in a wide range of military  
and civil applications, growing demand for integrating 
capabilities, such as the teaming of manned and 
unmanned platforms and continued requirements  
in cyber security and Intelligence, Surveillance  
& Reconnaissance (ISR). More generally, the 
digital economy, new materials and energy 
sources provide future opportunities.
We work across all domains – land, sea, air, space 
and cyberspace and across the whole capability life 
cycle – from early stage research and experimentation 
through to training and rehearsal. We are developing 
these strengths to ensure a greater focus on the rapid 
development, experimentation and deployment of 
new security capabilities to respond to growing and 
diversifying threats. For example, the creation of 
a Strategy and Planning function and an expanded 
business winning team facilitate a better understanding 
of markets, and carefully targeted Internal Research 
and Development projects help us shape and take 
advantage of new opportunities. 
To ensure we deliver sustainable growth  
in these markets our approach is to:
 – Act with pace and agility to meet customer needs 
and market opportunities;
 – Focus on the rapid development, experimentation  
and deployment of new capabilities;
 – Support with Internal Research and Development;
 – Prioritise commercial innovation and innovative  
business models;
 – Select campaigns on the basis of our view of 
long-term customer needs;
 – Build networks that bring together Government,  
industry, SMEs and academia;
 – Take steps to ensure we have access to talent 
now and in the future;
 – Drive outcome-based solutions for our customers  
that both improve services and deliver savings; and
 – Work to build cross-border collaboration.

2. Partnering for innovation 
Governments need innovation to respond to these 
fast evolving threats. Defence innovation initiatives 
are underway in a number of nations including the 
United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. The 
core principle of the UK Defence Innovation Initiative 
is establishing: “fertile partnerships with innovators in 
industry and academia, as well as with key allies and 
partners.” In Australia the aim is to: “access the potential 
of Australian defence industry to innovate”. In the US, 
the Third Offset strategy aims: “to identify and invest 
in innovative ways to sustain and advance America’s 
military dominance for the 21st Century” by developing 
capabilities in areas such as sensor fusion and 
man-machine interfaces. 
Through these initiatives government customers 
are seeking new approaches to innovation across the 
“Defence Enterprise,” in both equipment and processes, 
so that they can rapidly integrate new technologies 
into existing capabilities. 
Many customers are keen to capture the innovation 
that comes from universities and SMEs, particularly 
as the defence sector is no longer the sole, or primary, 
incubator of new technology. They are looking for 
assistance from organisations that can collaborate 
and help them connect their supply chains and 
access ideas coming from outside defence.

Our response:
We help customers meet new challenges through 
innovation. As a company we often fulfil an innovation 
integrator role, establishing partnerships with other 
organisations and building networks of suppliers. 
These networks bring together Government, 
industry, SMEs and academia in collaborating 
teams to facilitate innovation.
  Page 32 Relationships
Our ability to innovate and solve customer problems is 
based on the world-leading expertise of our people. As 
with many companies in our sector, the average age of 
our scientists and engineers has increased over the last 
decade. We are taking a number of steps to ensure our 
access to talent now and in the future, including launching 
Company-wide graduate and apprentice programmes, 
a QinetiQ Academy to drive the development of our 
employees and the 5% Club, a campaign which 
promotes opportunities for young people.
  Page 30 Our people
3. Value for money in defence  
After several years of shrinking defence budgets, there 
is increasing evidence that the cycle is bottoming out. 
Growth is forecast in adjacent areas such as security 
of civil infrastructure due to continued concerns about 
unrest and insecurity. In the US, President Trump has 
committed to increase defence spending and other 
governments are expected to increase defence spending 
to meet the NATO target of 2% of GDP. The projections 
are less certain in the Middle East where the lower 
oil price could constrain spending and in the UK 
due to Brexit. 
All governments, whether they are increasing or 
decreasing defence and security spending are 
under pressure to deliver greater value for money 
for taxpayers. This is being driven both by greater 
scrutiny of defence programmes and the need to 
create headroom for greater investment in innovation 
by ensuring better value for money for what they deliver 
today. For example, the UK Government is looking 
to achieve a 30% reduction in MOD civilian staff 
and built estate in the period 2015-2020. 
The requirement for greater value for money is driving 
bilateral and multilateral approaches to developing 
new capabilities, which remain relevant irrespective of 
Brexit. For example, in December 2016, the French and 
British Governments signed a number of agreements 
committing them to work together on joint programmes 
such as the development of a new Unmanned Combat 
Air System.
2%
NATO target for % of GDP to be spent on defence
Our response:
We have a long track record of improving services and 
delivering savings in parallel for our customers and have, 
for example, delivered significant savings for the MOD 
over the last 14 years we have been delivering the 
Long Term Partnering Agreement. We also deploy 
the expertise of our people to help customers 
meet their own efficiency challenges. 
The key objectives of our transformation are to increase 
customer focus and competitiveness. In some cases, 
this requires the introduction of innovative business 
models such as our Strategic Enterprise model for the 
delivery of UK aircraft engineering services where we 
are delivering both improved services and savings 
for our customers.
Through exercises such as the QinetiQ-facilitated 
Unmanned Warrior exercise in October 2016 – which  
the UK Secretary of State for Defence described as “a 
signal of our desire to work with global partners” – we 
are working to build cross-border collaboration between 
the UK and other nations. We are taking this approach in 
other home markets and also working with governments 
in new markets, which are looking to strengthen local 
industrial capabilities. 
11 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Market overview An update on our home markets
We operate in three 
home markets: the UK, 
US and Australia.
The UK Government’s Strategic Defence and Security 
Review (SDSR) published at the end of 2015 helped 
to clarify the UK’s capability priorities. In the SDSR 
the MOD pledged to spend 2% of GDP on defence 
and to address capability gaps such as combat air and 
maritime surveillance. New capabilities will be funded 
by 30% reductions in MOD civilian staff and in its built 
estate, and by £11bn of savings from 2015-20. The 
introduction of new capabilities and, in particular, 
extending the life of existing capabilities, provides 
QinetiQ with opportunities to deliver engineering, 
test and evaluation services as well as further 
opportunities for providing outsourced services. It is 
possible that a Comprehensive Spending Review and 
a new SDSR will take place following the UK General 
Election but all major political parties are committed 
to spending 2% of GDP on defence. 
Although competition is intense, the SDSR and focus 
on counter-terrorism is driving increases in budgets for 
C4ISR and cyber security. Investment in cyber security 
is to rise from £809m in 2015 to £1.9bn in 2020 and 
a new UK National Cyber Security Centre was 
established in 2016.
The UK Government is determined to get the best deal 
for Britain when exiting the EU and has a renewed focus 
on supporting exports as part of the Global Britain 
agenda. In the defence sector the Government is 
developing an industrial policy with the stated aim 
of bringing its prosperity and security agendas closer 
together. The policy is likely to require the MOD to spend 
more money with SMEs and companies that win large 
defence contracts will be required to ensure that 3%  
of employees working on that contract are apprentices. 
QinetiQ is well-placed to support these commitments  
as we already manage framework contracts for the 
MOD that involve more than 100 UK SMEs, and  
through our commitment to The 5% Club   Page 31. 
The Single Source Regulations Office (SSRO) is 
developing a new methodology for calculating the 
baseline profit rate in future years, potentially introducing 
multiple profit rates. This baseline rate acts as the 
starting point for agreeing the profit rates of new and 
renewed contracts, and suppliers can both under- and 
over-perform the contracted rate depending on, for 
example, risk, capital servicing and project execution.  
Approximately three-quarters of the revenue of our 
EMEA Services division is derived from single-source 
contracts, an increased proportion of which is now 
contracted on a long-term basis. For example, the 
11-year, £1bn amendment to the LTPA, signed in 
December 2016, was contracted using the FY17 
single source profit formula.
In the 2015 SDSR the MOD committed investment in 
science and technology will continue to be protected at 
1.2% of the defence budget with an increased emphasis 
on disruptive technologies and innovation, and a move 
away from some more traditional research programmes.
On 16 September 2016, the Secretary of State for 
Defence launched a new Defence Innovation Initiative 
for the UK focused on ensuring that Britain remains a 
credible military force against major adversaries, using 
traditional lethal and non-lethal effects to respond to 
evolving threats with pace and agility. A Defence and 
Security Accelerator has been launched as part of the 
Initiative to administer an £800m Innovation Fund. The 
Defence Innovation Initiative has a particular emphasis 
on partnership and the ‘Whole Force’ – military, civil 
servants and industry people – working as one.

12 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 In the US, the FY17 Defense Bill was published sooner 
than expected. Although it did not deliver the entirety of 
the $54bn increase that President Trump had proposed 
for defence, it will result in a significant increase in the 
budget for Overseas Contingency Operations. 
A renewed commitment by US military customers 
to unmanned ground vehicle products is reflected in 
plans to award new competitive Programs of Record 
for the development, acquisition and sustainment of 
US unmanned systems capability. Competitions are 
either under way or will be under way this year for 
these Programs of Record, funded by the US 
Department of Defense’s base budget. 
The previous administration’s Defense Innovation 
Initiative, also known as the Third Offset Strategy, put 
$18bn behind innovation and R&D in the period from 
2016 to 2021. Although this may be de-emphasised 
or rebranded, many of the key enabling technologies, 
such as artificial intelligence, human-machine 
collaboration, cyber and electronic warfare, are 
expected to remain priorities to ensure the United 
States’ “technological superiority.”
The Australian Government remains committed to 
providing defence with a stable and sustainable funding 
growth path, and the budget is on track to grow to two 
per cent of GDP by 2020-21. This is likely to result in 
six per cent per annum growth in its defence budget 
through 2020 and the replacement of the majority of its 
platforms over the next 15 years. The trend in Australia 
is for the Government to place larger contracts for 
whole-life programmes with strategic partners. Many 
of these programmes have a significant integrated 
logistics support requirement, and through the 
purchase of RubiKon Group in January 2017, 
we have acquired this capability as well as a 
significant reference programme.

13 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | An update on our home markets Strategy
Our vision is to be: “The chosen partner around 
the world for mission-critical solutions, innovating 
for our customers’ advantage.”
Leadership and organisation
To drive higher performance and alignment, new 
leaders were appointed during FY17 for the International 
business and our Business Development, Human 
Resources and Finance functions, all from outside 
QinetiQ. Our top 100 leaders completed a leadership 
development programme and are being supported 
with ongoing coaching. Our focus during FY18 is 
on a similar development programme for managers, 
and on facilitating employee-enabled change via four 
Transformation Action Groups established by employees 
from across the Company. We have also renewed our 
focus on our values and behaviours which support us  
in operating safely and successfully, and in working 
together effectively to meet customer needs first 
time. Our values are ‘Integrity,’ which reinforces 
our responsibility and accountability for our actions, 
‘Collaboration,’ which focuses us on delivering value 
through partnership and team work and ‘Performance,’ 
which emphasises excellent delivery to our customers.
We have completed the reorganisation of QinetiQ, 
establishing new businesses responsible for winning 
and delivering work, as well as enabling functions to 
provide support and resource. A Strategy and Planning 
function has been created to help position QinetiQ for 
future growth. The new function manages an Integrated 
Strategic Business Planning process which ensures we 
prioritise short-term actions within a coherent long-term 
plan for sustainable growth, and is developing a pipeline 
of potential bolt-on acquisitions where there is a 
strong strategic fit and investment rationale. 
Business winning
In order to grow we need to win more work both 
in our home markets and internationally. Our new 
International business unit is now established. To 
improve our business winning capability, our sales 
and bidding employees have completed assessment 
and development programmes, and further 
development of their skills is planned for FY18. 
Over the last year we have established more than 30 
business winning campaigns across the Group to drive 
organic growth. The teams pursuing these campaigns 
comprise established expertise within the Company plus 
experienced hires to ensure we have the optimum mix  
of knowledge and capability. As part of their strategy, 
each campaign team considers the best approach to 
partnership and investment needed to win business 
by delivering compelling customer value.
Delivery and operational excellence 
During the year, we successfully introduced a 
new operating model that allows us to resource 
as one company. Our UK scientists and engineers 
were transitioned to a new Engineering and Operations 
function at the beginning of 2017, ensuring that supply 
meets demand and we have the right skills mix over the 
long term. Our focus going forward is on embedding this 
change across QinetiQ to ensure the desired benefits 
are achieved, leading to greater innovation and value 
for our customers. 
To support our ability to resource as one company,  
we introduced a dynamic resource planning process  
in FY17, driving improved productivity and deployment  
of capability to meet customer needs. 
Our future success will be built on operational excellence 
– keeping our people safe, delivering what we say we  
are going to deliver, meeting milestones, exceeding 
expectations and improving customer satisfaction. 
David Smith, our new Chief Financial Officer, is driving 
a renewed focus on operational excellence in tandem 
with his role of executive sponsor for transformation. 
Safety remains our top priority in addition to our 
day-to-day focus on consistent operational delivery.
Investing in our future
In FY17, we delivered £20m of operational efficiencies 
to create the headroom to invest in sustainable growth. 
This was delivered by realigning our organisation and 
improving productivity and included a reduction of 
approximately 200 roles across the Company during the 
year. These efficiencies drove better value for money for 
our customers and allowed us to invest carefully in both 
our business winning capability and in research and 
development, particularly in support of our selected 
growth campaigns. 
An Internal Research and Development (IRAD) 
programme is under way with appropriate Executive 
oversight to ensure that projects are customer-driven 
and properly controlled. We have over 40 live projects, 
more than half of which are related directly to our 
growth campaigns, where we are using our investment 
to position ourselves for new market opportunities. 
In FY18, we are launching an improved ideas 
management process to ensure we capture 
and exploit early-stage ideas and innovations.
Transformation
We are transforming QinetiQ, 
our people, leadership,  
and our organisation, in 
order to deliver our vision and 
strategy. After the first year  
we have achieved a great deal, 
and the plan for FY18 is equally 
demanding. Not least is the 
ongoing challenge presented 
in embedding cultural change 
across the Company to enhance 
customer focus and improve 
competitiveness.

14 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1.  Lead and modernise UK 
Defence Test & Evaluation.
FY17 Progress – a year of building momentum
In September 2016, we signed an 11-year, £109m 
contract extension for Naval Combat System Integration 
Support Services (NCSISS) to the MOD. This supports 
the development of our Portsdown Technology Park site 
as the UK Centre of Excellence for maritime missions 
systems, improves the security of future revenues  
and provides a platform to win incremental work. 
In October 2016, we hosted Unmanned Warrior, a 
world-first demonstration of how unmanned systems 
can operate as part of a major multinational naval 
exercise. Over 50 autonomous vehicles were deployed 
in the air, on the water and under the surface on 
missions ranging from anti-submarine warfare to mine 
countermeasures. From inception to delivery we were 
instrumental in making this exercise happen, leading  
the UK component, providing range management 
expertise and delivering a transportable command  
and control system.
In December 2016, we agreed an 11-year, £1bn 
commitment with the UK MOD that secures 
approximately half our revenue on the core LTPA 
contract until 2028. This amendment, which uses the 
FY17 single source profit formula, secures our operation 
and modernisation of the Empire Test Pilots’ School 
at MOD Boscombe Down and the Air Ranges at MOD 
Aberporth and Hebrides. This gives us the confidence  
to invest approximately £180m to upgrade facilities  
and equipment, driving efficiencies to avoid cost 
increases that would have otherwise arisen and 
providing a platform for future growth. Our 
investment will be recovered from the MOD 
over time using the current LTPA mechanism.
Since its initial signature in November 2015, £80m 
of additional work has been added to the Strategic 
Enterprise contract, originally valued at £153m, under 
which we deliver aircraft engineering services to the 
MOD on an outputs-based model. We have added eight 
additional aircraft types to the contract, both fixed- and 
rotary-wing and see further opportunities to expand, 
working with partners to pool skills and bring 
collaborative teams together across industry.
FY18 – further enhancements to UK capability
Our focus is on working with the Front Line Commands 
and prime contractors to develop the future vision  
for UK T&E to meet the needs of the UK Defence Plan, 
support exports and international partnerships, and 
deliver the right outputs to enable future military 
capability. The five-year repricing of our Long Term 
Partnering Agreement with the UK MOD is due to take 
place at the end of FY18 so this is a particular focus.
In FY17, we were invited by Boeing to submit a 
proposal offering MOD Boscombe Down as a 
prospective location for its UK ‘centre of excellence’ 
driven by its fixed-wing business. We will continue 
to work with the MOD and Boeing to identify ways 
in which the site, which we operate on behalf of 
the MOD, could meet their requirements.

2.  Build QinetiQ as an 
international company.
FY17 Progress – International business established
On 1 April 2016, we created a new International business 
unit incorporating our Australian, Swedish, Canadian, 
Commerce Decisions and Advisory Services operations. 
In August we appointed Iain Farley as its Managing 
Director from Expro Group International where he was 
Vice President for Business Development and Emerging 
Business. Andreas Ward, previously Vice President 
Nordic and Baltics at Saab, was also appointed to 
run our operations in Sweden.
In December 2016, we acquired Meggitt’s Target 
Systems business for £57.5m, or £60.3m including 
price adjustments for working capital and net debt. 
The business – now renamed QinetiQ Target Systems 
– holds a leading position in the global targets and 
services market which is growing strongly as customers 
seek to validate their defence capabilities using 
high-fidelity threat representation. In addition to a design 
and manufacture capability in the UK and Canada, the 
business supplies targets to more than 40 countries 
and has on-site target operations in 15 countries.
During FY17 we have focused on building our 
capabilities in our home markets – the US and Australia 
in addition to the UK. In the US we have engaged with 
customers such as the US Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA), to collaborate to create new 
business opportunities. In Canada we secured our first 
home contract win with the Royal Canadian Coast 
Guard for work that will be delivered locally in Canada.
In Australia, we acquired RubiKon Group in January 
2017 for £7.4m. The company is a leading integrated 
logistics support provider and helps customers meet 
complex logistics, supply chain and procurement 
project challenges. Earlier in the year we were part 
of a RubiKon-led team which won the Strategic Support 
Partnership Contract for the Australian Government’s 
procurement of maritime patrol aircraft to replace  
the AP-3C Orion. The acquisition of RubiKon better 
positions QinetiQ Australia to offer whole programme 
solutions to customers in the Asia Pacific region.
We are evaluating new home markets with a particular 
focus on the Middle East and Asia Pacific and 
developing plans which inform the prioritisation of 
resources and the identification of potential partners. 
We secured a number of aerial targets contracts in 
the United Arab Emirates and flew our latest Banshee 
Jet 110 for the first time in India. During the year, our 
OptaSense subsidiary also completed the delivery of a 
system for the world’s largest distributed fibre sensing 
project for the 1,850km Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas 
Pipeline (TANAP) principally in Turkey.
We continue to develop opportunities to grow sales 
by exporting our products and services, working 
with partners such as the UK Trade and Investment’s 
Defence and Security Organisation (UKTI DSO). While 
we were unsuccessful with our joint bid with BAE 
Systems for a competition in Chile to upgrade their 
Type 23 frigates, we have an increasing pipeline of 
sales opportunities, particularly in the Middle East.
FY18 – delivering international growth
The International business was established to grow 
QinetiQ as an international company. Our objective  
is to win significant contracts outside the UK. As our 
strategy prioritises collaborative working, on many  
of our growth campaigns we work in partnership  
with prime contractors and with the support of 
the UK Government.
QinetiQ Target Systems
90%
of revenue generated outside 
the UK.
With growing defence ambitions 
and close to the rapidly evolving 
Asia Pacific region, Australia is 
a particularly attractive market. 
During the year QinetiQ Australia 
continued to develop its core 
capabilities including extending 
its contract for the provision 
of Aircraft Structural 
Integrity services.
16 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 3.  Invest in innovation and apply 
our core competence for 
customer advantage in defence 
and commercial markets.
FY17 Focus – campaigns initiated to drive  
commercial innovation
During FY17 we established business winning campaigns 
to drive commercial innovation, new processes, and 
innovative business models, in addition to the technical 
innovation that QinetiQ has always been known for. 
Campaigns are driven by horizon scanning of future 
customer needs and market opportunities. Group-level 
campaigns align with four main growth levers:
 – Major government programmes, such  
as Ballistic Missile Defence and Carrier Strike; 
 – Areas of QinetiQ strategic capability, such  
as modernised T&E, cyber security, and 
experimentation and rehearsal; 
 – Major near-term competitions; and
 – Exploitation of promising capabilities we have 
previously invested in, such as airborne surveillance. 
To enhance our probability of winning, we resource 
these through investment and partnership, collaborating 
with prime contractors, small businesses and 
universities on many of the campaigns. During the 
year we established partnerships with companies 
such as MBDA on laser technology and Thales 
on Defence Operational Training. 
In January 2017, the Dragonfire consortium – led by 
MBDA and including QinetiQ as well as other industry 
partners – was awarded a £30m programme by the 
UK MOD to deliver a defensive Laser Directed Energy 
Weapon (LDEW) Capability Demonstrator. QinetiQ’s 
role is to provide the high-powered laser technology for 
the programme and conduct trials over land and water 
at various ranges that we manage under the LTPA.  
We are supporting this campaign with IRAD funding 
to further develop our core laser technology which 
will be the enduring element of our offering.
During the year we secured contracts worth more 
than £10m for secured navigation working with both 
European and UK Government customers. Our work 
helps users to effectively exploit the Galileo constellation  
of satellites – the European Union version of GPS  
which is due to go live in FY21. This included the first 
demonstration of accessing the encrypted Public 
Regulated Service (PRS) real-world applications. At 
the end of the year we secured a global agreement 
with Rockwell Collins, the market leader in secure 
navigation, who will become the primary route to 
market for our software technology worldwide.
FY18 – growth campaigns in international markets
We will have capture plans and resourcing in place  
for all of our major campaigns in FY18. Because our 
International business was only established in April 
2016, our international growth campaigns are less 
mature than those focused on our home markets 
so they are a particular focus. 
Over 30
campaigns established.

Non-financial KPIs
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Work is under way led by David Smith, our 
newly appointed Chief Financial Officer, to 
review the key performance indicators and 
other metrics that we use to monitor the 
performance of the Company and measure 
the progress of the implementation of our 
strategy. We expect to update our KPIs 
during FY18 to reflect this review and 
that changes will be reflected in next 
year’s Annual Report and Accounts.
The objective of our strategy is to grow 
QinetiQ, delivering a sustainable increase in 
quality earnings to our shareholders. Progress 
is measured through a range of financial and 
non-financial key performance indicators. 
Measurements of customer satisfaction, 
health and safety and employee 
engagement underpin sustainability.
Measures such as orders, organic 
revenue growth, profitability and 
cash flow track financial performance. 
Similar indicators are used to review 
performance in each of the Group’s businesses.

Description
QinetiQ’s customer satisfaction survey asks all 
UK customers with contracts over £200,000 
about QinetiQ’s delivery and engagement. 
In the US, customer satisfaction metrics are 
reviewed on a contract-by-contract basis.
Description
The Lost Time Incident (LTI) rate is calculated 
using the total number of accidents resulting 
in at least one day taken off work, multiplied 
by 1,000 divided by the average number 
of employees in that year.
Description
The number shown is the total number 
of apprentices, graduates and sponsored 
students as a percentage of our UK workforce. 
Description
A measure of employee engagement  
(excluding QNA) on a scale of 0–1,000, based  
on the Best Companies Employee Survey. 
A separate survey is conducted in the US.
Through this survey, employees share 
their views about working at QinetiQ under 
the headings of management, leadership, 
Company, personal growth, my team, giving 
something back, fair deal and well-being.
Description
This is a measure of the number  
of employees leaving the Company  
not at QinetiQ’s instigation.
Rationale
Using an independent third party we annually 
survey around 100 of our largest projects to 
help us understand our performance and what 
we need to be doing to continuously improve. 
We also gather qualitative feedback through 
structured interviews.
Rationale
Health and safety performance is monitored 
to drive continual improvement in minimising 
risks to employees and reducing harm.
Rationale
Provides a measure of QinetiQ’s ability to 
attract and develop new employees. It is also 
a measure of our commitment to The 5% Club, 
an industry-led initiative of which we are a 
founding member, to grow the number of 
young people on apprenticeships, graduate 
programmes and student sponsorships.
Rationale
The annual survey enables comparison 
between QinetiQ and other UK companies. 
The primary purpose of the survey is to 
provide guidance to Team Leaders about 
how they can improve employee engagement.
Rationale
Provides a measure of the Group’s  
ability to retain employees.
Performance this year
Of those surveyed, we received an average 
rating for our performance overall of 8.2 out of 
10, up from 8.1 out of 10 in 2016 which shows 
progress. We saw an upward trend for most 
metrics and for bidding in particular. 
Performance this year
The LTI rate and the absolute number of lost 
time incidents resulting in at least one day off 
work have increased from the previous year. 
Safety is a top priority of all our businesses. 
A collective objective for FY18, used for 
remuneration, is to implement Safe for Life 
across the whole Group and in terms of 
how we operate with our supply chain. 
This programme focuses on improving 
safety behaviours.
Performance this year
There was a reduction in FY17 due 
in part to the acquisition of QinetiQ Target 
Systems and changes to how we recruit as 
a result of our reorganisation. We will increase 
our investment in Early Careers programmes 
across the Group in FY18. 
Performance this year
FY17 was a year of significant change 
for many employees as we transform 
the Company and this is reflected in the 
fall in the overall score. We are committed 
to acting on the feedback we received 
in the survey during FY18. 
Performance this year
Despite the reorganisation of the Company 
and the adoption of a new way of working, 
voluntary employee turnover reduced during 
the year. 
Link to strategy
Achieving our ambition of becoming the 
chosen partner requires a relentless focus 
on meeting the needs of customers in both 
our home markets and overseas. Customer 
satisfaction is a metric used for the Bonus 
Banking Plan. 
Link to strategy
The safety, health and well-being of our people 
are intrinsically linked to our strategic success.

Description
The level of new order (and amendments to 
existing orders) booked in the year. Although 
new multi-year contracts can impact the 
reported orders number, the level of orders 
booked in the year is an important indicator 
of future financial performance. 
Description
The Group’s organic revenue growth 
is calculated by taking the increase in 
revenue over prior year pro-forma revenue, 
at constant exchange rates. Prior year 
pro-forma revenue excludes the impact 
of acquisitions and disposals.
Description
The earnings before interest and tax, 
excluding all specific adjusting items*.
Description
The underlying earnings, net of interest  
and tax, expressed in pence per share.
Description
This is the total Group profit, net of interest 
and tax, including all specific adjusting items* 
and including discontinued operations.
Description
This represents net cash flow from operations 
before cash flows of specific adjusting items, 
less net cash outflows on the purchase/sale 
of intangible assets, plant and equipment, 
and pension deficit repair payments.
Rationale
This provides a measure of the Group’s ability 
to replace completed contracts/business with 
new contracts/business.
Rationale
Organic revenue growth demonstrates the 
Group’s capability to grow market share and 
sources of revenue within its chosen markets 
before the effect of acquisitions, disposals 
and currency translation.
Rationale
Underlying operating profit is used by the 
Group for performance analysis as a measure 
of operating profitability that is tracked over 
time. Specific adjusting items are excluded 
because their size and nature mask the true 
underlying performance year-on-year.
Rationale
Underlying EPS provides a measure of 
the earnings generated by the Group after 
deducting tax and interest. Specific adjusting 
items are excluded because their size 
and nature mask the true underlying 
performance year-on-year.
Rationale
This shows the overall financial performance 
of the Group reflecting both underlying  
and specific adjusting items of income and 
expenditure. It is a key financial measure used  
to reflect overall financial performance 
for the year.
Rationale
This provides a measure of the Group’s ability 
to generate cash from its operations and gives 
an indication of its ability to make discretionary 
investments and pay dividends to shareholders.
Performance this year
Orders grew 2% to £675.3m (2016: £659.8m), 
which included the award of the £109m, 11-year 
renewal from the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) 
for the Naval Combat System Integration 
Support Services (NCSISS).
The £1bn LTPA amendment signed during 
the year significantly increased the Group’s 
order book. As in previous years this was not 
included in reported orders to avoid distortion.
The contribution from businesses acquired 
during 2017 was £3.9m.
Performance this year
Revenue grew 4% to £783.1m (2016: £755.7m). 
Organic revenue growth, excluding the impact 
of foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 
1% compared to a 1% decline in 2016. Global 
products grew 8% organically, with EMEA 
Services stable.
Performance this year
Underlying operating profit* increased to 
£116.3m (2016: £108.9m). EMEA Services 
benefited from a £5.2m credit relating to the 
release of engine servicing obligations as we 
invest in new aircraft for test aircrew training. 
Global Products benefited from favourable 
foreign exchange movements and £2.2m 
of credits relating to historical overseas 
contractual disputes.
The contribution from businesses acquired 
during 2017 was £1.2m.
Performance this year
Underlying EPS grew 11% due to the increase 
in operating profit and the reduced share 
count, following the completion of the £50m 
share buyback.
Performance this year
Total Group profit after tax increased due to 
the higher underlying operating profit and an 
£18.4m profit on the disposal of property. 
The prior year included a £31.9m impairment 
charge and £16.2m profit on the sale of the 
Cyveillance business.
Performance this year
Underlying operating cash flow was £79.0m 
(2016: £103.6m) and included a £7m payment 
for a very old overseas dispute, an increase 
in capital expenditure and some working 
capital unwind. 
Link to strategy
Order intake is an important measure of 
progress of the implementation of our strategy, 
the objective of which is to grow the Group, 
and is used for the Bonus Banking Plan. 
For Executive remuneration it is adjusted 
to exclude businesses acquired in the year.

benefited from a £5.2m credit relating to the 
release of engine servicing obligations as we 
invest in new aircraft for test aircrew training. 
Global Products benefited from favourable 
foreign exchange movements and £2.2m 
of credits relating to historical overseas 
contractual disputes.
The contribution from businesses acquired 
during 2017 was £1.2m.
Performance this year
Underlying EPS grew 11% due to the increase 
in operating profit and the reduced share 
count, following the completion of the £50m 
share buyback.
Performance this year
Total Group profit after tax increased due to 
the higher underlying operating profit and an 
£18.4m profit on the disposal of property. 
The prior year included a £31.9m impairment 
charge and £16.2m profit on the sale of the 
Cyveillance business.
Performance this year
Underlying operating cash flow was £79.0m 
(2016: £103.6m) and included a £7m payment 
for a very old overseas dispute, an increase 
in capital expenditure and some working 
capital unwind.

21 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Key performance indicators Principal risks
Effective risk management is 
key to delivering our strategic 
objectives and realising our vision.
The Board is accountable for effective risk management 
across the Group. Board-level oversight is discharged 
through two committees: 
 – Audit Committee: focuses on risks where the 
primary impact is financial; and 
 – Risk & CSR Committee: focuses on risks where 
the primary impact is non-financial.
The reports of the Audit Committee and Risk & CSR 
Committee can be found on pages 59 to 65. Details 
of the Group’s system of risk management and internal 
control can be found in the Corporate Governance 
statement on pages 54 to 58. 
Risk appetite
The Board defines and reviews its tolerance of risk 
through establishing a clear risk appetite and setting 
appropriate delegations of authority to the executive 
and senior leaders. Risk appetite within QinetiQ focuses 
on those critical risk areas necessary to achieve our 
strategic goals. The risk appetite is articulated by 
defining three categories which describe the balance 
of scrutiny and mitigation activity against likely 
benefit or reward:
 – Eager: Willing to consider all delivery options despite 
greater inherent risk and eager to be innovative.
 – Balanced: Preference for delivery options that have 
a low or moderate degree of residual risk. Applying 
innovation only where successful delivery is likely.
 – Cautious: Avoidance of uncertainty with negligible 
or low residual risk. Applying innovation prudently 
where the risks are fully understood.
Commercial appetite
These three categories are then used within the context 
of the business strategy to define the Board’s 
commercial appetite as:
Delivery/ +
capabilities
Markets/ =
Customers
Commercial  
appetite
Proven Existing Eager
Proven New Eager/balanced
New Existing Balanced
New New Balanced/cautious
Risk register
The Group Risk Register consists of material risks 
relating to effective delivery of our strategy. The Board 
recognises that some risks may be affected by factors 
outside the control of the Company and also recognises 
that however good the risk management processes are 
they cannot provide absolute assurance and unknown 
risks may manifest without warning; the Company has 
processes in place to deploy appropriate management 
to such risks.
Longer-term viability assessment
Assessing the prospects of the Group
The Group’s corporate planning processes involve 
the following individual processes covering differing 
time frames:
1. An annual Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP) 
process that looks at the detailed financials for the 
subsequent three years, together with an overview 
of one additional year, to 31 March 2021.
2. An annual budget process that covers the 
subsequent year.
3. A bi-annual detailed forecast process to update 
the view of the first budget year (the year now 
in progress).
4. A rolling monthly ‘latest best estimate’ process to 
assess significant changes to the budget/forecast 
for the year in progress.
The corporate planning process is underpinned by 
assessing scenarios and risks that encompass a wide 
spectrum of potential outcomes, both favourable and 
adverse. The downside risk scenarios are designed 
to explore the resilience of the Group to the potential 
impact of all the significant risks set out on pages 
23 to 25, or a combination of those risks.
The scenarios are designed to be severe but plausible, 
and take full account of the availability and likely 
effectiveness of the mitigating actions that could be 
taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of 
the underlying risks, and that realistically would be open 
to them in the circumstances. In considering the likely 
effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the 
Board’s regular monitoring and review of risk and 
internal control systems, as discussed on page 64, 
is taken into account. It is assumed that existing 
undrawn bank facilities could be re-financed as 
they mature in FY20.
Alongside the annual review of risk scenarios applied to 
the strategic plan, performance is rigorously monitored 
to alert the Board and Executive Committee to the 
potential crystallisation of a key risk.
We consider that this stress-testing-based assessment 
of the Group’s prospects is reasonable in the 
circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved.
The period over which we confirm longer-term viability
While the Directors have no reason to believe the Group 
will not be viable over a longer period than three years, 
given the inherent uncertainty involved, the period over 
which the Directors consider it possible to form a 
reasonable expectation as to the Group’s longer-term 
viability is the three-year period to 31 March 2020. This 
period, essentially the period used for our mid-term 
business plans that are subject to stress-testing and 
scenario planning, has been selected because it 
presents the Board and readers of the Annual Report 
with a reasonable degree of confidence whilst still 
providing an appropriate longer-term outlook.
Confirmation of longer-term viability
As noted on page 58, the Directors confirm that their 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group 
was robust. Based upon the robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and their stress-testing-
based assessment of the Group’s prospects, all of which 
are described in this assessment, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period to 31 March 2020.

  The 2017 margin excluding the £5.2m non-
recurring release in respect of LTPA engine 
servicing obligations was 14.3%.
Orders, excluding the £1bn LTPA amendment, 
grew 5% to £520.9m (2016: £495.4m) including 
the award of the £109m 11-year renewal from 
the MOD for the Naval Combat System 
Integration Support Services (NCSISS), 
and £80m of additional orders added to 
the Air Strategic Enterprise contract. 
The £1bn amendment to the LTPA signed 
during the year has significantly increased 
total EMEA Services backlog. The remaining 
LTPA contract is due to be repriced on 
31 March 2018. 
Revenue was flat on both a reported basis 
and an organic constant currency basis with 
a broadly consistent performance across all 
business units within the division. The impact 
of the RubiKon acquisition, which completed 
in January 2017, and favourable foreign 
exchange movements were largely offset 
by the Cyveillance disposal in the prior year. 
At the beginning of the new financial year, 79% 
of EMEA Services’ FY18 revenue was under 
contract, compared with 77% at the beginning 
of the prior year. 
Underlying operating profit* reduced to £92.7m 
(2016: £93.8m). FY17 underlying operating 
profit* included a £5.2m credit relating to the 
release of engine servicing obligations as we 
invest in new aircraft for test aircrew training. 
There were other contract adjustments 
impacting on the results, but the financial 
impact of these was not material in aggregate. 
Excluding the £5.2m credit, a £3m credit in 
FY16 and the effect of foreign exchange and 
acquisitions, underlying operating profit fell by 
£4.6m, predominantly driven by the lower 
baseline profit rate for single source contracts. 
The impact of the lower baseline profit rate in 
FY17 was in line with our expectations. 
As we anticipated, the baseline profit rate for 
new and renewed single source contracts 
signed in FY18 will fall by 149 basis points 
from the FY17 baseline rate. Including the 
LTPA contract, 76% of EMEA Services revenue 
(2016: 74%) is derived from single source 
contracts, an increased proportion of which 
is now contracted on a long-term basis. For 
example, the 11-year, £1bn amendment to 
the LTPA, signed in December 2016, was 
contracted using the FY17 single source 
profit formula.
FY17 review 
Air & Space (30% of EMEA Services revenue)
The Air & Space business de-risks complex 
aerospace programmes by testing systems 
and equipment, evaluating the risks and 
assuring safety. 
Modernising UK Test & Evaluation

develop and test new information warfare 
capabilities through a series of trials, 
including defensive cyber operations, 
digital influence operations and 
artificial intelligence.
 – The business led a team from across QinetiQ 
to deliver Unmanned Warrior for the Royal 
Navy, a demonstration by 40 companies of 
how autonomous vehicles under the water, 
on the surface and in the air, can be used 
for future operations such as mine hunting. 
 – Later in 2017, it will host another 
international exercise at MOD Hebrides – 
Formidable Shield. 
 – To enable similar exercises to take place, the 
business is modernising the air ranges, with 
work beginning to upgrade facilities and 
tracking radar at the Hebrides range.
Investing in innovation
 – The business is a member of a UK industrial 
consortium, called Dragonfire, which won a 
£30m contract for a Capability Demonstrator 
Programme for laser technology. The 
demonstration is reliant on an innovative 
QinetiQ-developed technology, with the 
trials taking place on LTPA sites.

Modernising UK Test & Evaluation 
 – The business won a £10m contract to 
link existing Typhoon synthetic training at 
RAF bases to the QinetiQ-run Distributed 
Synthetic Air Land Training (DSALT) facility 
at RAF Waddington, building towards the 
MOD’s ambition to integrate all synthetic 
training into one programme. 
 – It delivered a cyber range for an Army 
exercise as part of a growing capability 
to support customers in the test and 
evaluation of cyber operations.
Building an international company
 – The business delivered its stand-off 
threat detection system, SPO-NX, to the 
US Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) for use at several high-profile 
events, including the US Presidential 
inauguration ceremony.
Investing in innovation
 – The business leads research framework 
contracts for the UK MOD, managing a 
network of more than 100 UK SMEs, as 
well as innovation initiatives for local and 
regional governments to support local 
business growth. 
 – This includes bringing together expertise 
in technology horizon scanning, human 
sciences, commercial off-the-shelf 
exploitation and experimentation as a 
service to help customers keep pace with 
the rapidly evolving technical and social 
media landscape. 
 – During the year the business secured 
contracts totalling £10m for secured 
navigation, working with European and 
UK Government customers to enable the 
effective exploitation by users of the Galileo 
constellation of satellites – the European 
Union version of GPS which goes live in 
FY21. This included the first demonstration 
of accessing the encrypted Public Regulated 
Service (PRS) in real-life applications. 
The business has built on this success 
by agreeing a partnership to go to market 
with Rockwell Collins around the globe.
 
International (8% of EMEA Services revenue)
On 1 April 2016 a new International business 
was established to deliver our capabilities in 
international markets.
 – In January 2017, the Group acquired 
RubiKon Group, an Australian integrated 
logistics support provider. The acquisition 
allows QinetiQ Australia to provide a 
more comprehensive service offering 
to customers and pursue ‘strategic 
partner’ opportunities with the 
Australian Government.
 – QinetiQ Australia continued to develop its 
core capabilities, extending contracts for the 
provision of integrated engineering services 
at the Defence Science and Technology 
Group’s Fishermen’s Bend workshop in

win with a contract to provide advice 
to the Royal Canadian Coast Guard. 
 – A new QinetiQ office is also being 
established in Malaysia to support 
sales and marketing in South East Asia. 
EMEA Services FY18 outlook
In EMEA Services revenue under contract 
for FY18 is in line with the prior year, and the 
division is expected to deliver modest revenue 
growth this year although the lower baseline 
profit rate for single source contracts 
represents a headwind for operating margins.
QinetiQ is enabling Royal Air Force Typhoon pilots to 
train together in virtual environments from different 
locations by linking simulators at the Squadrons’ 
Main Operating Bases. The project is a new addition 
to QinetiQ’s existing Distributed Synthetic Air Land 
Training (DSALT) contract with the UK Ministry of 
Defence, which provides synthetic mission training 
at RAF Waddington’s Air Battlespace Training 
Centre (pictured).

Global Products delivers innovative solutions to meet customer requirements and 
undertakes contract-funded research and development, developing intellectual 
property in partnership with key customers and through internal funding with 
potential for new revenue streams. The division is technology-based and has

portfolio with the introduction of several 
new enhancements to its data classification 
offering, which it provides to large military 
and commercial organisations.
Global Products FY18 Outlook
The Group’s Global Products division has 
shorter order cycles than EMEA Services 
and its performance is dependent on the 
timing of shipments of key orders. As a 
result of its contracted orders and pipeline 
of opportunities, as well as the anticipated 
full year contribution from the Target 
Systems acquisition, the division is 
expected to continue to grow in FY18. 
A Mk. II TALON robot from Japan-based Explosive 
Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 5, is used to inspect 
a suspicious package during a force protection and 
anti-terrorism training exercise at a United States Navy 
base in Japan. The exercise trained first responders 
and support personnel how to react to an improvised 
explosive device scenario. 
29 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report | Operating review People and relationships
Our employees and their relationships 
with others are at the heart of our 
vision to be the chosen partner.
At the heart of our vision is partnership, innovation 
and a vision-led strategy. Our people are critical to this 
and they make QinetiQ a truly unique organisation. Our 
values and the strong relationships we have with our 
people, customers, suppliers, business partners and 
communities are core to our business success. By 
harnessing these relationships, we can also create 
value for society by developing the skills of the 
next generation and contributing positively to 
the communities where we work.
Our people
People strategy
In FY17, we created a new people strategy to support 
our vision and strategy, that is values-led and balances 
the needs of employees and other stakeholders. The 
strategy is based on four integrated elements that work 
together to develop ‘Engaged People in Winning Teams’. 
The elements are ‘Right People’, ‘Right Culture’, ‘Right 
Learning’ and ‘Right Reward’. We will drive the 
development of the key elements in FY18.
Engaging our people
Engaged employees are vital to a successful business. 
The Employee Engagement Group (EEG) is an 
independent consultative forum which provides a 
trusted and effective two-way dialogue between the 
Company and employees. It ensures that our people 
are informed and engaged on key people issues, 
especially during times of change and it has been 
particularly valuable during our transformation. We 
regularly communicate with employees to ensure 
they understand QinetiQ’s strategy, performance 
and business priorities. Our communication channels 
include the intranet, monthly face-to-face Q-Talks with 
leaders and six-monthly roadshows with the Executive 
Committee. This ensures that across the Group our 
people understand how what they do contributes 
to our strategy and that they are knowledgeable 
about our Company. In FY18, we will be introducing the 
‘Global Portal’ a new intranet platform, enabling greater 
connectivity for our people across the Group. We use a 
number of channels to gather and understand employee 
engagement. We seek regular feedback as part of 
our face-to-face sessions with leaders (Q-Talks and 
roadshows) as well as more formally through surveys. 
In addition we monitor voluntary employee turnover, 
which reduced in FY17 (page 19). In FY17 we again 
used Best Companies to run a survey for all employees 
(excluding QNA, where they use the Top Work Places 
survey, administered by Workplace Dynamics), to 
independently measure levels of employee engagement. 
This annual survey is complemented by a shorter 
six-monthly ‘pulse’ to provide a detailed view of how 
engaged our people feel. The response rate was 70% 
and we scored 596 (compared to 623 in FY16). FY17 
was a year of significant change, which has been 
understandably challenging for many employees and 
this is reflected in the fall in the score. Feedback from 
the executive roadshows is seeing an upward trend 
on specific issues, e.g. ‘I am confident about the 
future’. Our employee surveys and feedback help us 
identify specific areas where we can work to improve 
performance and engagement and we are committed 
to acting on the feedback we receive. In FY18 we are 
seeking to simplify our approach to measuring and 
action planning on engagement, empowering teams 
to support change. One such approach will be to 
introduce ‘Rapid Improvement Events’ to remove 
barriers and support team collaboration.
  Page 19 Non-financial KPIs: Employee engagement 
and Employee turnover
Corporate values and culture
In FY17, we introduced new corporate values – integrity, 
collaboration and performance – to underpin our 
vision and strategy. These values reinforce our ongoing 
commitment to responsible business practice and 
our focus on delivering for our customers, through 
partnership. Their introduction followed a programme 
to engage with our people in the process of change and 
to ensure that our values resonate across the diversity 
of our workforce. The values have been embedded 
in our updated Code of Conduct and Performance 
Development Review (PDR) to ensure we capture 
’how’ people deliver results as well as what results 
they deliver. Cultural development is a key part of our 
transformation and four Transformation Action Groups 
(TAGs) have been set up to address Collaboration, 
Recognition, Culture and Communication. Under the 
Recognition TAG, a new employee recognition scheme 
has been initiated, with categories such as living our 
values, customer focus, innovation and community. 
Safety, health and wellbeing
The safety, health and wellbeing of our people and the 
environment we operate within are intrinsically linked 
to our success and underpin our strategic goals. 
In July 2016, an air accident involving a contracted-in 
Yak aircraft operating in support of the Empire Test 
Pilots’ School (ETPS) sadly resulted in the death of an 
RAF pilot and serious injury to the contractor pilot. We 
are actively supporting the subsequent official inquiries 
and will respond to all recommendations made. 
The lost time incident (LTI) rate is calculated as the 
number of lost time incidents, where the employee 
is away from work for one or more days, times 1,000, 
divided by the total number of employees. The LTI rate 
has increased from 5.0 to 5.7 following a small increase 
in lost time incidents. There were no prosecutions, 
prohibition notices or improvement notices issued 
by regulators in the UK during the last financial year. 
Lost Time 
Incident Rate 2017 2016 2015
QinetiQ Group 5.7 5.0 5.6
FY18 will see the launch of a new three-year Health 
Safety and Environment strategy. We are working 
together to reduce work-related ill-health and injury 
where our people are safe and healthy and enjoy a good 
work-life balance while feeling empowered and involved 
in making improvements. To assist this we have put 
in place a new Steering Committee, chaired by the 
Company Secretary and Group General Counsel, to 
coordinate the development and implementation of the 
strategy. Part of our new strategy involves the ongoing 
roll out of ‘Safe for Life’ across the Group during FY18, 
which focuses on behavioural safety aspects to 
improve safety and health (See page 18).
Integrity
Trusted to do the right thing 
at all times, we take pride in 
our decisions, and work to 
create a sustainable and 
responsible business.
Collaboration
The chosen partner for 
customers and industry 
colleagues, we are a diverse 
and inclusive community with 
a common purpose; every 
contribution is valued.
Performance
Customer focused and  
highly responsive, providing 
operational excellence  
and assuring safe and 
secure delivery.
30 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Equality, diversity and inclusion (ED&I)
For sustained business success, it is vital to create a 
workplace that is inclusive; where our diversity drives 
innovation and creativity for our customers. To achieve 
this, we have revitalised our programme to ensure we 
create a workplace and culture where everyone can 
be authentic, feel valued and realise their full potential. 
Under the new ED&I strategy we will focus on leadership 
and culture, training, communication and awareness, 
recruitment and outreach. In FY18 we will deliver updated 
training for key roles, review policy and introduce Fair 
Treatment Advisors who will provide an additional route 
for advice and support for our people. We will continue to 
collaborate with like-minded organisations and networks 
to share ideas. QinetiQ is subject to new Gender Pay

The 5% Club – Investing in a Generation
As with many companies in our sector, we need to consider 
the age diversity of our scientists and engineers and we are 
taking a number of steps to ensure access to talent now 
and in the future. QinetiQ is a founding member of The 5% 
Club, which aims to increase the employment and career 
prospects of today’s youth and equip the UK with the skilled 
workforce it needs. A commitment of the campaign is 
to publish the number of employees on apprenticeships 
and graduate programmes and sponsored students; the 
breakdown is shown below. We have seen a slight reduction 
this year, due in part to the acquisition of QinetiQ Target 
Systems, and as a result of our reorganisation, which has 
meant a change to how we recruit. Our plans for next 
year will see us increase our investment in QinetiQ 
Early Career programmes.

Learning and development
The QinetiQ Academy is a fundamental enabler of our 
vision and strategy, helping our people to develop and 
fulfil their potential, through three faculties – People, 
Business and Engineering, Science and Technical. 
Our learning management system has been developed 
further in FY17, providing employee access to a growing 
catalogue of training courses and we have invested in 
supporting a number of our people to undertake PhDs, 
as part of our IRAD programme. Key highlights in FY17 
include a suite of aligned development programmes:
 – Executive Committee development programme.
 – Leadership development programme for 
our top 100 leaders (see page 14). 
 – Managers have been trained on a revised PDR 
process, via a programme called ‘Raising the Bar’.
 – A management development programme (MDP) 
to develop our 1,100 line managers; MDP covers 
managing transformation and leadership culture.
Business ethics and anti-bribery 
Our Code of Conduct lays out our ethical standards, 
providing our people with clear direction and guidance 
on how we do business across the Group and how to 
get help. The Code (which has been updated) forms a 
cornerstone of our Operating Framework (see page 64 
for more on governance and the role of the Risk & CSR 
Committee). Training on business ethics is mandatory 
for all of our people, as well as Board members and is 
available for our suppliers and customers. As well as 
explaining the Code of Conduct, the training provides 
challenging scenarios to help our people know what to 
do if they were to come across issues such as bribery, 
conflict of interest, discrimination and modern slavery. 
Our people are provided with a number of routes to seek 
help or raise concerns. They are encouraged to talk to 
a manager, use our ethics email advice services and 
our independently-run 24/7 confidential reporting line 
(see page 58). We have provided prompt help and advice 
in response to all queries received via our ethics email 
advice services and all communication through the 
confidential reporting line is appropriately investigated.
We have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption and have put in place a range of governance 
measures. Our anti-bribery programme is overseen by 
our Chief Ethics Officer (the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary). We address the risk of bribery in 
our international business risk management process; 
undertaking due diligence, monitoring and auditing of 
our use of commercial intermediaries. We use expert 
third-party providers of due diligence where appropriate. 
We provide more in-depth anti-bribery training for those 
in higher risk roles, for example those who carry out 
overseas business.

Human rights
We seek to anticipate, prevent and mitigate potential 
negative human rights impacts through our policy 
and processes, which underpin our commitment 
to responsible business practices. These include 
our Code of Conduct, business ethics training and 
policies to support adherence to export controls, 
health and safety, non-discrimination, anti-bribery 
and environmental laws. This is further supported 
by our procedures on product and service trading, 
product safety, sustainable procurement, due diligence 
and risk management. We monitor the application of 
these policies and procedures through our business 
assurance processes. We believe that this embedded 
approach is effective. We have a structured approach to 
understanding human rights risk within our international 
business risk management process and in our supply 
chain. Our ongoing programme to address modern 
slavery has resulted in updated policies and training. 
Our statement on modern slavery and human 
trafficking is published on our website.

Relationships
The relationships we have with customers, suppliers, 
business partners and communities are core to our 
business today and in the long term. For us, working 
collaboratively with these groups delivers better 
outcomes which will drive growth, innovation and 
transformation. Collaboration – one of our three 
values – will help us to realise our vision to become 
the chosen partner around the world for mission-critical 
solutions, innovating for our customers’ advantage.
Customer focus
Collaborative working is a critical enabler of success 
throughout our strategic campaigns, for us, our 
customers, partners and suppliers (page 6). During 
FY17, we have placed significant, focused effort on 
strengthening our relationships with the UK MOD and 
the broader UK Government agencies and this can be 
seen in the progressive contracts we have won under 
the LTPA delivering true transformation across the 
UK test and evaluation enterprise. We have also taken 
significant steps forward on improving vital connections 
with industry partners, with collaborative agreements 
signed with BAE Systems, Boeing Defence UK, MBDA 
and Thales. By working collaboratively, we will secure 
joint growth with our partners and suppliers to provide 
our customers with better capability and value for 
money while accelerating programme timelines 
and reducing risk. 
We are signatories to the Armed Forces Corporate 
Covenant. In 2016, Steve Wadey was presented with 
the MOD’s Gold Award by the Duke of Cambridge, as 
part of the Defence Employer Recognition Scheme. The 
scheme encourages employers to support defence and 
inspire others to do the same. The award recognised 
our approach to recruitment and our commitment 
to our employees who are reservists.
  Page 18 Non-financial KPI: customer satisfaction
Supply chain
At QinetiQ, we see our supply chain as a critical asset 
as we look to grow our business. This year has seen 
an unprecedented investment in our supply chain in 
support of the test aircrew training and air range 
modernisation interventions, and many of our future 
key campaigns are dependent on partnering and 
contracting with industry to deliver integrated solutions 
to our customers. We are committed to making QinetiQ 
easy to do business with, especially for the SME 
community. This commitment has been demonstrated 
by our innovative approach to supply chain engagement 
on our Strategic Enterprise programme. Our approach 
to safety and governance in our supply chain remains 
paramount. We continue to refine our approach to risk 
management in the supply chain across the Group to 
both protect the interests of QinetiQ and its shareholders, 
and also the employees of our subcontractors.
Community relationships 
As a responsible employer, we invest in making a 
positive difference in the communities where we 
operate. Across QinetiQ Group, we provide employees 
with time for skills-based volunteering, (typically one 
day, at manager discretion). Our main focus is our 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) 
outreach programme which aims to inspire the next 
generation of scientists and engineers, contributing to 
solving skills shortages and youth unemployment and 
underpinning our approach to skills, recruitment and 
retention. This year we have engaged with over 5,700 
young people through bespoke activities and with 
teachers (see case study). We have also engaged with 
over 6,300 young people at events such as The Skills 
Show. Outreach focused on girls forms part of our ED&I 
strategy. As part of National Women in Engineering Day 
2016 we hosted inspirational events for young women at 
six locations across the UK. We will continue to promote 
the benefits of skills-based volunteering in FY18.
  Page 24 Principal risks and uncertainties: 
recruitment and retention.
Some of the sites we manage on behalf of the 
MOD have dedicated full-time Community Liaison 
Officers who manage local community and stakeholder 
relationships specific to the site. This year saw the 
end of our five-year partnerships with our existing 
charities, donating a total of £251,800 through employee 
fundraising and corporate matched funding. In the 
UK, employees have voted to select new corporate 
charities and we have also selected local Charity of the 
Year partners across many of our UK sites. In the US, 
employees fund-raise for a number of defence charities 
and in Australia we have a two-year partnership with 
the Australian War Memorial in Canberra to provide 
in-kind advisory services and engineering expertise.

Insight placement to offer them 
a real-world insight and a better 
understanding of the skills 
young people need in STEM 
careers. The programme is

32 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Resources and environment
Our aim is to deliver continuous improvement 
in our environmental management so that we 
play our part in protecting the environment.
With increasing pressure on natural resources, climate 
change and global ambitions arising from the Paris 
Agreement and the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals, we play our part in protecting the environment 
and support the sustainability requirements of 
our customers. 
Environmental stewardship
Our overall aim is to deliver continuous improvement 
in our environmental management. We are on target to 
successfully transition to ISO 14001:2015 and are due 
to achieve certification in the next financial year. Part 
of this, has been our ongoing commitment to review 
policy and process and communication with our people. 
In FY17, we assessed climate change risks on some 
of the main sites we operate and identified appropriate 
mitigations. We continue to be active members of the 
MOD – Industry Sustainable Procurement Working 
Group to ensure that we understand the sustainability 
agenda of a key customer. During FY17 we supported 
the successful delivery of Unmanned Warrior through 
close working and collaboration with QinetiQ project 
teams, industry partners and customer representatives. 
This involved sharing knowledge and experience to help 
meet and exceed our customers’ expectations, ensuring 
local areas of conservation were not affected and in 
particular, important seal haul-outs.
FY18 will see the launch of a new three-year health, 
safety and environmental strategy. Through continuing 
to mitigate our main environmental impacts and  
risks, and ensuring environmental considerations 
are addressed through the supply chain, we will 
continue to improve our environmental performance. 
The development of a stakeholder focused 
communication plan will enable us to improve the 
transparency of our environmental performance and 
embed our environmental approach into our whole 
culture to meet the expectations of our stakeholders.
Greenhouse gas emissions and energy management
Managing our energy reduces our impact on the 
environment and it improves our operational efficiency. 
In the UK business last year we achieved certification to 
ISO 50001 (BS EN ISO 50001:2011 Energy Management 
System) in recognition of the systems and processes 
in place to manage our energy consumption. We have 
used the framework to improve our approach to energy 
management and strive to embed energy efficiency 
best practice across the UK business. We continued 
our Energy Matters programme, communicating with 
our people, growing our network of Energy Champions 
and empowering our Energy Engineers to identify 
and implement energy saving projects. As part 
of transformation, the modern working environment 
programme has seen significant improvements in 
our video conferencing capability which can support a 
reduction in travel. We meet the requirements of ESOS 
(the Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme) through a 
combination of ISO 50001 certification and an energy 
audit report produced by our appointed ESOS Lead 
Assessor. We continue to submit voluntarily to 
the Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Change 
Programme, and are registered for the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment (CRC) scheme.
Our Group greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 
captured to meet the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic report and Directors’ report) 
Regulations 2013. The table below provides a summary 
of the Group’s GHG emissions from 1 April 2016 to 
31 March 2017, giving a summary of Scope 1 (fuel 
combustion and operation of facilities) and Scope 2 
(purchased electricity) emissions and an intensity ratio 
(per £m of revenue). We have adopted a financial control 
approach and have used the latest emissions factors 
from the UK Government, and the International Energy 
Authority. Our overall emissions have reduced by 13,192 
tonnes of CO
2
 (tCO
2
e) against the FY14 base year (our 
first year of GHG reporting for the Group). In FY17, we 
saw a 10% reduction against the previous financial year 
through a combination of new building management 
system projects, changes to operational activity, a 
milder winter and changes in GHG emission factors. 
We have made improvements to our GHG calculation 
methods and have identified some minor new emission 
sources. We have therefore corrected the FY16 data 
reported below compared with previously reported 
data. Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been 
externally verified by an independent third party, Carbon 
Credentials, against the ISO 14064-3 standard. The 
verification statement can be found on our website.

34 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Since joining QinetiQ from Rolls-Royce on 1 March 2017, 
I have been very active in getting to know the Company. 
In doing so, I have been impressed by the calibre of the 
people I have met and their commitment to serving 
our customers.
Thanks to the hard work of QinetiQ’s former CFO David 
Mellors, supported by the finance team, and Dr Malcolm 
Coffin who acted as Interim CFO, the financial position 
of the Group is strong and we have a solid foundation 
for the future. I am excited about building on this to 
help QinetiQ realise its potential.
Overview
Orders, excluding the £1bn amendment to the LTPA, 
grew 2% to £675.3m (2016: £659.8m), and were stable 
on an organic basis at constant currency. Key orders 
won in FY17 included the award of the £109m, 11-year 
renewal from the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) for the 
Naval Combat System Integration Support Services 
(NCSISS), £80m of additional orders added to the Air 
Strategic Enterprise contract and $41m US aircraft 
carrier orders. 
At the beginning of the new financial year, 74% of the 
Group’s FY18 revenue was under contract, in line with 
74% a year ago.

Revenue was up 4% at £783.1m (2016: £755.7m), 
including favourable foreign exchange movements and 
the acquisition of QinetiQ Target Systems and RubiKon. 
Revenue grew by 1% on an organic basis, after adjusting 
for foreign exchange movements, acquisitions and the 
divestment of Cyveillance in the prior year, due primarily 
to a strong performance in QinetiQ North America.

and a £31.9m impairment of US goodwill.
Underlying basic earnings per share* were 18.1p 
(2016: 16.3p) benefiting from the higher underlying

the completion of the £50m share buyback. Basic 
earnings per share for the total Group were 21.5p 
(2016: 18.1p per share). The average number of 
shares in issue during the year, as used in the 
basic earnings per share calculations, was 573.9m 
(2016: 587.0m) and there were 564.3m shares in 
issue at 31 March 2017 (all net of Treasury shares).

Specific adjusting items
Specific adjusting items, shown in the ‘middle column’, 
at the profit after tax level amounted to a total credit 
of £19.5m (FY16 credit: £10.2m). This included a profit 
of £18.4m recognised on the disposal of property and 
£4.1m of deferred tax movements, predominantly 
relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
in respect of tax losses.
The prior year included a profit of £16.2m recognised 
on the disposal of Cyveillance, a £7.5m gain following 
the closure of certain US Services warranty issues and 
a £31.9m impairment of US goodwill. There was also a 
net tax credit of £21.2m in the prior year, which included 
the impact of the statutory change to the research and 
development tax credits regime offset by the associated 
surrender of previously capitalised tax losses and other 
non-recurring deferred tax movements.
Acquisitions
On 21 December 2016, the Group acquired 100% of 
the issued share capital of Meggitt Target Systems 
for £57.5m, or £60.3m including price adjustments 
for working capital and net debt. The business is 
an international provider of unmanned aerial, naval 
and land-based target systems and services for T&E 
and operational training and rehearsal. On the date 
of acquisition, its name was changed to QinetiQ 
Target Systems and it was integrated into QinetiQ’s 
International business and is reported in Global 
Products. Goodwill of £24.5m and intangible 
assets of £24.2m were recognised on acquisition.
On 31 January 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the 
issued share capital of RubiKon Group Pty Limited from 
its founder management team for £7.4m (AU$12.6m). 
This Australian company provides solutions to complex 
logistics, supply chain management and procurement 
projects. RubiKon was integrated into the Group’s 
Australia business and goodwill of £3.9m and intangible 
assets of £3.1m were recognised on acquisition.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs were £1.2m (2016: £1.3m). The 
underlying net finance costs* were £0.2m (2016: 
£0.2m), with an additional £1.0m (2016: £1.1m) 
in respect of the pension net finance expense 
reported within specific adjusting items*.
Taxation
The underlying effective tax rate of 10.6% (2016: 11.8%) 
continues to be below the UK statutory rate, primarily 
as a result of the benefit of research and development 
expenditure credits in the UK. The effective tax rate 
is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate 
in the medium term, subject to the impact of any tax 
legislation changes, the geographic mix of profits and 
the assumption that the benefit of net R&D expenditure 
credits retained by the Group remains in the tax line.
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of 
£141.7m (2016: £154.8m) which are available for offset 
against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £3.7m has 
been recognised in the year, with the income statement 
credit classified as a specific adjusting item. This asset 
is in respect of £18.8m of UK losses and £1.4m of 
Canadian losses. No deferred tax asset is recognised 
in respect of the remaining £121.5m of losses due to the 
uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation. The Group 
has £66.5m of time-limited losses of which US capital 
losses of £30.0m will expire in 2020. Of the remaining 
£36.5m time-limited losses, £4.4m will expire in 2034, 
£22.7m in 2035 and £9.4m in 2036. Deferred tax 
has been calculated using the enacted future 
statutory tax rates. 
The current tax liability is £43.7m as at 31 March 2017 
(31 March 2016: £39.9m). This includes a tax liability 
in the US related to an unfavourable court decision in 
respect of the tax treatment of the Group’s acquisition 
of Dominion Technology Resources, Inc. in 2008. An 
insurance policy was taken out by the Group at the 
point of acquisition and, if the court’s decision is final, 
the funds required to settle this dispute will be provided 
by the insurers. Hence, an offsetting receivable is 
reported on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 
(included within trade and other receivables).

Cash conversion 
(post-capex)* 68% 95%
Net cash £221.9m £274.5m
The underlying cash conversion* ratio, which is after 
capex and pension deficit repair payments, was 68% 
(2016: 95%), delivering a net cash flow from operations* 
of £79.0m (2016: £103.6m). The working capital 
movements were in line with expectations and include 
a £7m payment for a very old overseas dispute which 
had been fully provided for in a previous year, the £5.2m 
engine-servicing obligation release in EMEA Services 
and £2.2m of releases relating to overseas contractual 
disputes in Global Products. Excluding non-recurring 
items the underlying cash conversion* ratio would 
have been 80%.
Net capex increased to £32.9m (2016: £29.8m) and 
is expected to increase to £80m-£100m in FY18 as 
we invest in core contracts including the LTPA following 
the contract amendment announced in December 2016. 
The additional capex will be recovered in full under 
existing LTPA terms and modernises capabilities 
as a platform for growth.

36 Strategic report QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 At 31 March 2017, the Group had £221.9m net cash, 
compared to £274.5m net cash at 31 March 2016. 
The reduction was primarily due to a £65.7m outflow 
in respect of the two acquisitions, the completion of 
the £50m share buyback and £33.4m of dividends. 
In aggregate these exceeded the operating cash 
inflow for the year. 
Total committed facilities available to the Group 
at year end, consisting of a revolving credit facility 
which is currently undrawn, amounted to £245.7m 
(2016: £235.6m), the increase being solely due to 
foreign exchange movements. 
Capital allocation
Priorities for capital allocation are: 
1.  Organic investment complemented by bolt-on 
acquisitions where there is a strong strategic fit; 
2. The maintenance of balance sheet strength; 
3. A progressive dividend; and 
4. The return of excess cash to shareholders.
The £50m share repurchase, which was announced 
in November 2015, was completed by 31 March 2017.
Dividend
The Board proposes a final dividend of 4.0p (2016: 3.8p) 
making the full year dividend 6.0p (2016: 5.7p). Subject 
to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 1 September 2017 to 
shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017. The 
full year dividend represents an increase of 5% in 
line with the Group’s progressive dividend policy.
Pensions
The net pension asset under IAS 19, before adjusting 
for deferred tax, was £156.0m (31 March 2016: liability 
£37.7m). The market value of the assets at 31 March 2017 
was £1,926.3m (2016: £1,410.4m) and the present value 
of scheme liabilities was £1,770.3m (2016: £1,448.1m). 
The movement from a liability to an asset was driven 
by an increase in asset prices and the benefit of our 
continued strategy to reduce risk through hedging.
The key assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation 
of the scheme were:
Assumption 2017 2016
Discount rate 2.60% 3.40%
CPI inflation 2.35% 2.10%
Life expectancy – male 
(currently aged 40) 91 91
Life expectancy – female 
(currently aged 40) 93 93
Each assumption is selected by the Group in 
consultation with the Company actuary and takes 
account of industry practice amongst comparator 
listed companies. The sensitivity of each of the 
key assumptions is shown in the following table. 
Assumption

The impact of movements in Scheme liabilities will, 
to an extent, be offset by movements in the value of 
Scheme assets as the Scheme has assets invested in 
a Liability Driven Investment Portfolio. As at 31 March 
2017, this hedges against 63% of the interest rate risk 
and 100% of the inflation rate risk, as measured on 
the Trustees’ gilt-funded basis.
The last triennial valuation of the scheme, on a funding 
basis, was a net surplus of £31.0m as at 30 June 2014, 
although if a funding valuation was carried out today the 
valuation could be a net deficit and may differ materially 
from the IAS 19 accounting valuation due to the inherent 
methodology differences. There has been no change 
to the cash contributions required under the recovery 
plan, which continues to require £13m of Company 
contributions per annum until 31 March 2018. The 
next actuarial valuation is due as at 30 June 2017.

39 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance statement
An introduction from our Chairman.
Mark Elliott
Non-executive Chairman
Dear shareholder, 
This report focuses on how the Board has carried 
out its functions, its oversight of strategy and 
management activity, how it has applied good 
governance practices and how QinetiQ has complied 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and related regulations.
During the year under review, QinetiQ has progressed 
with delivery against the targets of its vision and 
strategy, which it developed and rolled out in 2015 and 
2016, under the guidance of the Executive Committee 
which was set up at the end of the last financial year. 
As part of this process, QinetiQ has sought to change 
its internal operating model, to provide greater efficiency 
in its offering to key customers and to expand 
internationally. Against this backdrop of change, it is 
therefore critical that the Board of Directors provides 
leadership, guidance and oversight, to ensure that 
QinetiQ operates a sound system of corporate 
governance and internal control through effective 
stewardship and risk management.
On the strategic and commercial front, during the 
year, the Board of Directors was involved in decisions 
concerning critical strategic campaign activity, including 
the efficiencies provided to its key customer, the UK 
Ministry of Defence, under the amendment to the Long 
Term Partnering Agreement, the Strategic Enterprise 
contract, the Naval Combat Systems Integration 
Support Services contract, the acquisition of the 
Target Systems business in the UK and Canada, 
and the acquisition of RubiKon in Australia.
In terms of oversight and assurance, during the year 
we carried out an external audit tender process which 
resulted in the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP as QinetiQ’s auditor for the financial year ending 
31 March 2018, subject to their appointment at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting, in place of KPMG 
LLP, who has been QinetiQ’s auditor since its formation 
in 2001. Further details of the audit tender process can 
be found on page 63 in the Audit Committee report. 
In terms of leadership, as noted on page 4, the Chief 
Financial Officer, David Mellors, resigned in December 
2016 and was replaced by David Smith in March 2017. 
There has been no change in Non-executive Directors 
during the year. The Nominations Committee has 
reviewed the skills required in the current and future 
Non-executive Directors and, during the coming year, the 
composition of the Board and diversity will remain areas 
of focus. During the current year, the Non-executive 
Directors have met with the wider leadership community 
at quarterly events, to increase their knowledge and 
understanding of the Company’s businesses and 
how they operate.
The Non-executive Directors continue to bring 
independent judgement on key issues affecting the 
Group, and the Board intends to continue to provide 
a solid foundation of robust corporate governance to 
underpin the work of the executive management team 
as QinetiQ proceeds with its strategic campaigns.

40 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance statement
Compliance statement
The Board considers that QinetiQ has 
complied with all relevant Provisions of 
the Code throughout the last financial year. 
Code Principle A
Leadership
A1
The Role of the Board
The Board represents the interests of QinetiQ and 
its shareholders. It comprises a range of experience 
and expertise required to meet the challenges facing 
the Group. The Board of Directors is responsible for 
overseeing the Group’s strategy and performance and 
ensuring the implementation of operational activity 
which supports the strategy. It has mandated the 
organisation’s standards of behaviour and its risk 
appetite, along with key policies and processes, 
and enables the business to implement strategy 
and monitor operational performance through 
its direction and advice. 
The Directors’ powers are subject to the Articles 
of Association and any applicable legislation. The 
Board has delegated the day-to-day operational 
management of the Company to the Executive Directors 
and members of the senior management team, but 
certain matters are reserved to it for its decision. 
The Board monitors the performance of the senior 
management team and organises its business 
to have regular interaction with key members 
of senior management.
The Board met seven times during the year. The 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board and the 
Board’s objectives and responsibilities can be found 
on page 44. This report contains a statement of how 
the Board operates, including which types of decisions 
are taken by the Board and which are delegated to 
management. Details of the Board and Committee 
membership and Directors’ attendance at Board and 
Committee meetings are set out on page 46.
A2
Division of Responsibilities
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are not 
exercised by the same individual and their separate 
responsibilities are established, set out in writing and 
approved by the Board.
A3
The Chairman
The Chairman, working with the Company Secretary, 
sets the agenda for Board meetings and encourages an 
open and constructive debate. In accordance with the 
Code, the Chairman was independent on appointment.
A4
Non-executive Directors
The Non-executive Directors bring independent 
judgement on key issues affecting the Group and its 
business operations, including strategy, performance, 
resources (including key appointments) and standards 
of conduct. They provide constructive challenge to 
management and help develop proposals on strategy. 
The Board has appointed a Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director. Regular meetings are held 
with the Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
without the executives present.
The Board considers that all the Non-executive Directors 
were independent of QinetiQ’s executive management 
and free from any business or other relationships that 
could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement throughout the last financial 
year. In accordance with the Code, the Board undertakes 
an annual review of the independence of the Non-
executive Directors.
The Non-executive Directors bring independent 
judgement on key issues affecting the Group and its 
business operations including strategy, performance, 
resources (including key appointments) and standards 
of conduct. Their independence of character and 
integrity, together with the experience and skills that 
they bring to their duties, prevent any individual or 
small group from dominating the decision-making 
of the Board as a whole.
Code Principle B
Effectiveness
B1
The Composition of the Board
In compliance with provision B.1.2 of the Code, at least 
half the Board (excluding the Chairman) comprises 
independent Non-executive Directors. The Board 
considers the overall size and composition to be 
appropriate, having regard to the experience and skills 
that individual Board members bring to their duties. 
They are able to operate at a high level independently 
of each other but also work together as a team.
The Board considers that the skills and experience 
of its individual members, particularly in the areas 
of UK defence and security, the commercialisation 
of innovative technologies, corporate finance 
and governance, international markets and risk 
management, have provided both support and 
challenge to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer and the executive management 
team during the year, in terms of both the formulation 
of the new strategy and transformation programme 
and also in respect of ‘business as usual’ items which 
require Board oversight, such as financial and trading 
matters and significant commercial projects.
At the date of this report, the Board has nine members: 
the Non-executive Chairman; six other Non-executive 
Directors; and two Executive Directors – the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial 
Officer (CFO). 
The following changes in Board membership took place 
during the year:
 – David Mellors resigned as an Executive Director 
and CFO on 31 December 2016.
 – David Smith was appointed as an Executive Director 
and CFO on 1 March 2017.
Details of the process for the appointment of the new 
CFO can be found in the report of the Nominations 
Committee on page 52.

Financial Reporting Council’s 
UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) as currently in

to other significant commitments and the Chairman 
consulted where appropriate.
B4
Director Training and Development
On appointment, Directors receive a tailored induction 
programme, comprising site visits, meetings with 
management, and training where required. On an 
ongoing basis, Directors receive appropriate training 
about the Company and their duties. The Directors 
are also required to complete the annual business 
ethics training, as noted on page 31. The Company 
Secretariat organises site visits and training to suit 
individual requirements.
David Smith, who joined the Board in March 2017, has 
received technical materials in respect of the Group’s 
policies and procedures, had a series of meetings with 
senior management, members of the Finance team and 
members of the wider leadership community, and has 
visited a number of QinetiQ sites, including Malvern and 
Portsmouth in the UK and Waltham in the USA. He has 
also met with the Company’s auditors, brokers, and 
financial and corporate relations advisors.
During the year, individual Non-executive Directors 
visited the Shoeburyness and Boscombe Down sites in 
the UK and the Waltham site in the USA, as a result of 
specific requests. The Board received collective training 
in the form of technical briefings from KPMG on 
accounting changes, from Ashurst on the Market Abuse 
Regulation and a corporate governance update from 
the Company Secretary. Non-executive Directors also 
personally arranged and attended external updates 
and training courses.
B5
Information and Support for Directors
The Chairman, working in conjunction with the Company 
Secretary, ensures that the Board receives accurate, 
timely and clear information.
B6
Performance Evaluation
An evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
Committees and individual Directors, is carried out 
annually, with an external, independent, review in 
each third year.
The most recent external review took place in 2016. 
It was carried out by Lintstock and took place in the 
final quarter of the year so that it could be fully focused 
on outside the financial reporting cycle and strategy 
meetings. The key findings of the prior year external 
evaluation review and progress against them can be 
found on page 50. 
During the year under review, an evaluation of 
the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees 
was carried out internally by way of a questionnaire 
completed by Board members. Details of the process 
and key findings of this evaluation and resulting 
priorities for the coming year can be found on page 51.
B7
Re-election of Directors
The Company requires each serving member of the 
Board to be put forward for election or re-election 
on an annual basis at each Annual General Meeting.
Code Principle C
Accountability
C1
Financial and Business Reporting
The Board presents its results at the full year and the 
half year and provides quarterly updates to the market. 
The Annual Report and Accounts contains a Strategic 
report which provides an explanation of how the 
Company generates or preserves value over the 
longer term (the business model) and the strategy 
for delivering the objectives of the Company. A going 
concern statement and longer-term viability statement 
are included on pages 58 and 22 respectively, 
responsibility statements can be found on page 95, 
and details of the process for ensuring that the Annual 
Report is fair, balanced and understandable can 
be found on page 61. There is also a statement 
in the auditor’s report on page 99 about their 
reporting responsibilities.
C2
Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness in safeguarding shareholders’ 
interests and the Company’s assets. 
During the year, 
individual Non-
executive Directors 
visited the 
Shoeburyness and 
Boscombe Down 
sites in the UK and 
the Waltham site 
in the USA.
42 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The system is designed to manage and mitigate, rather 
than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and, like any appropriate or proportionate 
system of corporate internal control, cannot provide 
absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Details of risk management and internal control 
processes can be found on pages 54 to 57. The risk 
management process and the system of internal control 
necessary to manage risks are assessed and monitored 
by the Audit Committee (financial risks) and the Risk 
& CSR Committee (non-financial risks). A report on 
specific risk review activity undertaken during the year 
by those committees, together with the current risk 
registers, is presented by the CEO to the Board annually. 
The Strategic report contains on pages 22 to 25 details 
of the Company’s principal risks and uncertainties, their 
impact and how they are managed. 
An explanation of how the Directors have assessed the 
prospects of the Company and a statement in respect 
of the Board’s assessment of the Company’s longer-term 
viability are set out on page 22.
C3
Audit Committee and Auditors
The Board has established an Audit Committee 
comprising at least three independent Non-executive 
Directors, with formal terms of reference. It oversees the 
financial risk management and internal controls process, 
the effectiveness of internal audit activities, the external 
auditor’s independence and objectivity and makes 
recommendations to the Board in respect of the 
reappointment of the external auditor and their 
remuneration. The report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on pages 59 to 63.
Code Principle D
Remuneration
D1
Level and Components of Remuneration
The Board has established a Remuneration Committee 
with formal terms of reference. It is responsible for 
ensuring that levels of remuneration are of sufficient 
quality and that any performance related elements 
are relevant, stretching and designed to promote 
the long-term success of the Company.
D2
Developing Remuneration Policy and Packages
The report of the Remuneration Committee can be 
found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 
82 to 84. It provides details of, or links to, the Group’s 
reward and remuneration policies and payments, 
and also the procedure for setting policy on 
Executive Director remuneration.
The Committee also recommends and monitors 
the level and structure of remuneration for senior 
management. The Directors’ remuneration report 
is incorporated into this corporate governance 
statement by reference.
Code Principle E
Relations with Shareholders
E1
Dialogue with Shareholders
The Chairman ensures that all Directors are made aware 
of major shareholder issues and concerns, by way of 
reports from the Executive Directors at Board meetings, 
attendance at key financial calendar events and by 
making themselves available to meet shareholders 
as required. 
The Company attaches significant importance to 
maintaining an effective engagement with shareholders 
to ensure a mutual understanding of objectives and 
to deal with issues of concern. Responsibility for 
communications with shareholders rests with the 
Executive Directors, assisted by the Group Director, 
Investor Relations and Communications. The Company 
Secretary oversees communications with private 
individual shareholders. As noted on page 67, meetings 
with investors during the year were led by the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director. Investor roadshows, 
analyst presentations and webcasts were carried out 
during the year, as detailed on page 67.
An analysis of the shareholder register, by type of holder 
and by size of holding, can be found on page 152.

43 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance | Corporate governance statement Code Principle A – Leadership
Board objectives
The overarching remit of the Board is to demonstrate 
the highest standards of corporate governance in 
accordance with the Code and to carry out the 
Directors’ fiduciary duties:
 – To demonstrate strategic leadership and oversight;
 – To agree the strategy and to ensure the continuing 
evolution and implementation of the Group’s strategy 
to deliver value to all stakeholders: customers, 
employees and shareholders;
 – To develop challenging objectives for the business 
and monitor management performance against 
those goals;
 – To provide a framework of effective controls to assess 
and manage risks, with clear expectations of conduct 
to the highest standards of ethics;
 – To provide support and constructive challenges to 
the CEO and senior management to promote the 
Group’s success;
 – To demonstrate leadership in management systems 
around health, safety and environment; and
 – To manage succession planning for the Board 
and the Group’s executive management.
Matters reserved to the Board
The Board has a clearly articulated set of matters 
which are specifically reserved to it for consideration, 
in addition to those specified in the Company’s 
Articles of Association.
These include (but are not limited to):
 – Reviewing and approving the annual budgets;
 – Raising indebtedness;
 – Granting security over Group assets;
 – Approving Group strategy and the corporate plan;
 – Approving the Annual and Half-Year Report and 
Accounts;
 – Approving significant investment, bid, acquisition 
and divestment transactions;
 – Approving HR policies (including pension 
arrangements);
 – Reviewing material litigation; and
 – Monitoring the overall system of internal control, 
including risk management.
Operation of the Board
The Board has an annual calendar of meetings and 
operates through a comprehensive set of processes 
which define the schedule of matters to be considered 
by the Board and its Committees during the annual 
business cycle. This includes the level of delegated 
authorities (both financial and non-financial) available 
to Executive Directors and other layers of management 
in the business, QinetiQ’s business ethics, risk 
management, and health, safety and environmental 
processes. The Board devotes one entire meeting each 
year to consider strategy and planning issues that have 
an impact on the Group, from which the corporate plan 
is generated. It is also regularly kept up to date on 
strategic issues throughout the year. 
For each meeting, as standing items, the Board receives 
a written report from the CEO and CFO and a report 
produced by the Company Secretary on key legal and 
regulatory issues that affect the Group.
The CEO’s and CFO’s report contains a financial 
overview, addresses the key actions taken in pursuit 
of strategic initiatives which have had an impact on the 
Group since the previous Board meeting, with particular 
focus on the progress of each of the businesses, 
a report on investor relations which is prepared in 
consultation with QinetiQ’s brokers and a report 
on employee matters.
During the year under review, in response to comments 
arising from the annual Board effectiveness review 
(as detailed on page 50), the format of the CEO’s and 
CFO’s report was adjusted to lay greater emphasis on 
the growth strategy of the Company, to give more detail 
on customer engagement and to give details of progress 
with strategic goals. Other matters which might be 
included in the report as and when required include 
health, safety and environmental matters, corporate 
responsibility, the status of key account management/
customer relationship initiatives, the pipeline of potential 
bids, acquisitions, disposals and investments, and 
the post-acquisition performance of recently 
acquired businesses. 
The Board also receives updates from key functional 
areas on a structured basis, on issues such as human 
resources, treasury, corporate responsibility, real estate, 
security, trade controls and pensions.
During the year under review, members of the senior 
management team presented to the Board and its 
Committees on specific areas, including research 
and development activity, recruitment and retention, 
reputational risk, corporate responsibility, cyber risk and 
strategy. Non-executive Directors have attended each 
of the quarterly extended leadership meetings run by 
the Executive Committee and which are attended by 
approximately 100 senior leaders within the Group. 
The meetings take place over a two-day period, include 
updates on key business developments and provide 
networking and development opportunities for the 
wider leadership community.
Board and Committee meetings are generally spread 
over a two-day period, to allow sufficient time for the 
Board to deal with the various items of business. The 
Chairman meets with the Non-executive Directors, 
without executives present, after each Board meeting.
The Board also meets informally, to facilitate Board 
integration and working together as a team, and to allow 
time for the Directors to consider other matters outside 
of the formal agenda.

44 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Key issues considered by the Board in the past year
During the year under review, the Board continued to focus 
on its drivers for growth – implementation of strategy, 
oversight of progress with the Group transformation 
programme and organisational design, business 
development initiatives and financial performance. 
 1 
Group strategy 
and transformation 
programme 
 
The Board has had full oversight of the progress of the 
Group strategy and transformation programme during 
the year. Of the seven Board meetings held during the 
year, Group strategy was presented at five of them, the 
other two Board meetings having a particular focus 
on the financial results. At three of the meetings, the 
Group Director, Strategy and Planning, gave an update 
on key aspects of the Group strategy, on mergers 
and acquisitions, on progress against strategic goals, 
on market conditions and on particular areas of 
strategic focus. At these meetings the Board had 
the opportunity to question and challenge the 
work being undertaken.
The October Board Strategy meeting was a two-day 
meeting held at an off-site location where the strategy 
for the Group as a whole was reviewed by the Board. 
Reading materials were circulated in advance of the 
meeting, setting the strategic market context and 
including updates on strategic initiatives, the strategy
for each business area (Air and Space, Maritime 
Land and Weapons, Cyber Information and Training, 
International, OptaSense, QinetiQ North America and 
Business Development), and updates on the Group’s 
financial performance and trajectory, and on the 
ongoing internal business transformation programme 
in respect of process excellence, competitiveness, and 
working environment. At the outset, the CEO set out 
the objectives for the meeting and the Board advised 
on the details they wished to understand from the 
discussions. In the concluding remarks, it was noted 
that the matters raised by the Board had been 
addressed and the conclusions noted.
Business leaders attended the two-day meeting 
and presented on key subject areas where required. 
There was also time allocated during the two-day 
period to enable the Board and the senior managers 
to meet informally.
At the March Board meeting, the Group Director, 
Strategy and Planning, presented the Integrated 
Strategic Business Plan for the coming financial year, 
the plan being the culmination of feedback from the 
October strategy meeting, progress against existing 
strategic objectives and targets for the coming year.
In 2016, the Company initiated a two-year 
transformation programme, designed to deliver 
growth through improved customer focus and greater 
operational efficiency. As part of this programme, a 
new operating model based on collaboration, improved 
efficiency and new ways of working across the 
Company was rolled out. An organisational design 
programme in the Company’s employee structure was 
completed during the year under review to support the 
delivery of this operating model. The Board was kept 
up to date on progress against objectives and was 
able to challenge developments by way of regular 
reports from the Group Director, Transformation and 
by way of updates in the CEO’s and CFO’s report. At 
the October Board Strategy meeting, a specific report 
on the transformation programme was presented by 
the Group Director, Transformation, and the impact 
of the organisational design programme was referred 
to in a wider report by the CEO and Group Director, 
Human Resources in respect of HR strategy, talent 
management and succession planning. 
The progress of the Integrated Strategic Business Plan 
and transformation programme will continue to be on 
the Board agenda for review and measurement over 
the coming year. Details of the Group strategy can be 
found in the Strategic report on pages 14 to 17.

Business development –  
contract amendment  
to the Long Term  
Partnering Agreement 
In December 2016, QinetiQ announced a 
£1bn contract amendment to the Long Term 
Partnering Agreement with the UK Ministry of Defence, 
under which Test and Evaluation (‘T&E’) services have 
been delivered since 2003. Under the amendment, 
QinetiQ will modernise and operate the air ranges at 
MOD Aberporth and MOD Hebrides, and test aircrew 
training through the Empire Test Pilots’ School at MOD 
Boscombe Down. The Board of Directors considered 
the proposal at a Board meeting in July and approved 
it for initial presentation to the customer. An update on 
progress was provided in the CEO’s and CFO’s report 
at the September meeting and a formal presentation 
was made by the Group Director, Test & Evaluation at 
the Board Strategy meeting in October on the priorities 
related to the Company’s T&E strategy, approach, 
progress to date, targets and next steps. The contract 
amendment was finally agreed and announced 
in December 2016. At the January Board meeting 
the Group Director, Business Development and 
the Group Director, Test & Evaluation presented 
an update on how work under the new arrangement 
was progressing and provided an update on progress 
against the objectives relating to T&E. Throughout 
the process the Board was kept up to date on 
developments and had the opportunity to 
challenge management where appropriate.

Financial  
reporting 
 
 
Financial reporting is an ongoing area of Board 
governance, which is carried out in three principal 
ways: (i) by way of a standing report at each Board 
meeting from the CEO and CFO; (ii) by way of review 
of the full year and half-year results; and (iii) by way 
of an update at the annual Board Strategy meeting. 
As noted above, the CEO’s and CFO’s report tabled at 
each Board meeting contains a Group financial report. 
This report contains an overview, split by month and 
full year summary, and sets out details of Group 
financial performance to date, the latest forecast, 
and performance by sector. 
In conjunction with the Audit Committee, the Board 
reviews the results at the half-year and the full year, 
in November and May respectively. At the May Board 
meeting, the draft annual report and financial results 
announcement were considered. The Company’s 
brokers attended relevant parts of the meeting. The 
Board received a report from the CFO and considered 
the recommendation from the Audit Committee in 
respect of the work undertaken to satisfy the ‘fair, 
balanced and understandable’ requirement and the 
longer-term viability assessment. The Board received 
a summary of the principal controls put in place by the 
executive to ensure the integrity of the audit process, 
including the provision of information to the auditor, 
the self-certification process and internal management 
representations, and a going concern review. A paper 
was also tabled to discuss dividend considerations.
At the November Board meeting, the half-year 
announcement and draft results presentation were 
presented by the CEO and CFO to the Board for 
their consideration, together with a paper to discuss 
dividend considerations. The Company’s auditor 
and brokers attended relevant parts of the meeting.
In terms of dividend considerations, at both the full 
year and the half-year, the CFO tables a dividend paper 
which contains a recommendation as to whether 
to retain the current dividend policy and to propose 
consideration of a dividend payment based on that 
policy. The current dividend policy was reinstated in 
May 2011, when the Group recommenced payment 
of a dividend on the basis of “a progressive dividend 
policy which will take into account the profitability of 
QinetiQ’s businesses and underlying growth, as well 
as its capital requirements and cash flows, while 
maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover. The 
final dividend will normally represent approximately 
two-thirds of the full year dividend in future periods.” 
The dividend paper presented to the Board covers 
these various aspects and also looks at sustainability 
and market expectations.
At the annual Board Strategy meeting, the CFO  
gave a presentation on the financial performance 
trajectory, looking at Group performance against key 
financial parameters across a range of scenarios.

Committees
During the year, QinetiQ operated by way of five principal 
Board Committees and the Executive Committee. 
In the interests of full Board participation and 
transparency, the Board maintains a policy of all 
of the Directors being members of all of the Board 
Committees, with the exception of the Disclosure 
Committee (as noted below) and other than where 
prohibited by the Code, statutory or Security Committee 
requirements. As a result, all Board members are 
members of the Risk & CSR Committee, which 
facilitates full consideration of the oversight of internal 
controls and non-financial risk management, with all of 
the Non-executive Directors being the members of the 
Audit Committee and focusing on financial controls and 
financial risk management. Details of the key issues 
discussed, and decisions taken, are circulated to 
all members of the Board after the relevant 
Committee meeting.

The Board has established five principal Committees: 
the Audit Committee, the Nominations Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee, the Risk & CSR Committee 
and the Security Committee, together with a Disclosure 
Committee. Each operates within written terms of 
reference approved by the Board. 
The Disclosure Committee was established during the 
year under review to ensure compliance with the Market 
Abuse Regulation. The Disclosure Committee comprises 
the Chairman, the CEO, the CFO and any one of the 
Non-executive Directors that chair the Audit Committee, 
Remuneration Committee or Risk & CSR Committee. 
The role of the Committee is, on an ad hoc basis, to 
determine whether information is inside information 
which would require disclosure, and to make 
recommendations as to when that information 
should be disclosed, in accordance with regulatory 
requirements. In addition, a meeting of the Disclosure 
Committee is held after each Board meeting, with all 
Board members in attendance, which reviews the work 
of the executive-level Disclosure Panel that has taken 
place since the previous Board meeting.
The full terms of reference of each Committee can be 
found in the Governance section of the QinetiQ website 
at www.QinetiQ.com/about-us/corporate-governance.
A report in respect of each of the five principal 
Committees is set out in this report on the pages noted 
in the index on page 39. The details of attendance at 
Committee meetings are set out in the table on the 
previous page.
The relevant Code disclosures in respect of the 
Remuneration Committee are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 68 to 91 and are 
incorporated into this Corporate governance 
statement by reference.

During the year under review, the Committee met on 
a two-weekly basis, and reported via the Chief Executive 
Officer to the Board. Its focus continued to be on the 
achievement of the Group’s strategic goals in respect 
of growth and operational excellence, with an ongoing 
consideration of governance issues. The Executive 
Committee received, discussed and acted upon subject 
presentations on health, safety and environment, risks 
and opportunities, trade controls, business ethics, 
security and General Compliance matters. It was 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the 
Group’s activities, with the exception of QinetiQ North 
America (which is managed through the Proxy Board, 
as described on page 57 in the section headed 
‘Management and control of US subsidiaries’) and 
the oversight of the risk management process and 
its implementation by the businesses and functions. 
The Group uses a number of different committees to 
monitor and drive operational excellence and to ensure 
appropriate actions are taken to deliver the strategy. 
These committees are split between strategic and 
operational focus.
In addition, the Executive Committee has set up 
a number of sub-committees to drive integration, 
alignment and monitoring of policies and processes 
across the Group, to ensure functional excellence 
and best practice. Each sub-committee is led by a 
member of the Executive Committee and comprises 
representatives from relevant businesses and functions.
Communication between the Board and the 
Executive Committee
The Executive Directors and Company Secretary are 
members of the Executive Committee and are involved 
in the day-to-day management of the Group’s business, 
operations and underlying committees. Other Executive 
Committee members and members of the senior 
management team present to the Board and the Board 
Committees on key matters. This interaction enables

Company and its operations and to give guidance 
on strategy and oversight of the business direct to 
senior management.

Board performance evaluation
As noted on page 42, an evaluation of the performance 
of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors, is 
carried out annually, with an external, independent, review 
in each third year. An external review took place in 2016, 
with the 2017 review being carried out internally by way 
of a questionnaire completed by Board members.
Set out below are details of, and progress against, the 
key findings of the 2016 review. Set out on the next 
page are details of the 2017 evaluation process, its 
key findings and the priorities for the coming year.

The Board requested a review of its 
annual agenda, in order to ensure 
focus on issues of strategy while 
maintaining the requisite reporting 
rigour on operational and governance 
activity, and fulfilling the Company’s 
governance responsibilities.
The schedule of Board agenda items for the year was reviewed 
during the year. In addition to Standing and Governance items, the 
Board would also follow a timetable of deep dive subject reviews, 
and Executive Committee members would be attending Board 
meetings to present on these.
Further, the format of the CEO and CFO report to the Board was 
updated during the year to provide more detail on customer 
engagement and on progress against strategic goals and the 
growth strategy, as noted on page 44.
2
The Board requested greater oversight 
of HR policy and the development of 
a more in-depth understanding of 
the management of employee 
engagement, performance 
management, diversity and 
succession planning.
At the September Board meeting, the Group Director, HR presented 
a report on HR processes, with particular emphasis on the 
challenges presented by the organisational design aspect of the 
ongoing transformation programme, the matrix structure, details 
of the leadership development programme and activity with regard 
to gender pay legislation. An HR review process was put in place 
and its progress would be monitored.

Reviewing Executive Committee 
succession planning.
As noted on page 45, at the October Board strategy meeting, the 
CEO and Group Director, Human Resources gave a presentation 
on HR strategy, talent management and succession planning.
4
Reviewing the Board’s composition 
and skills.
The format of the Board skills matrix was reviewed, revised and 
updated during the year, following a review by the members of the 
Board in conjunction with the Company’s recruitment advisors.
5
Reviewing risk management and 
reporting processes.
The Board reviewed and approved a revised and updated Group 
Risk Register at its September meeting, and will consider its 
effectiveness during the financial year ended 31 March 2018. 
Further details can be found in the report of the Risk & CSR 
Committee on page 66.

growth would be discussed at each Board meeting. In addition, as 
noted on page 44, Non-executive Directors have attended each of 
the quarterly extended leadership meetings run by the Executive 
Committee and which are attended by approximately 100 senior 
leaders within the Group.
The 2017 review 
being carried out 
internally by way 
of a questionnaire 
completed by 
Board members.
50 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2017 Review process 
The review in respect of the 2017 financial year took 
place in the final quarter of the year and consisted of a 
series of externally-provided questionnaires in respect 
of each of the Board and its Committees and the 
Chairman, which were completed by each Director 
and the Company Secretary. In order to obtain a 
complete overview of the workings of the Board and 
its Committees, the Committee questionnaires covered 
time management and composition, Committee 
processes and support, the work of the Committee and 
priorities for change. The Board questionnaire covered 
composition, expertise, dynamics, management of 
meetings, support, Board Committees, focus of 
meetings, strategic oversight, risk management and 
internal control, succession planning and human 
resource management, and priorities for change.
Respondents were encouraged to include illustrative 
comments with their feedback.
Key findings
The results of the review were presented by the 
Chairman at the Board’s March meeting. The overall 
conclusion of the 2017 review was that the Board 
was satisfied that the performance of the Board had 
improved and it continued to be effective in executing 
its duties.
The Board composition, expertise, interaction 
with management, oversight of strategy, risk and 
succession planning were all highly rated, with an area 
for improvement identified as better management 
reporting (in terms of length of reports and the use 
of executive summaries).
Succession planning for the members of the Board was 
identified as a top priority, with the possible addition of 
greater international experience to align with QinetiQ’s 
strategic goals. The level of interaction between the 
Board and senior management in Board meetings, 
in the business and in informal/social settings was 
highly valued.
The management of the Board’s annual cycle of work, 
the agenda for Board meetings, the time and input 
during the meetings, and the quality and frequency 
of presentations made by management to the Board 
were positively rated. Further work was required to 
standardise the format and length of management 
reports and the inclusion of executive summaries. 
The importance of the Board monitoring progress 
made against the strategy was noted and the Board’s 
oversight of various aspects of risk management and 
internal control was rated highly, as was the oversight 
of the company’s health and safety performance. 
Priorities for the coming year
The Board’s priorities for the coming year were 
identified as:
i)  succession planning and longer-term Board 
composition to support implementation of 
strategic goals;
 ii)  a continued focus on strategy, and its 
implementation
iii)  monitoring the effectiveness of the executive 
management team
iv)  ensuring effective emphasis on governance matters;
v)  defining, developing and monitoring cultural 
development and change; and
vi)  continuing with the implementation of the proposals 
from the 2016 review.
Details of the outcomes of the effectiveness reviews for 
the following committees can be found in the individual 
Committee reports, as follows: Audit Committee – 
page 62, Risk & CSR Committee – page 66, and 
Remuneration Committee – page 82.
The overall conclusion 
of the 2017 review was 
that the Board was 
satisfied that the 
performance of the 
Board had improved 
and it continued to be 
effective in executing 
its duties.

Report of the Nominations Committee.
Mark Elliott
Nominations Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder,
During the year under review, the Nominations 
Committee focused on succession planning and 
a review of the balance of skills, background and 
experience of the Board. The Committee oversaw the 
appointment of David Smith as the new CFO, following 
the resignation of David Mellors. Board diversity and 
succession planning will remain key priorities for 
the coming year.
Mark Elliott
Nominations Committee Chairman
Main responsibilities
The role of the Committee is to ensure that the 
composition of the Board and Committees comprises the 
optimum balance of skills, knowledge and experience, and 
to oversee succession planning for the Board and senior 
management. It considers diversity, including skills mix, 
international industry experience and gender, when 
seeking to appoint a new Director to the Board. The 
Committee’s full terms of reference can be found in 
the Governance section of the QinetiQ website at 
www.QinetiQ.com/about-us/corporate-governance.
The Committee meets as necessary and when called by 
its Chair. During the financial year ended 31 March 2017, 
the Committee met on six occasions.
Overview
Key activities during the year were as follows:
a) Change of Chief Financial Officer;
b) Succession and development planning for senior 
management immediately below Board level, i.e. 
at Executive Committee level; and
c) Board succession planning, and in particular 
settling upon the skills required in current and 
future Non-executive Directors to support the 
Company’s strategic intent, and corporate 
governance requirements.
(a) Change of Chief Financial Officer
A sub-committee comprising the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and CEO was set up in June 2016 to 
deal with the change in CFO. The CEO, in conjunction with 
the Group Director, HR, prepared a role specification and 
conducted a review of potential recruitment consultants. 
Three potential search partners were shortlisted and, in 
July, the CEO reported to the Committee that Russell 
Reynolds had been appointed, due to their in-depth 
knowledge and experience of CFO recruitment. Russell 
Reynolds had no other connections with the Company. 
The Committee agreed at its meeting in July that the CEO 
would work with Russell Reynolds to produce a final 
shortlist of candidates for review at the Committee’s 
September meeting. A shortlist of four potential 
candidates was put forward and a preferred candidate 
identified. The preferred candidate met with the CEO, 
the Audit Committee Chair and the Chairman. At its 
September meeting, the Committee considered the 
appointment and made a recommendation to the Board 
of the proposed appointment, which was then approved. 
(b) Succession and development planning for senior 
management immediately below Board level, i.e. at 
Executive Committee level
The Committee continues to maintain oversight of 
the processes for ensuring that succession plans are in 
place for the top layer of management, with a focus on 
improving the talent pipeline and diversity. This process 
includes ensuring that the Board as a whole meets 
with senior management, that remuneration policy 
and long-term incentives for senior management are 
reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and that 
the Chairman works with the CEO to review succession 
planning and to ensure the right mix of skills and 
experience at the executive level. During the year 
Key points:
 – Six meetings during the year
 – Change of CFO
 – Succession and development 
planning.
52 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 under review, the Committee and the Board were 
updated by the CEO and the Group Director, HR, on HR 
strategy, including details of leadership skills required, 
leadership and career development activity, and 
succession planning for the Executive Committee and 
senior management. The strengths of, and development 
opportunities for, Executive Committee members 
were considered and agreed.
(c) Succession planning at Non-executive Director level
As noted on page 50, an action arising from the Board’s 
2016 annual effectiveness review was to review the 
Board’s composition and skills to ensure the right 
balance of skills and experience as the Company 
evolves in pursuit of its strategic objectives. The 
Chairman and the CEO began this process and a skills 
matrix was formulated for consideration by all members 
of the Board. At the Committee’s January meeting, the 
form of the matrix was agreed and circulated to the 
Board for completion, in readiness for the Committee’s 
March meeting. The matrix was split between three key 
areas, (i) personal qualities, including a range of skills 
and behaviours; (ii) foundation skills, including business 
experience, mergers and acquisitions, financial and 
governance; and (iii) markets experience, including 
government, defence, security and other commercial 
areas. Each of the three areas was given a weighting 
and a rating as to current and future requirements, 
with an opportunity to add comments.
The outcome from the skills matrix was considered at 
the Committee’s meeting in March 2017. In particular, 
it was noted that personal qualities remained very 
important, with strategic thinking of particular 
importance, and that business experience would 
become more important in the future, in terms of 
business development. The outcome of the review 
will be instrumental in the process for identifying 
future Non-executive Director appointments.
At its meeting in March 2017, the appointment and 
retirement dates of Non-executive Directors were 
considered, so that an appropriate calendar of activity 
can be prepared for timely succession planning. 
These dates are detailed below.

Board Diversity Policy
The Board Diversity Policy was approved by the Board in 2013. 
The key statement and objectives of that policy (the full text of 
which is available on the QinetiQ website www.QinetiQ.com/
about-us/corporate-governance) are as follows:
Statement:
The QinetiQ Board recognises the benefits of diversity. Diversity 
of skills, background, knowledge, international and industry 
experience, and gender, amongst many other factors, will be 
taken into consideration when seeking to appoint a new Director 
to the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Board 
appointments will always be made on merit.
Objectives:
The Board should ensure an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience to ensure an optimum Board and efficient 
stewardship. The Board should ensure that it comprises 
Directors who are sufficiently experienced and independent 
in character and judgement.
The Board aimed to increase the proportion of women on the 
Board to 25% by 2015. Thereafter, the Board aimed to maintain 
a minimum Board composition of 25% women, such percentage 
to be reviewed annually.
Progress against the policy: 
Having previously met the 2015 target of 25% of the Board 
comprising women, changes since then led to a reduction in this 
proportion. Following the appointment of Lynn Brubaker in January 
2016, the proportion of women members of the Board increased to 
22%, which is working towards the Board’s original objective of 25%. 
The Committee notes the recommendation in the five-year review 
of the Davies report to achieve a minimum representation of 33% 
by 2020.
Gender and ethnic diversity will be taken into consideration 
for all future Board appointments, with the proviso that future 
appointments will be made on merit, and will continue to take into 
account diversity in its broader sense, to ensure an appropriate mix 
of skills, background and experience as identified from the Board 
skills review.
Details of Company-wide diversity and inclusion activity can 
be found in the People and relationships section on page 31.
53 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance | Corporate governance statement Code Principle C – Accountability
Board oversight of risk management
The Board oversees the system of risk management and 
internal control by means of the Audit Committee and 
the Risk & CSR Committee in conjunction with the risk 
management and assurance processes detailed in this 
section. Any matters of particular concern are escalated 
for presentation at a Board meeting by the relevant 
personnel. Examples of such escalation are 
consideration of the risk register, expression of risk 
and risk reporting. The Board routinely challenges 
management to ensure that the systems of internal 
control are constantly improving, to maintain their 
effectiveness. Once a year, the CEO presents to the 
Board on the system of internal control in operation 
during the year.
At its meeting in March 2017, the Board reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal control that was 
in operation during the financial year ended 31 March 
2017. Details of specific risk review activity undertaken 
during the year by the Executive Committee, the Audit 
Committee and the Risk & CSR Committee, together 
with the current risk registers, were presented by 
the CEO. 
The following activity was noted at that review:
Executive risk review
 – Risk owners had reviewed and updated their 
risks prior to review by the Executive Committee.
 – Executive Committee formal risk reviews had been 
undertaken at four meetings during the year.
Board Committee risk review
 – The Audit Committee had undertaken a detailed 
review of the financial risk register at two meetings 
during the year.
 – The Risk & CSR Committee had reviewed the non-
financial risk register at four meetings during the year.
 – The Risk & CSR Committee had undertaken deep 
dive reviews into specific risks through the year.
Update to risk reporting format
 – A revised risk reporting format had been prepared 
and reviewed by the Audit Committee, Risk & CSR 
Committee and Executive Committee. Following 
various revisions, it had been approved and 
implemented during the year under review. Details of 
the work of the Risk & CSR Committee in respect of 
the review of risk management and its reporting can 
be found in the report of the Risk & CSR Committee 
on page 66.
As a result of the presentation to the Board, the Board 
considered that the risk review activity that had taken 
place during the year was effective.
Committee oversight of risk management
The risk management process and the system of 
internal control necessary to manage risks are managed 
by the Audit Committee (financial risks) and the Risk 
& CSR Committee (non-financial risks). The full Board 
attends these Committee meetings, either as a 
Committee member or as a guest so as to receive at 
first-hand the findings of the Committee. Details of the 
Committee memberships are set out on page 46. The 
internal audit function independently reviews the risk 
identification and control processes implemented by 
management, and reports to the respective Committee.
The Audit Committee and the Risk & CSR Committee also 
review the assurance process, ensuring that an appropriate 
mix of techniques is used to obtain the level of assurance 
required by the Board. The reports of both Committees 
can be found on pages 59 and 64 respectively.
Risk reporting is embedded in the management of the 
business through the Executive Committee and monthly 
Business Performance Reviews and feeds into Group 
strategy at the executive and Board level. 
Internal audit function
The internal audit function, which is independent of the 
business and has a direct reporting line to the Audit 
Committee, provides assurance to the Board and its 
Committees over the effectiveness of the internal 
control environment. The programme of work 
undertaken by the internal audit function is approved 
in advance by the Audit Committee. It is prioritised 
according to risk, including those risks identified by 
the Group through its risk management processes. 
Additionally, regular discussions are held between the 
internal audit function and the external auditor regarding 
internal audit reports, risks, internal audit plans and the 
wider control environment.
Board statements relating to risk management
Board statements relating to the ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment’, principal risks, the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control process, and going concern statement, 
can be found on page 58. The longer-term viability 
assessment can be found in the Strategic report 
on page 22.
Risk management and assurance activity 
– Three lines of defence model
Risk management and assurance activity conforms 
to the three lines of defence model as detailed on 
page 55. The first line of defence is performed by the 
businesses, through managing activities in accordance 
with established operating principles; the second line 
of defence is performed by the oversight functions, 
including the safety and governance team; and the third 
line of defence is performed by the internal audit team, 
reporting to the Executive Committee, to the Board’s 
Audit Committee in respect of financial risks, and to 
the Board’s Risk & CSR Committee in respect of 
non-financial risks. 
The Board 
routinely challenges 
management to ensure 
that the systems of 
internal control are 
constantly improving 
to maintain their 
effectiveness.

financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated 
accounts can be found on page 56, and details of risk 
management and assurance activity in respect of US 
subsidiaries within the requirements of the US National 
Industry Security Program can be found on page 57.
Review of significant risks
The Board, the Audit Committee and the Risk & CSR 
Committee regularly review significant risks to the 
business. Significant risks are risks, both financial and 
non-financial, which are related to the achievement of 
business objectives. They are identified, evaluated and 
mitigated by QinetiQ’s managers and are assessed 
on a continual basis. They may be associated with 
a variety of internal and external events, including 
control breakdowns, competition, disruption, regulatory 
requirements, and natural and other catastrophes. 
Managers are responsible for the implementation of 
suitable internal controls to ensure effective mitigation.

Internal control system
QinetiQ’s businesses are responsible for ensuring 
that a robust risk and control environment is in place 
as part of their day-to-day operations. Management 
in the business oversee this process and a clear set of 
delegated authorities is in place, covering financial and 
non-financial activities, and is consistent with effective 
operational control and risk management and the 
Board’s risk appetite. Key business policies, procedures 
and codes of practice, together with the Company’s 
Code of Conduct, are available on the Company’s 
intranet and apply to every employee within the QinetiQ 
Group, including all subsidiaries, with the exception of 
Foster-Miller, Inc., due to the proxy arrangement as 
detailed on page 57. Foster-Miller, Inc. is, however, 
an active and supportive participant in this overall 
framework and their President is a member of 
the Executive Committee.

Risk assurance activity during the year
Risk assurance activity was ongoing during the year 
under review. The following areas were covered by the 
Executive Committee and then key issues reported 
four times a year to the Risk & CSR Committee:
 – Updates in respect of general risk governance 
from the Group Director, Safety and Governance.
 – Reviews of business risk registers and moderation 
to form the Group Risk Register.
 – Quarterly reports from the internal audit function in 
respect of the effective management of Group risks 
and the risk management process.
 – Review of the risk identification process.
 – The output from the self-certification process and 
a review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
 – Regularly requiring risk owners to report their 
activity to the Risk & CSR Committee.
Self-certification process
An annual process of hierarchical self-certification on 
the effectiveness of internal controls, which provides 
a documented and auditable trail of accountability for 
the operation of the system of internal control, is in 
operation. This process is informed by a rigorous and 
structured self-assessment that addresses compliance 
with Group policy. It provides for successive assurances 
to be given at increasingly higher levels of management 
and, finally, to the Board. The self-certification process 
is carried out at the full year and the half-year.
Risk management and internal control:
 
Financial reporting process
The following elements provide assurance in respect 
of the financial reporting process and preparation 
of consolidated accounts:
 – The financial management and control framework;
 – The Company’s finance function;
 – The internal control and risk management systems;
 – The internal audit function;
 – The external audit function; and
 – Oversight by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The Company operates a financial management and 
control framework, comprising a system of targets, 
reporting (external and internal) and controls, that is 
embedded throughout the businesses and on which 
progress is reported to the Audit Committee and to 
the Board. The finance function consists of different 
financial reporting teams who report to the CFO. The 
Group Finance team comprises suitably qualified and 
experienced professionals, including accountants. It is 
responsible for the preparation of the half-year and 
annual reports and for internal financial reporting 
to senior management and the Board. To ensure a 
consistency of approach and accuracy in financial 
reporting, the team provides advice on accounting 
and financial reporting issues to QinetiQ’s businesses 
and sets the Group’s accounting policies which are 
contained in the Finance Accounting Manual. The 
team liaises with the external auditor.
The internal control and risk management systems 
described on pages 54 to 57 apply to the Company’s 
process of financial reporting and the preparation of 
consolidated accounts. The internal audit and external 
audit functions, and the reviews by the Audit Committee 
and the Board, provide a structured approach to the 
review and challenge of financial information and 
financial reporting. The report of the Audit Committee 
can be found on page 59 and the work of the Board 
in respect of financial oversight can be found on 
pages 45 and 54.
Employee reporting and guidance:
Confidential reporting process
QinetiQ has in place a confidential reporting process 
which is detailed on the Company’s intranet. If an 
individual does not feel that they can resolve any 
concerns with the Company directly, either through 
discussions with their line manager or directly with the 
Company Secretary or Group Internal Audit Manager, 
they can use an externally provided confidential internet 
and telephone reporting system, as noted in the People 
and relationships section on page 31. All concerns are 
passed by the external third party to the Group Internal 
Audit Manager who will ensure that they are held in 
strict confidence and are properly investigated. Reports 
on confidential reporting activity and the outcome 
of investigations are regularly reported to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness of the Group’s confidential reporting 
process during the year, as noted on page 60.
Anti-bribery and the prevention of corruption
QinetiQ has internal procedures in place that are 
designed to ensure compliance with the UK Bribery 
Act 2010, and other international regulations and 
best practice relating to the prevention of corruption, 
which are applicable to its business.
Ethics
The Company provides employees with guidance to 
assist them in making informed ethical decisions on 
a day-to-day basis, including the Company’s Code 
of Conduct, mandatory annual ethics training for all 
employees and the Company’s Directors, and links 
to the country risk table and review panel processes 
for doing business in high risk countries. Further details 
can be found in the People and relationships section 
on page 31.
Risk reporting is 
embedded in the 
management of the 
business through the 
Executive Committee 
and monthly Business 
Performance Reviews 
and feeds into Group 
strategy at the 
executive and 
Board level.
56 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Management and control of US subsidiaries
The US Global Products division, trading as QinetiQ 
North America, which contributed approximately £70m 
to the Group’s revenue in 2017, operates under a Proxy 
arrangement, as detailed below, with the remainder of 
the US business operating outside the Proxy regime and 
therefore following the same reporting lines and processes 
as the Group’s other, non-regulated businesses.
US Global Products division and the Proxy arrangement
The US Global Products division, trading as QinetiQ 
North America, is managed via Foster-Miller, Inc. (FMI), 
a wholly-owned subsidiary of QinetiQ in the US. It has 
been placed under a Proxy arrangement as it is required 
by the US National Industrial Security Program to 
maintain facility security clearances and to be insulated 
from foreign ownership, control or influence. Under 
the Proxy arrangement, FMI and the US Department 
of Defense (DoD) are parties to a Proxy agreement 
that regulates the management and operation of 
FMI. Pursuant to this Proxy agreement, QinetiQ has 
appointed four US citizens who hold the requisite US 
security clearances as Proxy holders to exercise the 
voting rights in FMI.
The current Proxy holders comprise David Carey, John 
Currier, Tom Mills and Scott Webster and have all been 
in office during the year under review. The Proxy holders 
are also Directors of FMI, with David Carey as Chairman. 
In addition to their powers as Directors, the Proxy 
holders have power under the Proxy arrangements 
to exercise all prerogatives of share ownership of FMI. 
The Proxy holders have a fiduciary duty, and agree, 
to perform their role in the best interests of QinetiQ as 
shareholder (including the legitimate economic interest), 
and in a manner consistent with the national security 
interests of the US. QinetiQ Group plc does not have any 
representation on the Board of FMI. QinetiQ Group plc 
may not remove the Proxy holders other than for acts 
of gross negligence or wilful misconduct or for breach 
of the Proxy agreement (and always only with the 
consent of the US Defense Security Service).
In terms of the power to govern, the Proxy agreement 
vests certain powers solely with the Proxy holders 
and certain powers solely with QinetiQ. For example, 
the Proxy holders cannot carry out any of the below 
without QinetiQ’s express approval:
 – sell or dispose of, in any manner, capital assets 
or the business of FMI;
 – pledge, mortgage or encumber assets of FMI for 
purposes other than obtaining working capital 
or funds for capital improvements;
 – merge, consolidate, reorganise or dissolve FMI; and
 – file or make any petition under the federal bankruptcy 
laws or similar law or statute of any state or any 
foreign country.
Unlike minority interest holders with protective veto 
rights, QinetiQ can unilaterally require the above to be 
carried out and these are, therefore, considered to be 
significant participative features. In addition, QinetiQ 
can require the payment of dividends, and the 
pay-down of parent company loans, from FMI.
The Company maintains its involvement in FMI’s 
activities through normal business activity and liaison 
with the Chair of the Proxy Board. QinetiQ’s CEO and/or 
CFO attended four meetings of the Proxy Board during 
the year under review. In addition, the March Board 
and Committee meetings were held at the FMI site in 
Waltham. Members of the local leadership team met 
with Board members and attended part of the Board 
meeting, and the Board went on a site visit and met 
local employees. 
The President of FMI is a member of the Executive 
Committee (as detailed on page 47). FMI commercial 
and governance activity is included in the business 
update provided in the regular executive report to the 
Board. This activity is subject always to the confines of 
the Proxy regime to ensure that it meets the requirement 
that FMI must conduct its business affairs without 
external control or influence, and the requirements 
necessary to protect the US national security interest.
It has been placed 
under a Proxy 
arrangement as it 
is required by the US 
National Industrial 
Security Program

Board statements relating to risk management.
Directors’ statement in respect of ‘fair, balanced 
and understandable’ assessment
All of the Directors consider that the Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. In this context, the 
coordination and review of the Group-wide input into the 
Annual Report is a vital part of the control process upon 
which the Directors rely and is an exercise which spans 
a period wider than the timetable for compiling the 
Annual Report itself. Critically these processes include 
the controls the business operates throughout the year 
to identify key financial and operational issues. Further 
details can be found in the report of the Audit 
Committee on page 61.
Board assessment of principal risks
The Board confirms that it has carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity. The way in 
which the Board understands and manages risk is set 
out on pages 54 to 66 and details of principal risks 
and their management and mitigation can be found on 
pages 22 to 25. Board level oversight is carried out by 
the Audit Committee and the Risk & CSR Committee. 
At its meeting in March 2017, the CEO presented 
details of the risk review activities that had taken 
place during the year.
Board review of the effectiveness of risk management 
and internal control processes
The Board confirms that it has conducted a review of 
the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems in operation during the 
year, as required by the Code. The Board considers that 
the risk review activities undertaken during the year 
under review, as presented by the CEO at the Board’s 
March meeting, amounted to an effective system being 
in place to ensure that all aspects of risk management 
and internal control had been considered for the year 
under review. Details of the Company’s principal risks 
and uncertainties and how they are managed and 
mitigated can be found in the Strategic Report on pages 
22 to 25. Details of the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems are set out in this 
Corporate governance statement on pages 54 to 66, 
and the reports of the Audit Committee and Risk & 
CSR Committee in respect of the oversight of 
risk management can be found on pages 59 
and 64 respectively.
Going concern
The Group’s activities, combined with the factors 
that are likely to affect its future development and 
performance, are set out on pages 2 to 37. The Chief 
Financial Officer’s review on pages 34 to 37 sets out 
details of the financial position of the Group, the cash 
flows, committed borrowing facilities, liquidity, and the 
Group’s policies and processes for managing its capital 
and financial risks. Note 26 on page 129 to the financial 
statements also provides details of the Group’s hedging 
activities, financial instruments, and its exposure to 
liquidity and credit risk.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through its available cash funds and 
its bank facilities. The market conditions in which the 
Group operates have been, and are expected to continue 
to be, challenging as spending from the Group’s key 
customers in its primary markets in the UK and US 
remains under pressure. Despite these challenges, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well positioned 
to manage its overall business risks successfully. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Group 
therefore continues to adopt the going-concern 
basis in preparing its financial statements.
The Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties, 
the principal ones being summarised in the ‘Principal 
risks and uncertainties’ section on pages 22 to 25. 
Crystallisation of such risks, to the extent not fully 
mitigated, would lead to a negative impact on the 
Group’s financial results but none are deemed 
sufficiently material to prevent the Group from 
continuing as a going concern for the next 12 months.
The Group continues 
to adopt the going-
concern basis 
in preparing its 
financial statements.
58 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Report of the Audit Committee
Paul Murray
Audit Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present the report of the Audit 
Committee on the work carried out during the last 
financial year. The Committee continues to operate 
on the basis of an open but challenging dialogue with 
management and with the internal and external auditors, 
and the application of an appropriate level of scrutiny. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee are set out in 
this report. In addition to reviewing the Group’s financial 
reporting processes and external audit effectiveness, two 
key areas that the Committee considered during the year 
were (i) a review of the process for risk management and 
reporting, in conjunction with the Risk & CSR Committee, 
in response to the outcome from last year’s review of 
the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. 
Further details are set out in the report of the Risk & CSR 
Committee on page 66 and the Committee reviewed the 
new process/format at its March 2017 meeting; and (ii) 
to initiate and oversee an audit tender process for the 
appointment of the external auditor, of which further details 
can be found in this report. After the successful conclusion 
of the tender, the Board approved the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the external auditor for 
the financial year ending 31 March 2018, to succeed KPMG 
LLP . I would like to thank all of the audit firms for their 
professionalism and work in the audit tender process, 
and also the team at KPMG who have worked closely 
with the Committee over many years.
As noted on page 51, an internal review of the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees was 
carried out during the year. The outcome of the review 
in respect of the Audit Committee is set out on page 62.
Paul Murray
Audit Committee Chairman
The Audit Committee is chaired by Paul Murray. 
The Board considers him to have recent and relevant 
financial experience. He was formerly Group Finance 
Director of Carlton Communications plc and LASMO plc, 
and he is currently Audit & Risk Committee Chairman 
at Royal Mail Group plc. The Board considers the 
members of the Committee to be independent. They 
bring extensive experience of corporate management 
in senior executive positions to the Company. Details 
of their background and experience can be found 
on pages 48 and 49. The CEO, CFO, Group Financial 
Controller, Group Internal Audit Manager and 
representatives of the external auditor normally 
attend Audit Committee meetings.
Main responsibilities
The Audit Committee monitors the Group’s integrity 
in financial reporting and reviews the effectiveness 
of the financial risk management framework. 
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found 
in the Governance section of the QinetiQ website at 
www.QinetiQ.com/about-us/ corporate-governance.
The Audit Committee meets as necessary and at 
least four times a year. During the financial year ended 
31 March 2017, the Committee met on six occasions.
The external auditor has the right to request that a meeting 
of the Audit Committee be convened. During the past 
financial year, and in accordance with its terms of 
reference, the Committee met with each of QinetiQ’s 
external auditor and the Group Internal Audit Manager 
on two separate occasions, without Executive Directors 
present, to discuss the audit process and assure itself 
regarding resourcing, auditor independence and objectivity.
Activities during the year
The Committee has an annual calendar of activities, in 
addition to which it identifies particular areas of focus 
during the year. During the course of its meetings, the 
Committee received presentations, reports and analyses 
from the CFO, the Group Financial Controller, the Group 
Internal Audit Manager and the external auditor.
The key activities during the year were as follows:
a) Internal controls (page 60);
b) Financial reporting: the significant issues considered 
by the Committee in relation to the preparation 
and reporting of the full and half-year financial 
statements, and how these issues were addressed 
(page assessment of the ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ requirement (page 61);
c) Audit Committee effectiveness review (page 62); 
and
d) External audit:
 – Effectiveness of external audit process 
(page 62);
 – External auditor independence and the provision 
of non-audit services (page 63);
 – Review of the effectiveness and the 
independence of the external auditor (page 63); 
and 
 – External audit tender and the appointment 
of auditor (page 63).
The Audit Committee 
monitors the Group’s 
integrity in financial 
reporting and reviews 
the effectiveness 
of the financial 
risk management 
framework.
59 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance | Corporate governance statement Other matters considered during the year:
The following matters are examples of items which the 
Committee considered during the year under review as 
part of its annual cycle:
 – External audit strategy for FY17: The external auditor 
presented a paper on their FY17 audit strategy. 
Significant risks to be reviewed included, among 
others, timing and recognition of revenue and profit, 
value of goodwill, tax treatments and accounting, 
and pensions accounting. 
 – Audit tender process: The Committee was kept 
informed on the work of the working group it had set 
up to carry out the audit tender process. A meeting 
of the Committee was held in January 2017 solely for 
the purpose of considering the final two candidates 
and for making a recommendation to the Board. 
Details of the audit tender process and its outcome 
can be found on page 63.
 – Group tax policy review: The CFO presented a 
paper to update the Committee on the Group’s tax 
priorities and issues. Various aspects of the Group’s 
R&D expenditure credit claims were discussed. The 
tax policy was considered to be cautious and the 
Company was up to date with its tax compliance.
 – Annual review of the Committee’s Terms of Reference 
and annual schedule of activities: No changes were 
made to the Terms of Reference. The annual schedule 
of activities was updated to reduce the number 
of meetings in May from two to one.
a) Internal controls:
During the year under review, the Committee monitored 
the effectiveness of the systems of internal control to 
gain assurance that an effective control framework was 
maintained. Reports on the effective operation of the 
control framework were received from management 
and reviewed by the Committee along with key policies 
and processes.
During the year under review, at four meetings, reports 
on the operation of internal controls and risk management 
processes, including the confidential reporting process, 
were received from the internal auditor.
Particular attention was given to the timely and effective 
implementation of remedial actions, either identified by 
the business directly, or by the internal audit function, 
with updates on improvement actions being scheduled 
for follow-up at a later meeting during the year. The 
internal audit function’s risk based strategic and annual 
plan was presented to, and scrutinised twice during the 
year by, the Committee, to provide assurance that 
resources were adequate and directed towards 
key risk areas. 
The annual plan is structured to ensure that all 
significant financial and non-financial risks are reviewed 
within a rolling three-year strategic plan. The audits 
include the review of financial systems, programmes 
and projects, as well as the management of specific 
risks identified through the Group’s risk management 
processes. During the year under review, the internal 
audit function audited constituent parts of the Group’s 
transformation programme, in line with a programme 
to support adherence to plans and achievement of 
outcomes. Other areas of focus during the year were 
anti-bribery and corruption processes and I.T. risk 
and control.
Internal audit activity in the year continued to indicate 
that, overall, an effective control environment was in 
place, with an open culture of continuous improvement 
being demonstrated by regular management requests 
for internal audits to be undertaken. 
The Committee also regularly reviews the effectiveness 
of the financial risk management framework, including 
reviewing key financial risks and assessing the 
effectiveness of management’s remedial action plans. 
During the year, the Committee undertook a detailed 
review of the financial risk register, noting (i) risks being 
actively managed through internal mitigation activity, 
including the timeframe for current mitigation to improve 
the risk position, (ii) risks managed at post-mitigation 
levels but heavily influenced by external factors and/or 
that require ongoing monitoring, and (iii) retired risks.
As noted on page 50, following on from the Board 
effectiveness review, the format for the Group Risk 
Register and for risk reporting was reviewed by the 
Board at its September and March meetings respectively. 
The Board approved a revised and updated Group Risk 
Register at its September meeting, and the effectiveness 
of the register will be considered during the financial 
year ended 31 March 2018. 
The process in respect of QinetiQ North America is 
adjusted to take into account the Proxy arrangements 
referred to on page 57. The executive management 
function has regular contact with the Chair of the Proxy 
Board and with US executive management, and the 
Group’s internal controls have been applied as far as 
possible within the requirements of the Proxy regime.
The internal audit function continues to work closely 
with US management to gain assurance that an 
effective control environment is in place. In addition, the 
Executive Directors attended meetings of the US Board 
during the year and further such meetings are planned.
The Committee confirms its view that it has received 
sufficient, reliable and timely information from 
management in the last financial year to enable 
it to fulfil its responsibilities.
Code Principle C – Accountability continued
Report of the Audit Committee continued
During the year under 
review, the Committee 
monitored the 
effectiveness of the 
systems of internal 
control to gain 
assurance that an 
effective control 
framework was 
maintained.
60 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 b) Financial Reporting – the significant issues 
considered by the Committee in relation to the 
preparation and reporting of the full and half 
year financial statements, and how these 
issues were addressed:
The Committee reviewed whether suitable accounting 
policies had been adopted, whether management had 
made the appropriate estimates and judgements, and 
sought support from the external auditor to assess 
them. To facilitate this process, the Committee received 
presentations from the CFO and the Group Financial 
Controller in respect of goodwill, accounting provisions 
for key contracts, litigation, trade controls and the 
treatment for taxation. It also received a report from 
the external auditor on the outcome of the audit.
The Committee reviewed the following main issues 
for the periods ended 30 September 2016 and 
31 March 2017:
 – the basis for, and judgements made by management 
in determining, the liabilities recorded for litigation, 
onerous contracts, potential claims and other disputes;
 – the carrying values of the Group’s cash generating 
units (CGUs), specifically goodwill associated with the 
US Global Products CGU which had been impaired 
in the prior year. The major assumptions impacting 
on the net present value of future expected cash 
flows were also discussed. Certain discount rate 
assumptions and market growth forecasts are 
advised by external consultants;
 – assumptions used to value the net pension 
asset of £156.0m (as advised by the Company’s 
external actuaries);
 – a quality of earnings analysis prepared 
by management;
 – the disclosures in the preliminary announcement 
and annual report and accounts, in particular those 
relating to non-recurring items (specifically, the £5.2m 
relating to the release of engine servicing obligations), 
risk, goodwill and tax;
 – the implications of delays to the BEPI-Colombo 
mission to Mercury programme; and
 – the process for making the longer-term viability 
statement and the assessment of different scenarios 
that could arise, to enable the Committee to make 
a recommendation to the Board at its May meeting. 
Further details can be found on page 22.
The reviews were carried out by way of papers 
presented by the CFO, the Group Financial Controller, 
the external auditor and the internal auditor, and 
through discussions with management. Based upon 
the business assurance process and discussions with 
management and the external auditor, the Committee 
was satisfied that the accounting disclosures and 
assumptions were reasonable and appropriate for 
a business of the Group’s size and complexity, that 
the external auditor had fulfilled its responsibilities 
in scrutinising the financial statements for any 
material misstatements and that the disclosures 
were satisfactory.
c) Assessment of the ‘fair, balanced and 
understandable’ requirement:
The Committee was required to provide advice to the 
Board to meet with the requirements of the Code on 
whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, provide a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s financial position and 
future prospects and provide all information necessary 
to a shareholder to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy. To enable it to do so, 
the CFO and members of management presented to 
the Committee details of the processes followed by 
management in preparing the accounts. In particular, 
the Committee noted:
 – the Group has developed a clear strategy, which has 
been presented to the Board for review during the year 
by business leaders, with updates on progress at each 
Board meeting;
 – monthly business reviews are undertaken by senior 
management which include monitoring business 
progress against budget;
 – business performance is monitored by the Board 
as detailed on page 44;
 – key individuals from appropriate business divisions 
and functions contribute to, or are involved in the 
verification of, the content of the Annual Report;
 – the Company has an Annual Report working group, 
comprising individuals from the Finance, Investor 
Relations, Assurance, HR, Group Strategy, Company 
Secretariat and Communications functions, which 
adheres to a timetable of actions for the production 
and review of the Annual Report;
 – the Annual Report working group is aware of the fair, 
balanced and understandable requirements and is 
tasked with ensuring that the Annual Report takes 
account of those requirements;
 – a checklist of considerations to ensure the 
requirements were met was completed by the 
working group and presented to the Committee in 
order to provide assurance to the Committee (and 
to the Board). The checklist includes areas such as 
ensuring what must be included to satisfy regulatory 
requirements, consulting with relevant experienced 
people to contribute and review each section, avoiding 
where possible the use of boiler-plate language and 
jargon, ensuring that all matters are discussed and all 
issues reported at an appropriate level of aggregation, 
with tables of reconciliations supported by and 
consistent with the accompanying narrative. There is 
an opportunity for contributors to provide comments 
on areas where there were difficulties or details of 
specific issues that have been considered; and
 – that ‘Alternative Performance Measures’ are 
appropriately described and reconciled to ‘statutory’ 
measures in the Annual Report and Accounts.
The external auditor confirmed their satisfaction with 
the standard achieved. The Board’s statement in this 
respect can be found on page 58.
...the Committee 
was satisfied that the 
accounting disclosures 
and assumptions 
were reasonable and 
appropriate for a 
business of the Group’s 
size and complexity...

d) Audit Committee effectiveness review:
The Committee’s September meeting considered 
the processes to be followed for the various 
governance reviews. With regard to the Audit Committee 
effectiveness review, as reported on page 50, the most 
recent external effectiveness evaluation of the Board 
and its Committees took place during 2016 and it 
was agreed therefore that for 2017, the evaluation 
of the effectiveness of the Committee would be taken 
alongside the Board effectiveness review and carried 
out by way of an externally provided questionnaire-
based process. 
The following actions had been noted from the 2016 
effectiveness review:
 – A review of risk management and reporting 
processes, led by the Chairs of the Audit Committee 
and the Risk & CSR Committee;
 – An update on the processes for the risk management 
and controls of the US business; and
 – To continue with Committee training to keep 
appraised of legislative evolution and best practice.
These items were covered during the year under review. 
Details of the risk review can be found in the Report of 
the Risk & CSR Committee on page 66. The processes 
for risk management and control of the US business 
were covered in reports from the internal audit function, 
and the Committee received updates from the external 
auditor in respect of financial matters.
As detailed on page 51, the 2017 Board and Committee 
effectiveness reviews were carried out by way of 
an externally-provided questionnaire. The Audit 
Committee questionnaire covered time management 
and composition, Committee processes and support, 
the work of the Committee and priorities for change. 
The outcome of the review was considered at the 
Committee’s March meeting. The effectiveness of the 
Committee continued to be rated highly. It was agreed 
that the Committee should continue with its process 
and discussion of items, with importance placed on 
focus and discipline. The transition to a new CFO and 
external auditor was identified as a key priority for the 
Committee in the coming year, along with obtaining 
more insight into any issues created by the ongoing 
transformation programme, improving the insight 
provided and ensuring that the reporting focuses 
the Committee on the key issues.
e) External Audit
Review of the effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee’s September meeting considered 
the approach for monitoring the effectiveness and 
independence of the external audit process in the light 
of the requirements of the Code and Financial Reporting 
Council guidance. In terms of timing, in previous years, 
the external audit had still been under way when the 
effectiveness questionnaire had been issued, with 
the results of the review being considered at the 
Committee’s May meeting. As this timetable gave little 
opportunity for the external auditor to respond or correct 
any issues within the audit cycle, the Committee 
decided to change the timetable and to undertake the 
review around June time, by way of a questionnaire-
based process, and to report the findings at the 
September Audit Committee meeting. This would 
provide an opportunity for any improvements to be put 
in place in time for the year-end audit. For the purpose 
of the 2017 year-end, an update was provided at the 
Committee’s May meeting on the actions arising 
from the 2016 effectiveness review. 
The 2016 review had been undertaken by way 
of questionnaire and had included the views of 
management and employees who were involved in 
supporting the external audit work, feedback from 
the CFO and Group Financial Controller and an open 
Committee discussion without the external auditor 
being present. 
At the May 2017 meeting, a report was received detailing 
the improvement actions implemented during the 2017 
financial year external audit process which had arisen 
from the detailed 2016 review questionnaire referred 
to above, as well as the output from an effectiveness 
review meeting held between KPMG, Group Finance 
and Group Internal Audit earlier in the 2017 financial year. 
Review by the FRC’s Audit Quality Review Team
During the year, the audit of the financial statements 
of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016 was 
subject to a review by the Financial Reporting Council’s 
(‘FRC’) Audit Quality Review Team (‘AQRT’). The 
Committee did not consider any of the review findings 
to have a significant impact on KPMG’s audit approach.
The transition to a 
new CFO and external 
auditor was identified 
as a key priority for 
the Committee in 
the coming year...
62 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 External auditor independence and the 
provision of non-audit services:
Policy on the regulation of non-audit work 
and safeguarding auditor independence
The Company views it as essential that the external 
auditor is both independent of any conflict of interest 
and perceived to be so. To safeguard auditor 
independence and objectivity, the following 
process is operated by the Company:
The Company has a Code of Practice applicable to all 
employees which sets out the principles for regulating 
the award of non-audit work to the external auditor. 
The Code of Practice clearly articulates the non-audit 
services which are prohibited, the non-audit services 
which can be purchased and the key approvals that 
are necessary prior to the provision of non-audit work. 
Pursuant to the Code of Practice, any non-audit services 
conducted by the auditor require the prior consent 
of the CFO or the Chairman of the Audit Committee; 
any services exceeding £50,000 in value require the 
prior consent of the Audit Committee as a whole.
Further, and in line with this policy, the Committee 
ensures that any advisory and/or consulting services 
provided by the external auditor do not conflict with 
its statutory audit responsibilities and are conducted 
through entirely separate working teams; such advisory 
and/or consulting services generally only cover 
regulatory reporting, tax, and mergers and 
acquisitions work.
The Code of Practice enables the Committee to take 
corrective action if it believes that there is a risk of the 
external auditor’s independence being undermined 
through the award of such work.
It is also QinetiQ’s policy that no KPMG employee may 
be appointed to a senior position within the QinetiQ 
Group without the prior approval of the CFO.
Review of non-audit work during the year
The Committee reviews the cost and nature of non-audit 
work undertaken by the external auditor at three meetings 
as a standing item, with a fourth meeting considering the 
auditor’s fees as part of the year-end review. 
In the last financial year, the fees relating to non-audit 
services amounted to £9,000 (2016: £199,000), being 
approximately 1% of the audit fee and 1% of the total 
fees. The fees related to advisory services in respect 
of business risk assessments. The Committee had 
concluded, prior to engaging KPMG for the provision 
of these services, that there had not been any conflict 
of interest that might compromise the independence 
of KPMG’s audit work. Details of the external auditor’s 
remuneration can be found in note 5 on page 115.
Review of the effectiveness and the independence 
of the external auditor
At its May meeting, the Committee reviewed the 
effectiveness and the independence of the external auditor 
during the year. The members of the Committee have 
declared themselves satisfied with the performance of 
KPMG as the Company’s auditor in the last financial year.
External audit tender and appointment of auditor
KPMG has been the auditor of the QinetiQ Group since its 
formation in 2001 pursuant to a competitive tender and is 
responsible for the audit of the financial statements for the 
year ended 31 March 2017, following their reappointment 
at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. 
The Company stated in the previous Annual Report and Accounts 
that it was its intention to align the process for putting the 
external audit contract out to tender with the conclusion in 2017 
of the five-year tenure of the audit partner. The tender process 
was managed by the Audit Committee and a sub-committee 
appointed, comprising the Audit Committee Chairman, two 
Non-executive Directors, the CFO and the Group Financial 
Controller. A three-stage process was designed and, in June 
2016, a notification of interest document and an independence 
assessment document were issued to interested firms.
Stage 1 required submission of a ‘summary information’ 
document and an interview with the sub-committee. A number 
of audit firms requested one-on-one meetings with the Audit 
Committee Chairman prior to the Stage 1 submission. These 
meetings were held in September 2016.
Stage 2 required submission of a detailed, formal proposal 
document. A virtual data room was made available to the firms 
containing relevant QinetiQ information, in order to assist with 
preparation of their proposals. The audit firms were able to 
interview members of QinetiQ management, to understand the 
requirements of the role and the complexities of the organisation. 
This process took place from September to December 2016.
Stage 3 involved presentations and interviews with the 
sub-committee and took place in January 2017. Criteria 
considered by the sub-committee as part of the evaluation 
process included audit effectiveness and approach, 
commerciality and independence, insight and understanding, 
perspective on accounting judgements and sector experience.
Following Stage 3, the sub-committee made a recommendation 
as to first and second choice candidates, with reasons (as 
required by the regulations) to the Audit Committee at a meeting 
convened in January 2017 specifically to conclude the audit 
tender process. The Committee noted the evaluation bases 
made by the sub-committee and discussed them. The 
Committee concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) was the preferred firm to conduct the audit engagement, 
and that they would bring a fresh approach to the audit, and 
recommended to the Board that PwC be selected as the Group’s 
external auditor for the year ending 31 March 2018. A resolution 
to appoint PwC as auditor will be put to shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on 19 July 2017. On behalf of the 
Committee, I would like to thank all of the audit firms for 
their professionalism and work in the audit tender process.
The Committee 
concluded that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’) was 
the preferred firm

Statutory Audit Services Compliance
The Company confirms that, during the year under 
review, it has complied with the requirements of the 
Competition and Markets’s Authority Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation 
(Mandatory Use of Competitor Tender Processes ad 
Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which 
relates to the frequency and governance of external 
audit tenders and the setting of a policy on the 
provision of non-audit services.

Report of the Risk & CSR Committee. 
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent
Risk & CSR Committee Chairman
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to report that, during the year, the 
Committee continued to carry out its core functions, 
with the support of the Executive Committee, in respect 
of non-financial risk management and oversight. The 
annual calendar of activity, together with the in-depth 
review of red risks and ‘deep dives’ into key risk areas, 
has continued to provide a firm basis on which the 
Committee is able to oversee the operation of the 
non-financial risk management processes within 
the Group. Regular updates, including corporate 
responsibility issues from management responsible 
for specific areas, continued to further the Committee’s 
understanding of risks and how they are mitigated.
In response to the outcome from last year’s review of 
the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, the 
Committee, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, 
reviewed the process for risk management and 
reporting. Further details are set out in this report 
on page 66. The effectiveness of the new process 
will be monitored during the coming year.
Admiral Sir James Burnell-Nugent
Risk & CSR Committee Chairman
Main responsibilities
The Committee has three primary functions:
 – to oversee the sound operation of the Company’s 
risk management systems;
 – to monitor non-financial risk exposures, including 
security, trade controls, ethics, corporate responsibility 
and health, safety and environment; and
 – to monitor adherence to the generic MOD 
compliance system.
The Committee’s full terms of reference can be found 
in the Governance section of the QinetiQ website at 
www.QinetiQ.com/about-us/corporate-governance.
The Committee meets as necessary, although normally 
not less than four times a year. During the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017, the Committee met on 
four occasions.
Activities during the year
The Committee has an annual calendar of activities, in 
accordance with which it carries out its core functions 
by way of regular reporting. In addition, it identifies 
particular areas of focus (‘deep dives’). The Committee 
continued to oversee health, safety and environment, 
trade controls, corporate responsibility, ethics and 
security through quarterly reports from the heads of 
those functions in the business. Details of key activities 
in respect of health, safety and environment and 
business ethics are set out in the People and 
relationships section on pages 30 to 33. 
In addition, during the year under review, in response to 
the outcome of last year’s review of the effectiveness 
of the Board and its Committees, the Committee, in 
conjunction with the Audit Committee, oversaw a 
project to review the process for risk management 
and reporting. Details can be found on page 66.
At each meeting, an introductory note of the key issues 
for that particular meeting ensured that all relevant 
matters were considered and dealt with appropriately. 
In addition, a separate section of the Committee papers 
contained supplementary materials to ensure that there 
was sufficient detail for those Committee members 
who wished to have more in-depth information on 
a particular matter.
The key activities during the year were as follows:
a) a review of the Group’s risk management activities 
(page 65);
b) a review of the generic MOD compliance system 
(page 65); and
c) the outcome of the Committee’s effectiveness review 
(page 66). 
A series of deep dives are scheduled for the course of 
each year, to facilitate an in-depth review and discussion 
of key risks. Examples of the deep dives carried out 
by the Committee during the year can be found on 
page 65.

64 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 a) A review of the Group’s risk management activities:
Each Committee meeting during the year was 
structured so that it received the following regular 
reports: a report from the Group Director, Safety and 
Governance, a report from the Group Director, Corporate 
Responsibility and an update from the Group Head 
of Internal Audit.
The report from the Group Director, Safety and 
Governance covered key areas of risk management 
activity, including health and safety and international 
trade controls. It included a high level summary of 
changes to non-financial risks, and an overview of 
assurance activity. In July 2016, an air accident involving 
a contracted-in Yak aircraft operating in support of the 
Empire Test Pilots’ School sadly resulted in the death 
of an RAF pilot and serious injury to the contractor 
pilot. The Company is actively supporting the 
subsequent official enquiries, and we will respond 
to all recommendations made. As part of its work, 
the Committee has considered, and will continue to 
consider, the procedural and risk management aspects 
of this incident. The report from the Group Director, 
Corporate Responsibility covered areas including 
business ethics training, emerging reputational risks, 
anti-bribery and corruption, diversity and inclusion, 
stakeholder engagement, trading policy and Modern 
Slavery Act reporting. The report from the Group Head 
of Internal Audit provided an update on internal audit 
activity since the last meeting, details of progress with 
audit recommendations and details of any overdue 
recommended actions from internal audits.
Details of the principal risks and uncertainties can be 
found in the Strategic report on pages 22 to 25. ‘Red’ 
risks are made the subject of a report to the Committee 
or become the subject of a deep dive review as part 
of the Company’s risk management processes.
b) Generic MOD compliance system:
A key aspect of the Committee’s work is the oversight 
of the MOD’s generic compliance system. This is 
integral to the work of QinetiQ in its relationship 
with the UK Government.
The generic compliance system is designed to give 
the MOD customer confidence that QinetiQ is able 
to provide impartial advice during any competitive 
evaluation of a procurement opportunity, where the 
Group wishes to operate on both the ‘buy’ and the 
‘supply’ sides. The aim is to achieve a balance between 
meeting the needs of the procurement customers in the 
MOD (principally Defence Equipment & Support) and the 
need to allow QinetiQ the flexibility to exploit research 
into the supply chain and pursue its planned commercial 
activities, without compromising the defence or security 
interests of the UK.
The Board nominates two senior executives to act as 
Compliance Implementation Director and Compliance 
Audit Director. Currently those roles are held by the 
Group Director, Safety and Governance and the Company 
Secretary and Group General Counsel respectively.
Examples of deep dive reviews into key risks carried out by the 
Committee during the year:
 – Cyber security/I.T. improvement programme 
The Group Director, I.T. presented to the Committee on two 
occasions during the year. He updated the Committee on 
the Company’s I.T. security arrangements, including system 
controls for high security networks, responsibilities for 
information systems across the Group, details of cyber 
security-related projects currently under way and steps being 
taken to improve I.T. systems across the Group. The format 
for a cyber security dashboard was considered and agreed 
by the Committee, detailing critical areas of focus, their 
status and actions or mitigations.
 – Competition law and anti-bribery and corruption 
The Company Secretary and Group General Counsel set out 
the framework for compliance (including perceived gaps and 
proposed remedial actions) with respect to each area of 
legislation. The Head of Business Assurance advised of actions 
being taken on anti-bribery and corruption compliance within 
the Group in accordance with an established timetable.
 – Recruitment and retention 
The Group Director, Human Resources updated the meeting on 
engagement with staff on changes being brought about by the 
new organisational design programme and the focus being 
applied to graduate retention and career development.
For each deep dive, Committee members were able to challenge 
the details provided and receive further details or give guidance 
as necessary.
Oversight of the operation of the compliance system 
is provided by the Committee. During the year under 
review, the Committee received an annual report from 
the Group Director, Safety and Governance and the 
internal audit function on the compliance areas that 
it monitored. The report was tabled at the January 
meeting. A typical report includes a summary of the 
scope and an executive summary of the findings with 
an audit opinion. The report includes specific findings 
with agreed associated time-bound action plans.
The Committee addresses any issues that would arise 
if QinetiQ were to fail to comply with the requirements 
of the generic compliance system. No breaches were 
noted during the year.
‘Red’ risks are made 
the subject of a report 
to the Committee or 
become the subject of 
a deep dive review as 
part of the Company’s 
risk management 
processes.

Report of the Risk & CSR Committee continued
c) Effectiveness review:
As reported on page 50, the most recent external 
effectiveness evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
took place during 2016 and it was agreed therefore 
that for 2017, the evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the Committee would be taken alongside the Board 
effectiveness review to be carried out by way of an 
externally-provided questionnaire-based process. 
The following actions had been noted from the 2016 
effectiveness review:
 – A review of risk management and reporting 
processes, led by the Chairs of the Audit 
Committee and the Risk & CSR Committee;
 – To continue to focus on the big risk areas;
 – To continue with the practice of having a more 
focused discussion on fewer items, aided by 
executive summaries;
 – To work closely with the Executive Committee and 
management in respect of risk management activity;
 – To continue the practice of deep dives into subject 
risk areas; and
 – To review the Committee’s focus on Corporate 
Responsibility in the light of best practice.
These items have been covered during the year 
under review by the specific project with regard 
to risk reporting and the ongoing Committee 
activities, as noted in this report. 
The outcome of the 2017 review was considered at 
the Committee’s May meeting and was as follows:
The Risk & CSR Committee was rated highly and the 
continued separation of financial and non-financial risk 
into the Audit Committee and Risk & CSR Committee 
respectively was considered to be working well and 
created appropriate time to focus on key issues.
The following actions were also agreed for the 
coming year: 
 – Devoting more time to deep dives and less to reporting;
 – Improved quality of papers;
 – Continuing to simplify and further use the new risk 
reporting system; and
 – Further training in risk management.
Special Project: a review of the risk register 
and risk management reporting:
The review of the risk register is a standing item on the 
Committee’s agenda, with amendments being made 
to reflect changes in the Group’s business and strategy. 
Following the results of the Board and Committee effectiveness 
reviews, the action to revise and clarify risk management and 
reporting was carried out jointly by the Chairmen of the Audit 
Committee and Risk & CSR Committee, in conjunction with the 
Executive Committee. The Board had requested revisions to the 
Group Enterprise Risk Reporting document to make clear the 
changing nature of risks as new elements arise, and specific 
mitigations are implemented, and thereby highlight areas 
requiring focus.
A draft revised risk register was presented to the Committee 
at its July meeting and to the Executive Committee later in 
July, along with an implementation plan to roll out the new 
risk reporting format and process. The Executive Committee 
requested reassurance around briefings to risk owners and 
leadership teams around the new metrics to be used in the 
revised format. The Group Director, Safety and Governance 
confirmed that briefings and support would be provided. The 
Committee further reviewed the non-financial risk register in 
September 2016 and January 2017. The Audit Committee 
undertook a detailed review of the financial risk register in 
September 2016. In addition, the risk reporting format was 
updated. Amendments were made to the risk reporting document 
and the format approved by the Audit Committee and the Board 
at their September meetings. The Board requested revisions to 
the Group Enterprise Risk reporting, to convey a dynamic sense 
of progress and identify areas requiring focus. KPMG were 
engaged to provide consultation on good practice risk reporting.
The new format was used for the November Audit and Risk & 
CSR Committee meetings. The new reporting process and risk 
register format were reviewed in conjunction with the Audit 
Committee in March 2017 and approved. It was noted that the 
improvements made to risk management had resulted in a new 
reporting template, an Executive Committee focused risk review 
and risk appetite review and new resource to improve tactical 
risk management.
Report of the Security Committee
There was no requirement for the Committee 
to meet during the year.
Membership and attendance during the year

67 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance | Corporate governance statement Code Principle D – Remuneration
Directors’ Remuneration Report (DRR)
Chairman’s statement
Michael Harper
Remuneration Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year 
ending 31 March 2017.
As the Chairman has outlined in his statement on page 
4, the Board has been encouraged by the progress made 
by the CEO and his new Executive Committee during the 
year and by the momentum the CEO in particular has 
given to the development and implementation of our 
new growth strategy. The progress is evident from 
the growth in our share price and our improved total 
shareholder return performance. 
Overall, the Remuneration Committee believes that good 
progress has been made during the year with increased 
orders and profitability. Overall, the annual contribution 
to the Bonus Banking Plan pool remains consistent 
with 2016 – see page 71.
The business context in 2017 
Governments across the globe are increasingly seeking 
to protect their citizens against a variety of security 
threats. Our expertise in science and technology is 
particularly relevant in this environment and we play 
a vital role in linking different technologies and making 
connections across supply chains and internationally. 
The implementation of our new strategy, which 
represents significant change in direction and 
approach in the complex market of defence 
is challenging and will take time.
The essence of the business strategy is to grow the 
Company sustainably over the next five years through 
transformation which continues at pace, partnering 
with our customers and investing in organic growth. 
This organic investment includes internal research 
and development, complemented by bolt-on 
acquisitions where there is a strong strategic fit. 
Short-term operational excellence is critical and the 
Remuneration Committee has spent a great deal of time 
during the year considering the incentive arrangements 
of the Executive Directors and the top 200 leaders 
in the Company with a view to ensuring the right 
balance between rewarding short-term performance 
and long-term growth. A sharp focus on annual 
performance will continue to be critical to delivering 
sustained, longer-term shareholder value. 
The new Directors’ Remuneration Policy
At the heart of the new policy, the Remuneration 
Committee is proposing a new approach to incentives 
which balances reward for incremental annual 
performance and long-term sustainable shareholder 
value creation as measured by share price appreciation 
and a progressive dividend policy. It is the Committee’s 
view that the new five-year strategy requires a bespoke 
and innovative approach to remuneration.
The approach is designed to:
 – Provide a clear link to strategy implementation
 – Link short-term and sustained long-term 
performance; and
 – Align the interests of our shareholders and 
leadership team.
The proposed incentive arrangements are built on the 
key performance indicators and performance targets 
which are integral to the five-year Integrated Strategic 
Business Plan.
During the year we embarked on an extensive 
consultation exercise with our largest shareholders and 
their representatives and we have listened carefully to 
the views we have received. The proposals which we 
are asking shareholders to vote on at the Annual General 
Meeting incorporate several design features which some 
of our shareholders requested during the engagement 
process. In summary the new policy:
 – Reduces the total incentive opportunity from 
425% to 325% of salary;
 – Reduces the maximum award under the Bonus 
Banking Plan from 225% to 200% of salary. As now, 
half the award is deferred into shares and delivered 
over a four-year period;
 – Introduces a new annual Deferred Share Plan equal 
to 125% of salary all of which is deferred into equity 
and subject to a three-year performance underpin 
with a further two-year holding period. This will 
be used in place of the performance share plan;
 – Increases the minimum shareholding requirement 
for the CEO to 300% of salary and 200% for the CFO 
from 200% and 150% of salary respectively; and
 – Reduces the pension contribution for new Executive 
Directors to 15% of salary from 25% of salary.

68 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Aligning the interests of our shareholders and 
QinetiQ’s leadership team
The Remuneration Committee has sought to ensure that 
the new approach to incentives aligns the interests of our 
shareholders with those of the top 200 leaders in QinetiQ. 
A number of checks and balances have been incorporated 
into the incentive arrangements to ensure that they will 
not reward short-term performance which is not 
sustained over the longer term. 
The key features of the arrangements which prevent 
this are:
 – The measurement of multi-year performance in 
respect of shares awarded under the Bonus Banking 
Plan through the annual forfeiture mechanism;
 – The mix of cash and shares awarded in the year is 
heavily weighted towards shares (circa 70% equity 
at maximum);
 – The long-term performance underpin which will 
determine whether the Deferred Share Plan shares 
vest in full at the end of three years;
 – The additional ‘holding period’ in respect of the 
Deferred Share Plan shares which may only be 
traded five years after the initial award;
 – The stretch of the performance targets – so the 
performance targets for the Deferred Share Plan 
are based on our strategic growth plan;
 – The transparent disclosure of the performance 
measures and targets; and
 – Increased share ownership requirements.
In summary, the proposed incentive arrangement 
comprise two elements: the existing Bonus Banking 
Plan (Element A) and a new Deferred Share Plan 
(Element B) which replaces the Performance Share 
Plan. The Bonus Banking Plan (Element A) targets are 
based on the annual budget whilst the Deferred Share 
Plan (Element B) targets are based on strategic growth 
measures. For 2018, the performance measure for the 
Deferred Share Plan (Element B) is based on improving 
underlying profit over the previous years outturn with 
a stretching maximum. 
We are aware that the use of operational financial 
measures and non-financial measures which drive 
long-term shareholder value is somewhat different 
from the more standard measures such as Earnings 
per Share and Total Shareholder Return performance 
measures. The design of the incentive arrangements 
are based on annual and multi-year performance 
assessment. We believe that we have succeeded 
in developing arrangements which will reward both 
short-term performance and sustained, long-term 
shareholder value.
Employee engagement and reward
All QinetiQ’s employees are key to the delivery of the 
strategy. The CEO and the Group HR Director have 
introduced regular consultations with our Employee 
Engagement Group on reward matters including 
Executive Directors’ pay. I have met the Chair of 
the Employee Engagement Group and it is our 
intention to meet again prior to the AGM and 
at appropriate intervals thereafter.
Conclusion
The Committee is presenting a revised Remuneration 
Policy for shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM and 
is included in full on pages 72-81. It is also available to 
view in full on the Company’s website www.QinetiQ.com. 
Further details on the new Deferred Share Plan (Element 
B) are set out in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
together with a summary description of the Plan’s terms 
and conditions.
I hope that we can rely on your vote in favour of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration and Remuneration 
Policy at the AGM on 19 July 2017. I am very grateful 
for the time shareholders and their representative 
bodies have given us throughout the consultation 
process. If you would like to discuss any aspect of 
this report, I would be happy to hear from you. You 
may contact me through Jon Messent, Company 
Secretary and Group General Counsel.

At a glance
How have we performed against our corporate performance objectives?
Embedding our strategy, in tandem with transforming our Company through reorganisation and people development, 
has seen a year of immense change delivered with pace and determination across the Group.
The diverse challenges and opportunities we face in our markets, our unique heritage, and the deep transformation 
our organisation is working through, means that we continue to evolve our strategy in a very deliberate way.
Exceeding targets on orders and achieving stretch on operating profit and cash flow is regarded by the Committee as 
a good result in such a challenging year. The Committee believe that incentivising strategic and operational objectives, 
which support the financial KPIs, has ensured the Company has progressed both in terms of what was delivered but 
also how it was delivered.
The collective objectives have seen the CEO, supported by an engaged Executive Committee and Leadership Community, 
lead on communicating our vision and purpose. The CEO has been visible to both customers and employees alike and 
he has been a personal sponsor of the Leadership Development Programme which every member of the Executive 
Committee and Leadership Community has undertaken with hugely positive results. The CEO has also worked very 
closely with the Board in developing an Integrated Strategic Business Plan which provides the challenge and direction 
over the next five years. 
We set five collective objectives, summarised below, based on securing contracts in certain markets and transforming 
the organisation. Of the five collective objectives, two were achieved in full, two partially achieved and one not achieved.
The Group Chairman takes responsibility for setting the personal objectives of the CEO and the two critical objectives, 
summarised below, relate to the development of the five-year Integrated Strategic Business Plan and Leadership 
Development. The Board is pleased with the excellent progress made against these two objectives. 
The following table highlights the performance and remuneration outcomes for the year ended 31 March 2017

Part 2: Remuneration Policy
Introduction
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was last approved 
in 2014 and the Company therefore seeks approval 
for the new policy at the AGM on 19 July 2017.
Scope of policy
The policy applies to Executive Directors, the Group 
Chairman and Non-executive Directors. Reference 
may also be made to the Executive Committee who, 
while not Directors, fall within the Committee’s remit, 
although the policy is not binding for these individuals.
Duration of policy
The policy will be put forward for binding vote at the 
AGM on 19 July 2017 and will be effective from that 
date. The Policy is expected to remain in effect until 
the 2020 AGM.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of 
policy as set out in this report. The Committee may 
also exercise operational and administrative discretions 
under relevant plan rules as set out in those rules. In 
addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend 
the Remuneration Policy with regard to minor or 
administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion 
of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval and commits to communicating 
to shareholders when discretion is used.
Key changes in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee conducted an extensive review of 
the Remuneration Policy taking into account the 
following factors:
 – The Company vision-led strategy launched at the 
beginning of FY17 aiming to establish the conditions 
for growth;
 – The new executive team, including both Executive 
Directors and Executive Committee members, 
established to deliver the strategy; and
 – The current suitability of the incentive arrangements 
for the Group incorporating insight from 
our Leadership Community and Employee 
Engagement Group.
This has resulted in the Committee proposing to 
introduce new incentive arrangements (collectively 
the Incentive Plan), if approved by shareholders, made 
up of two elements:
 – Bonus Banking Plan (Element A) with no change 
to the current terms and conditions other than a 
reduction in the maximum opportunity from 225% 
to 200% of salary
 – Deferred Share Plan (Element B) to be used in place 
of the current Performance Share Plan – maximum 
opportunity is reduced from 200% (current maximum 
granted to CEO in 2016 for two years) to 125% 
of salary.
Awards under the Deferred Share Plan (Element B) 
will be earned based on challenging strategic financial 
growth objectives set by the Committee each year in line 
with the Company’s Integrated Strategic Business Plan.
Shares earned under the Deferred Share Plan (Element 
B) are subject to a three-year vesting period, during 
which the participant must remain employed by the 
Company, and also cannot be sold for five years from 
the date of award irrespective of employment status. 
The rationale for the change to incentive provision is to:
 – provide a simple cohesive design, that incentivises 
delivery of the Integrated Strategic Business Plan;
 – recognise that the Integrated Strategic Business 
Plan will evolve, therefore providing the Board with 
the opportunity to manage the incentives annually 
to ensure the evolution continues to be incentivised; 
 – reward participants as shareholders by the build-up 
of a long-term retained shareholding; and
 – ensure a focus on long-term sustainable performance 
through the deferral in equity. Based on the maximum 
incentive opportunity of 325%, half of the Bonus 
Banking Plan (Element A) opportunity (100%) and all 
of the Deferred Share Plan (Element B) opportunity 
(125%) is treated as equity. 
There will be an increase in minimum shareholding 
requirement for the CEO to 300% of salary (previously 
200% of salary) and for the CFO 200% of salary 
(previously 150% of salary). This increases the 
alignment of Executive Directors’ remuneration 
with shareholder value.
The pension contribution for any new Executive Director 
will be reduced to a maximum of 15% of salary. The 
change will bring pension provision for Executive 
Directors more closely in line with the provision for 
the broader employee base.
Otherwise, the operation of the policy is in line with 
the previous policy in force.
The policy will be put 
forward for binding 
vote at the AGM on 
19 July 2017 and 
will be effective 
from that date.
72 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy is put forward for approval at the AGM on 19 July 2017. This policy covers 
the three year period commencing 1 April 2017 and complies with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounting and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
Base salary To attract and retain the 
talent needed to lead 
our business.
An Executive Director’s basic salary is set on 
appointment and reviewed annually or when 
there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, 
the Committee considers:
 – general salary rises to employees;
 – remuneration practices within the Group;
 – any change in scope, role and responsibilities;
 – the general performance of the Group;
 – the experience of the relevant Director;
 – the economic environment; and
 – when the Committee determines a 
benchmarking exercise is appropriate salaries 
within the ranges paid by the 
companies in the comparator groups 
used for remuneration benchmarking. 
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the 
Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set 
below the targeted policy level until they become 
established in their role. In such cases subsequent 
increases in salary may be higher than the general 
rises for employees until the target positioning 
is achieved. 
Typically, the base salaries of Executive Directors in 
post at the start of the policy period and who remain 
in the same role throughout the policy period will 
be increased by a similar percentage to the average 
annual percentage increase in salaries of all other 
employees in the Group. The exceptions to this 
rule may be where:
 – an individual is below market level and a decision 
is taken to increase base pay to reflect proven 
competence in the role; or
 – there is a material increase in scope or 
responsibility to the Executive Director’s role. 
The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels 
are positioned in line with companies of a similar 
size to QinetiQ and validated against other companies 
in the industry, so that they are competitive against 
the market.
The Committee intends to review the comparators 
periodically and may add or remove companies from 
the group as it considers appropriate. Any changes 
to the comparator groups will be set out in the 
section headed Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy, in the following financial year.
Pension To ensure that Executive 
Directors’ total remuneration 
remains attractive and 
competitive.
The Company provides a pension contribution 
allowance in line with practice relative to its 
comparators to enable the Company to recruit 
and retain Executive Directors with the experience 
and expertise to deliver the Group’s strategy.
This allowance will be a non-consolidated allowance 
and will not impact any incentive calculations.
The maximum policy pension contribution allowance 
will be reduced to 20% for existing Executive 
Directors in line with current provision; however, 
any new Executive Directors will have a maximum 
contribution of 15%.
The Company will set out in the section headed 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy, in the 
following financial year the pension contributions 
for that year for each of the Executive Directors.
Benefits To ensure that Executive 
Directors’ total remuneration 
remains attractive and 
competitive.
Benefits include car allowance, health insurance, life 
assurance, income protection and membership of the 
Group’s employee Share Incentive Plan which is open 
to all UK employees (the Executive Directors will also 
be eligible to participate in any other all employee 
plan operated by the Company from time to time).
The Committee recognises the need to maintain 
suitable flexibility in the benefits provided to ensure 
it is able to support the objective of attracting 
and retaining personnel in order to deliver the 
Group strategy. Additional benefits may therefore be 
offered such as relocation allowances on recruitment.
The maximum is the cost of providing the 
relevant benefits.

Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
Incentive Plan The Incentive Plan provides 
a significant incentive to the 
Executive Directors linked 
to achievement of delivering 
goals that are closely aligned 
with the Company’s strategy 
and the creation of value for 
shareholders.
In particular, the Incentive 
Plan supports the 
Company’s objectives by:
 – allowing the setting of 
annual targets based on 
the businesses’ strategic 
objectives at that time, 
meaning that a wider 
range of performance 
metrics can be used that 
are relevant and suitably 
stretching whilst also 
providing sufficient 
incentive linked to 
potential to be 
achievable; and
 – providing substantial 
deferral in shares and 
ongoing adjustment by 
requiring a threshold level 
of performance to be 
achieved during the 
deferral period. Amounts 
deferred in shares are also 
forfeitable on a director’s 
voluntary cessation of 
employment which 
provides an effective 
lock-in.
An award under the Incentive Plan is subject 
to satisfying financial and strategic/operational 
performance/personal performance conditions and 
targets measured over a period of one financial year.
A minimum of 50% of the incentive shall be based 
on financial performance measures.
The Incentive Plan consists of two elements 
(Element A and Element B).
Bonus Banking Plan (Element A). Annual Company 
contributions will be earned based on the satisfaction of 
the performance conditions. Contributions will be made 
for three years with payments made over four years. 50% 
of the value of a participant’s bonus account will be paid 
out annually for three years with 100% of the residual 
value paid out at the end of year four. 50% of the unpaid 
balance of a participant’s bonus account will be at risk 
of annual forfeiture.
Deferred Share Plan (Element B). Deferred 
share-based element earned based on the 
satisfaction of pre-grant annual performance 
assessment, which is subject to a three-year vesting 
period and a further two-year holding period. 
A minimum 50% (Remuneration Committee have 
discretion to increase subject to performance) of the 
unvested award will be at risk forfeiture after three years.
Malus and clawback provision apply to the Incentive 
Plan (both Elements).
The Committee has discretion to provide dividend 
equivalents on Element A and Element B shares.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the 
commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the detailed 
financial targets used for the incentive, disclosing 
precise targets for the Incentive Plan in advance would 
not be in shareholder interests. Targets, performance 
achieved and awards made will be published at the end 
of the annual performance period so shareholders can 
fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the Plan.
Maximum 325% of salary (200% of salary under 
Element A and 125% of salary under Element B).
Bonus Banking Plan (Element A)
Maximum = 200% of salary.
Target = 80%–120% of salary.
Threshold = 0% of salary.

Maximum = 125% of salary.
Target = 30%-75% of salary.
Threshold = 0% of salary.

Incentive Plan continued In exceptional circumstances the Committee retains 
the discretion to:
Change the performance measures and targets and 
the weighting attached to the performance measures 
and targets part way through a performance year if 
there is a significant and material event which causes 
the Committee to believe the original measures, 
weightings and targets are no longer appropriate; 
for example adjustments for: 
 – Acquisitions and disposals;
 – Restructuring costs;
 – Business structure changes;
 – Restated corporate allocations;
 – Foreign currency exchange rates; and
 – Board approved budget adjustments.
Make downward or upward adjustments to the 
amount of incentive earned resulting from the 
application of the performance measures, if the 
Committee believe that the incentive outcomes 
are not a fair and accurate reflection of business 
performance. Any adjustments or discretion applied 
by the Committee will be fully disclosed in the 
following year’s Directors’ remuneration report.
Minimum shareholding 
requirements
To align Executive Directors’ 
interests with those of 
shareholders through the 
build-up and retention 
of a personal holding 
in QinetiQ shares.
Executives have five years to accumulate the 
required shareholding.
300% of base salary for the CEO.
200% of base salary for the CFO.
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding 
requirements that will encourage the Executive 
Directors to build up over a five-year period and 
then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent 
to a percentage of base salary. Adherence to these 
guidelines is a condition of continued participation 
in the equity incentive arrangements. This policy 
ensures that the interests of Executive Directors 
and those of shareholders are closely aligned.
In addition, Executive Directors will be required to 
retain 50% of the post-tax amount of vested shares 
from the Company incentive plans until the minimum 
shareholding requirement is met and maintained.
The Committee retains the discretion to increase 
the shareholding requirements.

Notes to the policy tables
Performance measures and targets
The performance measures and targets, financial and non-financial, are determined annually based on the Company’s 
strategy. The Committee is of the opinion that the specific performance targets for the Incentive Plan are commercially 
sensitive and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Company to disclose them. The targets will be disclosed 
after the end of the relevant financial year in that year’s remuneration report.
However, the Committee is of the opinion that certain elements of the collective objectives may remain commercially 
sensitive beyond the end of the relevant financial year and will therefore be disclosed once they cease to be commercially 
sensitive which is anticipated to be within two years of the relevant financial year.
Remuneration policy for all employees
All employee of QinetiQ are entitled to base salary, benefits and pension. 
The link between performance and reward cascades down from the Executive incentive plans with the Leadership 
and Business Development Communities typically invited to participate in the Company’s formal annual incentive 
arrangements. All other employees may receive a discretionary bonus based on Company and individual performance. 
Participation in long-term incentive plans is available to Executive Directors, Executive Committee members, Leadership 
Community and selected other employees. Share ownership is further encouraged via the QinetiQ Share Incentive Plan.
Recruitment policy
The Company’s principle is that the remuneration of any new recruit will be assessed in line with the same principles 
as for the current Executive Directors. The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers 
necessary to secure a preferred candidate with the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. In setting the 
remuneration for new recruits, the Committee will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off 
or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive payments as well as giving consideration for the appropriateness of any 
award. The Company’s detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new Directors is summarised 
in the table below:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Salary, benefits and pension These will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Incentive Plan Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for 
existing Executive Directors and will not exceed 325% of salary.
Maximum variable remuneration The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted is 325% of salary 
(excluding any buy-outs).
‘Buy Out’ of incentives forfeited on 
cessation of employment
Where the Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment 
justifies the provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will 
be forfeited on cessation of an Executive Director’s previous employment will be 
calculated taking into account the following:
 – The proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive 
Director’s cessation of employment;
 – The performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the 
likelihood of them being satisfied; and 
 – Any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (‘Lapsed value’).
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where 
possible, under the Company’s incentive plan. To the extent that it was not possible 
or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive 
plan, a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Relocation policies In instances where the new Executive Director is required to relocate or spend 
significant time away from their normal residence, the Company may provide one-off 
compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive Director. The level 
of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but will take into 
consideration any cost of living differences/housing allowance and schooling.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion 
but there would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration 
arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured 
and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the person concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the 
remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
76 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Loss of office and change of control policy
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise the cost 
to the Company while complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. 
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge 
of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or 
compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.

Salary and 
benefits
In the event of termination by the Company, 
there will be no compensation for loss of office 
due to misconduct or normal resignation. 
In other circumstances, Executive Directors 
may be entitled to receive compensation for 
loss of office which will be a maximum of 
12 months’ salary. 
Such payments will be equivalent to 
the monthly salary and benefits that the

in employment with the Company. These will 
be paid over the notice period. Executive 
Directors will be expected to mitigate their 
loss within a twelve month period of their 
departure from the Company.

79 QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report Malus and clawback
Malus provisions apply to both the Bonus Banking Plan (Element A) and the Deferred Share Plan (Element B). Malus is the 
adjustment of Element A bonus contributions or the balance in a participant’s bonus account or unvested Deferred Share 
Plan (Element B) awards because of the occurrence of one or more circumstances. The adjustment may result in the 
value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of payments made under the Bonus Banking Plan (Element A ) or vested Deferred Share Plan 
(Element B) awards as a result of the occurrence of one or more circumstances. Clawback may apply to all or part of 
a participant’s payment under the Deferred Share Plan (Element A) or Deferred Share Plan (Element B) award and may 
be effected, among other means, by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows:
 – Discovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group or any 
Group company;
 – The assessment of any performance condition or condition in respect of a payment or award under the Incentive 
Plan was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information; 
 – The discovery that any information used to determine the Bonus Banking Plan (Element A) or Deferred Share Plan 
(Element B) award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information;
 – Action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud or gross misconduct; or 
 – Events or the behaviour of a participant have led to the censure of a Group company by a regulatory authority or have 
had a significant detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group company provided that the Board is satisfied that 
the relevant participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational 
damage is attributable to the participant.
The following table sets out the periods during which malus and clawback may be effected.
Bonus Banking Plan (Element A) Deferred Share Plan (Element B)
Malus Up to the date of a payment. Any time prior to vesting.
Clawback Three years post the date of any payment. Three years from the date of vesting.

80 Corporate governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Policy for Non-executive Directors
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-executive Directors is to apply the policy 
which applies to current Non-executive Directors.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation and performance measures Maximum opportunity
Non-executive Directors
Fees To attract and retain 
Non-executive Directors of 
the calibre required to assist 
the Company in setting and 
delivering its strategy.
The Executive Directors and the Group Chairman are responsible 
for setting the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors. 
The Board, minus the Chairman, is responsible for setting the 
Chairman’s fees. 
Non-executive Directors are paid an annual fee and additional 
fees for chairmanship of committees, and the Company retains 
the flexibility to pay fees for the membership of committees. 
The Chairman does not receive any additional fees for 
membership of committees.
Fees are reviewed annually based on equivalent roles in 
the comparator group used to review salaries paid to the 
Executive Directors. 
An annual accommodation allowance may be payable to the 
Group Chairman and as deemed appropriate for individuals 
who are not UK resident.
Excluding the Group Chairman, an additional fee is payable 
to those Non-executive Directors attending meetings outside 
of their country of residence.
Non-executive Directors and the Group Chairman 
do not participate in any variable remuneration or 
benefits arrangements.
The fees for Non-executive Directors 
and the Group Chairman are broadly 
set at a competitive level against the 
comparator group.
In general the level of fee increase for 
the Non-executive Directors and the 
Group Chairman will be set taking 
account of any change in responsibility 
and the general rise in salaries 
across employees.
The Company will pay reasonable 
expenses incurred by the Non-executive 
Directors and Group Chairman and may 
settle any tax incurred in relation to these.
Consideration of shareholder and employee views
The Chair of the Committee and the Group Chairman consult with key shareholders on remuneration matters from 
time to time, and particularly where changes to the Remuneration Policy are under consideration. The Chair reports any 
concerns expressed by shareholders to the Committee and these are taken into account as the Committee develops and 
implements its policy. Any comments received from shareholders outside these consultation exercises are also reported 
to the Committee, and the Committee takes account of general views on remuneration expressed by shareholders or 
representative bodies.
The Committee consulted with its principal shareholders in relation to the proposal to revise the policy and took 
into account views expressed during the consultation when agreeing the final design. The Remuneration Committee is 
grateful for shareholders’ comments and engagement during the consultation process. At the end of this process, the 
Remuneration Committee was pleased that the majority of the shareholders consulted expressed support for the policy.
The Committee has not formally consulted with employees and has not used any specific all-employee comparison 
metrics in forming this policy. However, the Committee has regularly consulted with the Company’s Employee 
Engagement Group on other reward matters.

Part 3: Annual Report on Remuneration
Introduction
The Remuneration Committee presents the Annual Remuneration Report showing how the Remuneration Policy has 
been implemented for the year ended 31 March 2017. 
The Committee presents the Annual Report on Remuneration to shareholders at the AGM on 19 July 2017. This report 
was compiled in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2013 as well as the Companies Act 2006. 
Remuneration Committee Structure
The Committee is chaired by Michael Harper, and is composed of the members set out on page 68.
Effectiveness review
In 2017, the effectiveness review was undertaken internally, and it rated the effectiveness of the Committee highly overall. 
Considerations for 2017 include continuing the productive dialogue with the Executive team and, subject to policy approval, 
ensuring incentive targets are stretching enough in the context of the strategy, as it plays out.
Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
Members of the Committee are appointed by the Board. The Committee comprises at least three members (not counting 
the Group Chairman), all of whom are independent Non-executive Directors. The Group Chairman of the Board also serves 
on the Committee as an additional member as he was considered independent on appointment as Chairman.
Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings. However, external advisors and other 
internal advisors such as the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Human Resources Director are invited to attend 
for all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate.
The Board appoints the Committee Chairman who is an independent, Non-executive Director. In the absence of the 
Committee Chairman and/or an appointed deputy, the remaining members present shall elect one of themselves to 
chair the meeting who would qualify under these terms of reference to be appointed to that position by the Board. 
The Chairman of the Board is not permitted to be Chairman of the Committee.
The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found on the QinetiQ website (www.QinetiQ.com). 
Service Contracts/Letters of Appointment
The Company’s policy is that Executive Directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving 12 
months’ notice. Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment. 
All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the 
AGM. Non-executive Directors typically serve two three-year terms but may be invited by the Board to serve for an 
additional period (see table in the Nominations Committee report on page 53).

The Committee has appointed PwC, an independent firm of remuneration consultants, to provide advice on market 
practice, corporate governance and institutional stakeholder views. Fees paid during the year for these services 
were £111,500 which included advice relating to the policy and shareholder consultation.
PwC provided the following additional services during the year:
 – Implementation support for the Company on Executive reward plans;
 – Consultancy and advice to Group Tax; and
 – Consultancy and advice in relation to Group Pensions.
The Committee is satisfied the scale and nature of this work does not impact on the objectivity and independence 
of the advice it receives from PwC.
Following the appointment of PwC as Independent Auditor the Committee can no longer retain PwC as advisors. 
The Committee undertook a thorough review and has appointed FIT Remuneration Consultants as advisors from 
1 April 2017.

Executive Directors changes during 2017
David Mellors (CFO) resigned from the Company on 31 December 2016 and was replaced by David Smith on 1 March 2017. 
Following David Mellors’ decision to leave the Committee agreed that all shares subject to performance conditions would 
lapse and that there would be no annual variable reward paid under the Bonus Banking Plan. However, given that David 
Mellors had built up equity in the Bonus Banking Plan when he made a positive contribution to stabilising the business 
through CEO change and transition to his successor, the Committee felt it was important that he stay incentivised during 
his notice period, therefore the decision was taken for David to remain eligible to receive the balance of his accrued 
and earned Bonus Banking Plan account. Details can be found on page 87.
Performance condition adjustments during 2017
In March 2015 the Committee agreed a set of adjustment principles to enable consistent and fair review in the event of 
an accounting decision impacting on incentives.
Underlying Operating Profit in 2017 included a credit of £5.2m following the LTPA contract amendment in December 2016. 
The contract amendment will see QinetiQ procure a new fleet of aircraft for the Empire Test Pilots’ School and QinetiQ is, 
as a result, released from the commitment to fulfill the previously expected level of servicing obligations of the existing 
fleet. The Committee, following review with the Audit Committee, viewed this as neutral for the purposes of remuneration 
as the original charges reduced profit, and therefore incentive outturns, in prior years.
As in 2015 and 2016, the Committee again adjusted the performance conditions for the Performance Share Plan and 
Deferred Annual Bonus Matching Plan to reflect continuing operations and share buyback.
Neither Executive Director participated in the long-term incentives impacted by these changes owing to their respective 
hire dates with only the CEO participating in the annual incentive. The annual incentive paid to the CEO was £1,104,687 
(86.4% of maximum) as detailed on page 86.
The following table provides a summary of all the key activities during the year. There was full attendance at each meeting 
except for March 2017 when Ian Mason was unable to be present.

Executive Director
To support the single figure, this section documents 
each element of remuneration and how the figure was 
calculated for the performance year ended 31 March 2017.
Salary/fees 
The increase in the CEO’s base salary reflects his 
first full year in post and a 2.5% (£14,000) per annum 
increase effective from 1 July 2016, in line with the 
typical 2016 salary increase across the Group.
The new CFO has commenced employment on the 
same base salary as his predecessor (£440,000).
Benefits
Benefits comprise of car allowance, healthcare, life 
assurance and income protection
Annual incentive
For the year ended 31 March 2017 achievement of 
on-target performance provides a payment equal to 
112.5% of base salary, rising on a linear scale to 225% 
of base salary for achievement of stretch performance.
For FY17 and FY16, the scheme begins to pay out 
once threshold performance measures have been 
achieved. For the year ended 31 March 2017, financial 
performance measures make up 75% of the annual 
incentive opportunity with collective objectives 
and personal objectives accounting for the remaining 
25%. For the year ended 31 March 2016, financial 
performance measures and personal objectives 
were weighted at 80%/20% of the annual incentive 
opportunity.

Collective Objectives
At the beginning of the performance period five collective objectives were set by the Remuneration Committee and 
communicated to the Executive Directors, Executive Committee and Leadership Community. Three of the objectives 
focus on delivering our strategy and the remaining two focused on operational transformation so that we are organised 
effectively to succeed.
Lead and modernise the UK Defence ‘Test & Evaluation enterprise’
The objective provided a focus on securing agreements for the modernisation of Boscombe Down and provision of future 
Test and Evaluation needs with key prime contractors. The objective was partially met.
Build the Company internationally
Significant progress was made, due to circumstances outside our control, the specifics of the objective were not delivered 
but remain live and therefore continue to be commercially sensitive and not disclosed. The objective was judged to be 
not delivered.
Innovate for customer advantage
The objective provided a focus on investing in new product capability opportunities. A number of these delivered contracts 
during the year but remain commercially sensitive and are not disclosed. The objective was measured as partially met. 
Transformation programme
The objective provided a focus on generating a five-year Integrated Strategic Business Plan and delivering recurring 
savings of £20m for future growth investment. The objective was successfully met.
Organisation development
The objective focussed on establishing a matrix organisation, designed to support our new business model and strategy, and 
completion of the Leadership Development Programme for over 200 of our senior leaders. The objective was successfully met.
Personal objectives
At the beginning of the performance period two personal objectives were set by the Group Chairman and communicated 
to the CEO. 
Growth
The objective provided a focus on developing a five-year business plan, generating a pipeline of potential acquisitions 
and building shareholder confidence. The five-year plan has been approved by the Board and the pipeline for potential 
acquisitions has already produced two successes via QinetiQ Target Systems and RubiKon Group Pty Limited. Positive 
shareholder feedback has shown that confidence is growing therefore the objective is judged to have been met.
Leadership
The objective provided a focus on forming the business leadership into an inspired, self-motivated winning group. Progress 
was to be shared with the Board at two reviews incorporating a clear focus on succession planning. Through organisation 
redesign, focused recruitment and development interventions and culture programmes the progress made has been 
positively received by the Board. The objective is judged to have been met. 
The Bonus Banking Plan operates as follows:
 – The Plan operates on a fixed four-year cycle. Year one of the Plan commenced on 1 April 2014, year two commenced 
1 April 2015, year three commenced 1 April 2016, and year four commenced on 1 April 2017.
 – Performance conditions are set at the beginning of each Plan year.
 – At the end of each of the first three Plan years the performance against targets is assessed and the level of the 
incentive earned is determined and paid into the Plan account.
 – At the end of each of the first three Plan years, 50% of the account balance will be paid and the balance retained 
and held in the Plan as notional shares.
 – At the end of the fourth year, any remaining balance in the Plan account is paid out in shares.

Following David Mellors’ resignation, he was ineligible to receive the annual contribution due from the Bonus Banking Plan. 
However he retained the balance in his Bonus Banking Account.
Forfeiture
The CEO retained notional shares in his Plan account of which 50% were subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture would have been 
enacted if Group Underlying Operating Profit was less than £85.0m for FY17. FY17 Group Underlying Operating Profit was 
£115.1m (excluding contribution from acquisitions) therefore no notional shares were forfeited.
Discretion
For the year ended 31 March 2017, no discretion was applied to the calculated results; therefore, £1,104,687 has been 
reported in the single figure calculation.
For the year ended 31 March 2016, financial targets were exceeded providing a contribution of 85.4% of base salary for 
the CEO and 82.9% of base salary for the CFO. £999,117 and £849,917 has been reported in the single figure table. No 
discretion was applied to these contributions.

Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The auditor is required to report on the information in this table. Set out below are the Directors’ shareholdings as at 
31 March 2017.
In relation to the revised Executive Shareholding Policy adopted on 1 April 2017 the Company requires Executive Directors 
to hold shares equivalent to 300% (CEO) and 200% (CFO) of base salary.
The CEO does not currently meet the minimum shareholding requirement; with a current holding equivalent to 10% of base 
salary using a share price of £2.726 (three-month average to 31 March 2017). This reflects his recent appointment as CEO 
and the lack of any opportunity for share-based awards to vest.
The CFO does not currently meet the minimum shareholding requirement; with a current holding equivalent to 0% of base 
salary using a share price of £2.726 (three-month average to 31 March 2017). This reflects his recent appointment as CFO 
and the lack of any opportunity for share-based awards to vest.

TSR performance between median and upper quartile when compared to the FTSE250. DAB Match is subject to the same 
EPS condition as the PSP. The price of a QinetiQ share at 31 March 2017 was 279.0p. The highest and lowest prices of a 
QinetiQ share during the year ended 31 March 2017 were 217.5p and 285.0p. There have been no changes to the interests

Performance review
The eight-year and three-year charts show the Company’s Total Shareholder Return over the period from 31 March 2009 
to 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2014 to 31 March 2017 compared with the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) over 
the same period based on spot values. The Committee has chosen to demonstrate the Company’s performance against 
these indices as it is an appropriate sector comparison within the index in which the Company is listed. This comparator 
group is also used to measure TSR performance in the PSP.

report specified by rules 4.1.5R (2) and 4.1.8R of the 
FCA’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
Research and development
One of the Group’s principal business streams is 
the provision of funded research and development 
(R&D) for customers. The Group also invests in 
the commercialisation of promising technologies 
across all areas of business.
The majority of R&D-related expenditure is incurred 
in respect of specific research contracts placed by 
customers. R&D costs are included within operating 
costs in the income statement and R&D income is 
reflected within revenue. In the financial year, the Group 
recorded £306.4m (2016: £300.8m) of total R&D-related 
expenditure, of which £272.8m (2016: £277.6m) was 
customer-funded work and £33.6m (2016: £23.2m) 
was internally funded. Additionally, £0.4m (2016: £0.4m) 
of late-stage development costs was capitalised 
and £1.3m (2016: £1.2m) of capitalised development 
costs was amortised in the year.
Political donations
QinetiQ does not make political donations to parties 
as that term would be commonly recognised. The legal 
definition of that term is, however, quite broad and may 
have the effect of covering a number of normal business 
activities that would not commonly be perceived to be 
political donations, such as sponsorship of events.
These may include legitimate interactions in making 
MPs and others in the political world aware of key 
industry issues and matters that affect QinetiQ, and that 
make an important contribution to their understanding 
of QinetiQ, the markets in which it operates and the 
work of their constituents.
Branches
The Company and its subsidiaries have established 
branches in a number of different countries in which 
they operate; their results are, however, not material 
to the Group’s financial results.
Share capital
As at 31 March 2017, the Company had allotted and 
fully paid up share capital of 571,757,121 ordinary shares 
of 1p each with an aggregate nominal value of £5.7m 
and one Special Share with a nominal value of £1. The 
ordinary share total includes 4,515,868 shares held 
exclusive of voting rights in treasury and 2,622,180 
shares held by employee share trusts. 
Details of the shares in issue during the financial year 
are shown in note 28 on page 135.
Share buyback activity
The Company announced at the half year in November 
2015 that it intended to carry out a return of capital to 
shareholders of up to £50m over 12 months, consistent 
with the Company’s capital allocation policy, by way 
of an on-market buyback, subject to prevailing equity 
market conditions. This was a continuation of buyback 
activity which began in 2014 when a £150m return of 
capital was carried out between 2014 and 2016. The 
Board considers the buyback process to be a flexible 
distribution method which is simple to execute, easily 
understood by the market and provides shareholders 
with a choice as to whether to participate. During the 
financial year under review, the Company completed 
this buyback.
As a result of the share buyback activity detailed above, 
during the year under review, 19,439,947 ordinary shares 
with a nominal value of 1p each in the capital of the 
Company (representing 3.4% of the issued ordinary 
share capital as at 31 March 2017) were purchased 
at an average price of 243.6 pence per share. Of these 
shares, 4,515,868 shares are held in treasury and the 
remainder have been cancelled.
In the financial year, the impact of the share buyback 
has been to increase basic underlying earnings per 
share from 16.3p to 16.7p, for total shareholder return 
to remain unchanged and for net asset value to 
reduce by £46.7m. In accordance with the Investment 
Association’s guidelines, the effect of the share buyback 
has been neutralised in incentive schemes, such that 
for calculation purposes the number of shares in issue 
is regarded as the same at the end of the three-year 
performance period as at the beginning. Accordingly, 
no benefit has accrued under the incentive schemes 
as a consequence of the share buyback.
Rights of ordinary shareholders
The rights of ordinary shareholders are set out in the

92 Governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Rights of special shareholder
The Special Share is held by HM Government 
through the Secretary of State for Defence (the Special 
Shareholder) and it may only be held by and transferred 
to HM Government. It confers certain rights which are 
set out in the Articles of Association to protect UK 
defence and security interests. These include:
 – the promotion and reinforcement of the MOD 
compliance principles which require QinetiQ to 
be an impartial, ethical and responsible contractor 
by avoiding conflicts of interest in its dealings 
with the MOD;
 – the protection of defined strategic assets of the 
Group, such as certain testing facilities, by providing 
the Special Shareholder with an option to purchase 
those assets in certain circumstances;
 – the right to require certain persons with a material 
interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their 
ordinary shares on the grounds of national security 
or conflict of interest; and
 – nationality of Directors provisions whereby at least 
the Non-executive Chairman or Chief Executive 
Officer must be a British citizen.
The Special Share carries no financial and economic 
value and the Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote 
at a general meeting of the Company. At any time the 
Special Shareholder may require QinetiQ to redeem the 
share at par and, if wound up, the Special Shareholder 
would be entitled to be repaid at its nominal value before 
other shareholders. Any variation of the rights attaching 
to the Special Share requires the written approval of 
the MOD. Further details can be found in note 28 on 
page 135.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
As detailed above, the Special Share confers rights 
under the Company’s Articles of Association to require 
certain persons with an interest in QinetiQ’s shares that 
exceed certain prescribed thresholds to dispose of some 
or all of their ordinary shares on the grounds of national 
security or conflict of interest.

Change of control – significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions 
entitling the counterparties to require prior approval, 
exercise termination, alteration or other similar rights 
in the event of a change of control of the Company, 
or if the company ceases to be a UK company:
 – The Combined Aerial Target Service contract is a 
20-year contract awarded to QinetiQ by the MOD on 
14 December 2006. The terms of this contract require 
QinetiQ Limited to remain a UK company which is 
incorporated under the laws of any part of the UK, 
or an overseas company registered in the UK, and 
that at least 50% of the Board of Directors are UK 
nationals. The terms also contain change of control 
conditions and restricted share transfer conditions 
which require prior approval from HM Government if 
there is a material change in the ownership of QinetiQ 
Limited’s share capital, unless the change relates to 
shares listed on a regulated market – ‘material’ is 
defined as being 10% or more of the share capital. 
In addition, there are restrictions on transfers of 
shares to persons from countries appearing on 
the restricted list as issued by HM Government.
 – The Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) is a 
25-year contract, which QinetiQ Limited signed on 
28 February 2003, to provide test, evaluation and 
training services to the MOD. This contract contains 
conditions under which the prior approval of HM 
Government is required if the contractor, QinetiQ 
Limited, ceases to be a subsidiary of the QinetiQ 
Group, except where such change in control is 
permitted under the shareholders Agreement 
to which the MOD is a party.
 – The company is party to a multi-currency revolving 
credit facility with a US$100m tranche and a £166m 
tranche, provided by a consortium of banks, that 
expires on 29 August 2019. Under the terms of the 
facility, in the event of a change of control of the 
company, any lender may give notice to cancel 
its commitment under the facility and require all 
outstanding amounts to be repaid.
The Directors’ contracts contain no provisions for 
compensation for loss of office on a change of 
control of the company.
Disclosures in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4
There are no matters requiring disclosure under Listing 
Rule 9.8.4. For completeness, details of the waiver 
of dividends by the Employee Benefit Trust have been 
included in the note on Employee Share Schemes on 
page 93 notwithstanding that the waiver is in respect 
of less than 1% of the total value of any dividend. 
Articles of Association
Changes to the Articles must be submitted to 
shareholders for approval. Save in respect of the rights 
attaching to the Special Share, the company has not 
adopted any special rules relating to the appointment 
and replacement of Directors or the amendment of 
the Company’s Articles of Association, other than 
as provided under UK corporate law.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
According to the Articles of Association, all Directors are 
subject to election by shareholders at the first annual 
general meeting following their appointment, and to 
re-election thereafter at intervals of no more than three 
years. In line with best practice reflected in the Code, 
however, the Company requires each serving member 
of the Board to be put forward for election or re-election 
on an annual basis at each Annual General Meeting.
Powers of the Directors: allotment/purchase 
of own shares
At the Company’s Annual General Meeting held in 
July 2016, the shareholders passed resolutions which 
authorised the Directors to allot relevant securities up to 
an aggregate nominal value of £3,910,816 (£1,955,408 
pursuant only to a rights issue), to disapply pre-emption 
rights (up to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital) 
and to purchase ordinary shares (up to 10% of the 
issued ordinary share capital). The authorities will 
remain valid until the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Resolutions in respect of the allotment of relevant 
securities, the disapplication of pre-exemption rights 
and the purchase of own shares will be laid before 
the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Company’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 
Wednesday, 19 July 2017 at 11.00am, at the offices of 
Ashurst LLP, Broadwalk House, 5 Appold Street, London

94 Governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
Annual Report and financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and parent company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and parent company and of their profit or loss 
for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 – make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 – for the Group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the EU;
 – for the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the parent company 
financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group and the parent company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent 
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Strategic report, 
Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate Governance Statement that comply with 
that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosure of information to the auditor
The Directors who held office at the date of approval 
of this Directors’ report have confirmed that, so 
far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the company’s auditor is 
unaware, and the Directors have taken all the steps 
they reasonably should have taken as Directors 
to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report
The Directors in office as at the date of this report 
confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
 – the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the company, and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
 – the management report (which includes the Strategic 
report and the Directors’ report) includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business, 
and the position of the company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.

Opinions and conclusions arising 
from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements 
is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of QinetiQ 
Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2017 set out 
on pages 102 to 146. In our opinion:
 – the financial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the Group’s profit 
for the year then ended;
 – the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European 
Union;
 – the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006; and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements, the risks of material misstatement that 
had the greatest effect on our audit, in decreasing 
order of significance, were are follows:
Recurring risks
Revenue from services – 
£682.4 million (2016: £679.0 million)
Refer to page 61 (Report of Audit Committee), 
page 106 (accounting policy note) and page 112 
(financial disclosures).
The risk:
Subjective estimate
A significant proportion of the Group’s revenues 
and profits derives from long-term contracts. These 
contracts can include complex technological and 
commercial risks and often specify performance 
milestones to be achieved throughout the contract 
period. This results in estimates and assumptions 
having to be made to forecast the margin on each 
contract after making appropriate allowances for these 
technical and commercial risks related to performance 
milestones yet to be achieved. The risk of misstatement 
is that the accounting for the Group’s significant 
contracts does not accurately reflect the status and 
the associated cost to complete of the relevant contract. 
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Control design: Assessing the design and testing the 
operating effectiveness of controls in place to manage 
the financial aspects of the Group’s long-term contracts, 
taking into account commercial and technical risks; 
Personnel reviews: For a sample of significant contracts, 
determined on the basis of technical and commercial 
complexity, financial significance and profitability, we 
obtained an understanding of the status of the contract 
through discussions with contract project teams and 
management at a Group and divisional level, attendance 
at project teams’ contract review meetings and 
examining externally available evidence, such 
as customer correspondence, where relevant; 
Historical comparison and sector experience: 
On a sample basis we examined the assumptions 
behind estimated costs to complete, challenging the 
reasonableness of these in light of supporting evidence 
including past experience of the contracts and the 
extent of technical or commercial risk identified; 
Assessing disclosures: We also assessed the Group’s 
disclosures on revenue, including its accounting policies. 
96 Governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 US Global Products goodwill – 
£43.4 million (2016: £37.9 million)
Refer to page 61 (Report of the Audit Committee), 
page 107 (accounting policy note) and page 121 
(financial disclosures).
The risk:
Forecast based valuation
The carrying value of goodwill associated with the 
US Global Products business was written down to its 
recoverable amount in the year ended 31 March 2016. 
As a result, any deterioration in these projections or an 
increase in the discount rate applied may result in a further 
write down being required. The carrying value of the US 
Global Products goodwill has been reassessed in 2017 
based on the discounted projected cash flows of this 
business, which are inherently uncertain due to the 
variability of future sales and product mix, and selection of 
an appropriate discount rate used for the purposes of the 
impairment calculations. Whilst the projections anticipate 
future growth based on 2017 performance, there remains 
uncertainty around the impact of new revenue streams 
and demand for the current portfolio of products. 
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Assessing methodology: Testing the principles and 
mathematical integrity of the Group’s discounted 
cash flow model; 
Benchmarking assumptions: With the assistance of 
our valuation specialists, we assessed the growth and 
discount rate used in the impairment calculation by 
comparing the Group’s assumptions to external data; 
Our sector experience: Challenging the cash flow 
projections by reviewing the timing of new revenue 
streams and product mix against market conditions 
and the current level of sales;
Sensitivity analysis: Testing the sensitivity of the 
impairment calculation to changes in the underlying 
assumptions;
Assessing disclosures: Assessing whether the Group’s 
disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions 
properly reflected the risks inherent in the valuation 
of goodwill. 
Other payables, provisions and contingent liabilities 
– included within other payables of £157.6 million 
(2016: £163.3 million), provisions of £24.0 million 
(2016: £19.1 million) and contingent liabilities 
of £Nil (2016: £Nil)
Refer to page 61(Report of the Audit Committee), 
page 109 (accounting policy note) and page 127 
(financial disclosures).
The risk:
Subjective estimates
The Group holds provisions in respect of contractual, 
legal and regulatory issues. The Group operates in 
regulated environments and a failure to comply with 
particular regulations could result in fines and/or 
penalties. There is judgement required in determining 
the significance of any instances of potential non-
compliance and potential liability based on 
management’s assessment of the most likely outcome. 
The financial statements should disclose any contingent 
liabilities in respect of contractual, regulatory or legal 
issues which have not been provided for on the basis 
that they are not considered to qualify for recognition 
as provisions. This is one of our key areas of audit focus. 
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Our sector experience: Critical assessment of the extent 
to which the Directors’ estimates take into account a 
balanced assessment of the latest available information 
and the accuracy and reliability of the sources of that 
information; 
Benchmarking assumptions: We corroborated the 
appropriateness of the Directors’ assumptions by 
reference to third party confirmations and legal 
advice, where available; 
Historical comparison and sector experience: We 
considered whether our understanding of the business 
gained throughout the audit process corroborated 
the provisions recorded. We challenged the Directors’ 
estimates of the most likely outcomes based on 
the range of possible outcomes to determine if 
the amounts provided are appropriate; 
Assessing disclosures: We considered the adequacy 
of the Group’s disclosures in respect of other payables, 
provisions and contingent liabilities. 
Tax provisioning – current tax payable £43.7 million 
(2016: £39.9 million), deferred tax asset £5.4 million 
(2015: £4.1 million)
Refer to page 61(Report of the Audit Committee), page 
107 (accounting policy note) and pages 124 and 127 
(financial disclosures).
The risk:
Subjective estimates
The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, USA 
and a number of other overseas jurisdictions. The level 
of current tax and deferred tax recognised requires 
judgements as to the likely outcome of decisions to be 
made by the tax authorities. This includes those related 
to specific tax allowances, such as the UK Research 
and Development tax credit. There is a risk that the 
judgements on which the provisions are based do not 
take into account or do not properly reflect the latest 
available, reliable information or an appropriate 
application of relevant tax legislation, and are either 
under or overstated as a result. 
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Our expertise: Challenging the appropriateness of the 
Directors’ assumptions and estimates in relation to tax 
assets and liabilities, by critically assessing the range of 
possible amounts that may be assessed under tax laws, 
likely settlements based on the latest correspondence 
with the relevant tax authorities and the complexity of 
the relevant tax legislation. We involved our own tax 
specialists in analysing and challenging the assumptions 
used to determine tax provisions based on our 
knowledge and experience of the application of the 
legislation by the relevant authorities and courts.

members of QinetiQ Group plc only continued
Assessing disclosures: Assessing whether the Group’s 
tax disclosures are appropriate and in accordance with 
relevant accounting standards. 
Retirement benefits – surplus £156.0 million 
(2016: deficit £37.7 million)
Refer to page 61(Report of the Audit Committee), 
page 109 (accounting policy note) and page 138 
(financial disclosures).
The risk:
Subjective valuation
Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
retirement obligation included in the net surplus in 
respect of the pension scheme, including mortality, 
price inflation and discount rates. Small changes 
in the assumptions and estimates used to value the 
net pension surplus would have a significant effect 
on the Group’s financial position.
Our response:
Our procedures included:
Benchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the 
support of our own actuarial specialists, the key 
assumptions applied being the discount rate, inflation 
rate and life expectancy assumptions used against 
externally derived data;
Assessing disclosures: Considered the adequacy of 
disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the surplus 
to changes in the key assumptions. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview 
of the scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £5.5 million (2016: £5.2 million), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before 
taxation, normalised to exclude this year’s specific 
adjusting items as disclosed in note 4, of £116.1 million 
(2016: £108.7 million), of which it represents 4.7% (2015: 
4.8%). The Group audit team performed procedures on 
those items excluded from normalised Group profit 
before taxation. 
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected misstatements exceeding £0.275 million 
(2016: £0.250 million), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds. The audit of QinetiQ Limited, the main UK 
trading company, and goodwill arising on consolidation 
accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s 
results: 78% of total Group revenue (2016: 81%); 87% of 
the total profits and losses that made up the Group’s 
underlying profit before taxation (2016: 90%); and 81% 
of total Group assets (2016: 69%). For the remaining 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregate 
Group level to re-examine our assessment that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement 
within these.

98 Governance QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed 
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
 – the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; 
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements; and
 – based solely on the work required to be undertaken 
in the course of the audit of the financial statements 
and from reading the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report: 
 – we have not identified material misstatements 
in those reports; and 
 – in our opinion, those reports have been prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures 
of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to 
in relation to: 
 – the Directors’ confirmation of longer-term viability 
on page 22, concerning the principal risks, their 
management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Group’s 
continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 March 2020; or 
 – the disclosures in note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis 
of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report 
to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 – we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the 
Annual Report and financial statements taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders

1. Significant accounting policies 
Accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Group’s 
financial statements. In the income statement, the Group presents specific adjusting items separately. In the judgement of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a 
proper understanding of the financial information, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately because of their si ze and nature. Underlying measures 
of performance exclude specific adjusting items. 
Specific adjusting items include: 
– amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions; 
– pension net finance expense; 
– gains/losses on business divestments and disposal of property and investments; 
– transaction costs in respect of business acquisitions; 
– impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; 
– the tax impact of the above; and 
– other significant non-recurring deferred tax movements. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s financial statements, approved by the Directors, have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in th e Directors’ Report on page 58 and 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRS’) and the Companies Act 2006 appli cable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on page 144. The 
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and other relevant 
financial assets and liabilities. Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The Group’s reportin g 
currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest £100,000. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2017. The purchase method 
of accounting has been adopted. Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
date control is obtained to the date that control is lost (usually on acquisition and disposal respectively). An investor con trols an investee when it is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its po wer over the investee. This is the IFRS 10 
definition of ‘control’. 
The Group comprises certain entities that are operated under the management of a Proxy Board. Details of the Proxy Board arrangements and the powers of the 
proxy holders and QinetiQ management are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report. IFRS 10 is the ac counting standard now applicable 
in respect of consolidation of entities. This does not specifically deal with proxy situations. However, having considered the terms of the Proxy agreement, the 
Directors consider that the Group meets the requirements of IFRS 10 in respect of control over such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities 
in the consolidated accounts. 
An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from 20%–50% of the equity voting rights, in respect of financial and 
operating policy. A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control. Associates and joint ventur es are accounted for using the equity 
method from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal. The Group’s investments in associates and joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on 
acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment to the recoverable amount. Wh ere an 
associate or joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Group’s share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide 
additional funding to the associate or joint venture.  
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies. 
On consolidation, all intra-Group income, expenses and balances are eliminated.  
Revenue 
Revenue represents the value of work performed for customers, and is measured net of value added taxes and other sales taxes on the following bases: 
Service contracts 
The Group’s service contract arrangements are accounted for under IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ taking into account each party’s enforceable rights regarding the services 
provided and expected manner of settlement. When the outcome of a contract involving the rendering of services can be reliably estimated, revenue associated 
with the transaction is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting period and reflecting the probable 
economic benefits that will flow to the entity. This is normally measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared with 
the estimated total contract costs after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved. No p rofit 
is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. When it is probable that total contra ct costs will exceed total contract 
revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense. The Group generally does not undertake construction contr acts. 
  
Notes to the financial statements 
106 Financial statements QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 www.qinetiq.com QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements 107 
Goods sold 
Sales of goods are recognised in the income statement on delivery of the product or when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the customer and revenue and costs can be reliably measured.  
Royalties and intellectual property  
Royalty revenue is recognised over the period to which the royalty relates. Intellectual property revenue can be attributed e ither to perpetual licences or to limited 
licences. Limited licences are granted for a specified period and revenue is recognised over the period of the licence. Perpetual licences are granted for unlimited 
time frames and revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. 
Segmental information 
Segmental information is presented according to the Group’s internal management reporting structure and the markets in which it operates. Segmental results 
represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group. Corporate expenses are allocated to the corr esponding segments. Unallocated 
items mainly comprise specific adjusting items. Specific adjusting items are referred to in note 4.  
Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. 
Research and development expenditure 
R&D costs incurred in respect of specific contracts placed by customers are recognised within operating costs and revenue is recognised in respect of the R&D 
services performed. Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are 
separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete 
the project. Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development. All other R&D costs are expensed to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished f rom the development phase, the respective project-related 
costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed. 
Financing 
Financing represents the financial expense on borrowings accounted for using the effective rate method a nd the financial income earned on funds invested. 
Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement 
are included within finance income and finance expense. Financing also includes the net finance expense in respect of defined benefit pension schemes. 
Taxation 
The taxation charge is based on the taxable profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of 
certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited to the income statem ent, except where they relate to items 
charged or credited to equity, in which case the relevant tax is charged or credited to equity. Deferred taxation is the tax attributable to the temporary differences 
that appear when taxation authorities recognise and measure assets and liabilities with rules that differ from those of the c onsolidated financial statements. The 
amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Any changes in the tax rates are recognised in the income statement unless related to items directly recognised in equity. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised 
on all taxable temporary differences excluding non-deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised on all deductible temporary differences provided that 
it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle balances on a net basis. 
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations and cash flows of which can be clearly distin guished from the rest of the Group 
and which: 
– represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; 
– is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or 
– is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale. 
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be class ified as held for sale. When 
an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income is re-presented as 
if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.  
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in the carrying value 
of equity accounted investments. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment l osses. Gains and losses on the 
disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected usefu l lives, typically between one 
and sixteen years. Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.  
The ‘multi-period excess earnings’ method and the ‘relief-from-royalty’ method are both used for fair valuing intangible assets arising from acquisitions. The multi-
period excess earnings method considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows 
related to contributory assets. The relief-from-royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result 
of the patents or trademarks being owned. 
Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation. Intangible assets are amortised over their respective u seful lives on a straight-line basis 
as follows: 
Intellectual property rights 2–8 years 
Customer relationships 1–16 years 
Development costs 1–4 years 
Other 1–9 years 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible non -current assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows: 
Freehold buildings 20–25 years 
Leasehold land and buildings  Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease 
Plant and machinery 3–10 years 
Fixtures and fittings 5–10 years 
Computers 3–5 years 
Motor vehicles 3–5 years 
Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance s heet date. In the case of assets 
constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and intere st. 
The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly. 
Impairment of goodwill and tangible, intangible and held for sale assets 
At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If the carrying amoun t of any asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective 
of any indication of impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash-generating unit (CGU) are 
written down to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less cos ts to sell and its value in use. The value 
in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU calculated using an appropriate pre -tax discount rate. Impairment 
losses are expensed to the income statement. 
Investments in debt and equity securities 
Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non- current asset and those classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, 
with any resultant gain or loss, other than impairment losses, being recognised directly in equity. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. 
The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date. The fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price 
of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows. 
Inventories 
Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production 
cost. Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. A provision is established when the net realisable 
value of any inventory item is lower than its cost. A ‘market comparison’ technique is used to fair value inventories acquired through a business combination. The 
fair value is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable 
profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories. 
Bid costs 
Costs incurred in bidding for work are normally expensed as incurred. In the case of large multi-year government contracts the bidding process typically involves a 
competitive bid process to determine a preferred bidder and then a further period to reach financial close with the customer. In these cases, the costs incurred after 
announcement of the Group achieving preferred bidder status are deferred to the balance sheet within work-in-progress. From the point financial close is reached, 
the costs are amortised over the life of the contract. If an opportunity for which the Group was aw arded preferred bidder status fails to reach financial close, the 
costs deferred to that point are expensed in the income statement immediately, when it becomes likely that financial close wi ll not be achieved. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated net of provisions for doubtful debts. Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables 
and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced. Payments received on account are included in trade and other payables and represent 
amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised. Other receivables will also include insurance recoveries where we are virtu ally certain of recovery.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily convertible into cash. In the cash flow statement overdraft balances 
are included in cash and equivalents. 
Current and non-current liabilities 
Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group. Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are initially recognised at 
fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in th e income statement over the period 
of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated 
liability presented in the balance sheet. Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the 
effective interest rate method. If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated. 
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably 
estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the oblig ation. Where appropriate, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate reflecting the level of risk and the time value of money. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. The de-recognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial 
instrument, when the instrument expires, or when the instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. 
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quote d instruments or valuation based 
on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments. 
Fair value hedging 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges of currency risk or interest rate risk are recognise d in the income statement. The hedged 
item is held at fair value with respect to the hedged risk with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement. 
Cash flow hedging 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. The ineffective portion 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses p reviously recognised in equity are 
included in the cost of the asset or liability. Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement a t the same 
time as the hedged transaction. 
Leased assets 
Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are held by the lessee. Assets held under finance leases are 
capitalised and included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments and fai r value at the inception of the lease. 
Assets are then depreciated over the shorter of their useful economic lives or the lease term. Obligations relating to finance lease s, net of finance charges arising 
in future periods, are included under financial liabilities.  
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary as sets and liabilities in foreign currencies 
are translated at period-end rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement. Gains and losses on designated forward forei gn exchange 
hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction. 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, 
associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. The results 
and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to sterling using the average rates of exchange during the 
period. Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly 
to equity and reported in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations 
are determined using the projected unit credit method. Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out bi-annually. Actuarial advice is provided by external 
consultants. For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present va lue of the defined benefit obligation 
are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively. 
For defined benefit plans, the cost charged to the income statement consists of administrative expenses and the net interest cost. There is no service cost due 
to the fact the plans are closed to future accrual. The finance element of the pension charge is shown in finance expense and the administration cost element is 
charged as a component of operating costs in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses and re-measurement gains and losses are recognised immediately 
in full through the statement of comprehensive income. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees. The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant 
and expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. The fair value of cash -settled awards for share-based payments 
is determined each period end until they are exercised or lapse. The value is expensed straight line over the period from grant to the date of earlie st unconditional 
exercise. The charges for both equity and cash-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
Share capital 
Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received, less issue costs. Company shares held by the empl oyee benefit trusts are held at 
the consideration paid. They are classified as own shares within equity. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity. 
Recent accounting developments 
Developments adopted by the Group in 2017 with no material impact on the financial statements 
The following UK GAAP and EU-endorsed Standards and amendments, improvements and interpretations of published standards are effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and have been adopted with no material impact on the Group’s financial statements:  
– IFRS 11 Joint arrangements – amendment to add guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business. 
– IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – amendments that change the financial reporting for bearer plants such as grape vines and rubber trees. Bearer plants 
should now be accounted for in the same way as property, plant and equipment. The produce growing on bearer plants will remai n within the scope of IAS 41. 
– IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38 Intangible assets – clarification of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation. 
– IAS 27(R) Separate financial statements – amendment allowing entities to use the equity method to account for investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures 
and associates in their separate financial statements. 
– IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – amendment to improve presentation and disclosure in financial reports.  
– IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and joint ventures – amendments to both applying the consolidation 
exemption and also on the sale or contribution of assets (note not yet endorsed for use in the EU). 
Annual improvement 2012-2014 cycle: 
– IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations – amendment regarding methods of disposal. 
– IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures – amendment regarding servicing contracts and the transfer of financial assets to a third party under conditions 
which allow the transferor to derecognise the asset but retain continuing involvement in them. A second amendment clarifies that some interim disclosures 
in IFRS 7 are not required. 
– IAS 19 Employee benefits – amendments regarding discount rates; when determining the discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations, 
it is the currency that the liabilities are denominated in that is important and not the country where they arise. 
– IAS 34 Interim financial reporting – amendment requiring ‘information disclosed elsewhere in the interim financial report’ to be cross-referenced from 
the interim financial statement to the location of that information. 
Developments expected in future periods of which the impact is being assessed 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The final Standard was published in May 2014 and the IASB has taken the decision to defer the effective 
date of IFRS 15 to 1 January 2018 i.e. FY19 for QinetiQ. The new Standard introduces a five -step model to the principle of revenue recognition. The framework 
includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the 
transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognising revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 
QinetiQ is currently undertaking an assessment of the impact of the new standard on its financial statements when adopted. At the current time it is not possible 
to quantify the impact on revenue. Potential impacts being considered on a contract-by-contract basis include whether the current methodology for recognising 
revenue over time remains appropriate, the treatment of contract modifications, variable consideration, determination and dis tinction of performance obligations, 
determination of agency and principal relationships and licences. QinetiQ observes that where services provided by QinetiQ are substantially the same over the life 
of the contract, QinetiQ will apply the series guidance stated in IFRS 15. This is not expected to affect the overall amount of revenue recognised under a contract 
but it may affect the phasing.  
The Group’s on-going IFRS 15 project includes development of new internal revenue recognition accounting policies and guidance and further training across 
the Group in order to apply the requirements of IFRS 15 to all QinetiQ contracts and further work is being under taken to quantify the impact of the transition 
to this new standard with effect from 2019. 
QinetiQ is also undertaking an analysis of the transitional guidance which allows for two different approaches; the retrospective method (with optional practical 
expedients) or the cumulative effect method. Under the retrospective method, QinetiQ would need to restate prior year compara tives and recognise the cumulative 
effect of applying the new standard in equity at the start of the earliest presented comparative period. Under the cumulative method, QinetiQ would apply the new 
standard as of the date of initial application, with no restatement of comparative period amounts. It would record the cumulative effect of initially applying the new 
standard – which would affect revenue and costs – as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the date of initial application. Under the cumulative effect 
method, the provisions of the new standard apply only to contracts that are open (i.e. not complete) under previous GAAP at t he date of initial application. QinetiQ 
acknowledge that the disclosure requirements under IFRS 15 are more prescriptive and extensive than under current GAAP.

Leases: The final Standard IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ was published in January 2016. Under the new Standard, companies will recognise new ass ets and liabilities, bringing 
added transparency to the balance sheet. IFRS 16 eliminates the current dual accounting model for lessees, which distinguishes between on-balance sheet finance 
leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. Instead, there is a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is similar to current finance lease accounting. 
Lessor accounting remains similar to current practice – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance and operating leases. The Standard will be effective 
from 1 January 2019 for QinetiQ subject to EU endorsement. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – This new Standard on accounting for financial instruments will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement. The Standard will be effective from 1 January 2018. 
Developments expected in future periods with no material impac t on the Group’s financial statements 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following new, revised, amended and improved published standards and interpretations, which were in issue  
at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, will have no material impact on the financial statements of the G roup when they become applicable 
in future periods: 
– Amendments to IFRS 2, 4, 9 and 15; 
– Amendments to IAS 7, 12 and 40.  
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies 
The following commentary is intended to highlight those policies that are critical to the business based on the level of mana gement judgement required in their 
application, their complexity and their potential impact on the results and financial position reported for the Group. The level of management judgment required 
includes assumptions and estimates about future events that are uncertain and the actual outcome of which may result in a materially different outcome from  
that anticipated. 
Revenue and profit recognition 
The estimation process required to evaluate the potential outcome of contracts and projects requires skill, knowledge and experience from a variety of sources 
within the business to assess the status of the contract, costs to complete, internal and external labour resources required and other fa ctors. This process is carried 
out continuously throughout the business to ensure that project and contract assessments reflect the latest status of such work. No profit is recognised on a 
contract until the outcome can be reliably estimated. 
Business combinations and related goodwill 
Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful 
economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants. Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that 
are different from actual future outcomes.  
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment. This process relies on the use of estimates of the future profit ability and cash flows of its 
CGUs which may differ from the actual results delivered. In addition, the Group reviews whether identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment. Further 
details on the sensitivity of the carrying value of goodwill to changes in the key assumptions are set out in note 13. 
Tax 
In determining the Group’s provisions for current tax and deferred tax, it is necessary to assess the likelihood and timing of recovery of tax losses created, and to 
consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To th e extent that the final outcome differs 
from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to current tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.  
Other payables, provisions and contingent liabilities 
The Group holds liabilities in respect of environmental and regulatory issues (see note 23). The Group operates in regulated environments and a failure to comply 
with particular regulations could result in fines and/or penalties. There is judgement required in determining the significance of any instances of potential non-
compliance and potential liability based on management’s assessment of the most likely outcome. The financial statements also disclose contingent liabilities 
in respect of legal claims and regulatory issues which have not been provided for on the basis that they are not considered to qualify for recognition as provisions. 
Judgement is required in these assessments. 
Post-retirement benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and inflation. 
Management exercises its best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate 
to the Group. Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the net 
surplus/deficit. Further details of these assumptions are set out in note 30.

QinetiQ Target Systems (formerly Meggitt Target Systems) 
On 21 December 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Meggitt Target Systems for £60.3m. The company is a provider of unmanned aerial, 
naval and land-based target systems and services for test and evaluation (‘T&E’) and operational training and rehearsal. On the date of acquisition, the company 
changed its name to QinetiQ Target Systems and integrated into QinetiQ’s international business. 
QinetiQ Target Systems provides target systems to approximately 40 countries with operations in Alberta, Canada and Kent, UK. The acquisition of this company 
enhances QinetiQ’s product portfolio, market position and ability to deliver global test and evaluation services. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of 
the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been £806.3m and the Group profit before tax would have been £136.6m. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and the adjustments required to 
the book values of the assets and liabilities in order to present the net assets of these businesses at fair value and in accordance with Group accounting policies. 
The fair values remain provisional, but will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.

The fair value adjustments include £24.2m in relation to the recognition of acquired intangible assets of which £17.4m relates to customer relationships 
and £6.8m relates to intellectual property. The goodwill is attributable mainly to the skills and technical talent of QinetiQ Target Systems’ workforce and the 
synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the companies into the Group’s existing business.

RubiKon Group Pty Limited  
On 31 January 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of RubiKon Group Pty Limited from its founder management team for £7.4m 
(AUD$12.6m). The company provides solutions to complex logistics, supply chain management and procurement projects in defence, aerospace, mining 
and government markets. RubiKon is now subsumed into the Australia business. 
RubiKon’s integrated logistics support services are complementary to the technical engineering advice and services that the Group provide. The acquisition 
is also expected to provide the Group with an increased share of ‘strategic partner’ style contracts in the growing Australian markets through access to 
RubiKon’s customer base. If the acquisition had occurred on the first day of the financial year, Group revenue for the period would have been £790.5m 
and the Group profit before tax would have been £132.5m. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
The following table summarises the recognised amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and the adjustments required to the 
book values of the assets and liabilities in order to present the net assets of the business at fair value and in accordance with Group accounting p olicies. The fair 
values remain provisional, but will be finalised within 12 months of acquisition.

* Details of specific adjusting items can be found in note 4. 
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of £141.7m (2016: £154.8m) which are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £3.7m 
has been recognised in the year, with the income statement credit classified as a specific adjusting item. This asset is in respect of £18.8m of UK losses and £1.4m 
of Canadian losses. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the remaining £121.5m of losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation. 
The Group has £66.5m of time limited losses of which US capital losses of £30.0m will expire in 2020. The remaining £36.5m of losses are time limited with £4.4m 
expiring in 2034, £22.7m in 2035 and £9.4m in 2036. A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 
1 April 2020) had previously been substantively enacted on 26 October 2015, and an additional reduction to 17% (effective 1 A pril 2020) was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Company's future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2017 have been 
calculated based on these rates. 
 
Factors affecting future tax charges 
The effective tax rate continues to be below the UK statutory rate, primarily as a result of the benefit of research and development expenditure credits in the UK. 
The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to the impact of any tax legislation changes, the geographic 
mix of profits and the assumption that the benefits of net R&D expenditure credits retained by the Group remain in the tax line. Future recognition of unrecognised 
tax losses will also affect future tax charges.

12. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average num ber of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares (see note 28). For diluted earnings per 
share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary sh ares arising from unvested share-based 
awards including share options.

Goodwill as at 31 March 2017 was allocated across two cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) within the EMEA Services segment and two CGUs within the Global 
Products segment.  
QinetiQ Target Systems Limited was acquired during the year (on 21 December 2016) and the goodwill arising of £24.5m was allocated to the existing UK Global 
Products CGU. The Group acquired RubiKon Group Pty Limited on 31 January 2017 and the goodwill arising of AUD $6.7m (£3.9m) was allocated to the existing 
Australia CGU. 
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected syne rgies, future growth prospects and 
employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances. The Group tests each CGU for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired. Impairment testing is dependent on management’s estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, 
the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates. Significant headroom exists in all CGUs with the exception of US Global Products (see below) and 
management considers that there are no likely variations in the key assumptions which would lead to an impairment being recognised in any of the other CGUs. 
Key assumptions 
Cash flows  
The value-in-use calculations generally use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two-year period. Discounted 
cash flows for the US Global Products CGU were based on a Board-approved three-year plan, reflecting increases in revenue from new product lines. Cash flows 
for periods beyond these periods are extrapolated based on the last year of the plans, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied.  
Terminal growth rates  
The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0% – 2.4% (2016: 2.0% – 2.4%). The US terminal growth rate 
was 2.0% (2016: 2.4%). Growth rates are based on management’s estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs 
operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term. 
Discount rates 
The Group’s weighted average cost of capital was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied , adjusted for risks specific to the market 
characteristics of CGUs, as appropriate on a pre-tax basis. This is considered to appropriately estimate a market participant discount rate. The pre-tax discount 
rates applied for the two EMEA Services CGUs were 10.9% and 16.1%, for the UK Global Products CGU was 10.8% and for the US Global Products CGU was 11.2%.  
Sensitivity analysis shows that the value of the terminal year cash flow, the discount rate and the terminal growth rates have a significant impact on the value of 
the discounted cash flow. 
Significant CGUs  
US Global Products 
The carrying value of the goodwill for the US Global Products CGU, which had been written down in the prior year, was £43.4m as at 31 March 2017 (2016: 
£37.9m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2017, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is marginally higher 
than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £49.5m) and no further impairment is required in the year to 31 March 2017. The key sensitivity impacting on the 
value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. These cash flows include certain assumptions about revenue and profit in respect of new product lines still 
to be launched and the success of winning certain government contracts. An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would 
not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. However, a reduction of £1.5m in the terminal year cash flows would lead to the recoverable 
amount no longer exceeding the carrying value. Any additional reduction in terminal year cash flows would result in an impairment of the goodwill of this CGU.  
Other CGUs 
The UK Global Products CGU and the two individual CGUs within EMEA Services all have significant headroom. An increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the 
terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. The carrying value of goodwill for the UK Global Products 
CGU as at 31 March 2017 was £30.3m (2016: £5.5m). The carrying values of goodwill for the two EMEA Services CGUs as at 31 March 2017 were £27.5m and 
£6.6m (2016: £27.5m and £2.2m). The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions between 31 March 2017 and the 
signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Deferred tax has been calculated using the enacted future statutory tax rates.  
At 31 March 2017, the Group had unused tax losses of £141.7m (2016: £154.8m) which are available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset of £3.7m 
has been recognised in the year, with the income statement credit classified as a specific adjusting item. This asset is in respect of £18.8m of UK losses and £1.4m 
of Canadian losses. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the remaining £121.5m of losses due to uncertainty over the timing of their utilisation. The 
Group has £66.5m of time limited losses of which US capital losses of £30.0m will expire in 2020. The remaining £36.5m of losses are time limited with £4.4m 
expiring in 2034, £22.7m in 2035 and £9.4m in 2036.

In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was granted 
to the reporting date. Credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US government agencies. Accordingly, the Directors 
believe that no credit provision in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts is required. As at 31 March 201 7 the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts 
of £2.0m (2016: £4.1m).

The current tax liability includes taxes due in the US following a court decision in respect of the tax treatment of the Group’s acquisition of Dominion Technology 
Resources, Inc. in 2008. An insurance policy was taken out by the Group at the point of acquisition and, if the court’s decision is final, then the funds required to 
settle this dispute will be provided by the insurers. Hence, an offsetting receivable is reported on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 (included within trade 
and other receivables).

Property provisions relate to under-utilised properties in the UK. The extent of the provision is affected by the timing of when properties can be sub-let and 
the proportion of space that can be sub-let. Based on current assessment the provision will be utilised within 10 years. 
Other provisions relate to environmental and other liabilities, the magnitude and timing of utilisation of which are determined by a variety of factors.

26. Financial risk management 
The Group’s international operations expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks 
and liquidity risks.  
Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.  
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives. Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with 
risk management policies. There have been no changes in any risk management policies since the year end.  
A) Fair values of financial instruments  
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been def ined as follows:  
Level 1 – measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level 2 – measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 2 derivatives comprise forward foreign exchange contracts which have been fair valued using forward exchange 
rates that are quoted in an active market; and  
Level 3 – measured using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).  
The following table presents the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2017 :

For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial i nstruments approximate to their 
carrying value as a result of the short maturity periods of these financial instruments. For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying 
value for credit risk. For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available. Where market values are not available, the fair values 
have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year end rates, except for 
unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value. There have been no transfers between levels.

B) Interest rate risk 
The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest costs and to reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group’s current policy is to require 
rates to be fixed for 30%–80% of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings. Where there are significant changes in the level 
and/or structure of debt, policy permits borrowings to be 100% fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage. At 31 March 2017 
and 31 March 2016 the Group had no borrowings.

Floating-rate financial assets attract interest based on the relevant national LIBID equivalent. Floating-rate financial liabilities bear interest at the relevant national 
LIBOR equivalent. Trade and other receivables/payables and deferred finance costs are excluded from this analysis.  
Interest rate risk management 
The revolving credit facility is floating-rate and undrawn as at 31 March 2017.  
C) Currency risk 
Transactional currency exposure 
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency. It is Group policy 
that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange cont racts. Hedge accounting 
documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Group’s transactional hedge contracts. 
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the 
income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating 
company involved.

31 March 2016 – sterling 5.8 1.7 0.2 0.6 8.3 
      
The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency ex posures.  
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchase s denominated in foreign currencies, 
as the transaction occurs. The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2017 against sterling are net US dollars 
bought of £29.1m (US$37.7m), net Euros bought of £7.1m (€7.4m), net Swiss Francs bought of £24.7m (CHF 30.6m) and net Swedish Krona bought of £10.0m 
(SEK 113.6m) 
Translational currency exposure 
The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US. As a result, the sterling value of the Group’s balance sheet can be affected 
by movement in exchange rates. The Group does not hedge against translational currency exposure to overseas net assets.

26. Financial risk management continued 
D) Financial credit risk  
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any 
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by a Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade 
long-term credit rating for cash deposits. In the normal course of business the Group operates notional cash pooling systems, wher e a legal right of set-off applies. 
The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, 
totals £223.9m (2016: £275.9m). The Group held cash and cash equivalents of £211.8m at 31 March 2017 (2016: £263.5m), which represents the maximum 
credit exposure on these assets. The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rat ed single A or better, although £122.9m 
(2016: £145.1m) was invested in AAA-rated money funds at the year end and nil (2016: £40m) was invested in deposits collateralised by security, where the 
security was UK gilts. 
E) Liquidity risk 
Borrowing facilities 
As at 31 March 2017 the Group had a revolving credit facility (RCF) of US$100m and £166m (2016: US$100m and £166m). The RCF is contracted until 2019 
and is un-utilised as shown in the table below:

H) Sensitivity analysis 
The Group’s sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2017 is set out in the following 
table. The impact of a weakening in sterling on the Group’s financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the 
Group’s overseas net assets and earnings respectively. Sensitivity on the Group’s assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.

 This relates to the impact on items charged directly to equity and excludes the impact on profit/loss for the year flowing into equity. 
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur. Actual results in the 
future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in global financial markets that may cause fluc tuations in interest and exchange rates 
to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the previous tables, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses. 
The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of 1% (100 basis points) in the specific rate of interest 
applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2017, with all other variables remaining constant. The estimated changes 
for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies from the levels ap plicable at 
31 March 2017, with all other variables remaining constant. Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only – in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.  
The impact of transactional risk on the Group’s monetary assets/liabilities that are not held in the functional currency of t he entity holding those assets/liabilities 
is minimal. A 10% weakening in sterling would also result in a minimal increase in profit before tax.

Rights attaching to the Special Share 
QinetiQ carries out activities which are important to UK defence and security interests. To protect these interests in the context of the ongoing commercial 
relationship between the MOD and QinetiQ, and to promote and reinforce the Compliance Principles, the MOD holds a Special Sha re in QinetiQ. QinetiQ obtained 
MOD consent to changes in its Special Shareholder rights, which were approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The changes to the Special Shar e were 
disclosed in the 2012 Annual Report. Subsequent to the changes approved at the 2012 AGM the Special Share confers certain ri ghts on the holder: 
a) to require the Group to implement and maintain the Compliance System (as defined in the Articles of Association) so as to mak e at all times effective 
its and each member of QinetiQ Controlled Group’s application of the Compliance Principles, in a manner acceptable to the Special Shareholder; 
b) to refer matters to the Board for its consideration in relation to the application of the Compliance Principles; 
c) to require the Board to obtain Special Shareholder’s consent: 
i) if at any time when the chairman is not a British Citizen, it is proposed to appoint any person to the office of chief executive, who i s not a British 
Citizen; and 
ii) if at any time when the chief executive is not a British Citizen, it is proposed to appoint any person to the office of chairman, who is not a British Citizen; 
d) to require the Board to take action to rectify any omission in the application of the Compliance Principles, if the Special S hareholder is of the opinion that such 
steps are necessary to protect the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom; and 
e) to demand a poll at any of QinetiQ’s meetings (even though it may have no voting rights except those specifically set out in the Articles). 
The Special Shareholder has an option to purchase defined Strategic Assets of the Group in certain circumstances. The Special Shareholder has, inter alia, the right 
to purchase any Strategic Assets which the Group wishes to sell. Strategic Assets are normally testing and research facilitie s (see note 31 for further details). 
The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to HM Government (or as it directs). At any time the Special Shareholder may require QinetiQ to 
redeem the Special Share at par. If QinetiQ is wound up the Special Shareholder will be entitled to be repaid the capital paid up on the Special Share before other 
shareholders receive any payment. The Special Shareholder has no other right to share in the capital or profits of QinetiQ. 
The Special Shareholder must give consent to a general meeting held on short notice. 
The Special Share entitles the Special Shareholder to require certain persons who hold (together with any person acting in co ncert with them) a material interest 
in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their ordinary shares in certain prescribed circumstances on the grounds of national security or conflict of interest. 
The Directors must register any transfer of the Special Share within seven days. 
Other reserves 
The translation reserve includes the cumulative foreign exchange difference arising on translation since the Group transitioned to IFRS. Movements on hedge 
instruments, where the hedge is effective, are recorded in the hedge reserve until the hedge ceases. 
The capital redemption reserve, which was created following the redemption of preference share capital and the bonus issue of shares, cannot be distributed. 
Own shares 
Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by independent trusts and include treasury shares and shares held by the employee share ownership 
plan. Included in retained earnings at 31 March 2017 are 8,957,048 shares (2016: 4,862,182 shares).

29. Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans for employees. The total share-based payment expense in the year was £3.3m, of which £3.3m related 
to equity-settled schemes and nil related to cash-settled schemes (year to 31 March 2016: £4.7m, of which £4.7m related to equity-settled schemes and nil to cash-
settled schemes). The share-based payment charged to equity is £2.1m consisting of the £3.3m charge to the income statement and a £1.2m cash payment 
relating to the Bonus Banking Plan. 
Performance Share Plan (PSP)

PSP awards are equity-settled awards and those outstanding at 31 March 2017 had an average remaining life of 1.4 years (2016: 1.4 years). There is no exercise 
price for these PSP awards. Monte Carlo modelling was used to fair value the TSR element of the awards at grant date. Assumpt ions used in the models included 
23% (2016: 22%) for the average share price volatility of the FTSE comparator group and 57% (2016: 53%) for the average correlation to the comparator group. The 
weighted average fair value of grants made during the year was £1.72 (2016: £1.79). The weighted average share price at date of exercise was £2.68 (2016: £2.51). 
Of the options outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable (2016: nil). 
Restricted Stock Units (RSU)  
In prior years the Group granted RSU awards to certain senior US employees under the RSU plan. The awards vest over one, two, three and four years. Of the 2014 
awards, and the awards granted before 2012, half are dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets and half on a time-based criterion. The time-based 
criterion requires the employee to have been in continual service up to the date of vesting. QNA organic profit growth is measured over the most recent financial 
year compared with the previous financial year, with 125% of this element awarded at a QNA organic profit growth rate above 1 5%, 100% awarded at 12.5%, 75% 
awarded at 10% and 25% awarded at 5%. The 2012 grants are entirely dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets. 67.5% of the 2013 grants are 
dependent on achieving QNA organic profit growth targets and 32.5% are dependent on a time-based criterion.

30. Post-retirement benefits 
Defined contribution plans 
In the UK the Group operates two defined contribution plans for the majority of its UK employees: a Group Personal Pension Plan (GPP) and a defined contribution 
section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme. These are both defined contribution schemes managed by Zurich. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which 
the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third-party financial provider. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are 
recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent t hat a cash refund or a reduction 
in the future payments is available.  
Defined benefit pension plans 
In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’) for a significant proportion of its UK employees . The Scheme closed to future accrual on 
31 October 2013. After this date, defined benefit members transferred to a defined contribution scheme. The Scheme is a final salary plan, which provides benefits 
to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on the members’ length of service and their final 
pensionable earnings at closure to future accrual. In the Scheme, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The 
benefit payments are made from Trustee-administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by UK regulations as is the nature of the relationship between 
the Group and the Trustees and their composition. Responsibility for the governance of the Scheme – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – 
lies jointly with the Company and the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Com pany and plan participants in 
accordance with the Scheme’s regulations.  
The asset/liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end o f the 
reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated bi -annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the 
related pension obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise.  
The Group has no further payment obligations once the agreed contributions have been paid. The expected employer cash contribution to the Scheme for the 
year ending 31 March 2018 is £13.0m.  
Triennial funding valuation 
The most recent completed full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2014 and resulted in an actuarially assessed surplus of £31.0m. 
The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2017. 
The agreed recovery plan requires £13.0m contributions per annum until 31 March 2018, the same annual funding level as previously in place. This includes 
£2.5m p.a. distributions to the Scheme, indexed by reference to CPI, from the Group’s Pension Funding Partnership. 
QinetiQ’s Pension Funding Partnership structure 
Following the 30 June 2011 valuation, a package of pension changes was agreed with the Trustees to provide stability to the Scheme. As part of the package of 
proposals, on 26 March 2012 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership (the ‘Partnership’) with the Scheme. Under this arrangement, properties 
to the capitalised value of £32.3m were transferred to the Partnership. The transfers were affected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement. The Scheme’s 
interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately £2.5m for 20 years, indexed with reference to CPI. These contributions replaced 
part of the regular contributions made under the past deficit recovery payments plan. The Scheme’s interest in the Partnership will revert back to QinetiQ 
Limited in 2032. 
The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group. Under IAS 19, the interest held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not 
qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and is, therefore, not included within the fair value of plan assets. As a 
result, the Group’s consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership. In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and 
leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet. QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership 
and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses. 
Other UK schemes  
In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme. The net pension deficits of this 
scheme at 31 March 2017 amounted to £nil (2016: £nil). QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company 
contributions are paid to this arrangement.

The Scheme’s assets do not include any of the Group’s own transferable financial instruments, property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group. 
 
* The Scheme has assets invested in a Liability Driven Investment portfolio. As at 31 March 2017 this hedges against 63% of the interest rate and 100% of the inflation rate risk, 
as measured on the Trustees’ gilt-funding basis. The increase in the year of £605.4m is split between performance of the LDI funds, with valuation gains of £355.2m, and asset 
reallocations of £250.2m, with £179.8m switched out of equities and £70.4m out of alternative bonds. 
** Includes allocations to high-yield bonds, secured loans and emerging market debt. 
Per the Scheme rules, the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus that may arise on cessation of the Scheme in the context of IFRIC14 
paragraphs 11(b) and 12 and therefore the full net pension asset can be recognised on the Group’s balance sheet and the Group’s minimum fun ding commitments 
to the Scheme do not give rise to an additional balance sheet liability.

Assumptions 
The major assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the Scheme were: 
 2017 2016 
Discount rate applied to Scheme liabilities 2.60% 3.40% 
CPI inflation assumption 2.35% 2.10% 
Assumed life expectancies in years:   
Future male pensioners (currently aged 60) 89 89 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 60) 91 91 
Future male pensioners (currently aged 40) 91 91 
Future female pensioners (currently aged 40) 93 93 
   
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, becau se of the timescale covered, may 
not necessarily be borne out in practice. It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are 
measured by external market indicators. The mortality assumptions as at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 were 90% of S2PMA for males and 90% of S2PFA 
for females, based on year of birth making allowance for improvements in mortality in line with CMI_2013 Core Projections and a long -term rate of improvement 
of 1.5% per annum.  
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors. The calculation of the surplus or 
deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group – principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares (and other assets) 
in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities. The funding of the Scheme is based on long -term trends 
and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors. 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 20 years. 
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation 
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to s ignificant actuarial assumptions 
the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. 
The methods and types of assumption did not change.  
Risks 
Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below: 
Volatility in market 
conditions 
Results under IAS 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions. The defined benefit obligation is linked to 
yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, while many of the assets of the Scheme are invested in other assets. Changing markets in 
conjunction with discount rate volatility will lead to volatility in the net pension liability on the Group’s balance sheet and in other 
comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the IAS 19 pension finance expense in the Group’s 
income statement. 
Choice of accounting 
assumptions 
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) involves projecting future cash flows from the Scheme many years into the 
future. This means that the assumptions used can have a material impact on the balance sheet position and profit and loss charge. 
In practice future experience within the Scheme may not be in line with the assumptions adopted. For example, members could live 
longer than foreseen or inflation could be higher or lower than allowed for in the DBO calculation. 
The accounting assumptions noted above are used to calculate the year end net pension asset/liability in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 
(revised) ‘Employee benefits’. Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Group’s cash payments into the Scheme. The payments into the Scheme are 
reassessed after every triennial valuation. The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2017. 
The triennial valuations are calculated on a funding basis and use a different set of assumptions, as agreed with the pension Trustees. Given the current extremely 
low gilt yields, a funding valuation of the Scheme would probably have resulted in a smaller surplus than the IAS 19 methodology if one had been performed at 
the year end.

31. Transactions with the MOD 
The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 28. Transactions between the Group and the MOD 
are disclosed as follows: 
Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties 
Under the terms of the Group’s acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights 
in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.  
Restrictions on transfer of title 
The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets (see below) include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD. The MOD 
also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances. 
MOD’s generic compliance regime 
Adherence to the generic compliance system is monitored by the Risk & CSR Committee. Refer to the Committee’s report within the Corporate Governance 
Statement on page 64. 
Strategic assets 
Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: 
i)  dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset; or 
ii)  voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset. 
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2017 was £6.3m (2016: £7.2m). 
Long Term Partnering Agreement 
On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) to provide Test and Evaluation (T&E) facilities and training support 
services to the MOD. This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to £5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the MOD, under which QinetiQ 
Limited is committed to providing T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery. 
Other contracts with MOD 
The LTPA is the most significant contract QinetiQ has with the MOD. In total approximately 70% of the Group’s revenue comes d irectly from contracts with  
the MOD. 
32. Contingent liabilities and assets 
Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of £46.1m at 31 March 2017 (2016: £32.8m) in the ordinary course of business.  
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commer cial contracts or otherwise and 
similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including in respect of environmental and regulatory issues . Provisions are made for the 
expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, 
and represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pe nding the outcome of various court 
proceedings, ongoing investigations and negotiations. However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless 
management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. Contingent 
liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated cl aims that might be brought can be 
resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as remote. 
The Group has also not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to property impairments in prior years that may pote ntially be recovered from the MOD. 
Recovery is subject to future negotiations. It is not considered practicable to calculate the value of this contingent asset. 
33. Capital commitments 
The Group had the following capital commitments for which no provision has been made: 
all figures in £ million 2017 2016 
Contracted 155.3 35.5 
   
Capital commitments at 31 March 2017 include £155.1m (2016: £30.8m) in relation to property, plant and equipment that will be wholly funded by a third- party 
customer under long-term contract arrangements. These primarily relate to investments under the LTPA contract.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
1. Accounting policies 
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial 
statements. 
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards. As permitted 
by section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented. 
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU (‘Adopted IFRSs’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage 
of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken. 
– A cash flow statement and related notes; 
– Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;

Foreign exchange
The Group’s income and expenditure is largely settled 
in the functional currency of the relevant Group entity, 
mainly Sterling or US Dollar. The Group has a policy in 
place to hedge all material transaction exposure at the 
point of commitment to the underlying transaction. 
Uncommitted future transactions are not routinely 
hedged. The Group continues its practice of not 
hedging income statement translation exposure. 
The principal exchange rates affecting the Group were 
the Sterling to US Dollar exchange rate and the Sterling 
to Australian Dollar rate.

Treasury policy
The Group treasury department works within a 
framework of policies and procedures approved by 
the Audit Committee. As part of these policies and 
procedures, there is strict control on the use of financial 
instruments. Speculative trading in financial instruments 
is not permitted. The policies are established to manage 
and control risk in the treasury environment and to 
align the treasury goals, objectives and philosophy 
of the Group.
Tax risk management
QinetiQ’s tax strategy is to ensure compliance with all 
relevant tax legislation, wherever we do business, whilst 
managing our effective tax rates and tax cash flows. 
Tax is managed in alignment with our corporate 
responsibility strategy in that we strive to be responsible 
in all our business dealings. These principles are applied 
in a consistent and transparent manner in pursuing the 
tax strategy and in all dealings with tax authorities 
around the world.
 – Tax planning – QinetiQ manages both effective 
tax rate (ETR) and cash tax impacts in line with the 
Board-endorsed tax strategy. External advice and 
consultation are sought on potential changes in 
tax legislation in the UK, the US and elsewhere as 
necessary, enabling the Group to plan for and mitigate 
potential changes. QinetiQ does not make use of 
‘off-shore’ entities or tax structures to focus taxable 
profits in jurisdictions that legislate for low tax rates.
 – Relationships with tax authorities – QinetiQ is 
committed to building constructive working 
relationships with tax authorities based on a policy 
of full disclosure in order to remove uncertainty in 
its business transactions and allow the authorities to 
review possible risks. In the UK, QinetiQ seeks to be 
open and transparent in its engagement with the tax 
authorities by sharing with HMRC the methodologies 
adopted in its tax returns.
 – Transfer pricing – The Group does not have a 
significant level of cross-border activity but, where 
it does have such transactions controls are in place 
to ensure pricing reflects ‘arm’s length’ principles in 
compliance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 
and the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. The Group 
does not, therefore, have a significant exposure to 
transfer pricing legislation.
 – Governance – The Board has approved this approach. 
The Audit Committee oversees the tax affairs and 
risks through periodic reviews. The governance 
framework is used to manage tax risks, establish 
controls and monitor their effectiveness. The Head 
of Tax is responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
policies, processes and systems are in place and that 
the tax team has the required skills and support to 
implement this approach.
QinetiQ’s corporate tax contribution – QinetiQ is 
liable to pay tax in the countries in which it operates, 
principally the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and 
Belgium. Changes in tax legislation in these countries 
could have an adverse impact on the level of tax paid 
on profits generated by the Group. A significant majority 
of the Group’s profit before tax is generated in the UK. 
This reflects the fact that the majority of the Group’s 
business is undertaken, and employees are based, in 
the UK. Total corporation tax payments in the year to 
31 March 2017 were £3.0m. The differential between 
the taxation expense and the tax paid in the year relates 
primarily to the timing of the recovery of research and 
development expenditure credits for which the cash 
is recovered in the year following the year of account. 
There is also an impact of deferred tax movements, 
whereby the income statement bears a charge (e.g. 
in respect of accelerated capital allowances) but for 
which there is no corporation tax paid in the year. 
Together, these result in the cash paid being £5.2m less 
than the total expense charged to the income statement.
Accounting standards
As a UK-listed company, the Group is required to adopt 
EU endorsed IFRSs and comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. The effect of changes to financial reporting 
standards in the year is disclosed in note 1 to the 
financial statements.

152 Additional information QinetiQ Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to 
lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares 
that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy 
shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront 
payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy 
or sell shares in this way you will probably lose 
your money.
How to avoid share fraud
1.  Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are 
unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer 
to buy or sell shares.
2.  Do not get into a conversation, note the name 
of the person and firm contacting you and then 
end the call.
3.  Check the Financial Services Register from 
www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm 
contacting you is authorised by the FCA.
4.  Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an 
authorised firm, copying its website or giving 
you false contact details.
5.  Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register 
if you want to call it back.
6.  Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not 
have contact details on the Register or you are told 
they are out of date.
7.  Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams.
8.  Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an 
unauthorised firm you will not have access to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme.
9.  Think about getting independent financial and 
professional advice before you hand over 
any money.
10.  Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, 
it probably is!
Report a scam
 – If you are approached by fraudsters please tell 
the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at 
www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out 
more about investment scams.
 – You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 
0800 111 6768.
 – If you have already paid money to share fraudsters 
you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
