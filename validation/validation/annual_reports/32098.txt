Number
2 
—— The year ended 30 April 2017 was a signiﬁcant year for the 
Group. On 7 September 2016 the Company and Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise (“HPE”), announced that they had agreed 
that Micro Focus would acquire HPE’s software business 
segment (“HPE Software”) by way of merger (“Merger”) with 
a wholly owned subsidiary of HPE incorporated to hold the 
business of HPE Software. This major transaction is on track 
to close at the beginning of September this year with the 
listing of consideration shares on the London Stock Exchange 
(“LSE”) and the simultaneous listing of American Depositary 
Shares (“ADS”) on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) 
(“Completion”). Micro Focus existing shareholders will also 
be entitled to receive a Return of Value which in total will be 
$500m that will be declared immediately prior to Completion.
This will create a global infrastructure software business with pro-forma 
revenues in the 12 months to 30 April 2017 of approximately $4.4 billion and 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion making it one of the 
largest dedicated software companies in the world and a leading technology 
stock on the LSE. Following Completion we will align our ﬁnancial year end 
to 31 October and will initially report an 18 month ﬁnancial period ending 
31 October 2018. This will enable us to launch the new Company’s ﬁnancial 
year with effect from 1 November 2017. 
During the year ended 30 April 2017 the Micro Focus business traded in line 
with the expectations we had set at the beginning of the year. This was 
achieved during a year of signiﬁcant change and distraction as we;
 – Completed the acquisition of Serena Software Inc. (“Serena”) together 
with three other smaller acquisitions; 
 – Integrated Serena into the Micro Focus Product Portfolio; 
 – Entered the FTSE 100 on 6 September 2016;
 – Became the spin/merge partner for HPE Software;
 – Began to work on the plan for integrating HPE Software;
 – Completed required regulatory ﬁlings in the UK, USA and elsewhere; 
 – Reﬁnanced the Company’s existing debt; and
 – Raised new banking facilities to enable the Completion of the HPE 
Software transaction and the Return of Value.
We have believed for some time that there are signiﬁcant segments of the 
infrastructure software market that have matured. The response to this is 
consolidation. To be successful in this stage of a market both operational 
effectiveness and scale are critical. We believe that Micro Focus is now 
well positioned to lead in this space.
There is a clear customer requirement for a company that can innovate and 
extend the life of mature software assets.
Like the Attachmate Group (“TAG”) and Serena acquisitions, the combination 
with HPE Software has clear business logic to extend Micro Focus’ market 
presence in mature infrastructure software segments; to increase the 
operational efﬁciency of the combined Group; to deliver effective product 
management focused on customer centred innovation and improve sales 
productivity. It is 100% consistent with the Company’s strategy which, as you 
will see in the following pages, has not had any signiﬁcant changes from the 
plan laid out ﬁve and a half years ago. Micro Focus sets out to deliver 
consistent long-term shareholder returns of between 15% and 20% per 
annum. The board is conﬁdent that medium-term low single digit revenue 
growth, industry leading margins and strong cash conversion will ensure that 
Micro Focus can deliver on that strategy. These returns can be further enhanced 
by the appropriate deployment of capital in value enhancing acquisitions.
The Company has a business strategy, a ﬁnancial strategy, an operating plan 
and an incentive strategy that all support our objective to achieve 15% to 20% 
compound annual return for shareholders. Since IPO in 2005 until 30 April 2017, 
the annual compound shareholder return over 12 years has been 29.3%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share have grown from 14.23 cents in 2006 to 
175.65 cents in 2017 and dividends per share have grown from 6 cents to 
88.06 cents with respective compound annual growth rates of 25.7% and 
27.7% respectively.
When we announced the acquisition of TAG on 15 September 2014 we set 
out the four phase plan on page 4 for the combination of the businesses whilst 
continuing to deliver sustainable shareholder returns. 
The only changes to this original plan which are reﬂected in the table on 
page 4 are that our detailed review concluded that the integration of systems 
supporting the new business will extend throughout the four year period 
and the rationalization of legal entities will extend through FY17 and beyond. 
This has now been superseded by the plan to adopt new systems being 
implemented in HPE Software. This software stack will give us one of the 
most up to date system stacks in the industry and serve as a scale platform 
for further Mergers and Acquisition (“M&A”) integration.
We have set out a new four phase plan on page 4 for the combination of 
the Micro Focus and HPE Software businesses whilst continuing to deliver 
sustainable shareholder returns.
The acquisition of HPE Software may delay the return to revenue growth as we 
consolidate the HPE Software products. As with prior transactions we expect 
HPE Software’s revenue trend to continue its historical decline until signiﬁcant 
change has been implemented. This integration will be delivered by the four 
year plan that will consolidate and strengthen the combined business, with the 
goal of delivering modest revenue growth in the medium-term as well as 
underpinning our margin improvement objectives.
We are building a strong platform with the addition of HPE Software. 
Once we achieve our target cash conversion ratio for the Enlarged Group of 
90% to 95% we will generate signiﬁcant free cash ﬂows from which we can 
deliver signiﬁcant returns of value to our shareholders and/or further highly 
accretive acquisitions.
Following our integration review in 2015 we decided that the Group should 
operate two product portfolios, Micro Focus and SUSE, and have reported the 
business this way since 1 May 2015. 
Since April 201 1, I have held the roles of both Chairman and Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer (“CEO”). In December 2015 we announced that effective from 
1 February 2016, I would be Executive Chairman and that Stephen Murdoch 
and Nils Brauckmann would become CEO of Micro Focus and CEO of SUSE 
respectively. Stephen and Nils discuss the operating performance of their 
respective portfolios for the year completed in the CEO reports.

Executive Chairman’s statement 
continued Our Business Model – strong and established 
technology franchises
As the Linux market and Open Source business have unique characteristics, 
we have a dedicated focus on the SUSE Product Portfolio. This focus is 
essential if we are to capitalize on the growth potential of these offerings and 
be responsive to the Open Source community and strong heritage of SUSE. 
In 2017 we continued to increase the headcount dedicated to development, 
customer care and sales and marketing of the SUSE Portfolio and made the 
ﬁrst acquisitions in this product portfolio. This investment has delivered 
revenue growth ahead of the market and so we will be further increasing 
this investment in 2018.
Micro Focus specializes in managing mature infrastructure software assets 
which have been delivering value to signiﬁcant numbers of customers over 
long periods of time. Our product portfolios have some or all of the 
following attributes:
1. Broad based – covering all industrial sectors
2. Signiﬁcant numbers of customers
3. Signiﬁcant maintenance streams
4. Relatively high switching costs
5. Signiﬁcant market positions
In any IT system the customers’ business logic and data remain critical to their 
competitive advantage. The key is unlocking this competitive advantage 
through exploitation of the latest technology innovation such as “OpenStack”, 
“Software-deﬁned Distributed Storage”, “mobility”, “big data”, “virtualization” and 
“cloud”. All of this needs to be done with the appropriate security to ensure 
customer data, company data and intellectual property are protected at all 
times. Typically customers would be forced into costly, disruptive and risky 
change to make this possible but with Micro Focus, customers can take a 
different approach that we characterize as bridging the old and the new. 
We focus on Customer Centred Innovation that enables customers to exploit 
new technologies without undue disruption.
By enabling our customers to link their investments in established technology 
with the latest innovation, Micro Focus helps customers gain incremental 
returns on investments they have already made and to preserve and protect 
their data and business logic. The most striking example of this is that an 
application written in Micro Focus COBOL 40 years ago – before anyone had 
thought of Linux, Windows, virtualization, cloud or wireless communications – 
will work today in all of those environments. Micro Focus has made this a 
reality. By contrast, if a COBOL application had been rewritten in another 
language, to execute in Java or .NET the customer would have to undertake 
additional incremental re-writes and incur signiﬁcant costs every time there 
was a major technology change.
Our acquisitions broaden the range and depth of our core infrastructure 
software solutions and bring outstanding new capabilities in Linux, OpenStack 
Cloud Infrastructure and security, the combination of which enables us to 
further extend the philosophy of “bridging the old and the new” across much 
more of our customer’s I.T. “footprint”.

The typical stages of a product life cycle are from new product introduction through to high growth to broad adoption and maturity, to decline and 
ultimately obsolescence.
When considering investment priorities, both organic and inorganic, we evaluate our options against a set of characteristics mapped to each stage of this 
adoption cycle enabling the categorization of our product portfolio into one of the four quadrants represented in the chart (FOUR-BOX MODEL).

opportunities could become growth drivers or represent emerging use 
cases that we need to be able to embrace.
Growth Drivers
Products with consistent growth performance and market opportunity 
to build the future revenue foundations of the Group.
Optimize
Products with declining revenue performance driven by the market or

Product Lifecycle
Introduction Growth Maturity
Micro Focus area of primary focus –  
Customer Focused Innovation
Decline
Nature of software
 – Innovative and often disruptive technologies
 – High capex and R&D
 – User base rapidly expanding products repeatedly enhanced
Investment strategy and valuation
 – Investing in growth = valuation and returns
 – Rich valuations
Micro Focus is a software company focusing on operational efﬁciency and scale  
to lead consolidation in the mature infrastructure software market
Nature of software
 – Infrastructure software: embedded products with high switching costs
 – Limited growth capex
 – Margin expansion and efﬁciency opportunities
Investment strategy and valuation
 – Returns driven by maximising cash ﬂow
 – Lower valuations Our approach to each category is summarized below:
 – New Models: here our focus is on identifying new innovation in the 
marketplace that is applicable to our core and growth driver propositions. 
This is the case where new innovation is needed to connect or leverage 
existing IT or application assets to deliver returns or open new opportunities. 
An example of this is Silk Performer Cloudburst, a cloud based 
implementation of our highly successful on premise Silk Performer product. 
This combination enables customers to execute a hybrid on premise/cloud 
solution ensuring day-to-day operations are handled effectively on premise 
but offering broadly unlimited additional capacity as and when needed to 
support business operational peaks, underpinned by the ﬂexibility and ease 
of use of a common solution in both cases. In SUSE our investments in 
OpenStack Cloud Infrastructure and Software-deﬁned Distributed Storage 
are also clear examples. 
 – Growth Drivers and Core: this represents the majority of our revenue 
and investment focus. We look to identify critical technologies that have 
delivered signiﬁcant value for customers and where the costs and risks 
of replacement or re-write are high and the returns from such activities 
are questionable. We determine how to enable these technologies for the 
latest IT innovations whether new operating environments such as Linux, 
OpenStack, JAVA or .NET or new use cases such as the cloud or mobile. 
For example, Visual COBOL enables customers to take COBOL applications 
forward with conﬁdence into the next phase of IT industry innovation, 
speciﬁcally cloud and mobile, whilst protecting their investments in 
business logic and data built up through prior investments. Security is a 
major focus area for customers as they seek to balance being open and 
accessible to their customers with the need to protect conﬁdential data 
and intellectual property. Through our suite of identity, access and security 
solutions we offer industry leading capabilities to help customers ﬁnd this 
balance. These capabilities span multiple portfolios and signiﬁcant 
opportunities for leverage and cross portfolio synergies exist.
 – Optimize: as the I.T. landscape shifts in response to new opportunities 
or challenges some technologies require repositioning or to be re-focused 
to identify and exploit remaining or new growth potential. This requires 
much more granular analysis and targeted investment. Our model forces 
this discipline. Inevitably, some technologies eventually approach end of life 
as some customers replace them with new solutions. For the remaining 
customers they still represent signiﬁcant value. Our approach is to continue 
to offer ﬂexible commercial and support models to enable customer access 
to the intellectual property and capabilities of these technologies for 
extended periods, again ensuring protection of customer investment for 
as long as possible technically and commercially.
Within this overall portfolio we have some products that are growing 
signiﬁcantly and others that are stable or in decline. Our business model 
means the way we manage the portfolio is analogous to a “fund of funds” with 
the objective of generating moderate growth over the medium-term, delivering 
high levels of proﬁtability and strong cash generation and cash conversion ratio 
with a balanced portfolio approach. We will continue to focus investment in 
growth and core products and will not dispose of declining products unless 
we can achieve greater than the discounted cash ﬂow they would generate 
in our ownership.
In addition to strengthening and developing our strong franchises across 
the product portfolio, we are uniquely positioned to help customers solve key 
challenges as they seek to be more effective, more competitive and more 
efﬁcient. Decades of technology innovation has opened up tremendous 
opportunities for companies in almost every market but typically this has 
resulted in very complex IT environments. Most organizations operate 
infrastructure and applications which have emerged over time, often years 
apart, such that core legacy platforms sit alongside distributed systems, 
which more recently have been extended further again with web, cloud 
and mobile technologies. 
This is set to continue as today’s business environment is characterized by 
unprecedented levels of change. Companies need to embrace this change 
in a way that protects their most prized assets – their intellectual property; 
their business logic; and their business data.
Our core objective is to deliver consistent shareholder 
returns of 15% to 20% over the long-term
The underlying premise behind Micro Focus’ business strategy is that the 
Company should consistently and over the long-term deliver shareholder 
returns of at least 15% to 20% per annum. To deliver this objective the 
Company has adopted an operational and ﬁnancial strategy underpinned 
by consistent and effective management and reward systems. This strategy 
is capable of execution over the long-term.
The Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange on 12 May 2005 at 
a price of 130 pence and in the year ended 30 April 2006 Diluted Adjusted 
EPS was 14.23 cents and total dividends for the year of 6 cents per share was 
declared. In the year ended 30 April 2017 Diluted Adjusted EPS is 175.65 cents 
and the proposed full year dividend is 88.06 cents representing a compound 
annual growth rate of 25.7% and 27.7% respectively. 
Dividends paid on our shares since the IPO to 30 April 2017 have totaled 
228.64 pence (350.21 cents) and in addition since January 2012 we have 
made four Returns of Value totaling 215 pence per share. On 30 April 2017 
our share price had increased to 2,588 pence. A shareholder who invested at 
the time of the IPO and had reinvested the Returns of Value would have grown 
their investment by 2,167% which is a compound annual return of 29.3%. 
In addition the Company has announced that there will be a Return of Value 
of $500m payable to existing Micro Focus shareholders on the register 
immediately before closing the HPE Software transaction.
On 28 March 201 1, on the back of two proﬁt warnings and poor performance 
in the year ended 30 April 201 1, the Company announced a share buy-back 
programme. The closing share price on 25 March 201 1, the day before the 
announcement, was 308.6 pence and the dividends received since IPO at that 
time were 43.56 pence. The annual rate of return for the shareholder from IPO 
to 25 March 201 1 was 18.5% per annum. The Company’s market capitalization 
on that date was £635.0m and by 30 April 2017 this had increased to £5,944.0m. 
The Company made cash returns to shareholders during this period of 
£764.9m, consisting of share buy-backs of £65.0m, ordinary dividends of 
£360.3m and Returns of Value of £339.6m. These cash returns represent 
120.5% of the market capitalization of the Company on 25 March 201 1 and 
the annual compound return for shareholders from that date to 30 April 2017 
is 29.3% per annum.
Micro Focus intends to remain a high growth company in terms of returns 
to shareholders.

07 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our performance in the year
Micro Focus Group delivered revenues and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA 
of $1,380.7m and $640.9m respectively (2016: $1,245.0m and $532.5m). 
On a pro-forma constant currency (“pro-forma CCY”) basis the revenue 
reduced by 0.9% which is just above the mid-point of the guidance range 
given at the beginning of the year and re-conﬁrmed at the interims. 
Our net debt at 30 April 2017 was $1,410.6m and represents a multiple of 
2.1 times Facility EBITDA of $673.4m, against our target of 2.5 times. 
We would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication, 
commitment and hard work in delivering the full year results. 
For the year ended 30 April 2017 bonuses will be paid to executive 
management and non-commissioned staff in Micro Focus in line with the 
improvement in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of the Group on a pro-forma CCY 
basis excluding the impact of in year acquisitions. Staff bonuses will be paid at 
45.0% of their on target amount reﬂecting a 4.5% increase in Underlying 
Adjusted EBITDA of Micro Focus on a CCY basis excluding the impact of 
in-year acquisitions. Executive Management received the same percentage.
Non-commissioned staff fully aligned with SUSE, were targeted 50% on 
improvement in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of the Group on a CCY basis 
excluding the impact of in year acquisitions and 50% on delivery of Annual 
Contract Value (“ACV”) growth targets in SUSE. Their bonus payment is 
75.5% of their on target amount, reﬂecting stronger than targeted 
achievement in the ACV component. 
The amount charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
in respect of the Corporate Bonus plan in the actual results for the year ended 
30 April 2017 was $20.8m (2016: $45.6m). 
Operational strategy to deliver our core objective
Operational excellence
Micro Focus has set out to be the most effective company at managing a 
portfolio of mature infrastructure software assets. This shows in our industry 
leading EBITDA margins and our strong cash conversion. We believe that our 
proven ability to execute not only delivers signiﬁcant amounts of cash and 
consequently great ﬂexibility, but also a competitive advantage in the 
acquisition of other similar assets as demonstrated this year.
The aims of our portfolio focus and operational strategy are:
1. Revenue growth;
2. Operating leverage; and
3. Signiﬁcant cash generation.
Our key areas of operational focus in order to deliver single digit revenue 
growth to achieve our core objective are Financial Discipline in M&A, 
Go-to-Market (“GTM”) (including indirect channels) and Product Development.

Executive Chairman’s statement 
continued Financial discipline, mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”)
Micro Focus has a strong ﬁnancial discipline around the uses of cash. The 
Company has a base case model that estimates the returns to shareholders 
from organic execution and the return of excess cash. This gives a sound basis 
on which to evaluate M&A where any acquisition contemplated would need 
to generate a risk adjusted return greater than the base case. Successful 
execution of M&A has been instrumental in achieving an annual compound 
total shareholder return of 29.3% since IPO compared to a base case target 
of 15% to 20%. The TAG and Serena acquisitions demonstrate this strong 
discipline and the returns that are achievable.
Industry and market dynamics mean that there are signiﬁcant numbers of 
potential assets that could ﬁt with our business model. These are either:
1. Bolt-on transactions like those completed in FY13, FY14, FY16 and FY17;
2. Signiﬁcant transactions such as Serena in FY17; or 
3.  Transformational deals such as the acquisition of TAG in FY15 and 
HPE Software. 
Each year the world of IT gets another year older (and we should remember 
that IT is still a relatively young industry). Whilst the vast majority of companies 
will choose to focus on the “new and exciting”; we believe that there will be an 
increasing opportunity to help clients derive value from their existing and often 
highly complex IT investments. 
Since the Completion of the TAG acquisition, the Company continues to 
receive signiﬁcant numbers of approaches from owners of companies who 
would be interested in becoming part of the larger Group. 
GTM and Product Development are covered in the CEO reports.
Linkage of management incentive to 
shareholder returns
Micro Focus has deployed a simple model to link management incentives 
to the delivery of shareholder returns. This model has worked successfully 
in motivating management to deliver exceptional returns to shareholders and 
is well understood and supported by our investment manager population. 
The annual cash bonus applies to all members of staff in Micro Focus 
(excluding those on sales incentives). If the Group’s Underlying Adjusted 
EBITDA is no greater than the prior year’s CCY comparative at budgeted 
exchange rates there is no bonus. The bonus for executive directors and 
operating committee members is maximized on achieving 10% growth over 
the prior year CCY Underlying Adjusted EBITDA with a straight line between 
the two points and for other staff there is no maximum. The staff neither 
beneﬁts nor loses from elements outside of their control such as exchange 
rates with the board taking a view that these items balance out over the 
business cycle. In year acquisitions are not included for bonus purposes. 
The board sees no value in bonuses being based on “soft” or non-ﬁnancial 
measures as evidence would suggest that these tend to serve to increase 
bonuses to levels not merited by ﬁnancial performance. Such targets are best 
achieved by executives managing and having appropriate management and 
control systems in place.
The normal stock plan starts to vest at EPS annual growth over the 
performance period of RPI plus 3%, with maximum vesting at RPI plus 9%. 
With RPI per annum over the three years to 30 April 2017 of approximately 
1.9% full vesting required 10.9% growth in EPS and dividend yield of 
approximately 3% this means that full vesting is aligned to lower end of 
the overall objective of 15% to 20% shareholder returns.
At the time of the TAG acquisition shareholder approval was obtained for an 
Additional Share Grant (“ASG”) of up to 5,412,240 ordinary shares, representing 
a maximum of 2.5% of the enlarged Group’s share capital at announcement 
which could be awarded to up to 15 senior managers in the 18 months 
following Completion. The performance period expires on 1 November 2017 
and vesting is dependent upon shareholder return of between 50% and 100% 
over the performance period, with straight-line vesting of the ASG between 
50% and 100% of shareholder return. 
As at 30 April 2017 ASGs are outstanding over only 3,262,420 ordinary 
shares granted to seven senior managers representing 1.4% of the voting 
rights of the Company at 30 April 2017. As it is more than 18 months since the 
Completion of the acquisition, no further ASGs relating to TAG will be made. 
This means that if, at the date of vesting, the share price is a minimum of 
1,490.27 pence per share or more, then 100% of the shares granted would 
become exercisable. This is based on the current dividend per share of 
148.58 pence for the relevant period. 
The ASG was essential to the delivery of value and has proven to be a very 
effective incentive from a shareholder perspective. Shareholders voted to 
repeat this scheme for the HPE Software transaction which received 99.98% 
support at the general meeting on 26 May 2017. If successfully executed, the 
plan will deliver approximately an increase in shareholders’ investment of 
£7.9 billion including ordinary dividends for full vesting of the ASG from the 
base price of 1,817 pence per share. 
As we look to the consolidation of the market the Company will be at a 
disadvantage to US listed companies and private equity ﬁrms when negotiating 
acquisitions if it is not free to negotiate appropriate management compensation.
Key performance indicators to check that we are on track are Underlying 
Adjusted EBITDA (absolute amount and growth percentage), cash conversion 
(absolute amount and conversion percentage), free cash ﬂow and earnings 
per share.
Delivering value to shareholders
The board has adopted a very clear plan of value creation.
Our priority is to improve the performance of the business in order to maximize 
the opportunity to generate modest revenue growth in the medium-term. At the 
same time we have created ﬂexibility to allow value creation to shareholders 
through cash distributions or acquisitions as appropriate. We deliver value to 
our customers through customer centred innovation. We will do nothing that 
will constrain our ability to achieve organic growth and we are currently 
investing signiﬁcant amounts on activities designed to enhance growth.
The TAG and HPE Software transactions are transformational in terms of 
the size of the Group from an operating point of view. It involves the type of 
transformation that many companies would have said that they needed to 
go private to achieve out of the public eye. The board and management of 
Micro Focus believe that it is quite possible to do this on the public market 
and deliver the resulting increase in value to existing shareholders.
The HPE Software transaction was also transformational in terms of market 
capitalization. The day before the announcement of the transaction Micro Focus 
had a market capitalization of £4,480.7m which had increased to £5,944.0m 
by 30 April 2017. This increased scale drew the attention of a new set of public 
company institutional investors and also meant that some existing institutional 
investors would be unable to hold their investments as we had become too big. 
We will also list in the USA, through an ADS, which further expands 
Micro Focus relevant investor base. 
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance
Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements and notes
Company ﬁnancial 
statements and notes Additional information
09 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Working with our brokers, Numis Securities, we set about establishing a 
signiﬁcant increase in our investor relations and outreach to the HPE 
shareholder base. Following this activity approximately 30% of the Company’s 
shares are now held in North America.
The board continues to target a net debt to Facility EBITDA multiple of 
approximately 2.5 times. This is a modest level of gearing for a company with 
the cash generating qualities of Micro Focus. We are conﬁdent that this level 
of debt will not reduce our ability to deliver growth, invest in products and/or 
make appropriate acquisitions. As the integration of the businesses continues 
the board will keep the appropriate level of debt under review.
In order to complete the acquisition of HPE Software the Company has 
extended its revolving credit facility from $375.0m to $500.0m, reﬁnanced its 
term loan debt of $1,515.2m with an improved repayment proﬁle and raised 
new term loan debt of $3,485m to complete the transaction and make the 
Return of Value.
At 30 April 2017 we had net debt of $1,410.6m representing a net debt to 
Facility EBITDA of 2.1 times. On closing of the HPE Software transaction net 
debt will be approximately $4.6 billion representing approximately 3.3 times net 
debt to pro-forma Facility EBITDA for the 12 months ended 30 April 2017.
The board has adopted a dividend policy of being two times covered by the 
adjusted earnings of the Group. This policy has delivered a proposed second 
interim dividend of 58.33 cents (2016: 49.74 cents per share), which represents 
a 17.3% increase on last year’s ﬁnal dividend and gives a total proposed 
dividend for the year of 88.06 cents per share (2016: 66.68 cents), an 
increase of 32.1%.
The dividend will be paid in Sterling equivalent to 45.22 pence per share, 
based on an exchange rate of £1 = $1.29, the rate applicable on 1 1 July 2017, 
the date on which the board resolved to pay the dividend. The dividend will be 
paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017.
Board changes and succession planning
At the Completion of the HPE Software transaction the board has announced 
that Chris Hsu will become CEO and Stephen Murdoch will become Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer (“COO”). Nils Brauckmann will continue as CEO of SUSE. 
To ensure delivery of the integration the board has agreed that I will remain 
Executive Chairman until the announcement of the ﬁrst full year results after 
Completion. This is currently expected to be January 2019.
During the year there were a number of other board changes which arose due to 
the conditions of the agreement to acquire HPE Software (”Merger Agreement”).
Effective 15 May 2017, Silke Scheiber and Darren Roos joined the board 
as two of the three independent Non-Executive Directors nominated by HPE 
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Upon Completion, John Schultz, the 
Executive Vice President and General Counsel of HPE, will join the board 
as the Non-Executive Director nominated by HPE. The board has determined 
that Mr Schultz will not be independent. In addition, Chris Hsu, who will 
become CEO of Micro Focus upon Completion, will join the board at that time. 
An additional independent Non-Executive Director nominated by HPE and 
to be approved by the Micro Focus Nomination Committee, is expected to 
be appointed after Completion. 
Steve Schuckenbrock and Tom Virden both resigned as Directors of 
Micro Focus, effective 25 April 2017, to ensure that the composition of the 
board remained in line with the UK corporate governance code and met the 
requirements of the Merger Agreement. We would like to thank Steve and 
Tom for their signiﬁcant contributions to Micro Focus.
Stephen Murdoch remains CEO of Micro Focus until Completion and will 
then become COO and simultaneously step down from the board. Stephen 
will remain a key member of the management team going forward and was 
instrumental in operationalizing our FOUR-BOX MODEL during the integration 
of TAG. We would like to thank him for his contributions as a board member 
and his continued commitment to Micro Focus as COO.
We welcome the new members of our board and biographical details of all 
board members are available on pages 52 and 53.
Outlook
Following completion of the acquisition of HPE Software, the Group intends to 
align its ﬁnancial year end to 31 October and will report an 18 month ﬁnancial 
period ending 31 October 2018. Assuming the transaction remains on schedule, 
the ﬁrst six months will comprise six months of the current Micro Focus business 
and two months of the HPE Software business. There will then be a full 
12 months trading of both businesses.
We anticipate revenues for the current Micro Focus Group business for the 
six months to 31 October 2017 will be broadly ﬂat on the comparative period. 
In anticipation of the impending integration of the Micro Focus and HPE 
Software businesses in November we have put on hold any operational 
changes in the existing Micro Focus business. We will provide guidance for the 
combined 12 month period to 31 October 2018 when we report in January 
2018 on the Group’s performance in the six months ending 31 October 2017.
Having delivered 12 years of approximately 29.3% compound annual returns 
to investors we believe we have a strong operational and ﬁnancial model that 
can continue to scale and provide excellent returns to our shareholders.
Kevin Loosemore
Executive Chairman
17 July 2017
10 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Executive Chairman’s statement 
continued Group results presented for the year ended 30 April 2017 
include the post-acquisition period results for Serena, GWAVA, 
OpenATTIC and OpenStack. Due to the signiﬁcant size of the 
Serena acquisition the directors believe that the Group results 
are better understood by looking at the comparative results on 
a pro-forma basis for the combination of Base Micro Focus 
and Serena. The directors do not consider the other acquisitions 
to be of a signiﬁcant size and therefore have not presented 
their results in the pro-forma comparatives.
Serena had a 31 January year end date prior to acquisition. 
Similar to other software companies with a perpetual licence 
model Serena’s revenues were weighted to the end of each 
ﬁnancial quarter and were weighted to the ﬁnal ﬁnancial 
quarter of the year. Micro Focus’ experience is that when the 
ﬁnancial year end is changed following acquisition the weighting 
of ﬁnancial performance moves to the new ﬁnancial year end. 
Consequently, in order to provide a meaningful comparison in 
the pro-forma results for the year ended 30 April 2017 the 
directors have combined the unaudited ﬁnancials for Serena 
for the year ended 31 January 2016 with the audited ﬁgures 
for Base Micro Focus for the year ended 30 April 2016. 
From the date of acquisition, 2 May 2016 to 30 April 2017, 
Serena contributed $144.8m to revenue and $72.2m to proﬁt, 
before any allocation of management costs and tax.

A reconciliation between the GAAP and Non-GAAP 
performance measures is given on page 13 (Revenue), 
page 16 (Adjusted Operating Proﬁt, Adjusted EBITDA and 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA) and note 4. The Group operates 
two product portfolios (i) Micro Focus and (ii) SUSE. These 
are the reporting segments and the cash generating units 
for the Group.
The Micro Focus Product Portfolio contains our mature infrastructure software 
products that are managed on a portfolio basis akin to a “fund of funds” 
investment portfolio. This portfolio is being managed with a single product 
development group that makes and maintains the software, whilst the software 
is sold and supported through a geographic Go-to-Market (“GTM”) organization. 
Products are organized into ﬁve sub-portfolios based on industrial logic. During 
the year Serena’s product set was added to the Development & IT Operations 
Management Tools sub-portfolio and towards the end of the year GWAVA was 
added to Collaboration & Networking. 
SUSE’s characteristics are different due to the Open Source nature and the 
growth proﬁle of its offerings. During the year SUSE made its ﬁrst acquisition 
of OpenATTIC, a storage management software solution, and then took over 
assets and staff from HPE related to OpenStack Infrastructure as a Service 
(“IaaS”) and Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) technology.
Our revenue guidance at the beginning of the year was for Group revenues 
for the full year to grow between zero% and minus 2% when compared to the 
pro-forma CCY revenues of the comparable period with growth in SUSE 
expected to partially offset the anticipated decline in the Micro Focus Product 
Portfolio based on the revenue trends in the sub-portfolios.

We provide additional Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) for the SUSE 
Product Portfolio. Total Contract Value (“TCV”) is the amount invoiced to 
customers (excluding sales tax) in respect of new contracts and renewals 
completed in the year. The weighted average contract length expressed in 
months, reﬂecting the duration of the TCV is also being provided as growth in 
TCV alone without this information is potentially misleading. Finally we provide 
Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) which aims to normalize contract length by only 
including the ﬁrst 12 months of each new contract or renewal included within 
TCV. Where the contract length is less than 12 months all of the TCV is 
included in ACV.
We are not providing renewal rate information for SUSE or Micro Focus. 
Our methodology is still being reﬁned in order to accommodate data from 
our multiple systems and we will seek to standardize on a single measure 
after Completion and integration with the HPE Software business. Once we 
have a common methodology and are content with the data we will provide 
clear explanations of both. In the meantime we believe that following the 
trends on the maintenance revenue for the Micro Focus sub-portfolios and 
subscription revenues for SUSE provides the best guidance on performance.

As part of the HPE Software transaction the Company’s shares and ADS will 
be listed on the LSE and NYSE respectively. As part of the regulatory ﬁling 
process in the USA the Group has reviewed its consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income presentation and has decided to re-classify both 
amortization of product development costs and amortization of acquired

13 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 technology intangibles from research and development expenses to cost of 
sales. This presentation complies with IFRS and, in the view of the Company’s 
Audit Committee, provides investors with a consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income presentation that is more comparable with other 
software companies listed on both markets.
Cost of goods sold
On a pro-forma CCY basis, cost of goods sold for the year decreased by 
$15.3m to $237.2m (2016: pro-forma CCY $252.5m) of which the exceptional 
costs were $2.9m (2016: pro-forma CCY $2.8m). The costs in this category 
predominantly relate to our consulting and helpline support operations, 
amortization of product development costs and amortization of acquired 
technology intangibles. Excluding exceptional items, amortization of product 
development costs of $22.4m (2016: pro-forma CCY $19.5m) and 
amortization of acquired technology intangibles of $69.1m (2016: pro-forma 
CCY $75.2m) cost of goods sold decreased by $12.2m to $142.8m (2016: 
pro-forma CCY $155.0m). The decrease is due primarily to a $7.2m reduction 
in staff related costs and the year-on-year impact of the reduction in 
Consultancy revenues.
On a reported basis, costs of goods sold in the year increased by $7.0m to 
$237.2m (2016: reported* $230.2m). Cost of sales increased primarily due 
to the acquisition of Serena and GWAVA ($17.7m and $0.7m respectively) 
and exceptional items of $0.7m to $2.9m (2016: reported $2.2m) offset by 
exchange rate differences of $1.4m and a reduction in staff related costs 
of $8.6m. Exceptional items are discussed later in this section.
Selling and distribution costs
On a pro-forma CCY basis, selling and distribution costs increased by $26.2m 
to $467.1m (2016: pro-forma CCY $440.9m). Excluding the amortization of 
purchased trade names and customer relationships intangible assets of 
$143.8m (2016: pro-forma CCY $106.7m), selling and distribution costs were 
decreased by $10.9m to $323.3m (2016: pro-forma CCY $334.2m). Within 
these costs were exceptional costs of $5.5m (2016: pro-forma CCY $3.8m), 
thus the underlying costs were $317.8m (2016: pro-forma CCY $330.4m), 
a reduction of $12.6m (3.8%) on the prior year on a pro-forma CCY basis. 
Reductions include travel and ofﬁce costs of $4.2m, staff related costs of 
$2.1m and marketing costs of $1.9m.
On a reported basis, selling and distribution costs in the year increased by 
$50.8m to $467.1m (2016: reported $416.3m).The acquisition of Serena 
and GWAVA increased selling and distribution costs by $21.7m and $1.4m 
respectively. Excluding the acquisitions in the year, selling and distribution 
costs increased by $27.7m to $444.0m (2016: reported $416.3m). This 
increase in selling and distribution costs includes an increase in exceptional 
items of $1.1m to $5.5m (2016: reported $4.4m), an increase in the 
amortization of purchased intangibles of $37.1m to $143.8m (2016: reported 
$106.7m) primarily offset by a reduction in staff related costs of $6.2m, 
a reduction in marketing costs of $2.0m and exchange rate differences 
of $5.2m. Exceptional items are discussed later in this section.
Research and development expenses
On a pro-forma CCY basis, research and development costs decreased by 
$1.1m to $180.1m (2016: pro-forma CCY $181.2m). Excluding exceptional 
costs of $6.8m (2016: pro-forma CCY $5.8m), the resultant costs were 
$173.3m (2016: pro-forma CCY $175.4m) a decrease of $2.1m (1.2%). 
Research and development costs are equivalent to approximately 13.0% 
of revenue (2016: pro-forma CCY 13.0%). 
On a reported basis, research and development expenses in the year increased 
by $15.5m to $180.1m (2016: reported $164.6m).The acquisition of Serena 
and GWAVA increased research and product development costs by $17.3m 
and $1.1m respectively. Excluding acquisitions in the year research and 
development expenses decreased by $2.9m to $161.7m (2016: reported 
$164.6m). The decrease related to a reduction in staff related costs of $8.6m 
and exchange rate differences $2.8m offset by an increase in exceptional 
items of $5.5m to $6.8m (2016: reported $1.3m) and a decrease in the 
capitalization of product development costs of $3.2m to $27.7m (2016: 
$30.9m). Exceptional items are discussed later in this section.
At 30 April 2017 the net book value of capitalized product development costs 
on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position was $49.1m (2016: 
$43.2m). The impact of net capitalization of internal product development 
costs was $5.3m (2016: net capitalization pro-forma CCY $1 1.4m). 
Administrative expenses
On a pro-forma CCY basis, administrative expenses increased by $62.6m 
to $202.9m (2016: pro-forma CCY $140.3m). Excluding share based 
compensation of $34.5m (2016: pro-forma CCY $30.2m), exceptional costs 
of $82.0m (2016: pro-forma CCY $12.5m) and an exchange gain of $4.9m 
(2016: pro-forma CCY gain of $3.3m), administrative expenses decreased 
by $9.6m (9.5%) to $91.3m (2016: pro-forma CCY $100.9m). The decrease 
has arisen mostly from a reduction in staff related costs of $8.5m. 
Share based compensation was $34.5m (2016: pro-forma CCY $30.2m), 
being ASG costs of $13.6m (2016: pro-forma CCY $10.4m), LTIP costs of 
$19.8m (2016: pro-forma CCY $18.9m) and Sharesave Scheme costs of 
$1.1m (2016: pro-forma CCY $0.9m).
On a reported basis, administrative expenses in the year increased by $63.9m 
to $202.9m (2016: reported $139.0m). The acquisition of Serena and GWAVA 
increased administrative expenses by $10.4m and $2.2m respectively. 
Exceptional items included in administrative expenses increased $61.9m to 
$82.0m (2016: reported $20.1m), share-based payments increased by $5.7m 
to $34.5m (2016: reported $28.8m) and exchange gains increased by $2.0m to 
$4.9m (2016: reported $2.9m). Excluding acquisitions in the year, exceptional 
items, share-based payments and exchange gains, administrative expenses 
decreased by $14.3m to $78.7m (2016: reported $93.0m). The decrease 
relates primarily to a reduction in staff related costs of $12.2m. Exceptional 
items are discussed later in this section.
Amortization of intangibles for the year was $236.4m (2016: reported 
$203.3m). This growth is as a result of the acquisition of Serena and GWAVA 
during the year. 
14 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial review 
continued to provide CCY comparatives, we have restated the pro-forma results of the 
Group for the 12 months ended 30 April 2016 at the same average exchange 
rates as those used in reported results for the year ended 30 April 2017. 
Intercompany loan arrangements within the Group are typically denominated 
in the local currency of the overseas afﬁliate. Consequently, any movement in 
the respective local currency and US$ will have an impact on the converted 
US$ value of the loans. This foreign exchange movement is taken to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The Group’s UK 
Corporation Tax liability is denominated in Sterling and any movement of the 
US$: Sterling rate will give rise to a foreign exchange gain or loss which is also 
taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The foreign 
exchange gain for the period is approximately $4.9m (2016: pro-forma CCY 
gain of $3.3m).
Adjusted Operating Costs and Total Operating Costs
Adjusted Operating Costs were $742.6m (2016: pro-forma CCY $776.2m) 
a fall of $33.6m. The reduction in Adjusted Operating Costs arose mostly 
from a reduction in staff related costs of $23.9m. Total Operating costs were 
$1,087.3m (2016: pro-forma CCY $1,014.9m) an increase of $72.4m.
Adjusted EBITDA and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA in the year increased by $21.2m to $651.1m (2016: 
pro-forma CCY $629.9m). 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA in the year increased by $25.6m to $640.9m 
(2016: pro-forma CCY $615.3m) at a margin of 46.4% (2016: pro-forma CCY 
44.2%). The increase in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA is larger than the 
increase in Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA does not include the impact 
of net capitalization of product development costs and foreign exchange gains 
or losses.

On a reported basis exceptional items increased by $69.4m, or 248.7% to 
$97.3m in the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: reported $27.9m). The 
increase was as a result of an increase in pre-acquisition costs of $52.4m 
relating to the proposed combination with HPE Software, an increase in 
integration costs of $4.1m in bringing acquired businesses together with the 
heritage Micro Focus business, an increase in severance costs of $8.3m 
primarily related to the Serena acquisition, an increase in acquisition costs 
of $2.1m, the non-recurrence of the $3.0m royalty provision release, offset 
by a decrease in property costs of $0.5m. 
The pre-acquisition costs relate to the acquisition of HPE Software which was 
announced in September 2016 and is currently expected to complete on 
1 September 2017. These costs relate to accounting, legal and commercial 
due diligence work, legal work on the various agreements, professional advisors 
fees and pre-integration costs relating to activities in readiness for the HPE 
Software acquisition across all functions of the existing Micro Focus business. 
The integration costs relate to work done in bringing together the base 
Micro Focus, TAG, Serena and GWAVA organizations into one organization. 
The acquisition costs relate to due diligence work, legal work on the acquisition 
agreements and professional advisors fees on the acquisition of Serena and GWAVA.
Currency impact
During the year to 30 April 2017, 62.4% of our revenues were contracted in 
US dollars, 21.2% in Euros, 4.5% in Sterling, 3.6% in Yen and 8.3% in other 
currencies. In comparison, 50.7% of our costs are US dollar denominated, 
12.2% in Sterling, 19.6% in Euros, 1.7% in Yen and 15.8% in other currencies. 
This weighting of revenue and costs means that if the US$: Euro or US$: Yen 
exchange rates move during the year, the revenue impact is greater than the cost 
impact, whilst if US$: Sterling rate moves during the year the cost impact exceeds 
the revenue impact. Consequently, actual US$ EBITDA can be impacted by 
signiﬁcant movements in US$ to Euro, Yen and Sterling exchange rates.
The currency movement for the US dollar against Sterling and Euro was a 
strengthening of 13.9% and 1.5% respectively and the Yen weakened by 
10.1% when looking at the average exchange rates in the year ended 
30 April 2017 compared to those in the year ended 30 April 2016. In order

 – Other interest costs of $0.1m (2016: pro-forma CCY $0.1m); offset by 
 – $1.0m (2016: pro-forma CCY $1.0m) of interest received. 
Net ﬁnance costs have decreased by $1.7m on a pro-forma CCY basis, mostly 
due to reduced loan interest and commitment fees ($2.1m) offset by an 
increase in the amortization of prepaid facility arrangement, original issue 
discounts and facility fees ($0.2m).
Proﬁt before tax and adjusted proﬁt before tax
Proﬁt before tax for the year ended 30 April 2017 was $196.3m (2016:

the year when compared to the 2016 pro-forma CCY as a result of an increase 
in exceptional costs of $72.4m, an increase in the amortization of purchased 
intangibles following the Serena and GWAVA acquisitions of $29.3m, an 
increase in the share based compensation charge of $4.3m, offset by an 
improvement in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA margin of 46.4% (2016:

Financial review 
continued Taxation
The tax charge for the period was $38.5m (2016: $32.4m) with the Group’s 
effective tax rate (“ETR”) being 19.6% (2016: 16.6%). The ETR on adjusted 
proﬁt before tax (“Adjusted ETR”) was 22.9% (2016: 23.1%) as set out in the 
table below.
In computing adjusted proﬁt before tax, $344.7m of adjustments have been 
made for the items shown in the adjusted proﬁt before tax section, of which the 
associated tax is $85.5m. The adjusted ETR for the year ended 30 April 2017 
of 22.9% is consistent with 2016 (23.1%).
The Group is forecasting an Adjusted ETR in the medium-term, including 
HPE Software, of approximately 33%. The increase compared to previous 
medium-term guidance, excluding HPE Software, of 23% to 27% is due 
primarily to the expected higher proportion of proﬁts subject to higher US tax 
rates, including US taxes arising on the repatriation of proﬁts from subsidiaries 
of HPE Software through the US to the UK. The Group is guiding to a cash tax 
rate on “Cash Proﬁts” (Underlying Adjusted EBITDA less exceptional items, 
capital expenditure and interest) for the Enlarged Group of 30%. 
The forecast Adjusted ETR is subject to various factors, including: 
 – Changes in tax legislation in the main jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates (for example, discussions are ongoing in relation to potentially 
signiﬁcant tax reforms in the US); 
 – The geographical mix of proﬁts (as mentioned above, the proportion 
of proﬁts subject to US tax is likely to increase following the 
HPE Software acquisition); 
 – The risk of challenge from tax authorities to the allocation of proﬁts 
across the Group in response to the OECD’s Base Erosion and Proﬁt 
Shifting project; 
 – Investigations and proposals of the European Commission; 
 – The tax consequences arising from the UK’s exit from the European Union; 
and
 – The resolution of open issues with tax authorities.
The Group’s cash taxes paid in the period were $24.6m (2016: $79.3m). 
Cash tax payments in the current year were lower than in the prior year for the 
following reasons:
 – In 2016 the Group paid $24.5m in respect of an Accelerated Payment 
Notice issued by HMRC in relation to the historic tax issue disclosed in 
previous years, which impacts UK tax returns from 2009 until 2015; and
 – In 2016 the Group paid $27.2m in respect of forecast US Federal income 
tax liabilities. Following a recalculation in 2016 of the impact of temporary 
differences, including the offset of brought forward deferred tax assets, 
these liabilities were signiﬁcantly lower than was initially anticipated. Of the 
resulting overpayment, $8m was refunded in 2017 and the remainder has 
been offset against current year Federal Tax liabilities. 
The forecast cash tax rate is an average over the medium-term. The cash tax 
rate, when compared to the Adjusted ETR, is likely to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly 
year-on-year due to various factors, including the following:
 – As a general matter, temporary differences often result in substantial shifts 
of cash tax payments from one period to another;
 – In particular, the rate at which recognized deferred tax assets (brought 
forward tax losses and credits) are utilized is likely to vary signiﬁcantly 
year-on-year, with the rate of utilization currently forecast to decrease 
signiﬁcantly over the medium term period;
 – The ﬁnal tax liability for a particular territory and year can often vary 
signiﬁcantly from the estimates on which instalment payments have been 
made, resulting in under and over payments (such as the overpayment 
mentioned above in the US in 2016); and
 – The timing of the settlement of open issues with tax authorities is uncertain 
and can lead to signiﬁcant one-off increases in the cash tax rate (such as 
the one mentioned above in the UK in 2016).
Tax liabilities are recognized when it is considered probable that there will be 
a future outﬂow of funds to a taxing authority. Tax provisions are based on 
management’s interpretation of country speciﬁc tax law and are measured 
using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach. Management uses 
in-house tax experts, professional advisors and previous experience when 
assessing tax risks. Within current tax liabilities is $49.1m (2016: $27.9m) in 
respect of provisions for uncertain tax positions, the majority of which relates 
to the risk of challenge from tax authorities to the geographic allocation of 
proﬁts across the Group. The Group does not anticipate that there will be 
any material reversal of these provisions in the next 12 months. Due to the 
uncertainty associated with such tax items, it is possible that at a future date, 
on conclusion of open tax matters, the ﬁnal outcome may vary signiﬁcantly.

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance
Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements and notes
Company ﬁnancial 
statements and notes Additional information
17 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 As disclosed previously, the Group beneﬁted from a lower cash rate of tax in 
recent years as a result of an on-going claim with HMRC in the UK, based on 
tax legislation, impacting its tax returns for the years ended 30 April 2009 
through to 2015. The Group maintains a provision for the potential liability in 
its consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The remaining provision at 30 April 2017 
is $5.2m (including interest on overdue tax of $3.0m) compared to $5.6m at 
30 April 2016. Subsequent to 30 April 2017 the Group paid a further $2.2m 
to HMRC following the receipt of a further Accelerated Payment Notice. When 
the tax position is agreed with HMRC, then to the extent that the tax liability 
is lower than that provided in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position, 
there would be a positive beneﬁt to the tax charge in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the year of settlement and a refund 
of any amounts paid under the Accelerated Payment Notices in excess of 
the agreed liability.
Proﬁt after tax 
Proﬁt after tax decreased by 3.2% to $157.8m (2016: $163.0m reported).
Goodwill
The largest item on the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position is goodwill 
at $2,828.6m (2016: $2,436.2m) arising from acquisitions made by the Group. 
In the year goodwill has increased due to the acquisition of Serena ($379.6m) 
and GWAVA ($12.8m). There was no goodwill increase relating to the 
acquisitions of OpenATTIC and OpenStack. 
Capital structure of the Group
As at 30 April 2017 the market capitalization of the Group was £5,944.0m 
(2016: £3,496.5m), equivalent to $7,667.8m ($5,104.9m) at an exchange rate 
of $1.29 to £1 (2016: $1.46 to £1). The net debt of the Group was $1,410.6m 
(2016: pro-forma including Serena $1,625.0m), all denominated in US$, 
resulting in an Enterprise Value of $9,078.4m (2016: $6,729.9m). The board 
believes that this capital structure is appropriate for the Group’s requirements. 
The debt facilities of the Group were put in place at the time of the acquisition 
of TAG on 20 November 2014 and totaled $2,000.0m under a credit agreement 
comprising a $1,275.0m seven year Term Loan B, a $500.0m ﬁve year Term 
Loan C and a $225.0m Revolving Facility (together “the Existing Facilities”). 
As part of the Serena acquisition additional Revolving Facilities commitments 
of $150.0m in total were obtained on 2 May 2016 from Barclays, HSBC and 
The Royal Bank of Scotland. 
During the current ﬁnancial year mandatory repayments of $9.6m of the 
Term Loan B and $37.5m of the Term Loan C were made together with a 
draw-down of $180.0m and repayment of $325.0m of the Revolving Facility. 
As part of the debt raising relating to the HPE Software transaction the Term 
Loan C was rolled into the Term Loan B-2 facility on 28 April 2017. 
At 30 April 2017, $80.0m of the Revolving Facility was drawn together with 
$1,515.2m of Term Loan B-2 giving gross debt of $1,595.2m drawn. 
During the year ended 30 April 2017 the Group renegotiated its debt facilities. 
On 1 August 2016 the Company allocated a re-pricing of its senior secured 
Term Loan B which reduced its ongoing interest payments. The interest rate 
was reduced from 4.25% to 3.75% and the LIBOR ﬂoor was reduced from 
1.00% to 0.75%. All other terms of the Group’s Credit Facilities remained 
the same.
The terms of the Micro Focus debt facilities from 1 August 2016 to 28 April 
2017 were as follows:
 – Syndicated senior secured tranche B term loan facility (“Term Loan B”), 
with an interest rate of 3.75% above LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 
0.75%), repayable at 1.00% per annum, with an original issue discount 
of 1.00% and a seven year term;
 – A syndicated senior secured tranche C term loan facility (“Term Loan C”), 
with an interest rate of 3.75% above LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 
0.75%), repayable at 10.00% per annum, with an original issue discount 
of 1.5% and a ﬁve year term; and
 – A senior secured revolving credit facility of $375.0m, (“Revolving Facility”), 
with an interest rate of 3.50% above LIBOR on amounts drawn (and 0.50% 
on amounts undrawn) thereunder and an original issue discount of 0.50%. 
The Revolving Facility was increased from $225.0m to $375.0m on 2 May 2016 
as part of the funding for the Serena acquisition (note 37).
New Facilities
The Company announced on 21 April 2017 the successful syndication of the 
new credit facilities (the “New Facilities”) on behalf of both MA FinanceCo, 
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro Focus, and Seattle SpinCo. Inc., a 
wholly owned subsidiary of HPE that will hold HPE Software. At Completion of 
the HPE Software transaction, currently anticipated to be 1 September 2017, 
Seattle SpinCo. Inc. will be merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Micro Focus in the Transaction.
The New Facilities comprise a $500.0m Revolving Credit Facility at LIBOR 
plus 3.50% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) placed with a number of 
ﬁnancial institutions and $5,000.0m of term loans. The new term loans are 
priced as follows:
New Facilities drawn as at 30 April 2017:
 – In relation to the existing senior secured term loans issued by MA 
FinanceCo, LLC the lenders in the Term Loan C of $412.5m due November 
2019 were offered a cashless roll of their investment into the existing Term 
Loan B, becoming Term Loan B-2, due November 2021 and this loan was 
re-priced to LIBOR plus 2.50% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) and 
as a result of the cashless rollover increased in size from $1,102.7m to 
$1,515.2m, effective from 28 April 2017.
New Facilities not drawn as at 30 April 2017 were as follows:
HPE Software Facilities:

Financial review 
continued The above new facilities are a modiﬁcation only of the existing facilities and the 
unamortized prepaid facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts 
have not been accelerated as a result. The remaining unamortized prepaid 
facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts will be recognized over 
the life of the new debt.
As part of the HPE Software transaction, the New Facilities will be used to:
(i)  Fund the pre-Completion cash payment by Seattle SpinCo. Inc. to HPE 
of $2,500.0m (subject to certain adjustments in limited circumstances);
(ii)  Fund the Return of Value to Micro Focus’ existing Shareholders of 
$500.0m; and 
(iii)  Pay transaction costs relating to the acquisition of HPE Software. 
The balance will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.
Micro Focus is already beneﬁtting from the reduced interest rate margin and 
repayment terms on the existing term loans. The only ﬁnancial covenant 
attaching to these facilities relates to the Revolving Facility, which is subject to 
an aggregate net leverage covenant only in circumstances where more than 
35% of the Revolving Facility is outstanding at a ﬁscal quarter end. 
At 30 April 2017, $80.0m of the available Revolving Facility of $375.0m was 
drawn, representing 21.3%. The facility was less than 35% drawn at 
30 April 2017 and therefore no covenant test is applicable.
Total equity 
The total equity of the Group is $1,613.5m (2016: $1,593.7m) with a merger 
reserve of $338.1m (2016: $988.1m).
Cash ﬂow and net debt
The Group’s cash generated from operations was $564.8m (2016: $456.1m). 
This represented a cash conversion ratio when compared to Adjusted EBITDA 
less exceptional items of 102.0% (2016: 87.9%).

As at 30 April 2017 the net debt of the Group was $1,410.6m (2016: 
$1,078.0m) comprising gross debt of $1,595.2m (2016: $1,787.25m), cash 
balances of $151.0m (2016: $667.2m) and pre-paid loan arrangements fees 
of $33.6m (2016: $42.0m). 
The most signiﬁcant cash outﬂows during the year were:
 – The payment of the ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 30 April 2016 
of $111.0m; 
 – An interim dividend of $66.5m; 
 – Payments of $547.5m in respect of the acquisitions of Serena, GWAVA 
and OpenATTIC (including $316.7m repayment of bank borrowings on 
acquisition of Serena and net of $68.2m cash acquired); 
 – Bank loan net repayments of $192.1m;
 – Corporate taxes payments of $24.6m;
 – Payment for tangible assets of $1 1.7m; 
 – Payment for intangible assets of $31.4m; and
 – Interest and loan payments of $87.8m.
Dividend 
The board had adopted a dividend policy such that it is two times covered by 
the adjusted earnings of the Group. In light of the impending HPE Software 
transaction the directors are paying a second interim dividend for the year of 
58.33 cents (2016: ﬁnal dividend 49.74 cents per share), which represents a 
17.3% increase on last year’s ﬁnal dividend and gives a total proposed dividend 
for the year of 88.06 cents per share (2016: 66.68 cents), an increase of 
32.1% compared to last year.
The dividend will be paid in Sterling equivalent to 45.22 pence per share, based 
on an exchange rate of £1 = $1.29 being the rate applicable on 1 1 July 2017, 
the date on which the board resolved to propose the dividend. The dividend will 
be paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at 4 August 2017.
Group risk factors
As with all businesses, the Group is affected by certain risks, not wholly within 
our control, which could have a material impact on the Group’s long-term 
performance and cause actual results to differ materially from forecast and 
historic results. 
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out on pages

From within the Micro Focus Product Portfolio we also manage, for the Group 
overall, the corporate support functions of HR, IT, Facilities, Finance, Legal and 
the Project Management Ofﬁce (“PMO”) for acquisitions and integration. In 
addition we manage the delivery of a shared service for other elements of 
support to the SUSE portfolio enabling SUSE to directly control what they 
need to execute with speed and ﬂexibility whilst leveraging the larger Group 
where effective as SUSE builds scale. During FY17 this shared service 
approach was phased out to further enable the SUSE team to execute 
autonomously such that in FY18 only the corporate support functions are 
shared with all other resources dedicated to either SUSE or Micro Focus. 
Wherever practical the corporate support functions staff are dedicated to 
product portfolios, including SUSE, in order to provide the additional beneﬁt 
of specialization whilst leveraging the scale of the shared function. 
Progress in FY17
During 2017 our main priority has been completing the integration of the 
different businesses into a more coherent whole, focused on consistent and 
sustained ﬁnancial performance and the delivery of innovation that matters to 
customers – what we call customer centred innovation. This means helping 
customers solve the real world challenges they face today as they wrestle with 
balancing the ever increasing requirements for I.T. to deliver new capabilities 
and support new business models with the demands of securing and running 
day to day operations. We achieve this through the rigorous application of our 
FOUR-BOX MODEL which has at its core direct engagement with customers 
to enable highly targeted product development and delivery. 
Highlights include:
 – Our focus on delivering customer centred innovation continued to 
gather momentum: 
 – Delivered 185 product releases or signiﬁcant enhancements in FY17 
with each sub-portfolio improving the levels of customer engagement 
and cadence of product delivery; 
 – Integration of Serena and acquisition and integration of GWAVA 
completed on time and now executing as integral parts of the 
Micro Focus Product Portfolio, adding further depth and new 
capabilities within Development & ITOM and C&N respectively; and 
 – Removed dependency on third party intellectual property in key 
strategic elements of our IAS portfolio. 
 – Integration of the business into a coherent whole is now broadly complete 
as evidenced by the progress on removing sub-branding, completely 
redesigning our websites, transitioning to a geographic Go-to-Market 
(“GTM”) model globally and creating an integrated approach to product 
development and management. The remaining focus area is on IT systems 
where our stated goal of driving standardization will take longer to deliver 
than originally anticipated. As a result of the planned merger with HPE 
Software we have decided to implement the new set of systems being built 
for HPE Software for the Group as a whole. This will enable more effective 
integration of the existing Group with HPE Software and the creation of 
a more ﬂexible platform from which to execute our strategy but it remains 
a very signiﬁcant undertaking. 
 – Financial performance in the year was in line with expectations, with 
progress in Maintenance Fee Revenue being somewhat offset by 
performance in Licence Fee Revenue where the loss to a competitor of an 
entire sales team and management structure caused three to ﬁve months 
of disruption which impacted our Host Connectivity business principally.
20 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio  The Micro Focus Portfolio Group in FY17
Product Group
We now execute as one global organization covering the ﬁve sub-portfolios. 
During FY17 we delivered major product releases across each sub-portfolio 
and more than 185 releases in total. We have established standard processes 
for market and opportunity analysis through product development to product 
launch and sales and partner enablement. Best practices in areas such as 
development methodologies, pricing and licence management have been 
identiﬁed and are now adopted across the Group. 
The FOUR-BOX MODEL approach was applied across all products to optimize 
returns and ensure product roadmaps reﬂect the appropriate priorities based 
on the individual products life cycle and portfolio management position. 
This more uniﬁed approach to product development and management has 
presented new opportunities for delivering more value to customers through 
sharing technology and best practice focused on speciﬁc customer use cases 
or challenges. For example, we have delivered advanced security capabilities 
from our IAS portfolio within our leading Host Connectivity solutions to bring 
signiﬁcantly enhanced functionality for customers to secure mainframe 
application access. 
We continue to invest in product development and sharpen our focus in 
product management. We are excited by the signiﬁcant enhancements to 
existing products, the new products released in the past year and the product 
roadmaps for the future. 
Go to Market (“GTM”) – sales, services and marketing 
The transition of the GTM approach from global business units measured on 
annual bookings to a geographic organization focused on quarterly revenue 
is now complete. 
This realignment of structure and approach was executed to enable closer 
engagement with the customer base and drive behaviour change at both the 
management and individual level to underpin the move to a more granular, 
quarterly cadence of sales forecasting and execution. 
In services we have changed the direction and objectives to align fully with our 
strategy of “making, selling and supporting software”. The teams have been 
reorganized with compensation and incentives changed to be targeted on 
delivering successful software implementations rather than more standalone 
services engagements. This change also enables better alignment with our 
channel partners. We have an extensive partner network that is a fundamental 
part of our long-term plans and it is important we ensure consistency of 
direction and focus to ensure objectives are aligned and mutual success is 
achieved in support of our customers. 
Our approach to and our engagement with our channel partners was improved 
during FY17. Channel programmes were completely revamped to focus on 
those partners who were adding most value to our customers through the 
investment in complementary skills and technologies. Underpinning this is a 
completely redesigned Channel Portal to simplify how we collaborate and to 
provide improved visibility and analytics.
Systems and Processes
The decision to switch the focus of our long term strategic approach to 
internal systems to leverage the HPE Software internal systems has had a 
short term impact on our ability to make the fundamental structural improvements 
we believe will underpin our long term strategy. In the interim we switched 
focus to tackling other areas of process or technology inefﬁciencies. Key 
examples include the continued simpliﬁcation of sales compensation plans, 
rationalization of websites, marketing support systems and social media 
platforms, improvements to our core data and voice infrastructure and 
improvements to our business intelligence and data analytics capabilities. 
We believe the changes made enable us to better serve our customers but 
we still have a great deal to do across systems (beyond the main strategic 
project), processes and people to deliver the levels of sales productivity 
desired and possible. 
We aim to increase sales productivity and predictability further by continuing 
to simplify the underlying processes and systems we use to run the business 
and improve customer insight by generating closer interaction between Sales 
and Marketing, Product Management and Product Development. All of which 
is key to effective operation today and faster integration with HPE Software 
in the future. 
Micro Focus Product Portfolio
Details of our ﬁve sub portfolios are provided below.
COBOL Development & Mainframe Solutions (“CDMS”) – 
19.2% of FY17 Group revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 18.5%)
We have continued to invest in our core COBOL development (“CD”) products 
that primarily target the off-mainframe distributed development market. The 
CD products enable programmers to develop and deploy applications written 
in COBOL across multiple platforms including Windows, UNIX, Linux and the 
cloud. Visual COBOL provides the fastest way for customers to move 
enterprise mainframe application workloads partially or wholly to Java Virtual 
Machine (“JVM”), .NET or cloud environments whilst protecting their existing 
investments and intellectual property.
COBOL applications continue to be at the heart of the world’s business 
transactions and to power the majority of large organizations’ key business 
operations. Maintaining our leadership position in CD is at the core of our value 
proposition. By embedding our products in industry standard development 
environments speciﬁcally Visual Studio and Eclipse, we have addressed the 
perceived skill issues, and expect that COBOL will provide a stable base and 
strong cash ﬂow for the Group over the coming decades.

21 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Our Mainframe Solutions (“MS”) product set addresses a customer’s need to 
get the most value out of their mainframe environment. These technologies 
allow customers ﬂexibility in deciding the platform choice for development, 
testing and deployment of their business applications. Various business and 
technical drivers would determine if it is best to do these functions either within 
the mainframe environment or outside of it on distributed Windows, UNIX and 
Linux machines. We offer customers the choice to do either or both, enabling 
the optimum balance of cost, risk and speed of execution across their 
mainframe and distributed computing platforms. Increasingly businesses are 
seeking to re-use existing business logic and data, while also looking to exploit 
new innovations in technology such as mobile and cloud. Our mainframe 
solutions allow customers to accomplish both by enabling the re-deployment 
of enterprise mainframe applications to distributed systems, virtualized mobile 
platforms, and the cloud. We estimate that the mainframe COBOL development 
market opportunity is approximately three times as large as that for off 
mainframe distributed COBOL development. 
Micro Focus will maintain its leadership positions in CDMS through products 
such as Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer. The continued stable 
revenue performance in this portfolio is showing that our strategy is working.
Host Connectivity – 12.7% of FY17 Group revenues 
(2016: pro-forma CCY 14.1%)
The Host Connectivity product portfolio helps customers improve user 
productivity as they extend host access to new web and mobile use cases 
while ensuring that modern security practices around encryption, authorization, 
and authentication can be enforced. We specialize in environments with 
heterogeneous systems or platforms and this product set has, in one form 
or another, assisted in these tasks for over 30 years. 
The Host Connectivity capabilities are extended by other products that provide 
legacy integration technologies that enable businesses to put their mainframe 
assets to work in new ways by exposing applications and data to modern 
development environments and business analytics systems. There are 
additional Secure Shell (“SSH”) based ﬁle transfer solutions that solve a range 
of tactical and strategic problems for securely transferring ﬁles of any size, 
enabling businesses to work seamlessly with partners and customers.
In Host Connectivity we will seek to build on our existing strengths in terms 
of technology and customer base combined with our innovations in security 
to establish a true leadership position in this area.
Identity Access & Security (“IAS”) – 15.0% of FY17 Group 
revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 15.4%)
This product set offers a broad set of proven solutions for Identity Governance 
and Administration, Access Management and Authentication, and Security 
Management. Our customers span all sectors with particular strength in 
regulated industries, including Healthcare, Finance, Government, Retail, 
Manufacturing, and Energy. In addition companies in non-regulated industries 
also implement our IAS products as a best practice for protecting intellectual 
property or other sensitive information, and to make their organizations 
more efﬁcient.
Customers use our Identity & Access Management (“IAM”) solutions to apply 
integrated policies across local, mobile, and cloud environments to govern 
access to information, administer and manage the identity and access lifecycle 
of users, and demonstrate compliance with regulations or mandates. We provide 
solutions that address identity lifecycle management, risk-based authentication, 
single sign-on (“SSO”), access governance, and multi-factor authentication.
Our Security Management solutions build upon this identity centric approach by 
integrating identity and other contextual information with security monitoring, 
ensuring organizations have the security intelligence they need, when they 
need it, to detect and respond to abnormal activity that signals a data breach 
or compliance gap. Our Security Management solutions provide privileged user 
management, secure conﬁguration management and visibility and control over 
user activities, security events, and critical systems across an organization to 
enable them to quickly address evolving threats.
Key trends driving growth in this area include the continued expansion and 
diversity of security threats to organizations and the growth of the resulting 
ﬁnancial risk, the increasing demand for organizations to demonstrate that they 
have the processes in place to manage access, and the continued expansion 
of virtualization and cloud deployments increasing the level of complexity of the 
applications and information over which organizations need to manage access 
and monitor activity. Additionally organizations have an opportunity cost, 
effectively to implement stronger authentication methods than traditional 
username/password to help minimize data breaches. 
Our IAS solutions are well suited to address these trends, using unique 
identity-powered technologies to help organizations govern and manage user 
privileges, facilitate and control access to applications and data, and monitor 
user and system activities. Although well positioned from a technology and 
capability perspective in this growth market there are many niche players who 
have point solutions and the trend in the market seems to be for customers 
to look for the potentially quicker ﬁx of a single point solution rather than a 
company-wide integrated solution. Our focus is to build on existing strengths 
but transition the portfolio to enable these strengths to be packaged for easier 
consumption and deployment giving the customer better longer term balance 
between speed of deployment as part of a more integrated solution versus 
disparate point solutions from multiple vendors.
22 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio 
continued Development & IT Operations Management Tools – 20.6% 
of FY17 Group revenues (2016: pro-forma CCY 22.7%)
On 2 May 2016 we added important new capabilities and depth to this product 
portfolio through the acquisition of Serena, a leading provider of Application 
Lifecycle Management products enhancing both our expertise in mainframe 
computing and distributed software change management. Consistent with our 
philosophy of customer centred innovation we have continued to develop the 
full suite of Serena products and started the process of leveraging existing 
Micro Focus capabilities to the beneﬁt of Serena products and customers 
and vice versa.
The Application Delivery and Testing products offer a range of DevOps 
solutions which span an organizations software development lifecycle – from 
deﬁnition (requirements capture) through to delivery (testing and change 
management). Organizations competing in a global marketplace must deliver 
innovative applications that meet customer expectations anytime, anywhere. 
Greater agility is required as software teams rapidly adapt to the volume and 
velocity of evolving business requirements and the demand to work in more 
diverse environments including mobile and cloud. Our Application Delivery and 
Testing solutions improve communication and collaboration between business, 
test, and development teams for continuous delivery of a superior applications 
and user experience across all their device and platform combinations.
Our Data Centre Management solutions integrate service management, 
application management, and systems management to give organizations a 
holistic view of their IT environment and business services, enabling companies 
to manage increased complexity and capacity with the right balance of cost, 
risk and speed of execution. We provide application performance management, 
IT process automation, business service management, and systems 
management solutions. 
Our Workload Migration and Disaster Recovery products help organizations 
complete data centre transformation and migration projects quickly and 
efﬁciently with automatic, unattended high-speed physical-to-virtual, 
virtual-to-virtual, or anywhere-to-cloud workload migrations. Additionally, our 
high-performance disaster recovery solutions offer warm-standby recovery 
speeds similar to mirroring but at the lower cost points more associated with 
tape backup for all server workloads: physical and virtual, Windows and Linux.
Endpoint Management products enable IT staff to handle the complexities of 
securing and managing a large footprint of PC’s, Macs, tablets and smartphones 
to give the proper and secure working environment to each employee. 
Using a uniﬁed management console, these tools enable all devices to be 
patched, compliant, secure and properly equipped. Due to the multifarious 
and complex nature of the user and system endpoints within today’s large 
organizations, this can be a burdensome and costly undertaking, and 
accordingly the toolset is both broad and deep. The capabilities include service 
desk; application virtualization; asset management; conﬁguration management; 
software distribution; full disk encryption; mobile device management; and 
patch management. 
We offer a very broad set of solutions and capabilities for customers. Our focus 
is on delivering the targeted innovation our customers need as they seek to 
solve complex, real world and ever changing challenges in building, operating 
and securing complex IT applications and infrastructure.
Collaboration & Networking – 10.5% of FY17 Group revenues 
(2016: pro-forma CCY 11.3%)
Our collaboration products enable organizations to build and operate work 
environments that are more secure and easier to manage, regardless of how 
or where people work. The products form a complete collaboration solution 
that has long been praised by customers and industry watchers for security 
and reliability. Key capabilities include email, calendaring, instant messaging, 
contact management, task management; team workspaces with document 
management, and workﬂows. 
On 30 September 2016 we completed the acquisition of GWAVA Inc. 
(“GWAVA”), a leading provider of email security and enterprise information 
archiving (“EIA”) solutions based in the US, Canada and Germany. GWAVA has 
a full suite of products, including their award winning EIA product Retain, that 
enable customers to protect, optimize, secure and ensure compliance for email, 
mobile and social data across multiple platforms including Micro Focus 
GroupWise, Microsoft Ofﬁce and Google.
Collaboration brings people, projects, and processes together in one secure 
place to enhance team productivity and this ﬁts closely with additional products 
that offer ﬁle, print, and networking services designed to enable organizations 
to securely print and share ﬁles both inside and outside their organization. The 
products can automate the conﬁguration and management of high availability 
collaboration and networking servers, that are simple to resource manage and 
maintain. Suitable for small workgroups, right through to global enterprise 
deployments, the end-user value proposition includes dynamic ﬁle services 
which automates policies data storage; ﬁle access; secure ﬁle sharing; ﬁle 
reporting; mobile access; and online, ofﬂine and mobile printing. 
Fully distributed networking services such as centralized server management; 
secure ﬁle storage; and storage management, provide full enterprise 
distributed networking environments suitable for small workgroups, right 
through to global enterprise deployments. 
This product set also includes the CORBA based network and data transport 
products which provide unrivalled functionality and performance to companies 
with a requirement for high speed, and secure transfer of data between 
systems on their multi-platform networks. This technology is deployed across 
thousands of customers supporting more than a billion transactions per day. 
We have been delivering value to our customer base with these products for 
decades and are committed to delivering the practical innovation and support 
our customers want and need to continue to leverage these investments. 
Micro Focus will maintain its existing and seek to develop new leadership 
positions through continued investment in customer centred innovation. We will 
maintain our leadership in COBOL Development & Mainframe Solutions through 
products such as Visual COBOL and Enterprise Developer. In Host Connectivity 
we will seek to build on our existing strengths in terms of technology and 
customer base combined with our innovations in security to establish a true 
leadership position. In Development & ITOM and Collaboration & Networking 
the strength of our existing franchises can be built upon through targeted 
innovation and customer engagement. By continuing to sharpen our focus 
in IAS we are well positioned for growth over the longer term.

$6.9m (2016: $10.2m). Excluding this, underlying maintenance revenues fell 
by 4.9% (2016: 6.2%). 
Consultancy revenue
Consultancy revenues declined by 12.0% (2016: 15.2%) on a pro-forma CCY 
basis as we completed the implementation of the established Micro Focus policy 
of focusing only on consulting business that supports our licence business.
CDMS revenues were $265.2m; a growth of 2.8% on a pro-forma CCY basis 
compared with the year to 30 April 2016. This portfolio continues to show 
annual revenue growth underpinned by Visual COBOL and Enterprise 
Developer which highlights the continuing value customers derive from our 
CDMS products in support of their mission critical applications. Licence 
revenues grew by 1.7% ($1.8m), Maintenance revenues grew by 3.2% ($4.7m) 
and Consulting revenues grew by 8.0% ($0.7m). 
Host Connectivity revenues declined by 1 1.0% ($21.6m) in the year on a 
pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenues declined by 22.2% ($19.8m) mostly 
as a result of the loss to a competitor of an entire sales team and management 
structure. Maintenance revenues declined marginally by 0.8% ($0.8m) and 
there was a decline in Consulting revenues of 35.7% ($1.0m).
Identity, Access & Security (“IAS”) revenues declined by 3.4% ($7.3m) 
in the year on a pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenues declined by 6.0% on 
pro-forma CCY basis due to a lack of large scale projects in customers which 
is an area of real strength for our products and increased competition in this 
market from niche players for the smaller more point solutions. We will continue 
to drive for growth in this area but expect that this will take time to be delivered. 
Maintenance revenues declined by 0.4% ($0.6m). 
Development & IT Operations Management Tools revenues which now 
include Serena were $285.2m; a 9.7% ($30.6m) decline on pro-forma CCY 
basis. $20.0m of the decline was in Maintenance revenues which declined by 
8.5% compared with 1 1.3% in the prior year. Licence revenues declined in the 
period by $9.0m partly due to lower sales of our Serena products which had a 
number of large licence sales in the prior year. Consulting revenues declined 
by 10.3% ($1.6m). 
Collaboration & Networking revenues which now include GWAVA were 
$144.5m a decline of 8.1% ($12.7m) on pro-forma CCY basis. Licence revenue 
grew by 23.2% ($5.5m). Maintenance revenue declined by 13.4% ($17.1m) 
in the period compared with 15.8% in the prior year.

North America started the year promisingly but had a disappointing third 
quarter which resulted in year-on-year revenue decline of 5.7% (2016: 6.4% 
decline) for the full year. The Federal business performed very well and CDMS 
execution improved throughout the year to deliver year-on-year growth within 
which Mainframe Solutions won exciting new customers and projects. Host 
Connectivity was down signiﬁcantly mostly due to disruption and the impact of 
losing an entire sales team and management structure to a competitor causing 
both performance and pipeline development issues. 
International had a challenging year with revenue decline year on year of 
6.1% (2016: 4.6% decline). This region like in North America experienced 
challenges in the Host Connectivity and IAS markets. CDMS was broadly ﬂat. 
France performed well and Germany and Nordics improved signiﬁcantly in 
the second half but this was not enough to make up for weaknesses in the 
other territories. 
Asia Paciﬁc & Japan saw a 4.0% year on year revenue decline (2016: 10.6% 
decline). Licence revenues were marginally ahead of last year and maintenance 
revenues were in line with trend. Strength in Japan and Australia was offset by 
weakness in India & Asia. The Australia business was rebuilt to ensure that the 
correct teams were in place to execute consistently and improve the overall 
capabilities locally and these changes started to deliver improvements from 
very early in FY17. There were some excellent wins in IAS that demonstrate 
what can be delivered when skill and execution levels are maintained.

Outlook
We have achieved a great deal over the last 12 months and enter the new 
ﬁnancial year with stronger foundations than a year ago. We continue to 
focus on improving the way in which we operate to maximize the efﬁciency 
of the organization. 
The Group has undergone huge change in FY16 and FY17 but the one 
constant has been clarity of strategy and the associated focus on aligning 
operational execution to the delivery of that strategy. Looking forward to 
FY18 this focus will continue with our key priorities being: 
 – Delivery of our ﬁnancial plan;
 – Continuing to operationalize the FOUR-BOX MODEL to better align 
resources to optimize the performance of each sub-portfolio; and
 – Planning for and subsequent integration with HPE Software following 
Completion of the transaction.

CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio 
continued Introduction
The SUSE Product Portfolio represented 22.0% of the total 
Group revenue in FY17 (2016: pro-forma CCY revenue 18.0%).
SUSE has continued with the mandate to deliver “accelerated, 
sustainable and proﬁtable revenue growth” and has continued 
to invest in the business to support this vision. FY17 has been 
another successful year for SUSE with growth in revenue, 
Annual Contract Value (“ACV”), Total Contract Value (“TCV”) 
and Underlying Adjusted EBITDA. 
SUSE created additional capacity with the objective of sustainable proﬁtable 
growth, by expanding the SUSE headcount across all of the key disciplines 
and SUSE also completed two technology led acquisitions during the ﬁscal 
year. Closer alignment of critical support functions continued during the year, 
as we aligned SUSE Services and SUSE Renewals to have dedicated leaders 
reporting into SUSE Sales leadership. In FY17, we continued to strengthen our 
partner eco system, with continued investment in broadening and deepening 
the partnership with Alliances, OEM, two tier distributors, value add resellers, 
cloud service providers and system integrators. We continue with our concerted 
effort to broaden the ISV partnership and accredit SUSE offerings on critical 
and relevant business applications. SUSE continues to rely on sustained 
growing contribution from these strategic partnerships for its overall success.
Technology acquisitions during the year:
During the year, SUSE acquired OpenStack IaaS and Cloud Foundry based 
PaaS technology from HPE together with a workforce of 105 Engineers. This 
will strengthen SUSE’s existing OpenStack Cloud (IaaS) offering and also 
SUSE’s Cloud Foundry PaaS offering when brought to market. The acquisition 
also enables SUSE to broaden its Original Equipment Maintenance (“OEM”) 
partnership with HPE to now include SUSE’s OpenStack Infrastructure as a 
Service (“IaaS”), Enterprise Linux and Software Deﬁned Storage solutions as 
well as fast track provision of more comprehensive offerings in the OpenStack 
IaaS and Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) space to all of its IHVs 
and alliance partners.
SUSE also acquired distributed storage management technology from 
OpenATTIC together with eight Engineers, which was a group within IT Novum 
GmBH, a German registered company. This will enable SUSE to strengthen 
SUSE Enterprise Storage and its open source software deﬁned distributed 
storage offering by adding advanced storage management capabilities to 
the solution.
We continued to extend SUSE’s presence and contribution in key Open Source 
projects and relevant industry groups both in support of strengthening our 
contribution to Open Source innovation and development efforts as well as in 
support of our partner and enterprise customer relationships.

Open Source Software
SUSE products and solutions are developed from Open Source technologies 
and brought to market with an Open Source business model. Open Source 
software source code is made available in the public domain under a number 
of different licensing models (such as GPL) which fosters collaboration and 
rapid innovation by developers around the world working as private individuals, 
for Enterprise customers and from within many of the industry’s largest 
IT companies.
SUSE actively utilizes and engages in a wide range of Open Source projects 
and related industry initiatives where we work together with communities and 
partners to drive the new innovation and create meaningful industry standards. 
These projects include the Linux Foundation, OpenStack, Ceph, Cloud 
Foundry, openHPC, OPNFV, Open Mainframe Project, Open Container 
Initiative, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and many more.

Enterprise Linux
Linux is one of the ﬁrst and most successful Open Source software projects in 
the industry and has now become a well-established choice in the enterprise 
operating system market but also in numerous other use cases including 
mobile devices, Internet of Things (“IoT”), cloud computing, big data analytics 
and more. All of the industry’s major software-deﬁned infrastructure 
innovations are being developed on and for the Linux operating system.
SUSE was the industry’s ﬁrst provider of an enterprise distribution of the Linux 
operating system and are the preferred choice on platforms such as IBM z 
Systems and for workloads such as SAP applications and SAP HANA.
Some of the key drivers behind the continued demand for enterprise Linux 
solutions such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server include:
 – UNIX to Linux migrations – the movement of workloads from proprietary 
UNIX operating systems on specialized hardware to Linux on industry 
standard hardware platforms but also IBM z Systems and Power.
 – Data Center consolidation and virtualization – maximizing hardware 
investments by running multiple operating system instances on the same 
physical server.
 – Cloud computing infrastructure – the most prevalent OS for the cloud 
infrastructure and also widely used as the OS for the workloads running 
on the private and public clouds. 
 – High Performance Computing – the world’s top supercomputing clusters 
and the growing use of high performance computing systems leverage the 
ﬂexibility and performance of Linux operating systems.
 – Software-deﬁned innovations – Linux has become the de-facto standard 
OS for the industry’s infrastructure software innovations from IoT, Big Data 
analytics and software-deﬁned storage, IaaS and private cloud, Containers 
and orchestration, PaaS, NFV and software-deﬁned networking.
OpenStack Private Cloud
OpenStack has become the industry’s clear Open Source standard for IaaS 
cloud with active engagement from dozens of leading IT companies and 
enterprises. This technology provides a highly ﬂexible alternative to proprietary 
solutions which both commercial companies and end-customer enterprises 
can directly engage with through the OpenStack project in addition to utilizing 
distributions such as SUSE OpenStack Cloud.
SUSE was a founding platinum member of the OpenStack Foundation and has 
held the Foundation’s board Chair position since its creation. SUSE OpenStack 
Cloud’s streamlined installation capabilities, unattended upgrades, high 
availability features and support for all leading hyper-visors makes it an ideal 
choice for enterprise private cloud.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for OpenStack private cloud solutions 
such as SUSE OpenStack Cloud include:
 – Data center evolution to Software Deﬁned Infrastructure (“SDI”) –  
the next step beyond data center consolidation and virtualization is to 
embrace the ﬂexibility and agility of cloud capabilities such as self-service, 
direct integration with software-deﬁned storage and networking.
 – On demand services and business agility – in a world that expects instant 
access to everything, the ability to rapidly stand up new products and 
services for both internal and external customers is essential to competing 
effectively.
 – Cost and value – traditional solutions lag in innovation and don’t bring the 
economic scalability in both CAPEX and OPEX costs needed to support 
modern business models the way Open Source solutions can.
Software-deﬁned Storage
Enterprises across all industry segments and sizes are struggling to control 
and manage the impact of explosive data growth at the very time that 
effectively using information is rapidly becoming the key to competitive 
differentiation. With more data to store in increasingly large and complex 
formats for longer periods of time, traditional storage solutions are not able 
to adequately address all the user cases and needs.
SUSE Storage, built on Ceph technology, is a unique solution with resilient 
self-managing and self-healing capabilities combined with ﬂexibility to 
dynamically utilize both existing hardware as well as today’s latest industry 
standard hardware components.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for Open Source software-deﬁned 
storage solutions like SUSE Storage include:
 – Massive data growth – more data volume, complex, large data formats and 
requirements to keep data for longer periods of time for analytics and 
regulatory compliance.
 – Need for ﬂexibility and elasticity – replacing traditional static storage 
appliances when more capacity is needed is simply not tenable in many 
cases. Enterprises require the ability to dynamically add capacity using 
industry standard hardware.
 – Cost and value – traditional storage solutions are often not economically 
scalable when faced with the massive data growth, larger complex data 
formats and need for longer term storage.
28 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
CEO Review – SUSE Product Portfolio 
continued Systems Management
For mid-sized or larger computing environments, comprehensive systems 
management is a critical factor that many enterprises still struggle to address. 
Considering the complexity of multiple hardware platforms, a wide variety of 
infrastructure technologies and the increasing use of combinations of on 
premise, hosted and public cloud resources, the business challenges are 
signiﬁcant as are the potential beneﬁts.
SUSE Manager is designed with a deep understanding of today’s Linux-based, 
Open Source enterprise infrastructure technologies whether those are used 
on premise, virtualized or in a cloud deployment. SUSE Manager is a powerful 
tool for integrated management and orchestrations of system provisioning, 
monitoring, conﬁguration management, automated patching – all designed to 
support the most complex enterprise and supercomputing scale deployments.
The key drivers behind the demand for systems management solutions like 
SUSE Manager include:
 – Managing complexity – growth in systems (physical, virtual and cloud) and 
new infrastructure technologies like IaaS, Containers, PaaS creates needs 
for new management methodologies (Dev/Ops) and new tooling 
to manage effectively.
 – Maintaining security, Service Level Agreements (“SLAs”) and uptime – to 
be most effective, systems and servers, wherever they are deployed, must 
be secure and able to meet stringent SLAs with maximum uptime.
 – Reducing Operating Expenses (“OPEX”) – the days of manual systems 
management processes are past for any enterprise that needs to also 
innovate and compete. Automation is essential to free up resources and 
control systems management OPEX. 
 – Meeting regulatory compliance requirements – to stay compliant, 
enterprises must have comprehensive monitoring, conﬁguration 
management controls and remediation capabilities in place.
Application Containers
Organizations can improve business agility by adopting a software-deﬁned 
infrastructure approach to support containerization of their applications. 
Container innovation helps to develop and deploy next-generation, cloud native 
container-based applications and to progressively migrate traditional and 
existing apps.
SUSE CaaS Platform, is a development and hosting platform for container-based 
applications and services. The solution lets IT operations and developers 
provision, manage and scale container-based applications and services. The 
solutions consist of three key components – orchestration using Kubernetes, 
a purpose-built operating system (SUSE MicroOS) for microservices and 
containers, and conﬁguration capabilities.
Some of the key drivers creating demand for Application Containers and 
solutions like SUSE CaaS Platform include:
 – Reduced time to market using out-of-the-box container platform 
capabilities that enable customers to implement container orchestration 
using production grade Kubernetes, deploy resilient container services, 
maximize portability, and develop in a trusted computing environment;
 – Increased operational efﬁciency with automation of deployment 
management tasks and full application lifecycle support of containers; and
 – Faster and more automated application releases across different 
infrastructure. Enablement of DevOps for improved application lifecycle 
management. Bridging developers and operations using a single, uniﬁed 
container platform that helps save development and operations time. 
Deployment of microservices and coexistence of conﬁguration and code.
SUSE – Key Performance Metrics

International and Asia Paciﬁc & Japan regions have shown strong growth 
in revenue of 28.0% and 28.9% respectively. Growth in these regions was 
derived across all routes to markets together with securing new business with 
large enterprise accounts. We are pleased to note that the change to specializing 
and aligning the ﬁeld sales and marketing resources to SUSE in the Asia 
Paciﬁc & Japan has enabled setting the foundation for sustained proﬁtable 
revenue growth. 
Revenue growth in North America was lower than expected, with some of the 
larger transactions not closing within the ﬁscal year as expected. We expect 
to see continuing growth in FY18. 
TCV and ACV
TCV represents the gross billings for the year of $339.1m, an increase of 
1 1.6% from the pro-forma CCY for FY16 of $303.8m. The weighted average 
contract duration marginally reduced to 28 months in FY17 from 29 months 
in FY16. The ‘in ﬁscal year yield’ from TCV to revenue remained broadly the 
same at 34% in FY17 as it was in FY16. ‘In ﬁscal year yield’ represents the 
proportion of TCV generated in the ﬁscal year that can be recognized as 
Subscription Fee Revenue (“SFR”) in the same ﬁscal year. As the weighted 
average contract duration reduces, we would generally expect to get a higher 
‘in ﬁscal year yield’. Net new subscription TCV increased by 12.4% year-on-
year and renewal subscriptions TCV grew by 10.4% year-on-year. Net new 
subscription contracts are derived from sale of subscriptions to new logo 
customers and existing customers expanding footprint of existing product 
portfolio or subscribing to new product solutions. 
ACV measures the ﬁrst 12 months duration equivalent of TCV. ACV grew to 
$220.1m, an increase of 15.7% from the pro-forma CCY for FY16 of $190.3m. 
ACV removes the impact of multi-year TCV and is a cleaner KPI on the 
performance of the business. Where subscription term is less than 12 months, 
all of the subscription TCV billing is included in the ACV measure.

CEO Review – SUSE Product Portfolio 
continued North America had below expected performance on TCV and ACV, declining 
by 14.6% and 4.8% respectively. Timing of some of the larger enterprise 
multi-year renewals together with deferral of some of the larger enterprise 
deals contributed to this decline. 
International achieved strong TCV and ACV growth at 33.8% and 31.9% 
respectively. Good solid performance across all countries in the region 
together with closing of some large enterprise deals contributed to this 
outstanding growth.
Asia Paciﬁc & Japan had very strong performance in TCV and ACV, growing 
by 31.1% and 37.6% respectively. We continue to have strong performance in 
China and Japan, and are also continuing to win new accounts in some of the 
other key markets in the region. The region continues to get good traction and 
growing revenue streams on local OEM relationships and also by leveraging 
the global agreements we have in place with key independent hardware 
vendors and cloud service providers.

Direct represents customers that have a master licence agreement with SUSE 
and subscribe directly with SUSE or via authorized fulﬁllment partners.
Indirect represents customers that subscribe via the SUSE Value Added 
Reseller network and predominantly through a two tier distribution model.
Global Service Partners represents primarily Independent Hardware 
Vendors who sell SUSE subscriptions alongside the sale of their respective 
hardware and subscriptions generated from cloud service providers.
OEM (Embedded Systems) represents entities that embed SUSE 
subscriptions within the sale of their respective specialized appliance offerings.
We continue to see signiﬁcant growth in Direct, Indirect and Global Service 
Partners routes to market, growing by 14.0%, 20.5% and 13.6% respectively. 
We also see a trend of customers, who purchased subscriptions at the outset 
direct and through Value Added Resellers, subsequently subscribing through 
Global Service Partners. We continue to see strength in the Value Added 
Reseller network, where we have seen signiﬁcant growth in ACV during the 
ﬁscal year.
OEM (Embedded Systems) transactions tend to be large, custom, specialized 
and binary in nature, and thus year-on-year ﬂuctuations in ACV generated are 
to be expected.
In aggregate the ACV mix by route to market remains stable in the year ended 
30 April 2017 compared to the year ended 30 April 2016 as we saw 
homogenous contribution to SUSE’s growth from the various routes to market.

of 32.5%. This is compared to the year ended 30 April 2016 pro-forma CCY 
Adjusted Operating Proﬁt of $79.9m, which is an increase of $18.8m (23.5%). 
Proﬁt margin improved to 32.5%, an increase of 0.6% (2016: 31.9%). We 
have seen a signiﬁcant increase in directly managed costs in SUSE that is 
consistent with the continuation of investments being made to deliver the 
SUSE growth charter. Reduction in allocation of centrally managed costs is a 
combination of Asia Paciﬁc & Japan moving to directly managed costs from 
allocated costs in FY16 together with some synergy beneﬁts and efﬁciencies 
driving reduced allocation of costs for centrally managed functions.

Deferred revenue
We continue to have year on year steady growth in the deferred revenue 
balance. At 30 April 2017 SUSE’s total deferred revenue balance was 
$374.3m (2016: $326.8m), an increase of $47.5m (14.5%) year-on-year. 
56.4% of this increase in deferred revenue balance is recognizable revenue 
in the next 12 months and 82.6% recognizable in 24 months.
Headcount
At the end of April 2016, direct headcount in SUSE was 641 increasing to 
936 by 30 April 2017, a net increase of 295 heads (46.0%) in the ﬁscal year, 
which includes the additional heads joining from the OpenATTIC acquisition 
in November 2016 and from the acquisition of OpenStack and Cloud Foundry 
assets in March 2017. The increased investment in direct headcount is 
primarily in Engineering, Product Management, Sales, Marketing, Product 
Marketing and Alliances to address the opportunity we see in the market for 
SUSE’s existing offerings together with new opportunities in OpenStack IaaS, 
Software Deﬁned Distributed Storage based on Ceph technology and with 
public cloud service providers. 
In addition to the direct headcount, the SUSE portfolio received in the year 
ended 30 April 2017 support from SUSE dedicated employees, who are 
organizationally aligned in the shared service functions of the Group. Most 
prominently in Renewal Sales, Consulting, Customer Care, Sales Operations 
and other corporate operations functions. These add up to approximately 
201 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”), which brings the total SUSE dedicated 
headcount supporting the SUSE business and customers to approximately 
1,137 FTEs at the end of April 2017.

CEO Review – SUSE Product Portfolio 
continued Recruitment and on-boarding
The successful execution of the growth charter and investment plan for SUSE 
depends on the ability to ﬁll the new, incremental positions in a timely fashion 
and thus ramping up our capacity in key areas of the business. 
To build on the momentum of this year we need to improve our ability to grow 
our team. To this end changes have been initiated, that will have a positive 
impact on the recruitment and on-boarding of new employees to the SUSE 
business as well as ongoing, quality HR management of the enlarged team 
that shall beneﬁt from those changes. This includes hiring of a VP HR 
dedicated to the SUSE business in Q3 FY17, closer alignment of shared 
HR service functions with the SUSE business and organization as well as 
deploying additional HR management and recruitment employees paired 
with an increase of third party recruitment spending.
Outlook “Sustainable, Proﬁtable Revenue Growth”
We will continue to invest in building out the organization to ensure continuing 
improvements in execution capacity across all major business functions and 
geographies as well as further investment in marketing program spend to drive 
demand generation and build brand awareness for SUSE.
The SUSE portfolio will expand in FY18 to provide a broader range of open 
source SDI solutions paired with improved and more complete management 
tools for the SDI architecture as demanded by our enterprise customers and 
technology partners. Examples include:
 – SUSE OpenStack Cloud Monitoring (launched in May 2017);
 – SUSE Container as a Service Platform (launched in June 2017); and
 – SUSE Cloud Foundry PaaS (scheduled to launch in Q3 of CY 2017).
For FY18 SUSE will focus on the successful execution of SUSE’s mandate for 
sustainable, proﬁtable revenue growth. The objective is to grow revenue ahead 
of growth rates for relevant markets.

Financial performance
Our ﬁnancial performance KPIs helped us to monitor our progress towards our 2017 revenue and EBITDA growth targets. 
Description Metrics Performance
Revenue decline 2017:
(0.9)%
2016:
(2.0)%
Revenue comprises total revenues compared with the prior year at pro-forma constant currency 
(“CCY”).
Adjusted EBITDA margin 2017:
47.2%
2016:
45.2%
Adjusted EBITDA is the Adjusted Operating Proﬁt prior to depreciation and amortization of 
purchased software. The Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by 
revenue for the year on a pro-forma CCY.
Underlying Adjusted 
EBITDA margin
2017:
46.4%
2016:
44.2%
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA removes the impact of net capitalization of product development 
costs and foreign currency gains and losses from Adjusted EBITDA. The Underlying Adjusted 
EBITDA margin represents Underlying Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the year on a 
pro-forma CCY.
Cash conversion 2017:
102.0%
2016:
87 .9%
This ratio is calculated using the cash ﬂows generated from operations divided by Adjusted 
EBITDA less exceptional items – the result indicates that the Group is generating cash from its 
on-going business which can be used to reinvest in the development of the business including 
ﬁnancing acquisitions, funding liabilities and paying dividends to shareholders.
Free cash ﬂow 2017:
$409.2m
2016:
$238.5m
Free cash ﬂow is deﬁned as cash generated from operations less interest paid, bank loan costs, 
tax paid and payment for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
Free cash ﬂow per fully 
diluted share
2017:
$1.724 
2016:
$1.046
Free cash ﬂow divided by the weighted average number of fully diluted shares.
Diluted Adjusted EPS 2017:
175.65c
2016:
146.70c
Diluted Adjusted EPS is calculated by taking proﬁt after tax, prior to exceptional items, 
amortization of purchased intangibles and share based compensation charges, and tax attributable 
to these charges divided by the weighted average number of fully diluted ordinary shares in issue 
during the year. This measure indicates the ability of the Company to continue to adopt a 
progressive dividend policy.
The Company uses several key performance indicators (“KPIs”) internally to monitor the performance of the business against 
our strategy. The movements year-on-year have been explained in the preceding pages. The KPIs that are used with a brief 
description on how they are calculated and the results for the year are as follows:

Risk management overview
The board’s role is to provide entrepreneurial leadership of the 
Group within a framework of prudent and effective controls 
which enables risk to be assessed and managed. During the 
year the board continued to enhance the risk management 
process to ensure that it is robust. Underpinning the operation 
of, and central to, the risk management process is the culture 
of the Group, led by the board, of openness, transparency, 
trust and accountability. On behalf of the board the Audit 
Committee reviews and challenges the effectiveness of the 
risk management process.
The board manages risk in accordance with the Risk Management Framework 
(“RMF”) under the Group’s Risk Management Policy and Procedure. The RMF 
is aligned to the business objectives and strategy. A key component of the RMF 
for the board is that, whilst the RMF enables a robust assessment of risk, it is 
also practical and proportionate. This ensures that the RMF is embedded into 
the day to day business processes across the Group, to drive risk awareness 
and risk culture. The board continues to build upon the RMF to respond to any 
future change in the Group’s risk proﬁle. In the year the board developed its risk 
appetite work and agreed a set of Group level risk appetite statements aligned 
to the Group’s principal risk areas. The statements set out the board’s risk taking 
approach to ensure a balanced view between risk aversion, opportunity and 
gains, against a background of maintaining reputation, ﬁnancial stability and 
compliance. As part of the assurance for the board the operation of the RMF 
is facilitated by an Internal Risk Management function. Individual risks are also 
mapped onto the Internal Audit plan for the year (see page 65 for the report on 
internal control). As part of the risked based internal audit process, the internal 
audit team assesses the gross and net risk ranking assigned by the risk 
owners to underpin the robustness of the operation of the RMF. The RMF is 
also subject to an annual review by Internal Audit. A key area of focus for the 
forthcoming year is to strengthen the three lines of defence (i) risk ownership 
(ii) risk management and compliance, and (iii) internal audit.
Risks are identiﬁed, assessed and recorded by the Micro Focus and SUSE 
Product Portfolios and the Group functions. Each product portfolio director 
and Group function head is responsible for the identiﬁcation, assessment and 
management of risk in their area. Each risk is owned by an individual in that 
area. The process includes the use of risk registers, one to one interviews with 
product portfolio directors, Group function heads and board members. Risks 
are assessed on a gross and net basis against a consistent set of criteria 
deﬁned by the board. The criteria measures likelihood of occurrence against 
potential impact to the Group including ﬁnancial results, strategic plans, 
operations and reputation. Each risk is allocated a risk appetite category and 
a risk tolerance; changes in the risk proﬁle are tracked at each reporting point 
in the year. The assessment includes current and emerging risks, as well as 
internal and external threats. Existing controls and improvement actions are 
recorded on the risk register for each risk.
The RMF contains a continuous cycle of review and reporting over the year. 
No fewer than ﬁve times a year, following one to one interviews with the business 
area directors and Group function heads, the individual risk registers are 
consolidated to form the Group risk proﬁle. The Group risk proﬁle is reported to 
the Executive Directors for monitoring, review and challenge. A report is made 
to every Audit Committee meeting in the year for review and to challenge the 
effectiveness of the RMF and then approval by the board. As part of the RMF 
an annual review of risk is also undertaken, this is aligned with the annual 
review of Internal Audit. These annual reviews focus on areas for improvement 
in the process, as well as the key emerging areas of risk for the Group in the 
year ahead. The board and the Audit Committee also received detailed risk 
assessments as part of reports on material projects. The RMF is set out below.

Principal risks and uncertainties  On 7 September 2016 the Group announced the intention to acquire the 
software business of HPE. This will be a transformational transaction for 
the Group and is currently expected to complete on 1 September 2017. 
The transaction is signiﬁcantly complex as it involves the carve-out of HPE 
Software from HPE, as well as the integration with the Group. To assist in 
managing the risks associated with the transaction the board engaged specialist 
external resources and has set up a dedicated Integration Management Ofﬁce 
(“IMO”). Risks are identiﬁed, owned, assessed and reviewed in accordance with 
the RMF. The IMO runs detailed deep dive integration sessions and risk 
assessments. The Completion of the acquisition, and integration, of HPE 
Software is a key area of principal risks in the forthcoming year. 
The Group faces a number of risks in this area which may include but is not 
restricted to; 
 – Integration of HPE Software with the existing businesses carried on by the 
Group may be more time consuming and costly than anticipated;
 – Closing is subject to a number of conditions which may not be satisﬁed 
or waived;
 – The Group is obliged to pay a termination payment if the Merger Agreement 
is terminated under certain circumstances;
 – Cost and expenses related to the transaction could exceed amounts 
currently estimated;
 – The Group will not be able to recover damages from HPE for any losses 
suffered as a result of a breach of warranty by HPE under the Merger 
Agreement following Completion;
 – There can be no guarantee that the Group Return of Value will be executed 
as planned or at all;
 – The development of IT systems for the HPE Software and the integration 
of the Group’s existing IT systems with HPE Software’s IT systems could 
be subject to delays or difﬁculties;
 – The Group may fail to realize the anticipated beneﬁts of the Merger;
 – HPE Software may not perform in line with expectations prior to or 
following the Completion;
 – Integration and implementation of the business strategies of the Group 
and HPE Software could fail or not achieve the objectives of the Group;
 – The transaction may result in a loss of customers for the Group;
 – Third parties may terminate or seek to modify existing contracts with 
HPE Software as a result of transaction;
 – The Group could incur operational difﬁculties or losses if HPE were unable 
to perform under the agreements entered into as part of the separation of 
HPE software from HPE;
 – The Group may be negatively affected if HPE Software is unable to 
obtain the same types and level of beneﬁts, services and resources that 
historically have be provided by HPE, or may be unable to obtain them 
at the same cost;
 – The Group will have an ongoing relationship with HPE following the 
Completion and, as a result, the future state of actions of HPE or any 
successor of HPE could adversely affect the Group;
 – The Group is exposed to funding risks in relation to its pension schemes;
 – The Group will be listing ADS’s on the NYSE which may result in liquidity in 
the market being adversely effected by maintaining two exchange listings;
 – Any future issue of shares may further dilute the holdings of the Group 
shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of the 
Group’s shares;
 – The Group may in certain circumstances be obliged to indemnify HPE for 
tax liabilities relating to the separation of HPE Software from HPE, which 
could be material;
 – The Group will be subject to potentially signiﬁcant restrictions relating to 
tax issues that could limit the Group’s ability to undertake certain corporate 
actions (such as the issuance of Micro Focus Shares or Micro Focus ADSs 
or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation) that otherwise could be 
advantageous to the Group;
 – The U.S. tax authorities may seek to treat the Group as a U.S. corporation 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Merger, which could 
result in material additional tax costs to the Group; 
 – Legislative or other governmental action in the U.S. could adversely affect 
the Group’s business; and
 – The tax rate that will apply to the Group is uncertain and may vary 
from expectations.
Following Completion of the acquisition of HPE Software, the Group intends 
to change its ﬁnancial year end to 31 October and will report an 18 month 
ﬁnancial period ending 31 October 2018.
As a consequence of Completion the Group will also be listed on the NYSE 
and, subject to Completion and the proposed change in ﬁnancial year end to 
31 October, the Group will need to put in place a system of internal controls 
which is compliant with the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002 (SOX) by 31 October 
2019. The Group has engaged specialist external resource to assist with the 
planning and implementation of SOX compliant internal controls. Preliminary 
work on SOX compliant internal controls has commenced as mentioned on 
page 66 in the report on internal controls. There may be other risks which 
emerge in the future. 
The risks above may result in an adverse impact on the principal risks and 
uncertainties for the Group set out below.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group, in common with all businesses, could be affected by risks and 
uncertainties that may have a material effect on its business operations and 
achieving its strategic objectives including its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. These risks could cause actual results to 
differ materially from forecasts or historic results. The board is mindful of the 
interdependencies of some risks. Where possible, the Group seeks to mitigate 
these risks through its RMF and internal controls, but this can only provide 
reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance against material losses.

Risk  
To remain successful the Group must ensure that its products continue to meet the requirements of customers. Investment in research and innovation in 
product development is essential to meet customer and partner requirements in order to maximize revenues and corporate performance. The Group has 
a large number of products, at differing stages of their life cycle. The extent of investment in each product set needs to be managed and prioritized 
considering the expected future prospects, to ensure an effective balance between growth and legacy products.
Potential impact Mitigation
If products do not meet the requirements of 
customers they will seek alternative solutions, 
resulting in the loss of new revenue 
opportunities and the cancellation of existing 
contracts. Insufﬁcient focus on key research 
and development projects may damage the 
long-term growth prospects of the Group. 
The Group continued to improve the interaction between Product Management, Product 
Development, Sales and Marketing. The Group’s structured approach to managing its 
products was further enhanced during the year to ensure alignment to the Four Box Model. 
The Group operates as two product portfolios Micro Focus and SUSE. All of Micro Focus’s 
products are managed through the global product management and development 
organization, with a geographic GTM organization. To capitalize on the growth potential of the 
SUSE Product Portfolio these are managed separately and dedicated resources concentrate 
on the development, customer care and sales, marketing and engineering. 
At Micro Focus on 2 May 2016 we completed the acquisition of Serena, a leading provider 
of Application Lifecycle Management products. On 30 September 2016 we completed the 
acquisition of GWAVA a leading company in email security and enterprise information 
archiving based in the US, Canada and Germany.
At SUSE on 1 November 2016 we acquired OpenATTIC storage management and 
engineering talent from the company it-novum. On 7 September 2016 it was announced 
that SUSE was to become HPE’s preferred Linux partner and explore additional collaboration. 
On 30 November 2016 it was announced that it had reached agreement with HPE on the 
acquisition of technology and talent to expand SUSE’s OpenStack Infrastructure-as-a-service 
solution and accelerate SUSE’s entry to the Cloud Foundry Platform-as-a-service market. 
The acquisition was completed on 8 March 2017. SUSE also appointed a dedicated Chief 
Technology Ofﬁcer in the year. Go to Market (“GTM”) models  
Risk
For the Group to succeed in meeting revenue and growth targets it requires successful GTM models across the full product portfolio, with effective 
strategies and plans to exploit channel opportunities and focus the sales force on all types of customer categories. In addition, effective GTM models 
may be more successful if accompanied by compelling Micro Focus and SUSE brand awareness programmes.
Potential impact Mitigation
Poor execution of GTM plans may limit the 
success of the Group by targeting the wrong 
customers through the wrong channels and 
using the wrong product offerings.
The business operates under a global product group with geographic GTM sales 
organizations. Revenue plans are supported by a range of measures to monitor and drive 
improvements in GTM operating models in both Micro Focus and SUSE. The dedicated sales 
teams operate by portfolio but management are targeted on the sales of both Micro Focus 
and SUSE Product Portfolios. Operationally there are quarterly business reviews with all 
geographies and monthly reviews with regional presidents, the President of Sales for Micro 
Focus and SUSE participate in their respective weekly management team meetings to review 
sales performance and GTM priorities. 
Customer sales cycles are reviewed regularly and a bid review process is in place to monitor 
and maximize customer revenue opportunities. In addition to sales performance reviews, 
marketing and product development programmes are assessed regularly to optimize levels 
of qualiﬁed pipeline and ensure that marketing programmes are supported by appropriate 
product offerings. 
A series of measures are in place to focus the direction of the sales force towards a broad 
range of customer categories. These measures include detailed bid management, tailored 
quota targets and robust pre-sales management. 
In addition, brand awareness programmes are in place and reviewed on an on-going basis to 
draw on differentiated and consistent PR plans across key geographies. These are supported 
by targeted industry analyst relations to reach and raise Micro Focus and SUSE brand 
awareness through key marketplace inﬂuencers. Brand building is also supported by growing 
a customer reference programme and online programmes such as effective search engine 
optimization, use of social media and improved corporate websites. 
The Product to Market process is standardized so that execution is on a consistent basis. 
Micro Focus continued to run the internal sales certiﬁcation programme, to improve the level 
of expertise across the sales force and the Micro Focus Sales Academy, the initiative through 
which it hires graduate sales representatives to enhance the sales capability and train up new 
talent with the potential to progress within the sales organization.
At SUSE a President of Global Sales was appointed in the year. A new Partner Programme 
strategy was also implemented across the business.

39 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Competition   
Risk
Comprehensive information about the markets in which Micro Focus and SUSE operate is required for the Group to assess competitive risks effectively 
and to perform successfully. 
Potential impact Mitigation
Failure to understand the competitive 
landscape adequately and thereby identify 
where competitive threats exist may damage 
the successful sales of the Group’s products.
Group product plans contain analysis of competitive threats and subscriptions to industry 
analyst ﬁrms are leveraged to better understand market dynamics and competitor strategies. 
In addition, customer contact programmes are analyzed for competitive intelligence. Micro 
Focus and SUSE continue to monitor and review intelligence on market threats to focus on 
offering best in class service to customers.
Employees   
Risk
The retention and recruitment of highly skilled and motivated employees, at all levels of the Group, is critical to the success and future growth of the Group 
in all countries in which it operates. Employees require clear business objectives, and a well communicated vision and values, for the Group to achieve 
alignment and a common sense of corporate purpose among the workforce.
Potential impact Mitigation
Failure to retain and develop skill sets, 
particularly in sales and research and 
development may hinder the Group’s sales 
and development plans. Weak organizational 
alignment and inadequate incentivization 
may lead to poor performance and instability. 
It could also have an adverse impact on the 
realization of strategic plans.
The Group has policies in place to help ensure that it is able to attract and retain employees 
of a high calibre with the required skills. These policies include training, career development 
and long-term ﬁnancial incentives. Leadership training schemes are in place to support 
management development and succession plans. The Group also has in place a performance 
management and appraisal system. The measures for talent management will continue to be 
enhanced to ensure a rigorous recruitment and retention process which is aligned to business 
as usual as well as the strategic plans for the Group. Succession plans have been developed 
and are in place for key leadership positions within the Company.
In the year the Group took signiﬁcant action to develop its management capability both 
internally, by training and promotions, and through external hires. In the year the Group 
appointed a dedicated HR Talent Manager.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued Business strategy and 
change management
Risk
The Group is engaged in a number of major change projects including acquisitions to grow the business by strengthening the portfolio of products and 
capabilities, IT projects and projects to standardize systems and processes. The successful integration of businesses will build a solid base for further 
expansion. These projects expose the Group to transformation risks. The acquisition of HPE Software is a complex transaction with a range of integration risks.
Potential impact Mitigation
Failure to analyze, execute and co-ordinate 
the various projects successfully may result in 
the disruption of the ongoing business without 
delivering the beneﬁts of the operational 
efﬁciencies and/or commensurate increase in 
revenues. In addition this may affect the ability 
to execute strategic plans for growth.
The risk increased in the year to reﬂect the 
risks associated with the acquisition of 
HPE Software.
The Group has an established acquisition strategy and focus on efﬁcient execution in the 
mature infrastructure software products. The Group announced the acquisition of HPE 
Software on 7 September 2016 and Completion is currently expected to be 1 September 2017.
The project is run in the dedicated IMO by an appropriately experienced team, utilizing 
external resources as required. There are detailed and robust governance disciplines around 
each project. The board monitors and reviews progress. The Group has a dedicated Group 
Business Operations and Integration Director to ensure that execution of the various projects 
are successfully aligned so as to minimize any disruption to business as usual. 
On 17 January 2017 Chris Hsu was announced as the CEO of the Enlarged Group (following 
Completion of the acquisition of HPE Software) at the same time Stephen Murdoch will 
become COO of the Enlarged Group, part of a strong and fully aligned leadership team to 
deliver the full potential of the transaction.
IT systems and information 
Risk
The Group’s operations, as most businesses, are dependent on maintaining and protecting the integrity and security of the IT systems and management 
of information. The Group may experience a major breach of system security or cyber-attack. The external threat proﬁle is generally increasing as are the 
regulations around data protection.
Potential impact Mitigation
Disruption to the IT systems could adversely 
affect business and Group operations in a 
variety of ways, which may result in an adverse 
impact on revenues and reputational damage.
The risk increased in the year to reﬂect the 
increase in the general external cyber risk 
environment.
The Group has in place a highly skilled technology team which constantly monitors and 
reviews the performance and availability of the Group IT systems including any risk of 
cyber-attack. Policies and processes are in place for the protection of business and personal 
information. The Group has in place well established and tested business continuity plans. 
The Group seeks to mitigate cyber risks with a range of measures including monitoring of 
threats and testing of cyber response procedures and equipment.

41 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Intellectual property 
Risk
Failure to adequately protect the Group’s Intellectual Property and brands. Some of the Group’s products utilize Open Source technology which is 
dependent upon third party developers.
Potential impact Mitigation
Failure could adversely affect the ability of the 
Group to compete in the market place and 
affect the Group’s revenue and reputation.
There are procedures in place across the Group to ensure the appropriate protection and use 
of the Group’s brands and intellectual property, which are monitored by the IP Panel and 
Legal team. 
Treasury  
Risk
The Group operates across a number of jurisdictions and so is exposed to currency ﬂuctuations.
The risk of foreign exchange ﬂuctuations may be increased as a result of Brexit.
The Group targets a Net Debt to Facility EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times and may require additional debt funding in order to execute its acquisition strategy. 
Potential impact Mitigation
The relative values of currencies can ﬂuctuate 
and may have a signiﬁcant impact on 
business results.
Insufﬁcient access to funding could limit the 
Group’s ability to achieve its desired capital 
structure or to complete acquisitions.
The Group’s operations are diversiﬁed across a number of currencies. Changes in foreign 
exchange rates are monitored and exposures regularly reviewed and actions taken to reduce 
exposures where necessary. The Group provides extensive constant currency reporting to 
enable investors to better understand the underlying business performance.
The Group has signiﬁcant committed facilities in place, the earliest of which matures in 
November 2021 and sufﬁcient headroom to meet its operational requirements.
The Group seeks to maintain strong relationships with its key banking partners and lenders 
and to proactively monitor the loan markets.
The Group also has strong engagement with the providers of equity capital, which represents 
an alternative source of capital.
Legal and regulatory compliance 
Risk
The Group operates across a number of jurisdictions. Compliance with national and regional laws and regulations is essential to successful business operations.
Potential impact Mitigation
Failure to comply could result in civil or 
criminal sanctions as well as possible ﬁnes 
and reputational damage.
The Group has in place policies and procedures to mitigate these risks. The Group’s legal and 
regulatory team, enhanced by specialist external advisors as required, monitor and review 
compliance. There is a Compliance Committee and a Market Abuse and Insider Dealing 
Committee which report into the board. All staff are subject to mandatory compliance training. 
During the year the Group established an executive Financial Reporting Group (FRG) to 
monitor, review and manage the risks associated with ﬁnancial reporting across the Group. 
The FRG reports to the audit committee.
42 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Principal risks and uncertainties 
continued Macro-economic environment 
Risk
The Group operates a global business and is exposed to a variety of external economic and political risks which may affect the Group’s business operations 
and execution of the strategy. 
Potential impact Mitigation
Adverse economic conditions could affect 
sales, and other external economic or political 
matters, such as price controls, could affect 
the business and revenues.
The risk increased in the year to reﬂect 
Brexit and the potential general external 
political environment.
The spread of jurisdictions allows the Group to be ﬂexible to adapt to changing localized risk 
to a certain extent. The Group has business continuity plans and crisis management 
procedures in place in the event of political events or natural disasters.
The Group have a Brexit Working Group with processes in place to assess, respond, monitor 
and track the impact of Brexit on our businesses, and associated risks, as matters progress 
and how the business can seek to mitigate these risks. 
Tax  
Risk
The tax treatment of the Group’s cross-border operations is subject to the risk of challenge under tax rules and initiatives targeting multinationals’ tax 
arrangements, including the OECD’s Base Erosion and Proﬁt Shifting project and EU state aid rules.
Potential impact Mitigation
Tax liabilities in various territories in which the 
Group operates could be signiﬁcantly higher 
than expected.
Tax laws, regulations and interpretations are kept under ongoing review by the Group and 
its advisors. The Group reviews its operations, including the structuring of intra-group 
arrangements, on a periodic basis to ensure that risks are identiﬁed and mitigated 
accordingly. External professional advice is obtained to support positions taken in ﬁnancial 
statements and local tax returns where there is signiﬁcant uncertainty or risk of challenge.

43 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The context for the assessment
The Group’s business model and strategy are central to an 
understanding of its prospects, and details can be found on 
pages 3 to 10. 
The Group’s current overall strategy has been in place for several years 
and there are no planned changes to this strategy. The Group delivered an 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA of $640.9m in the year and management 
and staff are incentivized to grow this in future years.
The board continues to take a conservative approach to the Group’s strategy 
where the focus is about stabilization of revenues in FY18 and a small revenue 
growth thereafter coupled with a focus on cost control. Decisions relating to 
major new projects and investments are made with a low appetite for risk and 
are subject to escalating system of approvals, including short payback periods. 
Acquisitions will be considered but they need to meet the Group’s stringent 
return on investment criteria.
In performing the below analysis, the Directors have made certain assumptions 
around the availability of future funding options including the ability to raise 
future ﬁnance. Furthermore, the analysis was based on the existing 
Micro Focus International plc before the proposed merger with HPE Software. 
In preparation for the proposed merger with HPE Software we have completed 
a due diligence process including a review of the strategy, risks and cash ﬂows 
of the business and do not consider that the proposed merger, including its 
funding, will have an impact on the overall viability of the Group.
The assessment process and key assumptions
The Group’s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic plan and 
annual budget process. This process includes an annual review of the ongoing 
plan, led by the executive directors and all relevant functions are involved, 
including GTM, Product Group, Marketing, Finance, IT, Human Resources, 
Legal, Treasury and Risk. The board participates fully in the annual process 
by means of discussion at the September, February and April board meetings, 
with the September meeting being a two day event. Part of the board’s role 
is to consider whether the plan continues to take appropriate account of the 
external environment including macroeconomic and technological changes.
The output of the annual review process produces an annual budget for next 
year and ﬁnancial forecasts for the subsequent two years assuming no further 
acquisitions. The latest updates to the strategic plan were ﬁnalized in April 
2017 following this year’s review and as part of the debt reﬁnancing and fund 
raising. This considered the Group’s current position and development of the 
business as a whole over the next three years.
As a result of this focus, ﬁnancial forecasts were prepared for a three year 
period and these were discussed at the board meeting in April 2017. The ﬁrst 
year of the ﬁnancial forecasts forms the Group’s operating budget and is 
subject to a re-forecast at the end of every quarter.
The key assumptions in the ﬁnancial forecasts, reﬂecting the overall 
strategy include:
 – Continued signiﬁcant revenue growth in the SUSE Product Portfolio 
with continued cost investment;
 – Continued revenue decline in the Micro Focus Product Portfolio with cost 
savings being achieved each year; and
 – Successful Completion of the debt reﬁnancing.
In assessing the Group’s viability the board has considered the principal risks 
as set out on pages 36 to 43.
Assessment of viability
Although the strategic plan represents the directors’ best estimate of the 
future prospects of the business, they have also tested the potential impact on 
the Group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan, 
by quantifying their ﬁnancial impact and overlaying this on the detailed ﬁnancial 
forecasts in the plan. These scenarios included various ‘severe but plausible’ 
circumstances that the Group could experience, including:
 – Lower revenue growth in the SUSE Product Portfolio;
 – Higher revenue decline in the Micro Focus Product Portfolio; and
 – Lower EBITDA growth.
The results of this stress testing showed that, due to the stability of the core 
business, the Group would be able to withstand the impact of these scenarios 
occurring over the next three years by making adjustments to its operating 
plans within the normal course of business.
The Group also considered a number of scenarios that would represent serious 
threats to its liquidity. None of these were considered to be plausible.
This viability assessment takes into account all the committed expenditure of 
the Group together with corporate transaction costs securing the Completion 
of the proposed merger with HPE Software. As noted above, it does not 
include the ﬁnancial results, position and prospects of HPE entities subject of 
the merger nor the New Facilities as mentioned on pages 18 and 19 that have 
been arranged in connection with the proposed merger. However, as noted 
above, in preparation for the proposed merger with HPE Software we have 
completed a due diligence process including a review of the strategy, risks and 
cash ﬂows of the business and do not consider that the proposed merger, 
including its funding, will have an impact on the overall viability of the Group.
Viability statement
Based on their assessments of prospects and viability above, the directors 
conﬁrm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next 
three year period ending 30 April 2020.
Going concern
The directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the ﬁnancial 
statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the accounting 
policies in the ﬁnancial statements.
44 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Viability statement  During the year ended 30 April 2017, Micro Focus’ Corporate 
Social Responsibility (“CSR”) programme has developed to 
address the additional scale of the Company following the 
acquisition of Serena. This focus follows the trend of the prior 
year to 30 April 2016, in which CSR activities were planned 
and driven primarily by the integration of TAG. The TAG 
acquisition quadrupled Micro Focus’ workforce and trebled 
its revenues. Looking forward, following the acquisition of 
HPE Software which is currently expected to complete on 
1 September 2017, Micro Focus’ CSR programme will need 
to scale further and address the expanded operations of the 
Group. Post Completion, Micro Focus will again more than 
treble its workforce and revenues. The CSR Committee is 
developing an appropriate programme to address the 
forthcoming integration challenges, recognize the increased 
relevance and impact of the Group and monitor, improve and 
report on progress going forward.
CSR activities are monitored and planned in four key areas: the Environment, 
Charity and Community Support, the Marketplace and Suppliers, and 
Employees and Ethics. The Corporate Responsibility Policy can be found on 
the Micro Focus website (www.microfocus.com/about/responsibility). 
Micro Focus is committed to complying with relevant CSR legislation across 
its global operations and strives to achieve standards over and above 
required levels. 
During the year ended 30 April 2017 the CSR committee met twice to agree 
priorities and progress activities and the CSR programme was reviewed at 
two board meetings during the year. Karen Slatford, the senior independent 
non-executive director, is responsible at board level for CSR and also chairs 
CSR committee meetings. Tom Virden, formerly, a non-executive director, 
also participated in the CSR committee to provide additional board level input 
until he resigned on 25 April 2017.
Micro Focus products can help customers to reduce their IT carbon footprint 
and these beneﬁts feature in conversations with existing customers, prospects, 
partners and suppliers. Employees regularly participate in CSR initiatives and 
internal communications regularly feature CSR topics. 
Micro Focus continues to work with the Carbon Trust and as a result of 
changes to our operational boundaries and increased acquisition activity 
Micro Focus narrowly missed achieving the “Carbon Trust Standard” this time 
round. However, Micro Focus has continued to build on our success and is 
committed to reducing our environmental emissions. 
Micro Focus continues to be a member of the FTSE4Good Index, the 
responsible investment index calculated by global index provider FTSE Group. 
Outlined below is the CSR progress that Micro Focus has made in the year 
ended 30 April 2017 across the four focus areas.
CSR progress in the year ended 30 April 2017
Environment
This ﬁnancial year is the second to incorporate environmental reporting that 
relates to the enlarged operations resulting from the acquisition of TAG, an 
organization that, historically, did not collect the data required for environmental 
disclosure. In addition the group has seen further expansion through the 
acquisitions of Serena, GWAVA, OpenATTIC and OpenStack. 
Micro Focus products and services help customers to reduce their carbon 
footprint and adopt carbon friendly IT strategies by enabling greater efﬁciency 
and longer life from existing technology and equipment. In turn, Micro Focus 
continues to develop its own policies to record, monitor and achieve 
improvements in its own carbon footprint. 
Micro Focus’ energy conservation is focused on energy efﬁciencies to drive 
down total energy consumption. The importance of reducing energy 
consumption levels is underlined within the Group by sharing data and seeking 
employee guidance on how to reduce our consumption within the boundaries 
of our operational control. For example, all staff are encouraged to turn off all 
electrical equipment at weekends and over the holiday periods – a scheme 
which has been adopted worldwide. In the last reporting year we extended our 
partnership with the Carbon Trust and entered into the UK Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”) as early adopters to ensure we maximize the 
beneﬁts that an ESOS Audit can produce. We used the audit ﬁndings in our 
energy roadmap for driving down our carbon output during the year ended 
30 April 2017, achieving an overall reduction across the expanded Group.

45 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate social responsibility  Key points for the 12 months to 30 April 2017:
 – Building on previous success in reducing environmental emissions, 
Micro Focus continued its commitment to the Carbon Trust by applying for 
re-certiﬁcation despite the increased level of operational activity across the 
expanded Group during the ﬁnancial year;
 – Micro Focus will complete its ninth year of commitment to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (“CDP”), underlining the Group’s commitment to further 
raise awareness of the importance of and manage emission reductions 
across global facilities;
 – CDP scores have improved year-on-year since joining CDP in 2009. In this 
reporting period Micro Focus will once again, report a decrease in absolute 
year-on-year emissions within this year’s CDP submission. This is the result 
of the operational boundary changes that impacted the previous reporting 
period across the enlarged Group; 
 – Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reported to CDP;
 – On-going commitment to promote electronic product distribution has 
delivered the Group’s highest ever result for the year. This reporting period 
98.84% of software products were distributed electronically, with just over 
1% delivered to customers via physical distribution;
 – Further improvements across all locations either by moving to more modern 
and efﬁcient ofﬁce environments or by improving the ofﬁce environments 
already in use. Part of Micro Focus’ decision making process when sourcing 
locations is to identify LEED ratings wherever possible. In recent years four 
ofﬁce relocations have been from buildings with no LEED rating to sites 
with Silver, Gold and Platinum ratings;
 – Continued landlord performance monitoring in all locations where 
Micro Focus operations are sited in multi-tenant premises;
 – Despite the increase in the size of the Group, further progress has been 
made continuing the consolidation of the data-centre power programme, 
thereby improving efﬁciencies and reducing cost and consumption. This 
includes the reduction of the quantity of dedicated server “environments” 
across the wider Group to signiﬁcantly lessen the footprint impact; and
 – Additional capital carbon projects took place in this reporting period. 
Lighting upgrade projects were evaluated and delivered, including the 
completion of the initial pilot that took place in the Belfast ofﬁce. Following 
on from this successful project, Micro Focus’ headquarters ofﬁce in 
Newbury is now on a pilot for evaluation. 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GGE”)
For this reporting year we have maintained our methodology for reporting 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. On a like for like basis, across the entire 
Group, Micro Focus achieved a 3.6% reduction in energy consumption for this 
reporting year. On an actual comparison of the reported Group in FY16, due to 
organizational boundary changes, the UK, China and the US made a strong 
contribution to the overall decrease in consumption from the previous period. 
This section includes Micro Focus’ mandatory reporting of GGE 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors Report) Regulations 2013.
Reporting year
The Green House Gas (“GHG”) reporting year is the same as Micro Focus’ 
ﬁscal year being 1 May 2016 to 30 April 2017 to align with Financial Reporting 
and the relevant CDP Reporting timeframe.
Organizational boundary and responsibility
In accordance with the deﬁnitional requirements of the “regulations”, in respect 
of emissions for which Micro Focus is responsible, emissions data is reported 
using an Operational Control approach to deﬁne the Organizational Boundary.
All material emission sources over which Micro Focus deems to have 
operational control are in scope. These sources are deﬁned as the purchase 
of electricity, heat, steam or cooling for the operation of facilities and the 
combustion of fuel for that operation of facilities. Processes are being 
established to track other sources of emissions such as commercial ﬂights 
for business travel, which is not presently covered in this data.
Methodology
The methodology used to calculate emissions is based on the most current set 
of regulations published by the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs 
(“DEFRA”) relating to relevant reporting periods. For consistency, in this 
reporting period our emissions have been calculated solely using DEFRA’s 
conversion tables published on their website, rather than as in previous periods 
where the energy company’s individual fuel mix was used. 
46 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Corporate social responsibility 
continued Scope of reporting emissions
Following the acquisition of TAG in November 2014, Micro Focus’ operational 
infrastructure approximately trebled in size. On a like-for-like basis Micro Focus’ 
energy consumption was lower in the 12 months to 30 April 2017 than during the 
previous reporting year by 0.1%, with best practice across the entire real estate 
and targeted employee communication, staff focused on reducing emissions. 
Since TAG had no environmental reporting requirements or tools to monitor 
and measure energy consumption, the Company has, where possible, 
implemented the same systems and processes that heritage Micro Focus used 
in the past to have these operational across the entire organization. This work 
is helping with the ability to monitor and report on year-on-year comparisons 
going forward.
During the year ended 30 April 2017, Micro Focus made progress on reducing 
the merged Company’s carbon footprint by reducing the overall real estate of 
the wider Group, integrating locations wherever possible. This delivered a net 
reduction across all operations. Total UK data for the Group delivered a 9.9% 
reduction in absolute consumption, a direct result of the integration strategy. 
Micro Focus reports emissions data on all locations where available, 
irrespective of the size of the Micro Focus facility. For smaller locations 
where no such data is available from managed serviced ofﬁces, or where 
Micro Focus is part of a multi-tenant occupancy building, or where stafﬁng 
levels are less than 10, the mean average per head is extrapolated out from 
all other locations.
Locations and approach taken:
Actual emissions data used – Bangalore (India), Beijing (China), Belfast 
(Northern Ireland), Cambridge (US), Dublin (Ireland), Düsseldorf (Germany), 
Ennis (Ireland), Galway (Ireland), Haifa (Israel), Hillsboro (US), Hong Kong 
(China), Johannesburg (South Africa), Kiev (Ukraine), Lisle (US), Milan (Italy), 
Mumbai (India), New Delhi (India), Newbury (UK), Nuremburg (Germany), 
Paris x 2, (France), Prague (Czech Republic), Provo (US), Rockville (US), 
Singapore (Singapore), Soﬁa (Bulgaria), Stockholm (Sweden), St. Albans (UK) 
and Troy (US).
The following locations are out of scope due to size and or lack of availability 
of information:
Where the data is not available, the same intensity ratio is used for the location 
on a headcount basis. Average UK CO
2
/head multiplied by headcount – 
Alphen den Rijn (Netherlands), Austin (US), Bellingham (US), Brasilia (Brazil), 
Brighton (US), Burlington (US), Cape Town (South Africa), Linz (Austria), Lyon 
(France), Columbus (US), Costa Mesa (US), Dubai (UAE), Edinburgh (UK), 
Geneva (Switzerland), Hanau (Germany), Horscholm (Denmark), Houston 
(US), Ismaning (Germany), Lisbon (Portugal), Loveland (US), Madrid (Spain), 
Melbourne (Australia), Mount Pleasant (US), New York (US), Oslo (Norway), 
Rome (Italy), Rotterdam (Netherlands), Santa Clara (US), São Paulo (Brazil), 
Seattle (US), Seoul (South Korea), Shanghai (China), Shenzhen (China), South 
Euclid (US), Sydney (Australia), The Hague (Netherlands), Taipei (Taiwan), 
Tokyo (Japan) and Toronto (Canada). 
The following locations are a multi-tenanted site which is sub-let in their entirety 
and is out of scope for this year’s report: Bracknell and Richmond (UK). 
Intensity ratio
To achieve a global picture of emissions, whilst recognizing that not all 
locations can be in scope, an intensity ratio of CO
2
 per tonne/per head has 
been used. As not all entities are revenue generating and not all can calculate 
emissions, this ratio should demonstrate a more comprehensive assessment.
2017 targets
During the year ended 30 April 2017, despite the complexities of the 
increased operational boundaries due to the acquisitions of Serena, GWAVA, 
OpenATTIC and OpenStack. Micro Focus improved on its target to reduce 
year on year emissions. 
During this reporting year we have continued our commitment to both CDP 
and the Carbon Trust. We have maintained our capital budget for investment 
in energy saving initiatives to help us drive further reductions. We continued 
to raise awareness locally across all sites.

47 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Charity and community support
Micro Focus donated over $80,000 (2016: $82,000) to selected charities 
and community support projects during the ﬁnancial year 2017. 
The Company encourages employees to help local communities and support 
relevant charities, chosen in line with agreed criteria and along the guidelines 
of education and local community support. A Charity Committee consisting of 
a range of employees from across the company manages these initiatives in 
two ways:
 – Firstly, on a funds-matching basis for individual employee charitable 
pursuits and awarding community project grants to initiatives put forward 
by employees; and
 – Secondly, by allocating a number of employee days per month to teams or 
individuals to directly beneﬁt a chosen charity or community initiative. 
The programme focused on local community initiatives for the entire year, a 
change from the usual format, encouraging staff to support projects in their 
communities and causes they are actively involved in. In prior years, a portion of 
the Group’s charitable giving has been allocated to global causes. This change 
has been made to recognize employee feedback.
Out of the total level of funds raised, $80,000 supported local and national 
causes across 1 1 countries in Australia, Bulgaria, China, Germany, India, 
Ireland, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, UK and USA.
This is the ﬁfth year that the local “project grants” initiative has been in place 
and in the year ended 30 April 2017, 50 charity or community organizations 
beneﬁted across multiple geographies across Micro Focus Group operations 
around the world. Projects included:
 – In Germany, providing computer equipment to aid and promote educating 
children in computing;
 – In India, supporting a charity project to provide four Indian schools and 
approximately 1,000 children with new shoes and another project 
providing equipment such as school bags and necessary textbooks for 
under-privileged children;
 – Participating in an initiative in Africa to build a community centre for 
education and health education purposes;
 – In the US, supporting the following projects:
 – A Boy Scout Troop in its work with the homeless in the Maryland area;
 – A World Youth Foundation project helping with education and 
community initiatives in the Houston area; and
 – Support material and resources for a community arts program in 
Paso Robles, California.
 – Supporting the development of a Visual and Performing Arts Education 
Program to help children avoid drugs and gang life in Santa Clara; 
 – Participating in a community project in Troy to provide food to 
disadvantaged children to assist with study outside of school hours; and
 – In the UK, supporting the following projects:
 – Funding much needed equipment for a youth football team;
 – Supporting two projects providing recreational space for children;
 – Providing computing equipment to a local school in Newbury; and
 – Helping a project in Northern Ireland in the Belfast area delivering 
computer science knowledge to children aged between nine and 1 1.
Throughout the ﬁnancial year, employees are regularly updated about 
community support and charity initiatives to keep them informed, encourage 
participation, and to provide feedback on the chosen initiatives through 
regular updates on the front page of the Company’s intranet and a dedicated 
charity page. 
In the coming ﬁnancial year, assuming Completion of the HPE Software 
transaction, Micro Focus will develop its charity and community initiatives 
to recognize the increased scale and impact of the Company’s enlarged 
operations on local communities, drawing on the experience of HPE Software 
employees’ engagement in these areas.
Marketplace and suppliers 
Micro Focus products and services continue to help organizations lower their 
energy impact and often customers beneﬁt from a lower carbon footprint. 
Our product portfolio encourages organizations to extract more value from 
their existing technology, avoiding expensive and more carbon intensive 
‘rip and replace’ product introductions.
Employees and ethics 
During the year ended 30 April 2017, Micro Focus has continued its 
integration to bring together employees of TAG and those of heritage 
Micro Focus. The TAG acquisition transformed the size of the organization 
and this has been increased further by the subsequent acquisitions of Serena, 
GWAVA, OpenATTIC and OpenStack. Employee numbers have grown from 
approximately 1,200 employees in October 2014 to more than 4,800 by the 
year ending 30 April 2017. The TAG integration has provided valuable 
experience for the Serena integration which has taken place during FY17. 
Furthermore, this experience is proving very valuable in setting the platform 
for the forthcoming integration of new employees after the Completion of 
the HPE Software transaction scheduled for 1 September 2017, which will 
at least treble staff numbers. 
The substantial integration initiatives progressed in FY17 have been combined 
with recruitment and retention programs through multiple training and 
performance management initiatives across the organization, to support and 
develop employees through a time of substantial change. These HR initiatives 
are designed to develop a culture that provides a rewarding and enjoyable 
working environment for employees who in turn are able to develop their 
careers in a professional and successful organization.

Corporate governance
Section 
Number
3 
—— The board of Micro Focus International plc is committed to 
delivering outstanding shareholder returns and believes this 
is underpinned by high standards of corporate governance 
and a strong corporate governance framework. To support 
this framework, the board has established and embedded 
procedures and processes throughout the whole Group.
During the ﬁnancial year ended 30 April 2017, the key board achievements were:
Shareholder engagement
There has been extensive shareholder engagement that has resulted in 
signiﬁcant new additions to the register, with 30% of our shares now being 
held in North America. In addition there has been engagement with 
shareholders of HPE in anticipation of the merger with HPE Software.
The Company’s market capitalization at 30 April 2017 was £5,944.0m and 
the Micro Focus shareholders prior to the acquisition of TAG who now own 
approximately 56.8% of the Company have seen their investment increase 
from £1,178.6m to £3,376.2m over a period of 32 months. During that period 
they have also received a Return of Value of £83.9m and ordinary dividends 
of £1 19.6m.
Integration of acquired businesses
The Company acquired TAG in November 2014 and Serena in May 2016. 
Since then we have been working hard to ensure shareholders realize the 
beneﬁts of these acquisitions. The key achievements over the last year have 
been the delivery of ﬁnancial results in line with management expectations 
and the announcement and commencement of integration planning for the 
HPE Software transaction.
Acquisition of HPE Software
On 7 September 2016 we announced the intention to acquire the software 
business of HPE. Since that time signiﬁcant effort has been spent on seeking 
required regulatory approvals. This transaction has featured high on the board 
agenda both pre and post announcement. It has also necessitated a reﬁnancing 
and raising of in excess of $5bn of debt. In addition to the HPE transaction 
we have completed three further ‘tuck-in’ acquisitions.
Talent development and succession planning
On 17 January 2017 we announced that Chris Hsu will become CEO on 
Completion of the merger. The board and I have agreed that I will remain as 
Executive Chairman until the publication of the ﬁrst set of Audited Financial 
Statements following Completion. As we move to a 31 October year end this 
will be for the 18 month period ending 31 October 2018, the results of which 
will be published in January 2019.
I believe that the board continues to be well balanced, with a broad range of 
skills and a good understanding of the market in which we operate and the 
challenges which we face.
Board performance evaluation
During the year we completed a board performance evaluation. I have 
received feedback from all of the directors conﬁrming that the process has 
been extremely valuable to the board. The results have been reviewed and 
a number of improvement areas prioritized for 2017/18. 
Board meetings and strategy sessions
Every year in September, an extended board meeting is devoted to 
reviewing aspects of the Group’s strategy and operation in more detail. 
The strategy sessions are an important and valuable part of the Group’s 
continued development.

The board
The biographies of each director can be found on pages 52 and 53. 
As at 17 July 2017, the board comprised nine directors: 
Name Role
Kevin Loosemore Executive Chairman
Mike Phillips Chief Financial Officer
Stephen Murdoch CEO Micro Focus

Amanda Brown Independent non-executive director 
Darren Roos
Independent non-executive director 
(appointed 15 May 2017)
Silke Scheiber
Independent non-executive director 
(appointed 15 May 2017)
In accordance with the Company’s articles of association, all directors are 
subject to election by the shareholders at the ﬁrst AGM of the Company after 
their appointment and to re-election by the shareholders on an annual basis at 
each AGM. Therefore all directors will retire, and seek election or re-election, 
as applicable, at the forthcoming AGM. This practice complies with the 
recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code. All the proposed 
appointees (other than Silke Scheiber and Darren Roos who joined the board 
on 15 May 2017) have been subject to a formal evaluation procedure in the 
last 12 months. Following that procedure the Executive Chairman conﬁrms 
the continuing commitment and effective contribution of the Directors and 
recommends their re-election. In addition, the Directors conﬁrm the continuing 
commitment and effective contribution of the Executive Chairman and 
recommend his re-election. The board also believes in relation to the 
non-executive directors that their skills and experience enable them to 
continue to provide valuable contributions to the board. The board is satisﬁed 
that the non-executive directors exercise rigorous and objective judgment. 
Role of the board 
The Company is controlled by the board, which is principally responsible for 
promoting the long-term success of the Group and its system of corporate 
governance. Although the board does delegate some matters to its committees 
(such as the remuneration, nomination and audit committees), as part of its 
leadership and control of the Company, the board has agreed a list of items 
that are speciﬁcally reserved for its consideration. These include business 
strategy, ﬁnancing arrangements, material acquisitions and divestments, 
approval of the annual budget, major capital expenditure projects, risk 
management, treasury policies and establishing and monitoring internal 
controls. At each meeting, the board reviews progress of the Group towards 
its objectives and receives papers on key subjects in advance of each board 
meeting. These typically cover:
 – Strategy and budgets;
 – Business and ﬁnancial performance;
 – Product plans and development;
 – Corporate activities;
 – Human resources; and
 – Investor relations.
While the board retains overall responsibility for, and control of the Company, 
day-to-day management of the business is conducted by the executive 
directors. Review of the Group’s principal business activities is the responsibility 
of the executive committee. The executive committee comprises the executive 
directors and is chaired by Stephen Murdoch, the CEO of Micro Focus.
Powers of the directors in relation to share capital
Details of the powers of the directors in relation to share capital can be found 
on page 95 of the Directors’ report.
Independent advice
The board has agreed procedures for directors to follow if they believe 
they require independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties and these procedures allow the directors to take such advice at the 
Company’s expense.

55 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Board meetings
For the current period, the board has scheduled meetings on a regular basis, approximately every two months with additional meetings when circumstances and 
business dictate. In months in which the board does not meet, update calls are scheduled to review progress. All directors receive an agenda and board papers 
in advance of meetings to help them make an effective contribution at the meetings. The board makes full use of appropriate technology as a means of updating 
and informing all its members. Board papers are circulated electronically to a tablet device, allowing directors to access documentation more easily and securely. 
The executive directors ensure regular informal contact is maintained with non-executive directors who are invited to accompany the executive directors when 
visiting the Group’s ofﬁces. The non-executive directors have unrestricted access to anyone in the Company. The Executive Chairman also meets separately with 
the non-executive directors.
In the ﬁnancial year under review the board met formally on ﬁve occasions. The board also met on a further nine occasions to receive interim updates or consider 
matters arising between formal meetings.

who wish to raise issues with the board, other than through the Executive Chairman. 
Executive directors The executive directors are responsible for developing the Group’s strategy and proposing the budget for board approval. 
They are also responsible for the ﬁnancial and operational performance of the Group and, in conjunction with the executive 
committee; they are collectively responsible for the day to day running of the business.
Non-executive directors The role of the non-executive directors is to ensure that independent judgment is brought to board deliberations and 
decisions. They promote the highest standards of integrity, probity and corporate governance throughout the Company.

which complement those of the executive directors.

responsibility of the Company Secretary to ensure that board procedures are followed and all rules and regulations are

57 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Management structure
A clearly deﬁned organizational structure exists within which individual 
responsibilities are identiﬁed and can be monitored. The management of the Group 
as a whole is delegated to the Executive Chairman and the executive committee.
The executive committee, chaired by Stephen Murdoch, and comprising the 
executive directors, meets regularly to agree strategy, monitor operational 
performance and consider key business issues. As part of its review, it 
considers the risks associated with the delivery of strategy and important 
governance issues within the Group’s operating companies.
There are a number of Group administrative functions such as Finance, 
Treasury, Human Resources, IT, Corporate Communications and Legal. 
These functions report to the board through the executive committee.
A number of Group-wide policies, issued and administered centrally, have 
been set to ensure compliance with key governance standards. These policies 
include areas such as ﬁnance, contract approvals, data protection, share 
dealing, business conduct, ethics and anti-bribery and corruption and 
anti-slavery and human trafﬁcking.
The conduct of Micro Focus’ individual businesses is delegated to local and 
regional executive management teams subject to a chart of approvals policy 
which is communicated to all employees in the Group. These teams are 
accountable for the conduct and performance of their businesses within 
the agreed business strategy.
Effectiveness
Induction of new directors
Each new director receives a comprehensive, formal and tailored induction 
into the Company’s operations. The directors can request that appropriate 
training is available as required. New directors’ inductions include brieﬁngs on 
the Company’s business, strategy, constitution and decision making process, 
the roles and responsibilities of a director and the legislative framework. New 
directors also meet with the Group’s senior product and other managers and 
with the Company’s shareholders at the AGM. A comprehensive induction 
pack is available to directors at all times on a tablet device. 
Board evaluation
A comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the board, its committees 
and each of its directors is carried out annually. The process is led by the senior 
independent non-executive director and supported by the Company Secretary. 
The outcome of the evaluation is discussed in detail by the board and any key 
recommendations are reviewed and implemented during the following year. 
As previously reported the 2016 board evaluation was externally facilitated by 
JCA Group. The 2017 board evaluation was internally facilitated and took the 
form of surveys completed by members of the board with respect to the 
performance of the board and each of its committees, as well as individual 
director surveys. The surveys included assessment of the effectiveness of the 
performance of the board and its committees and compliance with corporate 
governance principles. The evaluation process was conducted between March 
and April 2017. All directors have endorsed the internal evaluation process as 
being a valuable exercise.
Stage 1 – Comprehensive questionnaires – This year’s questionnaires 
focused on board composition, skills, expertise and diversity as well as board 
dynamics and operation, succession planning, strategic oversight and board 
support. They also covered progress on items raised in the prior years’ 
external evaluation.
Stage 2 – Compilation of results – a report was compiled by the Company 
Secretary which consolidated the directors’ responses.
Stage 3 – Reporting and discussion – the report was discussed with the 
Executive Chairman and the board reviewed the report in detail at its meeting 
in April 2017.
Conclusions and outcomes
The evaluation found the performance of each director to be effective, that 
each director had demonstrated commitment to the role and that the board 
had provided effective leadership and control. The evaluation established that 
the board had a strong foundation with a positive dynamic and beneﬁtted 
from signiﬁcant experience. 
The results of the evaluation are being used to assist the board in developing 
its approach going forward and include recommendations for understanding 
the culture of the HPE Software business and for maintaining the important 
Micro Focus cultural elements, recognizing that cultures would need to evolve 
for the Enlarged Group. In particular, recognizing that the key things to 
preserve are the company’s measurement and compensation system, its 
EBITDA targets to 2020, the leadership team and the Company’s product 
management process.

Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the ‘Code of Conduct’) 
and has in place several policies covering anti-bribery and corruption. 
As part of the Group’s anti-bribery and corruption programme, new employees 
are required to familiarize themselves with the Code of Conduct and complete 
an online anti-bribery and corruption training course. This course has also been 
completed by all existing employees and is rolled out to employees of newly 
acquired businesses. Additionally, certain employees in higher risk countries 
have taken part in face-to-face workshops which provides them with more 
focused and interactive training.
The Code of Conduct also includes policies on whistleblowing, gifts and 
hospitality, charitable donations and third party due diligence and sets out the 
appropriate level of behaviour expected from all staff.
Anti-slavery and human trafﬁcking 
During the year the Group introduced a new anti-slavery and human trafﬁcking 
policy following the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘MSA’)

 – Transaction Documentations and Due Diligence reports. 
In carrying this out, the committee considered the work and recommendations 
of the Group ﬁnance team, executive management and their own understanding 
of the business. In addition, the committee received reports from the external 
auditors setting out their view on the accounting treatments and judgments 
included in the annual report and accounts. The external auditors’ reports are 
based on a full audit of the annual report and accounts and a review of the 
interim ﬁnancial statement.
The Chairman of the committee has regular contact outside of the formal 
meetings with the partners of professional ﬁrms responsible for external and 
internal audit and tax advice.
Signiﬁcant issues considered in relation to the 
annual report and accounts 
The annual report and accounts were assessed by the committee, together 
with the appropriateness and application of accounting policies and areas of 
signiﬁcant judgment. The signiﬁcant issues considered by the committee were 
as follows:
Revenue recognition
The Group has a detailed policy on revenue recognition for each category of 
revenue; Licence, Maintenance, Subscription and Consultancy. This includes 
the application of rules relating to the allocation of fair values between these 
categories in accordance with the policy and the timing of their recognition. 
It also identiﬁes the different types of commercial contracts that the Group 
enters into and conﬁrmation that the revenue recognition is in line with IFRS. 
As is the case with many technology companies, the proﬁle of sales is weighted 
to the end of the ﬁnancial quarter. Other than in the case of Subscription, 
Maintenance and Consultancy revenue, the impact on recognized revenue 
is also weighted to the end of each ﬁnancial quarter. This can lead to the risk 
of misstatement of revenues from one period to the next. 
The committee received a paper from management on key revenue recognition 
judgments made during the year and reviewed the appropriateness of allocation 
of fair values between Licence, Maintenance, Subscription and Consulting as 
presented in the annual report and accounts, which concluded that no change 
to the allocation of fair values was necessary. The committee also considered 
the controls that management has in place to ensure that the fair value 
allocation of revenue is appropriate. The external auditors reported that they 
tested in detail all larger deals above a certain threshold and had not identiﬁed 
any exceptions. They had also tested a sample of transactions from the 
remaining population and no issues were identiﬁed. 
A close relationship between revenue recognition and cash collection is 
a good indicator of solid revenue recognition policies and the Group has a very 
satisfactory cash conversion ratio, low level of debtor days for which sales are 
outstanding and a low level of bad debt provisions. 
On the basis of the above the committee concluded that the Group’s revenue 
recognition was appropriate.
62 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Audit committee report 
continued Exceptional Items and Integration/Restructuring Provisions
The Group has completed four acquisitions during 2017 including Serena, 
GWAVA, OpenATTIC, and OpenStack and has announced its intention to 
merge with the HPE Software business which is in track to complete on 
1 September 2017. Signiﬁcant costs have been incurred during 2017 to 
acquire, integrate, restructure, and prepare for integration (in the case of the 
HPE Software business) which management have deemed to be 
exceptional items.
Restructuring and integration provisions additions in the year ended 
30 April 2017 includes severance and integration work undertaken in bringing 
together the base Micro Focus, TAG, Serena and GWAVA organizations into 
one organization. Restructuring and integration provisions also include 
provisions relating to activities in readiness for the HPE Software acquisition 
across all functions of the existing Micro Focus business.
The committee reviewed the classiﬁcation of costs treated as exceptional 
items and whether such costs meet the criteria set by management. The 
committee considered the presentation of exceptional items on the face of the 
Consolidated Income Statement and whether this approach is line with IAS 1 
“Presentation of Financial Statements”. The committee determined that the 
approach adopted by management was both appropriate and in accordance 
with the relevant accounting literature. 
The committee also received a report from management and discussed the 
assumptions with both management and the external auditors and concluded 
that the provisions made by management were reasonable and appropriate.
Provision for income taxes
The Group’s approach to providing for uncertain tax positions is set out on 
pages 17 and 18 of the Financial Review section.
Details of the Group’s tax provisions were included in the report prepared for 
the committee by the Group’s tax department in relation to the annual report 
and accounts. The provisions were reviewed by the committee and discussed 
with the Group’s Head of Tax and Treasury, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and external 
tax advisors. The committee determined that the level of the Group’s tax 
provisions was appropriate. This was conﬁrmed by the Group’s external 
auditors. 
Development expenditure
The costs incurred on development projects relating to the development of 
new computer software programmes and signiﬁcant enhancement of existing 
computer software programmes are recognized as intangible assets when it 
is probable that the project will be a success, considering its commercial and 
technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably. The costs are 
written off to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income over a 
period of three years from the point that the product is generally available. 
This results in a signiﬁcant amount of costs being capitalized each year 
although the overall impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income is currently small as the capitalization of cost in the year is similar to 
the amortization of previously capitalized costs. The net book value of product 
development costs at the end of the year was $49.1m (2016: $43.2m).
The committee considered the method of testing for potential impairment 
used by management and the reasonableness of the assumptions applied. 
The committee addressed this through the consideration of a report from 
management covering these areas and detailing both the capitalization and 
amortization processes applied and the new expenditure that was capitalized. 
It also looked at the levels that were capitalized in relation to Licence revenue 
generated and capitalized costs as a percentage of the total research and 
product development costs of the Group in the year and also in relation to prior 
years. The committee further discussed this with the external auditors and 
concluded that the assumptions made by management were reasonable and 
the carrying value of capitalized product development costs was appropriate.
Potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Management has carried out an impairment review of its purchased intangibles 
and goodwill. The net book value of the purchased intangibles is $1,031.6m 
(2016: $921.3m) and goodwill is $2,828.6m (2016: $2,436.2m). 
The committee received a report from management and having considered this 
concluded that no impairment was necessary. 
Business Combinations
There were a number of changes to the Group’s structure during the year, 
which included four acquisitions. As detailed in note 37, the total consideration 
paid during the year was $299.1m, which resulted in an increase of goodwill 
($392.4m) and acquired intangibles ($328.1m). 
The committee considered the risk that acquisitions are not accounted for 
correctly in line with IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ including:
 – The recording of fair value adjustments; and
 – The identiﬁcation and valuation of acquired intangibles. 
Valuations of the acquired intangible assets of all material acquisitions were 
performed by external valuation experts. Management determined this to be 
appropriate due to the size and complexity of these acquisitions. For smaller 
acquisitions, management deems it appropriate for the valuation of acquired 
intangibles to be performed in-house. Valuation and accounting papers prepared 
by Management and external experts were reviewed and considered appropriate 
by the Audit Committee. This included consideration of the following:
 – Cash ﬂows and discount rates used in business valuations; 
 – Models and key inputs used in intangible asset valuations including 
expected useful lives;
 – Fair value adjustments made by management to arrive at the fair values 
of the assets and liabilities acquired; and
 – The approach taken to identify intangibles.

63 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fair, balanced and understandable
The committee is satisﬁed that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as 
a whole, provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Company’s position at 30 April 2017 and the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy. A paper prepared by management provided the committee with the 
supporting detail to ensure that it was in a position to report to the board that 
the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts when taken as a whole were fair, 
balanced and understandable. 
The committee reached the conclusion on the basis that the description of the 
business agrees with its own understanding, the risks reﬂect the issues that 
concern it, appropriate weight has been given to the ‘good and bad’ news, the 
discussion of performance properly reﬂects the performance of the year and 
there is a clear and well-articulated link between all areas of disclosure.
The committee assisted the board in its assessment by considering the 
robustness of the processes used to prepare the Group’s Annual Report 
and Accounts 2017. The processes used included the following:
 – Review of papers provided by the executive and senior management 
on all areas where signiﬁcant judgments have been applied;
 – Review of the process of preparation and review by the senior 
management, executive directors and the ﬁnance management team; and
 – Review by the audit committee and discussions with the external auditors, 
senior management and executive directors on the fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment.
Viability statement
The committee assisted the board in relation to producing the Group’s viability 
statement. The committee reviewed the Group’s risk management process 
which had risk movement tracking and a new risk appetite statement to 
enhance the RMF to ensure a robust system of identifying, assessing and 
managing the Group’s key risks. Further information on this can be found on 
pages 36 to 43.
At the committee’s meeting in July 2017, the viability statement was 
considered, including a review of the risks and stress testing which had been 
carried out. Following this review the committee recommended to the board 
that the viability statement should be made for a three year period and that the 
Group was viable and there was negligible risk that it would breach any 
covenants or exceed its borrowing facilities. The viability statement can be 
found on page 44.
Assessment of effectiveness of external audit
The committee reviewed the performance of the external auditors taking into 
account the fulﬁlment of the agreed audit plan and amendments to it, input 
from management, responses to questions from the committee and audit 
ﬁndings reported to the committee. As part of this process the committee 
reviewed the feedback from the ‘Public Report on the Audit Quality Inspection 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’, issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”) in June 2017. Based on this information the committee concluded that 
the external audit process was operating effectively and PwC continued to 
prove effective in their role as external auditor.
Independence and objectivity of the external auditors
The committee has developed a robust policy designed to ensure that the 
auditors’ objectivity and independence is not compromised by it undertaking 
inappropriate non-audit work. This policy is reviewed annually and was last 
reviewed in April 2017. 
Auditor objectivity was safeguarded by the committee considering several 
factors: the standing and experience of the external audit partner; the nature 
and level of services provided by the external auditors and conﬁrmation from 
the external auditors that they have complied with relevant UK independence 
standards and fully considered any threats and safeguards in the performance 
of non-audit work. 
Non-audit fees 
The committee approves all non-audit work greater than £25,000 commissioned 
from the external auditors. During the year the fees paid to the auditor were: 
 – $3.5m (2016: $3.5m) for audit services;
 – $2.6m (2016: $0.8m) for audit related assurance services; 
 – $0.1m (2016: $0.1m) for services related to taxation; and 
 – $7.5m (2016: $1.8m) for other non-audit services. 
Audit related services in the year ended 30 April 2017 related primarily to the 
additional audit procedures required to be performed in respect of the Group’s 
historic ﬁnancial statements that are included in the US ﬁlings associated with 
the HPE Software transaction. 
The majority of work of other non-audit services provided by the auditors was 
in respect of their role as Reporting Accountants and due diligence provider in 
respect of the acquisition of HPE software. Other services in the year included 
ad hoc tax compliance, tax advice and customer license forensic services. 
The committee concluded that it was in the interests of the Group to use the 
auditors for this work as they were considered to be best placed to provide 
these services.
External audit appointment and tender
The committee reviews and makes recommendations with regard to the 
reappointment of the external auditors. In making these recommendations, the 
committee considers auditor effectiveness and independence, partner rotation 
and any other factors that may impact the external auditors’ reappointment. 
The current external auditors, PwC, have been auditors since the Company’s 
IPO in 2005 and they require that the audit partner rotates every ﬁve years. 
The most recent change in audit partner happened in the year ended 30 April 
2013 when Andrew Paynter took over as the lead audit partner. Partner 
rotation was therefore due in the year ended 30 April 2018 which coincided 
with the period for which Micro Focus is required to go out to tender under the 
EU Audit Directive and Regulation and the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014. The committee is conﬁdent that the effectiveness 
and independence of the external auditors was not impaired in any way. 
Due to the size and complexity of the acquisition of the HPE Software 
Business, the company applied for and was granted permission by the 
Competition Markets Authority and the Financial Reporting Council to defer 
their audit tender for a period of two years. Subsequently, the company 
became aware of a Joint Business Arrangement between PwC and HPE 
Software which would compromise their independence from the date of 
completion of the acquisition, targeted for 1 September 2017.
64 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Audit committee report 
continued As a result the committee undertook a competitive audit tender process for 
the ﬁnancial period commencing on 1 May 2017 in the period from January to 
April 2017, with the tender outcome recommendation decision being made at 
the audit committee meeting in April 2017. I led the tendering process chairing 
a steering group. The aim of the tender process was to recommend an audit 
ﬁrm who will provide the highest quality, most effective and efﬁcient audits. 
Critical success factors included sector experience and knowledge, cultural ﬁt, 
geographical coverage, the audit record of the lead partner and ﬁrm as well as 
the use of technology. In conducting the tender process the audit committee 
followed the FRC’s guidance Audit Tenders Notes on Best Practice February 
2017 (and its predecessor). Having ﬁrst formally assessed and conﬁrmed their 
ability to be independent in the time frame required, appropriate ﬁrms were 
invited to tender in January 2017. The tender process encompassed a range 
of activities including a data room, management interviews (including HPE 
Software), written proposals, tender presentations and a review process 
incorporating the use of scorecards. Members of the audit committee were 
involved throughout the process, provided with updates, copies of material 
documents, including the tender proposals and invited to attend the tender 
presentations. Internal stakeholders participating in the management interviews 
were invited to give feedback to the committee. The tender process culminated 
in a presentation day on 28 March 2017. 
Each participating ﬁrm was asked to comment on the tender process. All of the 
ﬁrms expressed satisfaction with the tender process which had allowed them 
to understand the Group’s business to prepare their proposals effectively. 
Following a period of due consideration of a report and recommendation from 
the committee, the board announced on 1 1 April 2017 its intention to appoint 
KPMG LLP to become Micro Focus’ external auditors and PwC will be 
stepping down as external auditors. 
There are no contractual restrictions on the choice of external auditors and 
therefore a resolution proposing the appointment of KPMG LLP as external 
auditors will be put to the shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting.
The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies

compliance 
The Company conﬁrms that it complied with the provisions of the Competition 
and Markets Authority’s Order for the year ended 30 April 2017.
Internal audit
An outsourced internal audit function was provided by KPMG during the year. 
The Group’s Director of Internal Audit and Risk provides oversight and 
co-ordination of internal audit. In order to ensure independence, internal audit 
has a direct reporting line to the committee and to me its chairman.
The committee monitored and reviewed the scope and results of the internal 
auditors’ activities as well as its effectiveness during the year. The annual 
internal audit plan is approved by the committee at the beginning of the 
ﬁnancial year, with any subsequent changes to the plan requiring committee 
approval. The nature and scope of the internal auditors’ work is reviewed and 
approved and the results of the audits are assessed alongside management’s 
responses. Issues with the audit reports which are graded as needing 
improvement are considered in detail by the committee along with the 
appropriateness of mitigation plans to resolve the issues identiﬁed.
At each meeting, the committee received reports from KPMG in order to 
ascertain in completing the internal audit plan and to review results of the audits.
Following a tender for internal audit services, led by me in parallel with the 
external audit tender process outlined above in the period January to April 
2017, the board will appoint PwC to provide outsourced internal audit services 
as soon as PwC are able to be released from the independence requirements 
as external auditor for FY17. Internal audit services in the intervening period 
will be provided by Deloitte.
Effective internal control and risk management
Following the annual cycle of work of the committee, it concluded that sound 
risk management and internal control systems had been maintained during the 
year. With respect to risk management, under the risk management framework 
the committee receives and reviews a report at each meeting on the principal 
risks across the Group which is discussed with senior management. The 
committee was satisﬁed with the process and risks identiﬁed. It was also 
satisﬁed that there was a high level of assurance provided by the internal 
auditors, the external review conducted by PwC at the half year and their full 
year audit, together with the input of the Group’s tax advisors, Deloitte. In this 
year Deloitte have also provided services relating to integration, IT and PMO 
and integration planning following the announcement of the HPE Software 
Transaction.
The board is ultimately responsible for establishing and monitoring internal 
control systems throughout the Group and reviewing their effectiveness. It 
carries out a review, at least annually, covering all material controls including 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
It recognizes that rigorous systems of internal control are critical to the Group’s 
achievement of its business objectives, that those systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate risk and that they can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed this position with its auditors 
and satisﬁed itself that the current control environment is effective.
There is an on-going internal process under the risk management framework 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group 
in association with the work performed by the outsourced internal audit function. 
This process has been in place throughout the year and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and it is regularly reviewed by the 
board and accords with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting September 2014.
As part of the process that the Group has in place to review the effectiveness 
of the internal control system, there are procedures designed to capture and 
evaluate failings and weaknesses and, in the case of those categorized by the 
board as ‘signiﬁcant’, procedures exist to ensure that necessary action is taken 
to remedy any such failings. The review covers all material controls, including 
ﬁnancial, operational and compliance controls.
The committee reports on a regular basis to the board on the Group’s 
internal ﬁnancial control procedures and makes recommendations to the 
board in this area.
The external auditors provide a supplementary, independent and autonomous 
perspective on those areas of the internal control system which they assess 
in the course of their work. Their ﬁndings are regularly reported to both the 
committee and the board.

65 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial reporting
In addition to the general internal controls and risk management processes 
described above, the Group also has speciﬁc internal controls and risk 
management systems to govern the ﬁnancial reporting process:
 – There are Group policies covering what is reported monthly to the board 
and the executive committee. The Group’s ﬁnancial reporting system has 
been guided by the requirement to ensure consistency and visibility of 
management information to enable the board and the executive team to 
review the Group’s worldwide operations effectively. During the year the 
Group set up an executive Financial Reporting Group (FRG) to monitor, 
review and manage the risks associated with ﬁnancial reporting across 
the Group. The FRG reports to the committee;
 – Cash ﬂow forecasts are produced monthly by all operations. These are 
reviewed by the Group treasury function to ensure effective cash 
management by the Group;
 – Management representations covering compliance with Group policies and 
the accuracy of ﬁnancial information are collected on a quarterly basis; 
 – All the major trading entities completed a self-assessment on the 
effectiveness of their internal control environment;
 – The consolidation process entails the combining and adjusting of ﬁnancial 
information contained in the individual ﬁnancial statements of the Company 
and its subsidiary undertakings in order to prepare consolidated annual 
report and accounts that present ﬁnancial information for the Group as a 
single economic entity. The Group accounting policies, sets out the basis of 
preparation and consolidation, including the elimination of inter-company 
transactions, balances and unrealized gains between Group companies;
 – Financial information from subsidiaries is reviewed for accuracy by internal 
review and externally audited where required; and
 – The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are completed in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in conformity with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union (collectively “IFRS”), IFRS Interpretations 
committee, the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
There have been no signiﬁcant changes in the Company’s internal control over 
ﬁnancial reporting during the year under review that have materially affected, 
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s control over 
ﬁnancial reporting. 
The board, with advice from the committee, is satisﬁed that an effective system 
of internal control and risk management processes are in place which enable 
the Company to identify, evaluate and manage keys risks and which accord 
with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related 
Financial and Business Reporting September 2014. These processes have 
been in place since the start of the ﬁnancial year up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. Further details of the risks faced by the 
Group are set out on pages 36 to 43.
The key elements of the control system are:
 – The Group operates a structured, objectives-driven approach to fulﬁl its 
core purpose and goals in respect of sustained proﬁtability and growth;
 – Systems and procedures are in place for all major transaction types with 
appropriate authorization controls;
 – All contracts are reviewed. The level of review depends on the size and 
complexity of the contracts and associated risks. There are formal limits 
above which the review level is escalated;
 – Reconciliations are performed on a timely basis for all major accounts; and
 – Research and development and capital expenditure programmes are 
subject to formal review and monitoring procedures.
The board recognizes the need to understand and control the variety of risks 
to which the Group is exposed. During the year, in order to address this on 
behalf of the board, the committee oversaw the executive management’s risk 
management activities under the RMF. The executive management took 
responsibility for regular evaluation of generic and speciﬁc risks within the 
business and the implementation of mitigation plans to address them.
Risks are assessed with reference to the achievement of the Group’s business 
objectives and according to current market and economic issues. The continuous 
monitoring of strategic and operational risks is the responsibility of the board 
and executive management respectively. The risk process has been in place 
for the year under review and is up to date at the time of this report.
The committee considers any signiﬁcant control matters raised in reports 
from management and by the internal and external auditors. It then reports 
its ﬁndings to the board. Where weaknesses are identiﬁed, the committee 
requires appropriate action to be taken by management and may request 
internal audit to perform a speciﬁc review into these areas if required.
Micro Focus’ internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting were for the ﬁrst time 
subject to review under the PCAOB auditing standards in connection with the 
audit of Micro Focus’ annual consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the three 
years ended 30 April 2016 to be included in the registration statement on 
Form F4 to be ﬁled by Micro Focus with the SEC in connection with the 
Merger. The PCAOB auditing standards are US standards that registered 
public accounting ﬁrms are required to follow in connection with the audit 
of Micro Focus’ consolidated ﬁnancial statements. As a result of the work 
undertaken, certain deﬁciencies in Micro Focus’ internal controls for the 
purposes of Section 404 have been identiﬁed. These relate to the fact that 
Micro Focus did not, for the ﬁnancial periods under audit nor the year ended 
30 April 2017, have sufﬁcient formally documented and implemented 
processes and review procedures, nor did it have sufﬁcient formality and 
evidence of controls over key reports and spreadsheets. Micro Focus has 
already begun to implement measures to address and remediate these 
deﬁciencies.
Whilst the Directors are satisﬁed that the Micro Focus Group has been and 
will continue to be in compliance with the internal control and related ﬁnancial 
reporting requirements under the Code and the Listing Rules, the PCAOB 
requirements in connection with Section 404 reporting are more detailed and 
evidence based.

conﬁdential basis. The committee receives regular reports as to whether any 
matters have been raised within the Group and any applicable details.
Accountability
The board is responsible for the preparation of the Annual Report and 
Accounts which, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and

69 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Given the timing of the review, the committee does not consider it appropriate 
to make fundamental changes to the Remuneration Policy in advance of the 
Completion of the transaction. In addition, no increases are being made to base 
salaries to reﬂect the increase in the size and scope of the organization as a 
result of the transaction at this point in time. Instead, a further review will be 
carried out following the integration of the new business to ensure the 
Remuneration Policy remains ﬁt for purpose for the enlarged and evolving 
group. It may therefore be necessary to revert to shareholders within three 
years for approval of changes to the Remuneration Policy.
Although our overall remuneration approach remains the same, the views of 
our shareholders are important to us and feedback received during FY17 was 
considered carefully by the committee during the review and resulted in the 
following changes being made to the Remuneration Policy:
 – To further strengthen the alignment between executive directors and 
shareholders, for the upcoming year, shareholding guidelines will be 
increased to 200% of salary (from 150% of salary); 
 – The clariﬁcation statements which were made in respect of the recruitment 
policy of the previous remuneration policy have now been fully reﬂected in 
the proposed Remuneration Policy; 
 – The incorporation of resolutions approved by the shareholders at the 2016 
AGM (and subsequent clariﬁcation statements) in respect of;
 – the introduction of deferral under the annual bonus (including further 
clariﬁcation on the operation of malus and claw back); and
 – the ability to make ASG awards and in line with shareholder feedback 
at the time of the AGM, future ASG awards will be pro-rated for time 
and performance on a change of control;
 – Following discussions with our shareholders, we have included a discretion 
for the committee to incorporate a measure of malus and claw back in 
respect of future ASG awards. Speciﬁcally, the Committee will have the 
ability to reduce the level of award which will ultimately vest/become 
exercisable in the case of a material misstatement in the audited ﬁnancial 
accounts in respect of the relevant performance period. This will apply to 
the relevant post vesting holding period; and
 – The removal of the ability to award Additional Responsibility Allowances.
Business performance in FY17 and incentive out-turns
Despite FY17 being a signiﬁcant period of change both in terms of the 
integration of Serena and the other acquisitions completed in the year, together 
with announcement of the HPE Software transaction and the commencement 
of planning to integrate HPE Software, the business traded in line with the 
expectations set at the beginning of the year. Speciﬁcally, total revenue was 
slightly above the mid-point of the guidance range of zero to minus 2% 
compared with the pro-forma CCY revenue for FY16 including Serena. 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA (excluding the impact of in year acquisitions) 
grew by 4.5% during the year when compared with the CCY FY16 number.
Shareholders saw the full beneﬁt of the improved operational performance 
with Diluted Adjusted EPS grew by 19.7% to 175.65 cents (2016: 146.70) and 
the full year dividend increased by 32.1% to 88.06 cents (2016: 66.68 cents). 
Annual Statement from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the board I am pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration 
Report at the end of another highly successful year, the highlight of which has 
been the announcement of the planned merger with HPE Software (due to 
complete on 1 September 2017). The Directors Remuneration Report sets out 
the amounts earned in respect of the year ended 30 April 2017 and the 
remuneration policy for Directors of Micro Focus.
The Directors Remuneration report is presented in two sections: 
The Annual Report on Remuneration provides details on the amounts earned 
in respect of the year ended 30 April 2017 and how the Remuneration Policy 
will be implemented for the year ending 30 April 2018. This will be subject to 
an advisory vote at the AGM to be held on 4 September 2017.
The existing Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM 
with additions to the Policy approved at the 2016 AGM. It was also endorsed by 
99.98% of shareholders when they approved the merger with HPE Software on 
26 May 2017. As the policy has been in place for three years it will be subject 
to a binding shareholder vote at our 2017 AGM in line with the three year cycle.
Policy review
Micro Focus has a clear strategy that deﬁnes an operating and ﬁnancial model 
designed to deliver superior shareholder return, and we believe that our 
remuneration framework continues to underpin this strategy. We will continue 
to strongly align the remuneration of senior managers with the requirements 
and interests of shareholders through:
 – A simple, transparent remuneration model which is understood by 
executives and shareholders;
 – Output-based incentive schemes which ultimately motivate senior 
management to deliver sustainable shareholder returns of between 
15% and 20% per annum; and
 – A framework that rewards our employees for delivering signiﬁcant value 
through transformational acquisitions.
Given the requirement to seek re-approval for our Policy in 2017, the 
committee reviewed the continued appropriateness of the current approach 
to remuneration at Micro Focus and its ability to drive superior shareholder 
returns. The committee concluded that the current approach has been 
successful in driving strong performance against our key indicators of 
EBITDA, EPS and shareholder returns.
The review was also carried out in the context of the HPE Software 
transaction which will be transformational for Micro Focus, and is wholly 
consistent with our long-term business strategy to be the most disciplined 
global provider of infrastructure software, creating signiﬁcant value for 
our shareholders.
70 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration report  The wider Company
As part of its role, the committee monitors the remuneration arrangements 
across the wider Company as an integral part of the strong performance 
culture driving our business. As well as all employees being eligible to 
participate in our all employee share plans, all non-commission employees 
participate in a bonus scheme which operates on the same metrics for all 
levels in the Company. Additionally around 100 of our senior managers and 
key employees receive LTIP awards subject to the same performance 
metrics that apply to executive directors.
Shareholder Engagement
We remain committed to maintaining an open and transparent engagement 
with our investors. We believe that a clear objective of the Directors 
Remuneration Report is to communicate clearly how much our executive 
directors are earning and how this is clearly linked to performance. Members 
of the remuneration committee are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with 
corporate governance advisory agencies and investors in order to better 
understand their views on Micro Focus’ approach to executive remuneration 
which are then taken into account when determining the remuneration 
arrangements for the executive directors.
We believe we have demonstrated the strong link between our Policy and value 
creation over the past six years; therefore I hope to receive your support at our 
upcoming AGM. 
Amanda Brown
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
17 July 2017
Despite the strong performance in the year, the stretching nature of the 
targets set under the annual bonus resulted in a pay-out of the maximum 
opportunity of 45.0% and 75.5% for non-commissioned staff in Micro Focus 
and SUSE respectively.
However, the sustained strong performance of the Company over the last 
three years has seen Diluted Adjusted EPS grow from 97.48 cents in the year 
ended 30 April 2014 to 175.65 cents, a compound annual growth rate of 
21.7% exceeding the upper end of the LTIP’s EPS performance criteria. 
This resulted in the LTIP awards granted three years ago vesting in full. 
Application of Policy in FY18
We have provided full details on the implementation of our Policy for FY18, 
subject to shareholder approval, on pages 72 to 78 which will consist of the 
following remuneration elements linked to generation and delivery of real 
returns to shareholders:
 –Base salary 
 –Pension
 –Annual Bonus
 –Long-term incentive
 – ASG awards
Subject to Completion of the HPE Software transaction, Chris Hsu will 
become CEO of the Enlarged Group from the date of Completion. Full details 
of Chris’ package were disclosed in the Circular to shareholders in respect of 
the transaction. His base salary will be $1,000,000 on appointment. He will 
be eligible for participation in the incentive plans on the same basis as other 
executive directors, with a maximum annual bonus opportunity of 150% of 
salary and a maximum LTIP opportunity of 200% of salary.
Stephen Murdoch will become COO and will simultaneously step down from 
the board at Completion. I would like to echo Kevin Loosemore’s words earlier 
in this report, and thank Stephen for his hard work and dedication as a board 
member of Micro Focus.
For Mike Phillips and Stephen Murdoch, the committee considered it 
appropriate to increase salaries by 2.5%, in the context of continued returns 
to shareholders over recent years and the contribution of the management 
team in achieving this success. This increase was in line with the average 
salary increase for the wider workforce.
For Nils Brauckmann the committee decided to award a 10% increase 
reﬂecting the rapid growth and value of the SUSE business under Nils’ 
leadership, his performance and development in role and his positioning 
compared to direct competitors.

This Directors’ Remuneration report has been prepared on behalf of the 
board by the committee and complies with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The report 
has been prepared in line with the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for executive 
directors in accordance with Section 439A of the Companies Act 2006 
(“the Act”). A binding shareholder resolution to approve the Remuneration 
Policy will be proposed at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 
4 September 2017 and will be effective from that date subject to shareholder 
approval. No signiﬁcant changes are proposed to the Policy previously 
approved by shareholders, with the exception of those highlighted in the 
Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the beginning 
of this report. The Policy will be available to view at www.microfocus.com.
The Company’s policy on the remuneration of executive directors and their 
direct reports is established by the committee and approved by the board. The 
individual remuneration package of each executive director is determined by 
the committee. No executive director or employee participates in discussions 
relating to the setting of their own remuneration.
The objective of the Group’s remuneration policies is that all employees, 
including executive directors, should receive appropriate remuneration for their 
performance, responsibility, skills and experience. Remuneration packages are 
designed to enable the Group to attract and retain key employees by ensuring 
they are remunerated appropriately and competitively and that they are 
motivated to achieve the highest level of Group performance in line with the 
best interests of shareholders. 
Policies on remuneration take account of the pay structure, employment 
conditions and relativities within the Group and also the industry sector. 
They also take into consideration that individuals may have different levels of 
experience, capability, and market demand for their services. To determine the 
elements and level of remuneration appropriate to each executive director, the 
committee considers benchmark remuneration data for selected comparable 
technology companies as well as a broader Group of companies of a similar 
size to the Company.
It is intended that a signiﬁcant proportion of remuneration will continue to 
be performance-related. Conditions for performance-related bonuses and 
long-term incentives, i.e. Underlying Adjusted EBITDA and EPS respectively, 
will represent challenging targets which are designed to increase shareholder 
value and are linked to the Company’s ﬁnancial and operational strategy. The 
committee will review the performance conditions annually to ensure that they 
remain demanding and appropriate.
In line with the Investment Association’s guidelines on responsible investment 
disclosure, the committee will ensure that the incentive structure for executive 
directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or 
governance (“ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. 
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no 
restriction on the committee that prevents it from taking into account corporate 
governance on ESG matters.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on the ‘auditable part’ of the Directors’ Remuneration report and to 
state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The report has therefore been 
divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Terms of reference
The committee is responsible for reviewing remuneration arrangements for 
members of the board and for providing general guidance on aspects of 
Remuneration Policy throughout the Group. Its terms of reference include

the remuneration of the Company’s Chairman, CEO and other executive 
directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the executive

 – Determine the total individual remuneration package of each executive 
director and other senior executives including bonuses, incentive payments, 
share options and any other share awards;

Ordinarily, salary increases will be in 
line with increases awarded to other 
employees of the Group. However, 
increases may be made above this level 
at the committee’s discretion to take 
account of individual circumstances 
such as:
 – Increase in scope and responsibility;
 – Increase to reﬂect the individual’s 
development and performance in 
role (e.g. for a new appointment 
where base salary may be increased 
over time rather than set directly at 
the level of the previous incumbent

Measures and targets are set for each 
ﬁnancial period and pay out levels are 
determined by the committee based on 
performance against those targets.
All executive directors with the exception 
of the Executive Chairman are required to 
defer one-third of their bonus into an award 
over Company shares. The deferral period 
will normally be for a period of three years. 
Kevin Loosemore is exempt as his annual 
bonus has been 150% since 201 1 and its 
treatment was covered in his service contract 
which predates the remuneration policy
The committee may, in exceptional 
circumstances, amend the bonus pay out 
should the formulaic outcome not, in the 
view of the committee, reﬂect overall 
business performance or individual 
contribution. Any such adjustments would 
be disclosed in the relevant year’s Annual 
Report on Remuneration and bonuses 
would not exceed the stated maximum.
Claw back provisions may be applied to the 
cash bonus up to one year following payment.
Malus provisions will apply during the three 
year deferral and deferred shares will also 
be subject to claw back up to one year 
after vesting.
Dividend equivalents are payable over the 
vesting period in respect of the bonus share 
awards which vest.
The maximum opportunity is 150% 
of salary for all Executive Directors 
in any 12 month period.
The measures and targets 
are set by the committee.
Targets are set that drive 
improvement in the 
underlying performance of 
the business ensuring a link

Currently measures are 
limited to growth in 
Underlying Adjusted EBITDA

currency. The maximum 
bonus will be achieved by 
growing the Underlying 
Adjusted EBITDA by 10% 
year on year excluding the 
impact of in year acquisitions 
and currency on straight 
line basis.
This may change if needed 
to support a change in

Additional Share Grant
Aligns executive interest with 
those of long-term shareholders 
and ensures the success of 
a material acquisition (by 
whatever means) of a business 
or entity made by the Group.
ASGs take the form of conditional share 
awards or nil cost options which may be 
awarded during the ﬁrst 18 months from 
the date of Completion of the acquisition 
(by whatever means), with vesting 
dependent upon the achievement of a 
performance condition. Performance is 
typically measured over three years.
Holders of ASGs are required, subject to 
continued employment on the vesting date, 
to hold ASGs or ordinary shares acquired 
on exercise (net of any sales to meet ﬁscal 
charges) for a minimum of 12 months 
following the vesting date. 
For the replicated ASG programme which 
was approved by shareholders at the 2016 
AGM, the Remuneration Committee will 
have discretion to include a malus and 
claw back clause to the effect that malus 
may be applied up to the vesting date and 
claw back may be applied during the 
12 month period post the vesting date 
in the case of a material misstatement 
of the ﬁnancial statements in respect 
of the performance period.
The number of Ordinary Shares issued 
or issuable pursuant to ASGs granted 
pursuant to a single ASG programme 
may not exceed 2.5% of the issued 
Ordinary Share capital of the Company 
at the time of completion of the 
acquisition. Within this limit, the number 
of Ordinary Shares that can be awarded 
to any individual under the relevant ASG 
programme may not exceed 0.5% of 
the issued Ordinary Share capital of the 
Company at the time of completion of 
the acquisition.
The percentage of the ASG 
which will Vest is:
(i)  0% if the Shareholder 
Return Percentage is 
50 per cent. or less;
(ii)  100% if the Shareholder 
Return Percentage is 
100 per cent. or more; and
(iii)  a percentage determined 
on a straight line basis 
between (i) and (ii) above.
The ‘Shareholder Return 
Percentage’ will reﬂect 
dividends paid and any 
increase in share price from 
a reference price ﬁxed at, 
or following, the 
commencement of 
discussions relating to the 
relevant transaction to the 
average of the closing share 
price on the 20 Business 
Days prior to the Vesting 
Date. The Vesting Date is the 
third anniversary of the date 
of grant or an earlier date 
determined by the committee.

Non-executive director fees
Provides an appropriate 
reward to attract and retain 
high-calibre individuals.
The non-executive directors are paid a basic fee. Additional fees are paid for chairmanship of board committees and 
for the roles of senior independent director and Deputy Chairman.
Fees are currently paid in cash but the Company may choose to provide some of the fees in shares Fees are set at 
a level which:
 – Reﬂects the commitment and contribution that is expected from the non-executive directors; and
 – Is appropriately positioned against comparable roles in companies of a similar size and complexity in the relevant 
market, especially companies of a similar size and international scope to the Company, in particular those within 
the technology sector, the FTSE 100, US listed technology companies and privately owned software companies.
Fees are reviewed periodically. Increases will typically be in line with market levels of fee inﬂation. In exceptional circumstances 
(including, but not limited to, material misalignment with the market or a change in the complexity, responsibility or time 
commitment required to fulﬁl the relevant non-executive director role) the Chairman and Executive Directors have 
discretion to make appropriate adjustments to fee levels to ensure they remain market competitive. Non-executive directors 
may also be reimbursed for all necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in performance of their duties and tax thereon.
Aggregate fees paid to non-executive directors will remain within the limit stated in the Company’s articles of 
association, currently £1m. Actual fee levels are disclosed in the Directors’ Annual Report on Remuneration for the 
relevant ﬁnancial year.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any incentive scheme.
Notes to the remuneration policy table
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of ofﬁce (including exercising any discretions available to it in 
connection with such payments), notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed: 
(i)  Before 25 September 2014 (the date the Company’s ﬁrst shareholder approved policy came into effect); 
(ii)   Before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved directors’ 
remuneration policy in force at the time they were agreed; or 
(iii)   At a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the 
individual becoming a director of the Company. 
For these purposes “payments” includes the committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the 
payment are “agreed” at the time the award is granted.
The committee will operate the annual bonus, DSBP and LTIP according to their respective rules (or relevant documents) and in accordance with the Listing 
Rules where relevant. The committee retains discretion, consistent with market practice, with regard to the operation and administration of these plans. 
These include, but are not limited to the following in relation to the LTIP and DSBP;
 – The participants; the timing for granting awards; the size of an award subject to maximum limits set out in the policy table; and the determination of vesting;
 – Discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
 – Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
 – Adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special dividends); 
 – The annual review of performance measures and weighting, and targets for the LTIP from year to year;
 – The operation of malus and claw back; and
 – To settle awards in cash.

 – The participants; the determination of the bonus payment; the timing of 
payment; and dealing with a change of control;
 – Determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan 
and the appropriate treatment chosen; 
 – The annual review of performance measures and weighting, and targets 
for the annual bonus plan from year to year; and 
 – The operation of malus and claw back.
Awards under the ASG will operate as approved by shareholders and the 
committee retains the discretion in relation to (but not limited to) the following:
 – The participants; the timing for granting awards; the size of an award 
subject to the maximum limits set out in the policy table and the 
determination of vesting;
 – To settle awards in cash; and
 – How to take account of any variations in share capital of the Company.
In relation to both the Company’s LTIP and annual bonus plan, the committee 
retains the ability to adjust the targets and/or set different measures if events 
occur (e.g. material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business) which 
cause it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and the 
amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and 
are not materially less difﬁcult to satisfy. Any use of the above discretions would, 
where relevant, be explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, as 
appropriate, be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
Malus and/or claw back provisions may be applied to awards under the 
annual bonus, DSBP and LTIP for up to one year following payment or vesting 
as appropriate. These provisions may be applied in the case of material 
miss-statement of results, an error in calculation, fraud and gross misconduct, 
conduct leading to serious harm to the Group’s reputation or a signiﬁcant 
ﬁnancial loss or a material failure of risk management. 
In addition, ASG awards under the reciprocal programme which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2016 AGM may be subject to malus up to the vesting 
date and claw back during the 12 month period following the vesting date in 
the circumstances of a material misstatement of the ﬁnancial accounts during 
the performance period.
The use of discretion in relation to the Company’s Sharesave and approved 
section of the LTIP will be as permitted under HMRC rules and the Listing 
Rules. Details of share awards granted to existing executive directors are set 
out on pages 89 to 91 of the Annual Report on Remuneration. These remain 
eligible to vest based on their original award terms. 
Performance measures and targets
The Company’s core objective is to continue to deliver shareholder returns of 15% 
to 20% per annum over the long-term. The committee continues to believe that a 
combination of Underlying Adjusted EBITDA, Revenue Growth, Cash ﬂow, EPS 
and Total Shareholder Return remain the most appropriate measures of long-term 
performance of the Company. The performance measures used under the annual 
bonus are selected annually to help the Group achieve its core objective. The 
annual bonus plan is currently linked to growth in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA. 
Vesting of LTIP awards is currently linked to growth in EPS as the committee 
believes that this aligns with the Company’s focus on shareholder value. ASG’s 
pay out to the extent value is delivered to our shareholders. The committee 
believes that a combination of the measures under our incentive plans provides 
a strong line of sight for the executives and supports the long-term strategy.
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into 
account the Group’s strategic priorities and the economic environment in 
which the Group operates. 
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent 
principles to those for executive directors. Salary reviews take into account 
Group performance, local pay and market conditions and salary levels for 
similar roles in comparable companies. All non-commission employees 
participate in a bonus scheme which operates on the same metrics for all 
levels in the Company from entry level employees to executive directors.
Around 100 of our senior managers and other key employees also receive 
LTIP awards. Performance conditions are consistent for all participants, while 
award sizes vary by individual. All UK employees are eligible to participate in 
the all-employee share plans on the same terms. The plans are available to 
22 other countries worldwide. 
 
All of our UK employees are able to participate in our Flexible Beneﬁts 
programme.
ASGs in relation to the 2014 acquisition of TAG were made by the 
remuneration committee in the ﬁrst 18 months following the acquisition to 
certain senior managers or employees of the Enlarged Group and new joiners 
who were deemed critical to the delivery of the acquisition and integration of 
TAG and Base Micro Focus, with the total number of recipients (including 
executive directors) not exceeding ﬁfteen.

79 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The ‘minimum’ scenario shows salary, pension and beneﬁts only. These are the 
elements of the executive directors’ remuneration packages that are not at risk.
The ‘on-target’ scenario shows ﬁxed remuneration as above, plus a pay-out of 
50% of the maximum annual bonus and 25% vesting for long-term incentives 
(excluding ASG awards).
The ‘maximum’ scenario reﬂects ﬁxed remuneration, plus full pay-out of all 
incentives (excluding ASG awards).
Share price movements and the payment of dividends are excluded. ASGs 
have not been included in the analysis as they are one-off awards which do not 
form part of the on-going annual remuneration arrangements. Further details 
of outstanding ASG awards are provided on page 91.
Recruitment of executive directors
The remuneration package for a new executive director would be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy in force at the 
time of appointment and taking account of the experience and skills of the 
individual and prevailing market conditions. In determining the appropriate 
remuneration structure and levels, the committee will take into consideration 
all relevant factors to ensure that the arrangements are in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. The committee would seek not to pay 
more than is necessary to secure the right candidate. The maximum aggregate 
value of incentives (excluding buyouts) on appointment will be 500% salary. 
The committee may make an award in respect of a new appointment to 
‘buy-out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer 
and may exercise the discretion available under the relevant Listing Rule to 
facilitate this, i.e. in the event that a structure that is different from those 
detailed in the Remuneration Policy would be required. For example, the 
committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements as part 
of the buy-out when it considers these to be in the best interests of the 
Company and, therefore, of its shareholders. 
Any such buy-out payments would be:
 – Based solely on remuneration lost when leaving the former employer; 
 – Would be no higher than the commercial value forfeited; and
 – Would typically reﬂect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash, shares and 
options), time horizons and performance requirements attaching to 
that remuneration. 
Internal appointment of executive directors
In the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of the prior role may be allowed to pay out according to its terms on 
grant. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to 
appointment may continue, provided that they are disclosed in the following 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. For external and internal appointments, 
the committee may agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses, as appropriate and within the limits set by the committee. 
Appointment of interim executive directors 
The committee also recognizes that there may be times when it is appropriate 
to appoint an interim Executive Director or in exceptional circumstance require 
that a non-executive director takes on an executive function on a short-term 
basis. Remuneration for interim executive directors will be determined within 
the existing Remuneration Policy. 
In exceptional circumstances where a non-executive director takes on an 
executive function on an interim basis, the director will receive an increase to 
their cash fee (reﬂecting the market rate for that role) only for the duration of 
the appointment.
Non-executive directors will not be eligible for an annual bonus or LTIP in the 
event of a signiﬁcant merger or acquisition. The committee commits to consulting 
with and seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside 
these policy limits. 
Executive directors appointed as a result of mergers 
and acquisitions
As merger and acquisition activity is part of the Company’s strategy, the 
committee recognizes that such activity may give rise to situations where there 
are exceptional circumstances in relation to executive directors and certain 
senior management. Should it be necessary to match compensation in an 
acquired company and/or adjust compensation of existing management to 
deliver signiﬁcant shareholder beneﬁts then the Company may wish to offer 
awards of variable remuneration in excess of the maximum levels stated in the 
policy table. However, the Company will only do so after consulting with, and 
seeking approval from shareholders in advance of operating outside these limits.
Executive directors’ service agreements
The executive director service contract for Kevin Loosemore was entered into 
before 27 June 2012 and has not been renewed following its execution. There 
are accordingly areas where this contract is not consistent with the policy for 
new executive directors as set out below.
The Company’s policy is that executive directors’ service agreements 
normally continue until the director’s agreed retirement date or such other 
date as the parties agree are terminable on no more than six months’ notice 
and provide no entitlement to the payment of a pre-determined amount on 
termination of employment in any circumstances. In addition, in some limited 
cases, career counselling may be provided after the cessation of employment 
for a deﬁned period.

16 January 2017 which will come into effect subject to Completion of the transaction, 
at which point Chris will become Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of the Enlarged Group.
1
  Subject to the below, set out in the loss of ofﬁce payments section, Kevin 
Loosemore’s notice period decreases by one month for each complete 
month served after 31 October 2017 until it reaches zero on 1 May 2018.

  Stephen Murdoch will become Chief Operating Ofﬁcer on Completion of the 
transaction and will step down from the board simultaneously. 
If an executive director commits any crime or act of dishonesty or, other than 
Kevin Loosemore, commits any material breach of their service contract or any 
act of gross misconduct, the Company is entitled to summarily terminate the 
service contract without notice or payment in lieu of notice or other compensation. 
In the case of Kevin Loosemore, his employment may be terminated by the 
Company without notice if, in the opinion of the board acting reasonably and 
after giving Kevin Loosemore reasonable opportunity to comment before such 
opinion is reached, it is determined that he has committed any serious breach of 
his service contract which is incapable of remedy or he is guilty of any gross 
misconduct, or gross incompetence, in the discharge of his duties of his 
employment. Any such contract terms cannot however, as a rule of law, affect 
the executive director’s statutory rights such as rights in respect of unfair 
dismissal.
Loss of ofﬁce payments and notice period
For executive directors, other than Kevin Loosemore, there are no 
predetermined special provisions with regard to compensation in the event 
of loss of ofﬁce; compensation is based on what would be earned by way of 
salary, pension entitlement and other contractual beneﬁts over the notice 
period. In the event that a contract is to be terminated, and a payment in lieu 
of notice made, payments to the executive director may be staged over the 
notice period, at the same interval as salary would have been paid. 
In respect of Kevin Loosemore, his loss of ofﬁce compensation is equal to 
£735,000 in the event his employment is terminated prior to 1 May 2018. 
Subject to Kevin Loosemore being granted an ASG on the same terms as 
the TAG ASG deed granted on 18 September 2014 (or as mutually agreed 
between the Company and Kevin Loosemore, subject to compliance with the 
terms of the ASG programme approved by the Company’s shareholders on 
22 September 2016) over at least 947,100 Ordinary Shares within one week 
of Completion (or within one week of Micro Focus being permitted to grant 
such ASGs) his existing notice provisions (including any right to a payment in 
lieu of notice of £735,000) as detailed above, will be replaced in their entirety 
with a six month notice period. If the Company and Kevin Loosemore are not 
able to mutually agree the terms of an ASG deed such that the ASG is issued 
within the required time frame, then Kevin Loosemore’s notice period will not 
change and as at 1 May 2018 his notice period will be down to zero.
Executive directors must take all reasonable steps to obtain alternative 
employment during the notice period and payments made by the Company will 
be reduced to reﬂect any payments received in respect of alternative employment.
There is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus and this is at the 
discretion of the committee. Where an executive director ceases to be 
employed by reason of death, disability, ill-heath or any other reason at the 
committee’s discretion they may receive a pro-rata bonus for the year of 
cessation, paid on the normal payment date (with committee discretion to 
accelerate), based on performance against predetermined targets and time 
served during the year. 
The treatment of leavers under our DSBP and LTIP is determined by the rules 
of the relevant plan. The committee will determine when and if awards vest 
and the period during which awards may be exercised.
Awards under the LTIP and DSBP typically lapse if the participant leaves 
employment in case of termination for cause or resignation. In other cases, 
normally including death and ill health, injury or disability, redundancy and 
retirement, or any other reason at the committee’s discretion, awards would 
typically vest early and be pro-rated for time and performance where relevant. 
Although the committee may determine that awards should continue to their 
normal vesting date. On death, awards typically vest immediately. 
Overview Strategic report Corporate governance
Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements and notes
Company ﬁnancial 
statements and notes Additional information
81 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 ASG awards will normally lapse if a participant leaves prior to the vesting date 
following voluntary resignation, breach of contract, gross misconduct or gross 
incompetence, subject to committee discretion. In the circumstances of fair 
dismissal other than those listed above, then the ASG will normally vest, 
subject to time pro-rating and subject to satisfaction of the performance 
condition, and will become exercisable on the normal vesting date for a period 
of six months. In all other cases, the ASG will normally vest, subject to the 
performance condition, and become exercisable on the normal date for a 
period of six months.
Change of control
The rules of the DSBP and LTIP provide that, in the event of a change of 
control or a scheme of arrangement of the company, awards vest to the extent 
that the performance conditions (where applicable) are satisﬁed at the date of 
such event. Any such early vesting would generally be on a time pro-rata basis. 
The committee may vary the level of vesting, if it believes that exceptional 
circumstances warrant this, taking into account any other factors it believes 
to be relevant in deciding to what extent an award will vest.
The directors may exchange their awards over Company shares for awards 
in shares of the acquiring company if the terms of the offer allow this.
Awards held under all-employee plans would be expected to vest on a change 
of control and those which have to meet speciﬁc requirements to beneﬁt from 
permitted tax beneﬁts would vest in accordance with those requirements.
For the replicated ASG programme which was approved by shareholders at the 
2016 AGM, on a change of control or scheme of arrangement of the company, 
outstanding ASGs will normally vest subject to time pro-rating from the 
effective date of grant (namely the announcement of the relevant transaction) 
and assessment of performance achieved. For the ASG programme in 
connection with The Attachmate Group acquisition, on a change of control 
or scheme of arrangement of the company, outstanding ASG’s will normally 
vest in full. 
Policy in respect of external board appointments
We recognize that external non-executive directorships are beneﬁcial for both 
the executive director concerned and the Company. With prior approval from 
the board, each serving executive director can undertake external non-executive 
directorships. At the discretion of the board, executive directors are permitted 
to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Non-executive directors’ terms of appointment
The non-executive directors’ terms of appointment are recorded in letters of 
appointment. The required notice from the Company is 90 days in all cases. 
The non-executive directors are not entitled to any compensation for loss of 
ofﬁce and stand for election or re-election as appropriate at each AGM. 
Details of the letters of appointment of each non-executive director who has 
served as a director of the Company at any time during the ﬁnancial year are 
set out below:

Silke Scheiber and Darren Roos were appointed to the board on 15 May 2017 
and their contracts expire on 15 May 2020. 
All appointments of non-executive directors are subject to election by shareholders 
at the ﬁrst AGM of the Company after appointment and to re-election on an 
annual basis thereafter. All the directors will be offering themselves for election 
or re-election at the AGM to be held on 4 September 2017.
Consultation with employees
Although the committee does not consult directly with employees on the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the committee does consider the general 
basic salary increase, the benchmarking of employee compensation and 
beneﬁts, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions for the 
broader employee population when determining Remuneration Policy for 
the executive directors. 
Consideration of shareholder views
The committee also considers developments in institutional investors’ best 
practice expectations and the views expressed by shareholders when setting 
Directors’ remuneration. We remain committed to shareholder dialogue and 
take an active interest in voting outcomes. Prior to the proposed renewal of our 
policy at the 2017 AGM, we consulted with major shareholders and investor 
bodies and were pleased with the response we received. If any of these 
shareholders express concerns relating to our policy, we would endeavour 
to meet with them, as appropriate, to understand and respond to any issues 
they may have.
82 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration report 
continued Annual Report on Remuneration
The following section provides the details of how the Remuneration Policy 
was implemented during the year.
Remuneration Committee membership during the 
year ended 30 April 2017
During the year the committee comprised only of independent non-executive 
directors which we see as fundamental to ensuring that the remuneration of 
executive directors and senior executives is set by people who are independent 
and have no personal ﬁnancial interest, other than as shareholders, in the 
matters discussed. The committee met eight times during the year under 
review. The number of committee meetings attended by each director in the 
year ended 30 April 2017 was as follows: 
Committee 
member
Held Number of meetings 
attended
Amanda Brown 
(Chair) * 8 8
Karen Slatford 8 8
Tom Virden** 8 8
Richard Atkins 8 8
*  Amanda Brown was appointed on 6 July 2016 and became Chair of the 
committee on 22 September 2016.
**  Tom Virden resigned on 25 April 2017.
The committee invited the Executive Chairman, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
and the Group Human Resources Director during the year to provide views and 
advice on speciﬁc questions raised by the committee and on matters relating 
to the performance and remuneration of senior managers. They did not 
participate in discussions relating to their own remuneration. The Company 
Secretary attended each meeting as secretary to the committee.
Agenda during the year ended 30 April 2017
The key activities of the committee were as follows:
 – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration report for the year ended 
30 April 2016;
 – Reviewed salaries of the executive directors and the Executive Chairman’s 
direct reports;
 – Reviewed bonus payments and LTIP vesting against targets;
 – Conducted annual review and ratiﬁcation of remuneration packages for 
executive directors and senior executives, incorporating institutional 
investor feedback;
 – Considered current guidelines on executive compensation from advisory 
bodies’ and institutional investors; 
 – Reviewed Group-wide pay and beneﬁts;
 – Established targets for annual cash bonuses for the year ending 
30 April 2018;
 – Considered the award of ASG’s in light of the HPE Software transaction; 
and
 – Reviewed the performance and terms of reference of the committee.
External advisers
The committee last reviewed their external advisers in 2012 and appointed 
Kepler Associates (a brand of Mercer) (“Kepler”). Kepler attends committee 
meetings where appropriate and provides advice on remuneration for executives, 
analysis on all elements of the Remuneration Policy and regular market and 
best practice updates. Kepler reports directly to the committee chair, and is a 
signatory to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be 
found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Kepler’s parent, Mercer, 
does not provide any other services to the Company. The committee is satisﬁed 
that the advice it receives from Kepler is independent. The terms of Kepler’s 
engagement are available from the Company Secretary and they are paid on 
a time and materials fee for projects outside the scope of their retainer. 
The committee seeks advice on legal matters from a number of ﬁrms as 
appropriate. The committee continually assesses ongoing advice provided by 
its advisers on remuneration matters. The fees incurred with Kepler in the year 
under review were £14,250 (2016: £23,755), plus VAT. Management, in their 
advisory role to the committee have also worked with Deloitte during the year 
on various issues that have been presented to the committee.

  As previously discussed with shareholders, due to this being Nils Brauckmann’s ﬁrst board appointment his initial salary was set at a relatively low level with the intention 
to increase this over time as he develops in the role. The 10% salary increase is reﬂective of Nils’s strong performance to date and the role continuing to increase in size 
and complexity as the business grows.
As disclosed in the shareholder circular, Chris Hsu will receive a base salary of $1,000,000 following his appointment as CEO to the board subject to the 
Completion of the HPE Software transaction.
The average basic salary increase across the Group for 2017 is 2.3%.
Pension
Executive directors will continue to receive a pension contribution or payment in lieu of pension. The Executive Chairman receives a payment in lieu of pension 
of 20% of base salary whilst other executive directors receive a contribution of 15% of base salary.
88 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Directors’ Remuneration report 
continued Annual bonus
The annual bonus will continue to be based on growth in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of in year acquisitions. 
There will be zero payment if there is no growth increasing on a straight-line basis to a maximum payment at 10% year-on-year growth. 
Subject to completion of the HPE Software transaction the Company is intending to align its year end to 31 October. This will result in an 18 month ﬁnancial 
period ending 31 October 2018 with the “New” ﬁnancial year for the Enlarged Group commencing on 1 November 2018. In this “New” ﬁnancial year ending 
31 October 2018, the bonus will operate on a similar basis as for the year ended 30 April 2017 and the maximum bonus opportunity for all executive directors 
will be 150% of salary for the period. In the period to 31 October 2017 the current executive directors’ bonus entitlement will be determined by the improvement 
in Underlying Adjusted EBITDA for the existing business when compared to the six months ended 31 October 2016 whilst the bonus opportunity for Chris Hsu 
is subject to the performance of HPE Software in the year ending 31 October 2017.
For all executive directors (with the exception of the Executive Chairman) one-third of any bonus earned will be deferred into Company shares, to maximize 
long-term shareholder alignment, support retention in a highly competitive and global talent pool, and be in line with typical market practice. Two-thirds of the 
bonus will continue to be paid in cash. The Executive Chairman is exempt as his annual bonus has been 150% since 201 1 and its treatment was covered in his 
service contract which predates the remuneration policy. Deferred bonus awards will vest in full after three years, subject to continued employment.
For those subject to the changes, malus and claw back provisions will apply to awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan, as well as to the cash bonus.
LTIP
In the context of the HPE Software transaction, the committee has determined that no LTIP or ASG awards will be made until the transaction has completed. 
Any awards made will be in line with the approved remuneration policy. At present it is anticipated that the performance measures and targets will be on a similar 
basis as for awards made in 2016. However, further details of the awards will be made at the time awards are granted and full details in respect of the awards 
will be provided in next year’s remuneration report.
Implementation of non-executive director remuneration for the year ending 30 April 2018
Following the annual review of non-executive director fees, it was determined that the fees should be increased to reﬂect the increased size, scope and 
responsibilities of the roles, in the context of the transaction with HPE software and the Enlarged Group going forwards. The approach to non-executive directors’ 
fees is set out in the table below:
Independent non-executive director base fee £70,000 p.a.
Additional fee for chairing a committee £20,000 p.a.
Fee for the SID (including chairing committees) £120,000 p.a.

The performance condition is that the percentage of ordinary shares subject to the ASG which may be acquired on exercise on or after the vesting date is as follows:
(i) 0% if the Shareholder Return Percentage (as deﬁned below) is 50% or less;
(ii) 100% if the Shareholder Return Percentage is 100% or more; and 
(iii) A percentage determined on a straight line basis between (i) and (ii) above.
The ‘Shareholder Return Percentage’ will be calculated by deducting 819.425 pence per share (the ‘Reference Price’), being the average of the 20 days before 3 
June 2014 (being the date of the heads of agreement relating to the proposed combination of Micro Focus and TAG between Micro Focus, Wizard, Golden Gate 
Capital and Francisco Partners Management LLC), from the sum of the ‘Vesting Price’ (calculated as the average closing share price over the period of 20 days 
ending on the day prior to the vesting date) plus the total of all dividends per share between Completion and the vesting date. This will be divided by the 
Reference Price, multiplying the resulting ﬁgure by 100 to obtain the Shareholder Return Percentage.
Sharesave
In relation to the Sharesave Scheme, Mike Phillips joined the Company scheme on 21 August 2013 at an option price of £5.98 over 1,504 shares that are 
exercisable from 1 October 2016. These were exercised during the year.

closing price varied between 1,416p and 2,558p per share.

 – On a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have 
one vote for every share of which he or she is the holder.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting or class meeting 
in respect of shares held by him or her if any call or other sum then payable by 
him or her in respect of that share remains unpaid. Currently, all issued shares 
are fully paid.
Deadlines for voting rights
Full details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights in respect of the 
resolutions to be considered at the Annual General Meeting (the ‘AGM’) to 
be held on 4 September 2017 are set out in the Notice of Meeting which 
accompanies this report.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company may, by 
ordinary resolution, declare a dividend to be paid to members but no dividend 
shall exceed the amount recommended by the board. The board may pay 
interim dividends and any ﬁxed rate dividend whenever the proﬁts of the 
Company, in the opinion of the board, justiﬁes its payment. All dividends shall be 
apportioned and paid pro-rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares.
Transfer of shares
Subject to the Articles, any member may transfer all or any of his or her 
certiﬁcated shares in writing by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or 
in any other form which the board may approve. The board may, in its absolute 
discretion and without giving any reasons, decline to register any instrument 
of transfer of a certiﬁcated share which is not a fully paid share provided that, 
where any such shares are admitted to the Ofﬁcial List maintained by the UK 
Listing Authority, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to 
prevent dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and 
proper basis. The board may decline to recognize any instrument of transfer 
relating to shares in certiﬁcated form unless it is in respect of only one class 
of share and is lodged (duly stamped if required) at the Transfer Ofﬁce (as 
deﬁned in the Articles) accompanied by the relevant share certiﬁcate(s) and 
such other evidence as the board may reasonably require to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed 
by some other person on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so). 
In the case of a transfer of shares in certiﬁcated form by a recognized clearing 
house or a nominee of a recognized clearing house or of a recognized 
investment exchange the lodgment of share certiﬁcates will only be necessary 
if and to the extent that certiﬁcates have been issued in respect of the shares 
in question. The directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer 
of shares (whether fully-paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
Subject to the Articles and the CREST Rules (as deﬁned in the Uncertiﬁcated 
Securities Regulations, as amended), and apart from any class of wholly 
dematerialized security, the board may permit any class of shares in the 
Company to be held in uncertiﬁcated form and, subject to the Articles, title 
to uncertiﬁcated shares to be transferred by means of a relevant system.
Repurchase of shares
The Company obtained shareholder authority at the last AGM (held on 
22 September 2016) to buy back up to 14.99% of its issued share capital. 
At that time this amounted to 34,346,931 ordinary shares, and the authority 
remains outstanding until the conclusion of the next AGM on 4 September 
2017. The minimum price which must be paid for such shares is 10 pence per 
ordinary share and the maximum price which may be paid for each ordinary 
share shall not be more than the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) 
stipulated by the Listing Rules from time to time in force published by the 
Financial Conduct Authority.
Amendment to the Articles
Any amendments to the Articles may be made in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 by way of special resolution.

LLC the lenders in the term loan C of $412m due November 2019 were 
offered a cashless roll of their investment into the existing term loan B-2 
due November 2021 and this loan will be re-priced to LIBOR plus 2.50% 
(subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) and as a result of the cashless rollover 
increased in size from $1,102.7m to $1,515.2m, effective from 28 April 2017.
Facilities not drawn as at 30 April 2017 were as follows:
HPE Software facilities
 – The new $2,600.0m senior secured seven year term loan B issued by 
Seattle SpinCo, Inc. is priced at LIBOR plus 2.75% (subject to a LIBOR 
ﬂoor of 0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%;
Micro Focus facilities
 – The new $385.0m senior secured seven year term loan B issued by MA 
FinanceCo LLC is also priced at LIBOR plus 2.75% (subject to a LIBOR 
ﬂoor of 0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%; and
 – The new Euro 470m (equivalent to $500.0 million) senior secured seven 
year term loan B issued by MA FinanceCo LLC is priced at EURIBOR plus 
3.00% (subject to a EURIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) with an original issue 
discount of 0.25%.
The above new facilities are a modiﬁcation only of the existing facilities and 
the unamortized prepaid facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts 
have not been accelerated as a result. The remaining unamortized prepaid 
facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts will be recognized over 
the life of the new debt.
The New Facilities will be used to;
(i)  Fund the pre-Completion cash payment by Seattle SpinCo, Inc. to HPE of 
$2,500.0m (subject to certain adjustments in limited circumstances), 
(ii)  Fund the Return of Value to Micro Focus’ existing Shareholders of 
$500.0m and 
(iii)  Pay transaction costs. The balance will be used for general corporate and 
working capital purposes.
Micro Focus is already beneﬁtting from the reduced interest rate margin 
and repayment terms on the existing term loans. The only ﬁnancial covenant 
attaching to these facilities relates to the Revolving Facility, which is subject 
to an aggregate net leverage covenant only in circumstances where more 
than 35% of the Revolving Facility is outstanding at a ﬁscal quarter end. 
As 30 April 2017, $80.0m of the Revolving Facility of $375.0m was drawn, 
representing 21.3%. The facility was less than 35% drawn at 30 April 2017 
and therefore no covenant test is applicable.
The strategic report does not contain any information about persons with 
whom the Company has contractual or other arrangements which are essential 
to the business of the Company as, in the view of the directors, there are no 
such arrangements.

So far as they are aware, the directors at the date of this report conﬁrm that 
there is no relevant audit information (that is, information needed by the 
Company’s auditors in connection with preparing their report) of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware and that the directors have taken all 
reasonable steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make

Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Following the Audit Tender process KPMG LLC have indicated their 
willingness to become the Auditors of the Group and a resolution regarding 
their appointment will be proposed at the AGM.
Going concern
The directors, having made enquiries and produced a Viability Statement 
(page 44), consider that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
and therefore it is appropriate to maintain the going concern basis in 
preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Post balance sheet events
Post balance sheet events have been reported in note 38 in this Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each 
ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the group ﬁnancial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in 
conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (collectively “IFRS”) 
and company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable 
in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
directors must not approve the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the group and company for that period. 
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 – State whether applicable International Financial Reporting Standards 
as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and 
in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union (collectively 
“IFRS”) have been followed for the group ﬁnancial statements and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102, have been 
followed for the company ﬁnancial statements, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
 – Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
 – Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the group and company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that 
are sufﬁcient to show and explain the group and company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the 
group and company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group 
and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group and company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the board of 
directors section conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 – The company ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 102 “The 
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland”, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the company;
 – The group ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in conformity with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (collectively “IFRS”), give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of the 
group; and
 – The Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the group and company, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In the case of each director in ofﬁce at the date the Directors’ Report is approved:
 – So far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of 
which the group and company’s auditors are unaware; and
 – They have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the group and company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

—— Report on the Group ﬁnancial statements  
Our opinion
In our opinion, Micro Focus International plc’s Group ﬁnancial statements 
(the “ﬁnancial statements”):
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 April 
2017 and of its proﬁt and cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in the ‘Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies’, the group, in 
addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by 
the IASB.
What we have audited
The ﬁnancial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 
(the “Annual Report”), comprise:
 – the Consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as at 30 April 2017;
 – the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year 
then ended;
 – the Consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the year then ended;
 – the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
 – the Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies; and 
 – the notes to the ﬁnancial statements, which include other explanatory 
information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual 
Report, rather than in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements. These are 
cross-referenced from the ﬁnancial statements and are identiﬁed as audited.
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the ﬁnancial statements is IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
and applicable law.

Areas of 
focus
 – Overall Group materiality: $16.8m which 
represents approximately 3.5% of proﬁt before 
tax, exceptional items and amortisation of 
purchased intangibles.
 – The Micro Focus Group has ﬁnance functions in 
three principal locations around the world, being 
the UK, US and Ireland. One of these is the 
Group’s head ofﬁce located in the UK where 
our work on the Group consolidation was 
conducted. Local teams in the US and Ireland 
audited the primary business components 
accounted for from those locations, with the 
Group audit team visiting these locations during 
the year both to direct and supervise the work 
of local teams and to make sure we had a full 
and complete understanding of their work – 
particularly in so far as it related to the identiﬁed 
areas of focus.
 – In total, locations where we performed audit 
work accounted for 75% of the Group revenues 
and 70% of the Group’s revenues.
 – Revenue recognition
 – Fair value of acquisition accounting
 – Exceptional costs and restructuring provisions
 – Taxation
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements. In particular, we looked 
at where the directors made subjective judgments, for example in respect 
of signiﬁcant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits 
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, 
including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors 
that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identiﬁed as “areas 
of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit 
to address these speciﬁc areas in order to provide an opinion on the ﬁnancial 
statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our 
procedures should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all 
risks identiﬁed by our audit. 
98 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Micro Focus International plc  Revenue recognition
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Refer also to notes 1 and 2 (pages 1 19 to 121)
We focused on this area because the allocation of revenue to each 
component of a sale (Licence, Maintenance, Subscription and Consulting), 
when sold together in a bundle, requires the application of judgment in 
allocating revenue between the components of the bundle. We assessed 
this risk to be greatest in larger transactions, where there is increased 
likelihood of unusual sales arrangements containing bespoke terms.
Given that Licence revenue is generally recognised up front in full, whereas 
Maintenance and Subscription revenue is spread over the duration of the 
contact term, the risk of there being inappropriate allocation of revenue also 
becomes more relevant in the period immediately prior to the year end.
We also addressed how processes and controls may have been 
circumvented and manual adjustments made to revenue.
Our testing focused on the larger and more complex revenue transactions 
throughout the year and on sales made around the year end to check that 
revenue was accounted for in the correct period. In aggregate, the contracts 
tested accounted for approximately 27% of total Licence revenue during 
the year.
In respect of sales contracts tested, we checked that the fair value 
allocation of revenue between the Licence, Maintenance, Subscription and 
Consulting components at deal inception was in line with the terms of the 
sales contracts and Group accounting policies. This included considering 
any unusual terms in the sales contracts and the period during which 
Maintenance is to be provided to the customer. We tested the basis upon 
which management calculate the fair value attributable to the components 
of revenue by reference to the sales price achieved when components are 
sold on a standalone basis, which we found to be consistent.
In order to identify where processes and controls may have been 
circumvented and inappropriate manual adjustments made to revenue, 
we used data analysis techniques to identify revenue postings in certain 
signiﬁcant reporting entities not generated by cash or trade receivables 
or a release from deferred income.
Having identiﬁed those transactions, we traced a sample to supporting 
documentary evidence that, without exception, supported their validity.

99 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Fair value of acquisition accounting
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Refer also to note 37 (pages 157 to 163) 
We focused on this area because the fair value adjustments (which included 
the creation of intangible assets, associated deferred tax liabilities, and a 
reduction in deferred income) in relation to the Serena acquisition were 
judgmental in nature and also material or potentially material.
Serena Software Inc. (“Serena”) was acquired on 2 May 2016 for $277.6m, 
payable in cash at completion. At the acquisition date, the carrying value of 
its net assets totaled $147.3m. Adjustments to record the assets and 
liabilities at fair value (as is required by accounting standards) decreased 
the value of the acquired net assets by $249.3m. As a result goodwill 
totaling $379.7m was established.
Our testing focused on the larger and more judgmental fair value 
adjustments that were recorded. Particular adjustments we tested were:
Intangible assets – intangible assets of $317.7m were valued, representing 
customer relationships, trade names and technology. The directors obtained 
external valuations for the acquired intangible assets. Using our own 
valuations expertise, we evaluated the valuation methodologies used for 
each type of asset and satisﬁed ourselves that the methodology was 
appropriate and consistent with market practice. We also examined the 
key assumptions used as inputs to the valuation models to assess whether 
these were consistent with our understanding of the Serena business, 
its historical performance and the markets in which it operates. These 
assumptions included revenue and proﬁt forecasts, discount rates, customer 
attrition rates, technology obsolescence rates and royalty rates. We found 
that the key valuation assumptions were within our expected range and 
that the valuation methodologies applied were appropriate.
Deferred tax – In accordance with accounting standards, the creation of 
these intangible assets resulted in the creation of deferred tax liabilities 
on acquisition of $109.2m. We examined and satisﬁed ourselves with the 
methodology and tax rates used to calculate these liabilities. This involved 
reference to the tax jurisdictions in which Serena operates, levels of 
business in those jurisdictions and the manner in which proﬁts are 
expected to be repatriated and taxed.
Deferred income – Adjustments totalling $4.6m were recorded reducing 
the value of deferred income. The purpose of this adjustment was to record 
the liability at the fair value for which it could be settled between 
knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. We checked 
that the methodology used to calculate the fair value was appropriate under 
the accounting standards, consistent with market practice for this type of 
transaction and consistent with recent transactions entered into by the Group. 
We found this to be the case. We also tested the appropriate unwinding of 
the deferred income adjustment in line with the revenue proﬁle. This reduction 
in deferred income resulted in $3.8m less revenue recognised in the 
post-acquisition period than there would have been if no adjustment had 
been made.
100 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Micro Focus International plc 
continued Exceptional costs and restructuring provisions
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
Refer also to notes 3 and 24 (pages 121 to 123 and 142 to 143) 
Consistent with the prior year, restructuring activities have occurred in 
relation to both the integration of The Attachmate Group Inc. (“TAG”) and 
Serena Software Inc. (“Serena”) businesses, which has led to $27.7m of 
integration costs. In addition, pre-acquisition costs of $58.0m have been 
incurred in relation to the future acquisition of HPE Software. These 
costs mostly relate to due diligence work, legal work on the acquisition 
agreements, professional advisors on the transaction and pre-integration 
costs relating to activities in readiness for the HPE Software acquisition 
across all functions of the existing Micro Focus business.
The presentation of restructuring and pre-acquisition costs in the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as exceptional expenses 
required additional consideration, as the classiﬁcation of an expense as 
exceptional depends on judgments made by the directors in identifying such 
items. Consistency in identifying and disclosing items as exceptional is 
important in order to maintain comparability of the results year on year.
Provisions as at 30 April 2017 primarily comprise $16.2m for onerous lease 
and dilapidation and $12.1m for restructuring and integration. Additions in 
the year primarily comprised $4.6m in respect of changes in the estimated 
time to sublease a North American property, and $48.5m in relation to 
severance and integration activities in bringing together the Base Micro 
Focus, TAG, Serena and GWAVA organisations into one organisation. 
There have been $43.5m of provision utilisations in the year.
The extent of restructuring and integration costs/credits provided for in 
the ﬁnancial statements involves the exercise of judgment regarding the 
estimate of future costs and the extent to which a constructive obligation 
exists. The estimate of onerous lease provisions also requires judgment – 
in particular, where the directors intend to sub-let the property, given 
uncertainties regarding the expected rental income and the time delay 
in securing a sub-tenant.
We tested the presentation of exceptional items by assessing whether 
the classiﬁcation in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
was in line with the Group’s accounting policy set out on page 125 and 
whether the accounting policy was consistent with IFRS. We found no 
issues regarding the accounting policy or its application. Where provisions 
were recorded that were in respect of exceptional items, we reconciled the 
exceptional charge recorded in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income to the movement in the related provision.
We selected a sample of items in respect of which restructuring and 
pre-acquisition costs had been recognised, focusing in particular on the 
more signiﬁcant costs. For the sample selected we found that the costs 
recognised were consistent with supporting documentation and were 
appropriately classiﬁed.
We tested the onerous lease and dilapidation provisions by agreeing details 
of property obligations to underlying rental contracts for a selection of 
properties. For properties that the Group expects to sub-let, we noted that 
the Group had engaged third parties in the active marketing of properties 
and we compared the period of assumed vacancy prior to the expected 
sub-let date to supporting documentation. We also assessed whether the 
sub-let income assumed was commensurate with rental rates under 
negotiation with potential sub-let tenants. We found management’s 
estimates to be consistent with these observations.

The existing Group structure is complex and the Group also has a 
signiﬁcant presence in jurisdictions that have more complex tax legislation. 
This brings with it an increased level of complexity and uncertainty in 
relation to the appropriate level of provisioning required throughout 
the Group.
We used our tax specialists to evaluate the judgments and calculations 
made by management in estimating the provisions held in respect of 
uncertain tax positions. In doing so we assessed the provisions recognised 
in the ﬁnancial statements by reference to the outcome of prior tax audits 
conducted on the Group, correspondence between the Group and relevant 
tax authorities, the view of the Group’s tax advisors and our own experience 
in these areas. We found the provisions to be within an acceptable range.
We used our local tax expertise in the UK and US to understand the key 
judgments made by the Group in relation to ongoing integration activities 
within the Group. We held meetings with senior management and read 
correspondence from the Group’s external tax advisors and considered 
their views on these matters. We assessed and formed our own views on 
the key judgments made by the Group and found that the judgments made 
were materially consistent with our own views in respect of the signiﬁcant 
tax exposures.

102 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work 
to be able to give an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. 
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we assessed the audit 
signiﬁcance of each reporting unit in the Group by reference to both its 
ﬁnancial signiﬁcance and other indicators of audit risk, such as the complexity 
of operations and the degree of estimation and judgment in the ﬁnancial 
results. We also considered the changes to the overall Group as a result of 
the acquisition and ongoing integration of Serena Software Inc. in the year 
and where the key business activities and transactions reside.
Following this assessment, we determined that we needed to focus our audit 
work at the Group’s head ofﬁce. We also instructed PwC US and PwC Ireland, 
as component auditors, to perform audits of ﬁnancial information of the 
signiﬁcant reporting units accounted for locally in those territories. We visited 
these locations during the year to ensure we obtained a full understanding of 
the operational activities, and appropriately scoped risks and agreed responses 
to those risks. We also attended audit clearance meetings in these locations 
and took an active part in reviewing the work undertaken by PwC US and PwC 
Ireland on the areas of signiﬁcant risk and areas of focus relevant to their 
locations. This, together with additional procedures performed at the Group 
level over the consolidation process, gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole.
In total, locations where we performed audit work accounted for 75% of Group 
revenues and 70% of the Group’s cost base.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was inﬂuenced by our application of materiality. We set 
certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative 
considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, 
timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual ﬁnancial statement 
line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both 
individually and on the ﬁnancial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the 
ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group 
materiality
$16.8m (2016: $14.8m).
How we 
determined it
3.5% of profit before tax, exceptional items and 
amortisation of purchased intangibles.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
We applied this benchmark to eliminate volatility and 
preserve the link between materiality and the 
performance of the underlying business.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identiﬁed during our audit above $840,000 (2016: $700,000) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set 
out on page 96, in relation to going concern. We have nothing to report having 
performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything 
material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the directors’ statement 
about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. We have nothing material to add or to 
draw attention to. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it 
is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it to do so, for 
at least one year from the date the ﬁnancial statements were signed. As part 
of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Consistency of other information and compliance with applicable requirements
Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 – the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the ﬁnancial statements; and
 – the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have 
identiﬁed any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – information in the Annual Report is:
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited ﬁnancial 
statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our 
audit; or 
 – otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the statement given by the directors on page 96, in accordance with 
provision C.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that 
they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for members to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy 
is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group acquired in the 
course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report.
 – the section of the Annual Report on pages 61 to 64, as required by 
provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the Audit Committee 
does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the 
Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions to report.
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group.
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 – the directors’ conﬁrmation on page 36 of the Annual Report, in accordance 
with provision C.2.1 of the Code, that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
 – the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
 – the directors’ explanation on page 44 of the Annual Report, in accordance 
with provision C.2.2 of the Code, as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
104 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Independent auditors’ report to the members  
of Micro Focus International plc 
continued Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement 
that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability 
of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and 
only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process 
supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment 
with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements 
are consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not 
made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the Code. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
Responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements 
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out 
on page 96, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the 
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgments against available evidence, forming our own judgments, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the 
Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we consider whether 
those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements. 
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Company ﬁnancial statements of 
Micro Focus International plc for the year ended 30 April 2017 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having 
been audited.

*  Provision utilization consisting of cash payments of $55.6m for the year ended 30 April 2016, has been revised from provision movements to working capital movements with a 
corresponding impact on the effects of exchange rate changes line. Subsequent to the revision, the remaining amounts presented in provision movements represent expenses net of 
reversals recorded within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The presentation of bank loan costs paid of $1.8m for the year ended 30 April 2016, has been revised 
from cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities to cash ﬂows from operating activities as management determined they were inappropriately presented within cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing 
activities. Management does not believe these corrections are material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in any periods. The revision did not 
impact the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity in any periods.
The principal non-cash transaction in the year ended 30 April 2017 was the cashless rollover of Term Loan C to Term Loan B-2.
11 0 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Consolidated statement of cash ﬂows 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 General information
Micro Focus International plc (“Company”) is a public limited Company 
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered ofﬁce is, 
The Lawn, 22-30 Old Bath Road, Newbury, RG14 1QN, UK. Micro Focus 
International plc and its subsidiaries (together “Group”) provide innovative 
software to clients around the world enabling them to dramatically improve the 
business value of their enterprise applications. As at 30 April 2017, the Group 
had a presence in 40 countries (2016: 39) worldwide and employed 
approximately 4,800 people (2016: 4,200). 
The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Following Completion of the acquisition of HPE Software, the Group intends to 
align its ﬁnancial year end to 31 October and will report an 18 month ﬁnancial 
period ending 31 October 2018.
The Group consolidated ﬁnancial statements were authorized for issuance 
by the board of directors on 1 1 July 2017.
Signiﬁcant Accounting policies
A Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and in conformity with 
IFRS as adopted by the European Union (collectively “IFRS”). The consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the 
historical cost convention.
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the 
use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to 
exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or 
areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements are disclosed below in II, ‘Critical accounting estimates 
and assumptions’.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are set out below. Other than as described 
below, the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year ended 30 April 2016, apart from standards, 
amendments to or interpretations of published standards adopted during the 
year, certain cash ﬂow classiﬁcation described in consolidated statements of 
cash ﬂows; and the re-classiﬁcation of costs in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Re-classiﬁcation of costs for Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income Presentation
As part of the HPE Software transaction the Company’s shares and ADS will 
be listed on the LSE and NYSE respectively. As part of the regulatory ﬁling 
process in the USA the Group has reviewed its consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income presentation and has decided to re-classify both 
amortization of product development costs and amortization of acquired 
technology intangibles from research and development expenses to cost of 
sales. This presentation complies with IFRS and, in the view of the Company’s 
Audit Committee, provides investors with a consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income presentation that is more comparable with other 
software companies listed on both markets. The year ended 30 April 2016 
comparatives have also been re-classiﬁed and additional detail is provided on 
the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income this year. 
B Consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements of the Group comprise the ﬁnancial statements of 
the Company and entities controlled by the Company, its subsidiaries and the 
Group’s share of its interests in associates prepared at the consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position date. 
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group has control over 
an entity where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from 
its involvement within the entity and it has the power over the entity to effect 
those returns. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing control. 
Control is presumed to exist when the Group owns more than half of the voting 
rights (which does not always equal percentage ownership) unless it can be 
demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control. The results of 
subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control passes to the 
Group. The results of disposed subsidiaries are consolidated up to the date 
on which control passes from the Group. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition 
of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of exchange, with costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition being expensed. Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and 
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill.
Where new information is obtained within the ‘measurement period’ (deﬁned 
as the earlier of the period until which the Group receives the information it 
was seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition 
date or learns that more information is not obtainable, or one year from the 
acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed as at the 
acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the 
amounts recognized as of that date, the Group recognizes these adjustments 
to the acquisition balance sheet with an equivalent offsetting adjustment to 
goodwill. Where new information is obtained after this measurement period 
has closed, this is reﬂected in the post-acquisition period. 
For partly owned subsidiaries, the allocation of net assets and net earnings 
to outside shareholders is shown in the line ‘Attributable to non-controlling 
interests’ on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
and the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies 
adopted by the Group.
At 30 April 2017, the Group had a 74.7% (2016: 71.5%) interest in Novell 
Japan Ltd.
Associates
An associate is an entity, that is neither a subsidiary or a joint venture, over 
whose operating and ﬁnancial policies the Group exercises signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is presumed to exist where the Group has 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but can also arise where the 
Group holds less than 20% if it has the power to be actively involved and 
inﬂuential in policy decisions affecting the entity.

111 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 B Consolidation (continued)
Associates are accounted for under the equity method, where the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated ﬁnancial position 
includes the Group’s share of their proﬁts and losses and net assets, less any 
impairment in value. This involves recording the investment initially at cost to 
the Group, which therefore includes any goodwill on acquisition and then, in 
subsequent periods, adjusting the carrying amount of the investment to reﬂect 
the Group’s share of the associates’ post-acquisition proﬁts and losses, which 
is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and its 
share of post-acquisition comprehensive income, which is recognized in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Unrealized gains arising 
from transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interests in the associates.
At 30 April 2017 the Group had a 12.5% interest ($10.5m) (2016: 14.3%, 
$12.7m) investment in Open Invention Network LLC (“OIN”). There are eight 
(2016: seven) equal shareholders of OIN, all holding 12.5% (2016: 14.3%) 
interest, and each shareholder has one board member and one alternative 
board member. The Group exercises signiﬁcant inﬂuence over OIN’s operation 
and therefore accounts for its investment in OIN as an associate. 
C Revenue recognition
The Group recognizes revenues from sales of software Licences (including 
Intellectual Property and Patent rights, to end-users, resellers and Independent 
Software Vendors (“ISV”)), software maintenance, subscription, technical 
support, training and professional services, upon ﬁrm evidence of an 
arrangement, delivery of the software and determination that collection of a 
ﬁxed or determinable fee is reasonably assured. ISV revenue includes fees 
based on end usage of ISV applications that have our software embedded in 
their applications. When the fees for software upgrades and enhancements, 
maintenance, consulting and training are bundled with the Licence fee, they 
are unbundled using the Group’s objective evidence of the fair value of the 
elements represented by the Group’s customary pricing for each element in 
separate transactions. If evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered 
elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered 
elements, revenue is ﬁrst allocated to the elements where fair value has been 
established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements. 
If evidence of fair value for any undelivered element of the arrangement does 
not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that 
there is evidence of delivery.
If the arrangement includes acceptance criteria, revenue is not recognized until 
the Group can objectively demonstrate that the acceptance criteria have been 
met, or the acceptance period lapses, whichever is earlier. 
The Group recognizes Licence revenue derived from sales to resellers upon 
delivery to resellers, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met; 
otherwise revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of the product to 
the end-user. Where the Group sells access to a Licence for a speciﬁed period 
of time and collection of a ﬁxed or determinable fee is reasonably assured, 
Licence revenue is recognized upon delivery, except in instances where future 
substantive upgrades or similar performance obligations are committed to. 
Where these future performance obligations are speciﬁed in the Licence 
agreement, and fair value can be attributed to those upgrades, revenue for 
the future performance obligations is deferred and recognized on the basis 
of the fair value of the upgrades in relation to the total estimated sales value 
of all items covered by the licence agreement. Where the future performance 
obligations are unspeciﬁed in the Licence agreement, revenue is deferred and 
recognized rateably over the speciﬁed period. 
For Subscription revenue where access and performance obligations are 
provided evenly over a deﬁned term, the revenue is deferred and recognized 
rateably over the speciﬁed period.
Maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of 
the contract, which in most cases is one year. Revenue from consulting and 
training services is recognized on a percentage of completion basis as the 
services are performed. The stage of completion is measured on the basis 
of services performed to date as a percentage of the total services to be 
performed. Amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition 
criteria are included in deferred income.
Rebates paid to partners as part of a contracted program are netted against 
revenue where the rebate paid is based on the achievement of sales targets 
made by the partner, unless the Company receives an identiﬁable good or 
service from the partner that is separable from the sales transaction and for 
which the Group can reasonably estimate fair value.
D Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes costs related to the amortization of product development 
costs, amortization of acquired technology intangibles, costs of the consulting 
business and helpline support and royalties payable to third parties.
E Segment reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’, the Group has derived the 
information for its operating segments using the information used by the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“the Executive Committee”). Operating segments 
are consistent with those used in internal management reporting and the 
measure used by the Executive Committee is the Adjusted Operating Proﬁt 
for the Group as a whole as set out in note 4. The Group has two operating 
segments: Micro Focus Product Portfolio and SUSE Product Portfolio. Details 
of the Group’s operating segments can be found in the Strategic Report.
F Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those signiﬁcant items which are separately disclosed 
by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the 
Group’s ﬁnancial performance. Management of the Group ﬁrst evaluates group 
strategic projects such as acquisitions, divestitures and integration activities, 
company tax restructuring and other one off events such as restructuring 
programs. In determining whether an event or transaction is exceptional, 
management of the Group considers quantitative and qualitative factors such 
as its expected size, precedent for similar items and the commercial context 
for the particular transaction, while ensuring consistent treatment between 
favourable and unfavourable transactions impacting revenue, income and 
expense. Examples of transactions which may be considered of an exceptional 
nature include major restructuring programmes, cost of acquisitions or the cost 
of integrating acquired businesses.
G Employee beneﬁt costs
a) Pension obligations and long-term pension assets
The Group operates various pension schemes, including both deﬁned 
contribution and deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans. A deﬁned contribution plan is 
a pension plan under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions into a separate 
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁcient assets to pay all employees 
the beneﬁts relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. 
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan that is not a deﬁned contribution plan.
For deﬁned contribution plans the Group pays contributions to publicly or 
privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual 
or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as an employee 
beneﬁt expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as 
an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments 
is available.
11 2 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 
continued G Employee beneﬁt costs (continued)
Typically, deﬁned beneﬁt plans deﬁne an amount of pension beneﬁt that an 
employee will receive on retirement. This is usually dependent on one or more 
factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognized in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position in 
respect of deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. Certain long-term pension assets do not meet the deﬁnition of plan 
assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the 
creditors of the Group. Such assets are recorded separately in the consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position as long-term pension assets. The deﬁned 
beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that have terms to mature 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in 
actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise. Past-service costs are recognized 
immediately in income. 
The current service cost of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan, recognized in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in employee beneﬁt 
expense, except where included in the cost of an asset, reﬂects the increase 
in the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation resulting from employee service in the current 
year, beneﬁt changes, curtailments and settlements.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation and the fair value of plan assets. 
This cost is included in employee beneﬁt expense in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Long-term pension assets relate to the reimbursement right under insurance 
policies held in the Group with guaranteed interest rates that do not meet the 
deﬁnition of a qualifying insurance policy as they have not been pledged to the 
plan and are subject to the creditors of the Group. Such reimbursement rights 
assets are recorded in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as 
long-term pension assets. Fair value of the reimbursement right asset is 
deemed to be the present value of the related obligation because the right to 
reimbursement under the insurance policies exactly matches the amount and 
timing of some or all of the beneﬁts payable under the deﬁned beneﬁt plan. 
b) Share based compensation
The Group operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans 
during the year.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of the shares or options is recognized as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the shares or options granted. Non-market vesting conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. Market vesting conditions are taken into account when 
determining the fair value of the options at grant date. At each consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position date, the Group revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognizes the 
impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the 
remaining vesting period.
The shares are recognized when the options are exercised and the proceeds 
received allocated between ordinary shares and share premium account. Fair 
value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate 
for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations. The Additional Share Grants have been valued using the 
Monte-Carlo simulation pricing model.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the 
share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself, and the charge 
is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
c) Employee beneﬁt trust
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group sponsored Employee Beneﬁt 
Trust are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as it is considered 
to be an intermediate payment arrangement. In particular, the Trust’s purchases 
of shares in the Company remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they 
vest unconditionally with employees.
H Foreign currency translation
a) Functional and presentation currency
The presentation currency of the Group is US dollars. Items included in the 
ﬁnancial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured in the 
functional currency of each entity. The Group uses the local currency as the 
functional currency, except for two entities based in Ireland (Novell Ireland 
Software Limited and Novell Ireland Real Estate Limited) and the parent 
company, where the functional currency is the US dollar.
b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from 
the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
c) Group companies
The results and ﬁnancial position of all the Group entities that have a functional 
currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
presentation currency as follows:
i)  Assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position 
presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position;
ii)  Income and expenses for each consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income item are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average 
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates 
prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses 
are translated at the dates of the transactions); and
iii)  All resulting exchange differences are recognized as a separate component 
of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign entities are taken to other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the 
closing rate, with the exception for goodwill arising before 1 May 2004 which 
is treated as an asset of the Company and expressed in the Company’s 
functional currency.

I Intangible assets
a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair 
value of the net identiﬁable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of 
acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible 
assets. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is 
allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
Each of those cash-generating units represents the Group’s investment in 
each area of operation by each primary reporting segment.
b) Computer software
Computer software licences are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred 
to acquire and bring into use the speciﬁc software. These costs are amortized 
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to 
ﬁve years.
c) Research and development
Research expenditure is recognized as an expense as incurred in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in research and 
development expenses. Costs incurred on product development projects 
relating to the developing of new computer software programmes and 
signiﬁcant enhancement of existing computer software programmes are 
recognized as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a 
success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs 
can be measured reliably. Only direct costs are capitalized which are the 
software development employee costs and third party contractor costs. 
Product development costs previously recognized as an expense are not 
recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Product development costs are amortized from the commencement of the 
commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis over the period 
of its expected beneﬁt, typically being three years, and are included in costs 
of sales in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
d) Intangible assets – arising on business combinations
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortization. Amortization is charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life 
of each intangible asset. Intangible assets are amortized from the date they are 
available for use. The estimated useful lives will vary for each category of asset 
acquired and to date are as follows:
Purchased software Three to five years
Trade names Three to 20 years
Technology Three to 10 years
Customer relationships Two to 10 years
Amortization of purchased software intangibles is included in administrative 
expenses, of technology intangibles in cost of sales and of trade names and 
customer relationships intangibles in selling and distribution costs in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
J Property, plant and equipment
All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is 
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated 
with the item will ﬂow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income during the ﬁnancial year 
in which they are incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to write off the cost of each asset to its residual value over its 
estimated useful life as follows:
Buildings 30 years
Leasehold improvements Three to 10 years
Fixtures and fittings Two to seven years
Computer equipment One to five years
Freehold land is not depreciated. The assets’ residual values and useful lives 
are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its 
estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined 
by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Property held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or 
estimated fair value less costs to sell.
K Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject to amortization and 
are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortization 
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss 
is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair 
value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows being cash-generating units. Any non-ﬁnancial 
assets other than goodwill which have suffered impairment are reviewed for 
possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Assets that are 
subject to amortization and depreciation are also reviewed for any possible 
impairment at each reporting date.
L Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost 
of ﬁnished goods comprises software for resale and packaging materials. 
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
When work has been performed and the revenue is not yet recognized, the 
direct costs of third party contractors and staff will be treated as work in 
progress where the probability of invoicing and evidence of collectability 
can be demonstrated.
11 4 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 
continued M Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortized cost less provisions for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence 
that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated 
future cash ﬂows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the 
provision is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
N Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with 
banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown 
within borrowings in current liabilities on the consolidated statement of 
ﬁnancial position.
O Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are 
stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost and redemption 
value being recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income over the period of borrowing on an effective interest basis.
P Leases
Leases where the lessor retains a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are classiﬁed as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the period of the lease.
Q Taxation
Current and deferred tax are recognized in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, except when the tax relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with directly 
in equity.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax 
liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. 
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of 
the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt nor loss, it is not 
accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the consolidated statement 
of ﬁnancial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred 
income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilized.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current tax is recognized based on the amounts expected to be paid or 
recovered under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position date.
R Ordinary shares, share premium and dividend distribution
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividend 
distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognized as a liability in the 
Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved 
by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognized when they 
are paid.
S Financial instruments and hedge accounting
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized in the Group’s consolidated 
statement of ﬁnancial position when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provision of the instrument. Trade receivables are non-interest 
bearing and are stated at their fair value less the amount of any appropriate 
provision for irrecoverable amounts. Trade payables are non-interest bearing 
and are stated at their fair value. In accordance with its treasury policy as at 
30 April 2017 and 2016, the Group does not typically hold or issue derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments for hedge accounting or trading purposes.
T Provisions
Provisions for onerous leases, restructuring costs and legal claims are 
recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of past events; it is probable that an outﬂow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Restructuring 
provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination 
payments. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outﬂow 
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of 
obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an 
outﬂow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations 
may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to 
be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the 
obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognized as an interest expense.

11 5 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 U Adoption of new and revised International Financial 
Reporting Standards
The accounting policies adopted in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
are consistent with those of the annual ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 
30 April 2016, with the exception of the following standards, amendments to 
or interpretations of published standards adopted during the year:
(a)  The following standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards are now effective and have been adopted by the Group:
 – Amendment to IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38, 
‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortization applies for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2016. In this amendment the IASB has 
clariﬁed that the use of revenue based methods to calculate the depreciation 
of an asset is not appropriate because revenue generated by an activity 
that includes the use of an asset generally reﬂects factors other than the 
consumption of the economic beneﬁts embodied in the asset.
 – Annual Improvements 2014 includes amendments to IFRS 5, ‘Non-current 
Assets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations’, IFRS 7, ‘Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures’, IAS 19, ‘Employee Beneﬁts’ and IAS 34, 
‘Interim Financial Reporting’ applies for periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2016.
 – Amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of ﬁnancial statements’ as part of the 
IASB initiative to improve presentation and disclosure in ﬁnancial reports, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016.
 – Amendment to IAS 27, ‘Separate ﬁnancial statements’ on the equity 
method applies to periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These 
amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in their separate 
ﬁnancial statements. 
The amendments above do not have a material impact to the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
(b)  The following standards, interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group:
 – IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ establishes the principles 
that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of ﬁnancial 
statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue 
and cash ﬂows arising from a contract with a customer. Application of the 
standard is mandatory for annual reporting periods starting from 1 January 
2018 onwards. Earlier application is permitted. The standard replaces 
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 1 1 ‘Construction contracts’ and related 
interpretations clariﬁcations. Please refer to below for a more detailed 
assessment to-date on implementing this standard.
 – IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’. This standard replaces the guidance in 
IAS 39 and applies to periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
It includes requirements on the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial 
assets and liabilities; it also includes an expected credit loss model that 
replaces the current incurred loss impairment model.
 – Amendments to IAS 7, ‘Statement of cash ﬂows’ on disclosure initiative are 
effective on periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, subject to EU 
endorsement. This amendment introduces an additional disclosure that will 
enable users of ﬁnancial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities 
arising from ﬁnancing activities and is part of the IASB’s Disclosure 
Initiative, which continues to explore how ﬁnancial statement disclosure 
can be improved.
 – Amendments to IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’ on recognition of deferred tax 
assets for unrealized losses are effective on periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017, subject to EU endorsement. These amendments clarify 
how to account for deferred tax assets originated from unrealized loss in 
debt instruments measured at fair value.
 – Amendments to IFRS 2, ‘Share based payments’ on clarifying how to 
account for certain types of share based payment transactions are effective 
on periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU 
endorsement. These amendments clarify the measurement basis for 
cash-settled share-based payments and the accounting for modiﬁcations 
that change an award from cash-settled to equity-settled. It also introduces 
an exception to the principles in IFRS 2 that will require an award to be 
treated as if it was wholly equity-settled, where an employer is obliged to 
withhold an amount for the employee’s tax obligation associated with a 
share based payment and pay that amount to the tax authority.
 – IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ addresses the deﬁnition of a lease, recognition and 
measurement of leases and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of ﬁnancial statements about the leasing activities of 
both lessees and lessors. A key change arising from IFRS 16 is that most 
operating leases will be accounted for on balance sheet for lessees. The 
standard replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’, and related interpretations. The standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and 
earlier application is permitted if the entity is adopting IFRS 15 ‘Revenue 
from contracts with customers’ at the same time, subject to EU endorsement. 
 – Annual improvements 2014–2016 include amendments to IFRS 1, 
‘First-time adoption of IFRS’, IFRS 12, ‘Disclosure of interests in other 
entities’ and IAS 28, ’Investments in associates and joint ventures’ regarding 
measuring an associate or joint venture at fair value applies for periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU endorsement. 
 – IFRIC 22, ‘Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’ 
addresses foreign currency transactions or parts of transactions where 
there is consideration that is denominated or priced in a foreign currency. 
The interpretation provides guidance for when a single payment/receipt is 
made as well as for situations where multiple payments/receipts are made, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject 
to EU endorsement.
 – Clariﬁcations to IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ are 
effective on periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to EU 
endorsement. These amendments comprise clariﬁcations of the guidance 
on identifying performance obligations, accounting for licences of 
intellectual property and the principal versus agent assessment (gross 
versus net revenue presentation).
 – IFRIC 23, ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’ clariﬁes how to apply 
the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12 when there is 
uncertainty over income tax treatments. In such a circumstance, an entity 
shall recognize and measure its current or deferred tax asset or liability 
applying the requirements in IAS 12 based on taxable proﬁt (tax loss), tax 
bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined 
applying this interpretation. This interpretation is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, subject to EU endorsement.
11 6 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 
continued U Adoption of new and revised International Financial 
Reporting Standards (continued)
For IFRS 9, IFRS 16, IFRIC 22 and IFRIC 23, it is too early to determine how 
signiﬁcant the effect on reported results and ﬁnancial position will be. The 
impact of IFRS 15 is discussed below. The impact of the other standards, 
amendments and interpretations listed above will not have a material impact 
on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
Impact of IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’
On 28 May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for the 
Group starting 1 November 2018, following the announcement of the new 
year-end date. We do not plan to adopt IFRS 15 early. The standard permits 
two possible transition methods for the adoption of the new guidance:
 – Retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented in accordance with 
IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”, 
or
 – Retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard 
recognized on the date of the initial application (cumulative catch-up 
approach).
We currently plan to adopt the new standard using the cumulative catch-up 
approach. We are in the process of assessing the impact developing our future 
IFRS 15 revenue recognition policies and adjusting the relevant business 
processes to adopt these new policies. We have established a project across 
Micro Focus’ business to review the impacts of IFRS 15 and as part of this 
effort, the most notable difference to date is in relation to certain incremental 
costs of obtaining a contract. IFRS 15 requires the capitalization and 
amortization of certain in-scope sales commissions and third party costs to 
match the recognition of the associated revenue. An evaluation study is 
underway to determine the potential impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements in the year of adoption. There will be no impact to cash ﬂows. 
IFRS 15 may also change the way we allocate on a transaction price to 
individual performance obligations which can impact the classiﬁcation and 
timing of revenues. Further analysis of the requirements is currently being 
undertaken to understand the possible impact, if any.
In addition to the effects on our consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, we expect changes to our consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position 
(in particular due to the recognition of contract assets/contract liabilities, the 
differentiation between contract assets and trade receivables, the capitalization 
and amortization of costs of obtaining a contract and an impact in retained 
earnings from the initial adoption of IFRS 15) and changes to the quantitative 
and qualitative disclosure included. 
We will continue to assess all of the impacts that the application of IFRS 15 will 
have on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements in the period of initial application, 
which will also signiﬁcantly depend on our business and Go-to-Market strategy 
in FY18. The impacts, if material, will be disclosed, including statements on if 
and how we apply any of the practical expedients available in the standard.
II Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group has made its 
best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the ﬁnancial 
statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The Group regularly reviews 
these estimates and updates them as required. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Unless otherwise indicated, the Group does not believe that 
it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported related to the 
accounting estimates and assumptions described below. The Group considers 
the following to be a description of the most signiﬁcant estimates, which 
require the Group to make subjective and complex judgments, and matters 
that are inherently uncertain.
A Potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in 
accordance with the accounting policy K. The recoverable amounts of 
cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. The valuation 
of goodwill and other intangibles is tested annually or whenever there are 
changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts may not be 
recoverable. These tests require the use of estimates. Details of the Group’s 
impairment review and sensitivities to changes in assumptions are disclosed 
in note 9. 
B Provision for income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant 
judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group 
recognizes liabilities for anticipated settlement of tax issues based on 
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome 
of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such 
differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period 
in which such determination is made.
The Group carries appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax 
computations are agreed with the taxation authorities.
C Business combinations
When making acquisitions, the Group has to make judgments and best 
estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price. Where 
acquisitions are signiﬁcant, appropriate advice is sought from professional 
advisors before making such allocations otherwise valuations are done by 
management using consistent methodology used on prior year acquisitions 
where appropriate professional advice was sought. 
D Development expenditure
The Group invests in the product development of future products in 
accordance with the accounting policy I(c). The assessment as to whether this 
expenditure will achieve a complete product for which the technical feasibility 
is assured is a matter of judgment, as is the forecasting of how the product will 
generate future economic beneﬁt. Finally, the period of time over which the 
economic beneﬁt associated with the expenditure occurred will arise is also a 
matter of judgment. These judgments are made by evaluating the development 
plan prepared by the research and development department and approved by 
management, regularly monitoring progress by using an established set of 
criteria for assessing technical feasibility and benchmarking to other products.

Consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements and notes
Company ﬁnancial 
statements and notes Additional information
11 7 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 E Revenue recognition
The key areas of judgment in respect of recognizing revenue are the timing of 
recognition and the fair value allocation between Licence and Maintenance 
revenue, speciﬁcally in relation to recognition and deferral of revenue on support 
contracts where management assumptions and estimates are necessary.
F Exceptional Items and Integration/Restructuring 
Provisions
The Group classiﬁes items as exceptional in line with accounting policy F. 
The classiﬁcation of these items as an exceptional is a matter of judgment. 
This judgment is made by management after evaluating each item deemed to 
be exceptional against the criteria set out within the deﬁned accounting policy. 
G Provisions
The Group has made key judgments relating to provisions. Provisions include 
onerous leases and dilapidations, restructuring and integration, legal and other. 
Key judgments included determining the time to sublet vacant properties, 
restructuring and integration liabilities and the potential outcome of 
legal cases. 
III Financial risk factors
The Group’s multi-national operations expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks 
that include the effects of changes in credit risk, foreign currency risk, interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk. Risk management is carried out by a central treasury 
department under policies approved by the board of directors. Group treasury 
identiﬁes and evaluates ﬁnancial risks alongside the Group’s operating units. 
The board provides written principles for risk management together with speciﬁc 
policies covering areas such as foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit 
risk and liquidity risk, use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments and non-derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments as appropriate, and investment of excess funds. 
In accordance with the treasury policy as at 30 April 2017 and 2016, the 
Group does not typically hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial instruments. 
A Credit risk
Financial instruments which potentially expose the Group to a concentration 
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts 
receivable. Cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality ﬁnancial 
institutions. The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of 
business. Collateral is not required for those receivables, but on-going credit 
evaluations of customers’ ﬁnancial conditions are performed. The Group 
maintains a provision for impairment based upon the expected collectability 
of accounts receivable. The Group sells products and services to a wide range 
of customers around the world and therefore believes there is no material 
concentration of credit risk.
B Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk 
arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the UK 
Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises 
from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net 
investments in foreign operations. Foreign exchange risk arises when future 
commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities are denominated 
in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
There were no hedging transactions in place at 30 April 2017 and 2016. 
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets 
are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
C Interest rate risk
The Group’s income and cash generated from operations are substantially 
independent of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s interest rate risk 
arises from short-term and long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable 
rates expose the Group to cash ﬂow interest rate risk. The Group does not use 
interest rate swaps to manage its cash ﬂow interest rate risk at the present 
time due to low market rates. 
D Liquidity risk
Central treasury carries out cash ﬂow forecasting for the Group to ensure 
that it has sufﬁcient cash to meet operational requirements and to allow the 
repayment of the bank facility. Surplus cash in the operating units over and 
above what is required for working capital needs is transferred to Group 
treasury. These funds are used to repay bank borrowings or invested in interest 
bearing current accounts, time deposits or money market deposits of the 
appropriate maturity period determined by consolidated cash forecasts.
Trade payables arise in the normal course of business and are all current. 
Onerous lease provisions are expected to mature between less than 
12 months and nine years. 
At 30 April 2017 gross borrowings of $1,595.2m (2016: $1,787.3m) related to 
our senior secured debt facilities (see note 20). $142.8m (2016: $287.8m) is 
current of which $80.0m (2016: $225.0m) is the revolving credit facility. The 
borrowings disclosed in the balance sheet are net of pre-paid facility costs.

continued 1 Segmental reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments’, the Group has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (“the Executive Committee”) for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. The Group’s reportable 
segments under IFRS 8 are as follows:
Micro Focus – The Micro Focus Product Portfolio segment contains mature infrastructure software products that are managed on a portfolio basis akin to a 
“fund of funds” investment portfolio. This portfolio is managed with a single product group that makes and maintains the software, whilst the software is sold and 
supported through a geographic Go-to-Market organization. The products within the Micro Focus Product Portfolio are grouped together into ﬁve sub-portfolios 
based on industrial logic: CDMS, Host Connectivity, IAS, Development & ITOM and Collaboration & Networking. 
SUSE – The characteristics of the SUSE Product Portfolio segment are different from the Micro Focus Product Portfolio due to the Open Source nature of its 
offerings and the growth proﬁle of those offerings. SUSE provides and supports enterprise-grade Linux and Open Source solutions. The SUSE Product Portfolio 
comprises: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and Extensions, SUSE OpenStack Cloud, SUSE Enterprise Storage, SUSE Manager and SUSE Linux Enterprise 
Desktop and Workstation Extension. 
Operating segments are consistent with those used in internal management reporting and the proﬁt measure used by the Executive Committee is Adjusted 
Operating Proﬁt. Centrally managed costs are allocated between Micro Focus and SUSE segments based on identiﬁable segment costs with the remainder 
allocated based on other criteria including revenue and headcount.

Integration costs of $27.7m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $23.6m) arose from the work done in bringing together the Base Micro Focus, TAG, 
Serena and GWAVA organizations into one organization. Other activities include: development of a new Group intranet and website, system integration costs. 
The acquisition costs of $2.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 are external costs in evaluating and completing the acquisitions of Serena Software Inc., 
GWAVA Inc. and OpenATTIC completed during the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: acquisition of Authasas BV $0.5m). The costs mostly relate to due diligence 
work, legal work on the acquisition agreements and professional advisors on the transaction. 
Pre-acquisition costs of $58.0m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $5.6m) relate to the acquisition of HPE Software, which was announced in September 
2016 and is expected to complete in the third quarter of calendar year 2017 (note 38). The costs mostly relate to due diligence work, legal work on the 
acquisition agreements, professional advisors on the transaction and pre-integration costs relating to activities in readiness for the HPE Software acquisition 
across all functions of the existing Micro Focus business. 
The property costs of $5.5m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $6.0m) relate to the cost of exiting entire buildings or ﬂoors of buildings which the Group 
are leasing following the integration of the TAG and Serena businesses. The majority of the costs relate to TAG and Serena properties in North America.
Severance and legal costs of $3.4m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $4.8m releases) relate mostly to termination costs for senior Serena executives 
after acquisition.
Royalty provision releases of $3.0m for the year ended 30 April 2016 related to provisions no longer required as a result of new contracts being concluded with 
a third party.

The directors use the Adjusted Operating Proﬁt as the performance measure of the business. 
The use of these alternative performance measures is consistent with those used by sell-side equity analysts who write research on the Group and how 
institutional investors consider the performance of the Group.
Facility EBITDA was the measure used under the Group’s $420m Revolving Credit Facility to determine the Net Debt to Facility EBITDA covenant calculation. 
Whilst the $420m facility was repaid and cancelled as part of the reﬁnancing on the acquisition of TAG, for consistency the directors will continue to use the 
metric Net Debt to Facility EBITDA. These measures are not deﬁned in IFRS and thus may not be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies.

A deferred tax credit of $23.0m (2016: $8.5m credit) as at 30 April 2017 and corporation tax credit of $4.1m (2016: $1.5m) as at 30 April 2017 have been 
recognized in equity in the year in relation to share options. A deferred tax debit of $0.3m (2016: $1.7m debit) as at 30 April 2017 has been recognized in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the year in relation to the deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes.
The tax charge for the year ended 30 April 2017 is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.92% (2016: 20.0%). The differences are 
explained below:

Tax rates, other than the UK standard rate, includes an increase in provisions of $14.8m (2016: $0.8m) for uncertain tax positions relating to the risk of challenge 
from tax authorities to the geographic allocation of proﬁts across the Group. Excluding these provisions, the net impact of the higher foreign tax rates is $3.9m 
(2016: $14.2m). This reduction in the year ended 30 April 2017 is primarily attributable to a lower level of proﬁts subject to US tax. 
The Group realized beneﬁts in relation to intra-group ﬁnancing of $15.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $14.4m). The beneﬁts mostly relate to 
arrangements put in place to facilitate the acquisitions of TAG and Serena. 
Beneﬁts from the UK patent box regime amounted to $7.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: $7.6m). 
The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year is analyzed in note 28.
The Finance Act 2016, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% effective from 1 April 2020, was substantively enacted on 
6 September 2016. This rate reduction has been reﬂected in the calculation of deferred tax at the balance sheet date and has reduced the tax charge in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income by $1.3m. This reﬂects the net impact of the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, in particular liabilities 
relating to intangibles.
The expenses not deductible increase the tax charge in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income by $10.0m (2016: $7.7m). The increase is due to 
non-deductible costs incurred in relation to the acquisitions of Serena and GWAVA and costs incurred in relation to the forthcoming HPE Software transaction.
The Group realized a net credit in relation to the true-up of prior year current and deferred tax estimates of $2.7m for the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: 
$4.6m). In the year ended 30 April 2016, there was a signiﬁcant movement between current and deferred tax in the US as a result of the Group being able to 
utilize signiﬁcantly higher deferred tax assets (losses and tax credits) against prior year current (federal and state) tax liabilities than previously anticipated.

At 30 April 2,828,604 2,436,168
The Group has two operating segments: Micro Focus Product Portfolio and SUSE Product Portfolio. 
The hindsight period adjustments in the year ended 30 April 2016 relate to transactions that occurred within 12 months of the acquisition date and are 
attributable to TAG acquired during the year ended 30 April 2015 (note 37).
The additions to goodwill in the year ended 30 April 2017 relate to the acquisition of Spartacus Acquisition Holdings Corp. the holding company of Serena 
Software Inc. (“Serena”) and GWAVA Inc. (“GWAVA”) (note 37). 
Of the additions to goodwill, there is no amount that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit (“CGU”). The Group 
conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has 
been allocated. It has been determined that the Group has two CGUs being the two product portfolio groups: Micro Focus and SUSE.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the 
carrying value, an impairment results. The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting (2016: $nil). 
The recoverable amounts of the two CGUs are determined based on the value in use (“VIU”) calculations. The determination of whether or not the goodwill of the 
two CGUs has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which that goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future ﬁnancial performance of the CGUs. The cash ﬂow projections in the three following ﬁnancial years reﬂect 
management’s expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGU’s market.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are:
 – The discount rate applied to each CGU;
 – Operating margin; and 
 – The long-term growth rate of net operating cash ﬂows. 
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and 
discount rates and the pressure these place on the impairment calculations.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the operating margins across the two CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the 
absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.

Discount rate applied
The Group based its estimate for the pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) and using long-term market and industry data to 
derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation. The discount rate applied to the two CGUs represents a pre-tax rate that reﬂects market assessment of the time 
value of money at the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position date which has been adjusted for risks speciﬁc to each CGU. For the purposes of the 
impairment review the directors have calculated discount rates for both CGUs and then applied the higher discount rate of 1 1.4% (2016: 1 1.6%). 
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably 
possible. If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash ﬂows of all of the two CGUs were 2.0% (2016: 2.0%) higher in absolute terms 
than the management’s estimate, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
Operating margins
The operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins 
are not indicative of future operating margins.
The operating margins for each of the two CGUs is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past 
operating margin are not indicative of future operating margin. The operating margins applied to the Micro Focus CGU is c.50% (2016: 55%) and the SUSE CGU 
is 31% (2016: 32%). 
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE in the absolute value of operating margins would be the limit of what could 
be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Group’s cost base is ﬂexible and could quickly respond to market changes. The Group is spread 
across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more signiﬁcant changes. If the 
operating margin used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE lower in absolute terms than management’s 
estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge. If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not 
be any impairment charge. 
Long-term growth rate
The VIU calculations are based on ﬁve years projections and then a terminal value calculation. The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ﬂows are 
assumed to be 1% for the Micro Focus CGU (2016: 1%) and 5% for the SUSE CGU (2016: 5%). 
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a change to 0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE is reasonably possible. If the 
absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 0% for Micro Focus and 2.0% for SUSE lower than management’s 
estimates, the Group would not have recognized any goodwill impairment charge.

Of the $28.3m of additions to product development costs, $27.7m (2016: $30.9m) relates to internal product development costs and $0.6m (2016: $0.5m) to

Open Invention Network LLC (“OIN”), a strategic partnership for the Group, licences its global defensive patent pool in exchange for a pledge of non-aggression 
which encourages freedom of action in Linux and the sharing of new ideas and inventions. There are no signiﬁcant restrictions on the ability of associated 
undertakings to transfer funds to the parent. There are no contingent liabilities to the Group’s interest in associates.
At 30 April 2017 the Group had a 12.5% interest ($1 1.5m) (2016: 14.3%, $12.7m) investment in OIN. There are eight (2016: seven) equal shareholders of OIN, 
all holding 12.5% (2016: 14.3%) interest, and each shareholder has one board member and one alternative board member. The Group exercises signiﬁcant 
inﬂuence over OIN’s operation and therefore accounts for its investment in OIN as an associate. 
The Group uses the equity method of accounting for its interest in associates. The following table shows the aggregate movement in the Group’s investment

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and unrelated. The Group considers the 
credit quality of trade and other receivables on a customer by customer basis. The Group considers that the carrying value of the trade and other receivables that 
is disclosed below gives a fair presentation of the credit quality of the assets. This is considered to be the case as there is a low risk of default due to the high 
number of recurring customers and credit control policies. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor 
and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable. Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of 
the normal provision for doubtful receivables. At 30 April 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term 
nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2017, trade receivables of $39.9m (2016: $28.8m) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a large number of independent companies for 
whom there is no recent history of default. The amounts are regarded as recoverable. The average age of these receivables was 24 days in excess of due date 
(2016: 20 days). 
As at 30 April 2017, trade receivables of $2.6m (2016: $4.5m) were either partially or fully impaired. The amount of the provision was $2.6m (2016: $4.5m). 
The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in selling and distribution costs in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income. Amounts charged in the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. The Group does not hold 
any collateral as security.

During the year ended 30 April 2017 the Group renegotiated its debt facilities. 
On 1 August 2016 the Company allocated a re-pricing of its senior secured Term Loan B which reduced its ongoing interest payments. The interest rate was 
reduced from 4.25% to 3.75% and the LIBOR ﬂoor was reduced from 1.00% to 0.75%. All other terms of the Group’s Credit Facilities remained the same. 
The terms of the Micro Focus debt facilities from 1 August 2016 to 28 April 2017 were as follows:
 – Syndicated senior secured tranche B term loan facility (“Term Loan B”), with an interest rate of 3.75% above LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.75%), 
repayable at 1.00% per annum, with an original issue discount of 1.00% and a seven year term;
 – A syndicated senior secured tranche C term loan facility (“Term Loan C”), with an interest rate of 3.75% above LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.75%), 
repayable at 10.00% per annum, with an original issue discount of 1.50% and a ﬁve year term; and
 – A senior secured revolving credit facility of $375.0m, (“Revolving Facility”), with an interest rate of 3.50% above LIBOR on amounts drawn (and 0.50% on 
amounts undrawn) thereunder and an original issue discount of 0.50%. 
The Revolving Facility was increased from $225.0m to $375.0m on 2 May 2016 as part of the funding for the Serena acquisition (note 37).
New Facilities
The Company announced on 21 April 2017 the successful syndication of the new credit facilities (the “New Facilities”) on behalf of both MA FinanceCo, LLC, 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro Focus, and Seattle SpinCo, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of HPE that will hold HPE Software. Post 30 April 2017, Seattle 
SpinCo Inc. will be merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of Micro Focus in the HPE Software Transaction.
The New Facilities comprise a $500.0m Revolving Credit Facility effective on Completion at LIBOR plus 3.50% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) placed with 
a number of ﬁnancial institutions and $5,000.0m of term loans. The new term loans are priced as follows:
New facilities drawn as at 30 April 2017:
 – In relation to the existing senior secured term loans issued by MA FinanceCo, LLC the lenders in the Term Loan C of $412.5m due November 2019 were 
offered a cashless roll of their investment into the existing Term Loan B, becoming Term Loan B-2, due November 2021 and this loan was re-priced to LIBOR 
plus 2.50% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) and as a result of the cashless rollover increased in size from $1,102.7m to $1,515.2m, effective from 
28 April 2017.
Facilities not drawn down as at 30 April 2017 were as follows: 
HPE Software facilities: 
 – The new $2,600.0m senior secured seven year Term Loan B issued by Seattle SpinCo, Inc. is priced at LIBOR plus 2.75% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 
0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%;

Micro Focus facilities: 
 – The new $385.0m senior secured seven year Term Loan B issued by MA FinanceCo LLC is also priced at LIBOR plus 2.75% (subject to a LIBOR ﬂoor of 
0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%; and
 – The new Euro 470.0m (equivalent to $500.0m) senior secured seven year Term Loan B issued by MA FinanceCo LLC is priced at EURIBOR plus 3.00% 
(subject to a EURIBOR ﬂoor of 0.00%) with an original issue discount of 0.25%.
The above new facilities are a modiﬁcation only of the existing facilities and the unamortized prepaid facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts have 
not been accelerated as a result. The remaining unamortized prepaid facility arrangement fees and original issue discounts will be recognized over the life of the 
new debt. 
As part of the HPE Software merger, due to complete in the third quarter of calendar year 2017, the New Facilities will be used to:
(i) Fund the pre-Completion cash payment by Seattle SpinCo Inc. to HPE of $2,500.0m (subject to certain adjustments in limited circumstances);
(ii) Fund the Return of Value to Micro Focus’ existing Shareholders of $500.0m; and 
(iii) Pay transaction costs relating to the acquisition of HPE Software. 
The balance will be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.
The only ﬁnancial covenant attaching to these facilities relates to the Revolving Facility, which is subject to an aggregate net leverage covenant only in 
circumstances where more than 35% of the Revolving Facility is outstanding at a ﬁscal quarter end. 
At 30 April 2017, $80.0m of the available Revolving Facility of $375.0m was drawn, representing 21.3%. The facility was less than 35% drawn at 30 April 2017 
and therefore no covenant test is applicable.

amortized between four and six years. The fair value of borrowings equals their carrying amount.

Onerous leases and dilapidations provisions
The onerous lease and dilapidations provision relates to leased Group properties and this position is expected to be fully utilized within nine years. The provision 
was increased by $4.6m, mostly due to a lengthening in the estimated time to sublease a North American property. 
The provision was increased by $7.7m in the year ended 30 April 2016 due to a lengthening in the estimated time to sublease certain properties and reduced 
by $1.8m due to the shortening in the estimated time to sublease two properties.

Restructuring and integration provisions
Restructuring and integration provision additions in the year ended 30 April 3017 includes severance and integration work undertaken in bringing together the 
Base Micro Focus, TAG, Serena and GWAVA organizations into one organization. This includes, amongst other activities; development of a new Group intranet 
and website and system integration costs. Restructuring and integration provisions also included provisions relating to activities in readiness for the HPE 
Software acquisition across all functions of the existing Micro Focus business. Releases in the period relate to IT programs no longer continuing in light of the 
HPE Software acquisition (none of which was capitalized) and the release of provisions established for the Group reorganization in March 2016. The provisions 
as at 30 April 2017 are expected to be fully utilized within 12 months.
In the year ended 30 April 2016, restructuring and integration provisions related mostly to severance and integration work undertaken during the year. Integration 
provisions arose from the work done in bringing together the Base Micro Focus and TAG organizations into one organization. This includes, amongst other 
activities; email migration, system integration and legal entity reorganization. Severance releases in the year ended 30 April 2016 related to the change in 
estimates made for integrating the TAG business in the year ended 30 April 2015, including the redeployment of staff previously notiﬁed of redundancy. 
Legal provisions
Legal provisions in the year ended 30 April 2017 and 2016 include management’s best estimate of the likely outﬂow of economic beneﬁts associated with 
a number of small ongoing legal matters. Releases of legal provisions in the year ended 30 April 2017 relate to legal matters now resolved.
Other provisions 
Other provisions as at 30 April 2017 include primarily:
 – $0.5m relating to potential future fees; 
 – $nil relating to tax due for pension and bonus payments prior to July 201 1 for a subsidiary in Brazil (2016: $0.2m); and
 – $nil remaining provision for potential customer claims (2016: $1.0m).
Releases of other provisions in the year ended 30 April 2017 related to the potential customer claims and Brazil tax matters now resolved.
25 Pension commitments
a) Deﬁned contribution
The Group has established a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees. The principal funds are those in the US, UK and 
Germany. These were funded schemes of the deﬁned contribution type. Outside of these territories, the schemes are also of the deﬁned contribution type, 
except for France and Japan which is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, but which has few members and therefore is not signiﬁcant to the Group. 
Pension costs for deﬁned contribution schemes are as follows:
2017

Within non-current liabilities:
Retirement benefit obligations (30,773) (31,669)
There are four (2016: three) deﬁned beneﬁt plans in Germany under broadly similar regulatory frameworks. All of the plans are ﬁnal salary pension plans, which 
provide beneﬁts to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life in the case of retirement, disability and death. The level of beneﬁts 
provided depends not only on the ﬁnal salary but also on member’s length of service, social security ceiling and other factors. Final pension entitlements are 
calculated by our Actuary at Swiss Life. They also complete calculations for cases of death in service and disability. There is no requirement for the appointment 
of Trustees in Germany. The schemes are administered locally with the assistance of German pension experts. All four plans were closed for new membership. 
During the year ended 30 April 2017 a pension scheme arrangement in Germany was identiﬁed as requiring reclassiﬁcation under German law from a deﬁned 
contribution scheme to a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme.

Long-term pension assets
Long-term pension assets relate to the reimbursement right under insurance policies held by the Company with guaranteed interest rates that do not meet the 
deﬁnition of a qualifying insurance policy as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Group. Such reimbursement rights 
assets are recorded in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as long-term pension assets. Fair value of the reimbursement right asset is deemed to be 
the present value of the related obligation because the right to reimbursement under the insurance policies exactly matches the amount and timing of some or all 
of the beneﬁts payable under the deﬁned beneﬁt plan. 
The movement on the long-term pension asset is as follows:

Foreign currency exchange (loss)/gain (1,107) 375
As at 30 April 22,031 22,272
The non-plan assets were not subject to an actuarial revaluation until after 30 April 2015 and therefore a hindsight adjustment has been made in respect of this 
and reﬂected in last year’s consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The key assumptions used for the German scheme were:
2017 2016
Rate of increase in final pensionable salary 2.00% 2.60%
Rate of increase in pension payments 2.00% 2.00%
Discount rate 1.95% 1.70%
Inflation 2.00% 2.00%
The net present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations of the German scheme is sensitive to both the actuarial assumptions used and to market conditions. If the 
discount rate assumption was 0.5% lower, the obligation would be expected to increase by $4.5m as at 30 April 2017 (2016: $4.8m) and if it was 0.5% higher, 
they would be expected to decrease by $3.9m (2016: $4.1m). If the inﬂation assumption was 0.25% lower, the obligations would be expected to decrease by 
$1.2m as at 30 April 2017 (2016: $1.3m) and if it was 0.25% higher, they would be expected to increase by $1.3m (2016: $1.4m).
The mortality assumptions for the German scheme are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in the territory, 
speciﬁcally German pension table ‘Richttafeln 2005 G’ by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck.
These assumptions translate into an average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring at age 65: 
2017 2016
Retiring at age 65 at the end of the reporting year:
Male 19 19
Female 23 23
Retiring 15 years after the end of the reporting year:
Male 19 19
Female 24 24
The net present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligations of the German Schemes are sensitive to the life expectancy assumption. If there was an increase of one 
year to this assumption the obligation would be expected to increase by $1.1m (2.9%) as at 30 April 2017 (2016: $1.1m, 2.9%).
The net liability included in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position arising from obligations in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes is as follows:

None of the plan assets are represented by ﬁnancial instruments of the Group. None of the plan assets are occupied or used by the Group. The plan assets 
comprise of re-insurance with guaranteed interest rates. The majority of the plan assets have guaranteed interest rates of 4.0%, with the remaining at 3.25% or 2.75%. 
Through its deﬁned beneﬁt schemes the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are detailed below:
 – Changes in bond yields – A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of 
the pledged and unpledged re-insurance holdings.
 – Inﬂation – Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to inﬂation, and higher inﬂation will lead to higher liabilities. There is a cap on the level of 
inﬂationary increase on one of the plans which protects the plan against extreme inﬂation. The majority of the plan assets are either unaffected by or loosely 
correlated with inﬂation, meaning an increase in inﬂation will also increase the deﬁcit.
 – Life expectancy – The majority of the plan obligations are to provide beneﬁts for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an 
increase in the plan liabilities.
 – In the case of the deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset liability matching (“ALM”) that has 
been developed by the Company to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the pension schemes. In addition to the plan 
assets outlined above, the Company had re-insurance assets valued at $22.1m as at 30 April 2017 (2016: $22.3m). These assets are designated to fund the 
pension obligation and do not qualify as plan assets as they have not been pledged to the plan and are subject to the creditors of the Company. Within this 
framework the Company’s objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in re-insurances that match the beneﬁt payments as they fall 
due and in the appropriate currency.
Sensitivities
The table below provides information on the sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes to the most signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions. The table shows 
the impact of changes to each assumption in isolation, although, in practice, changes to assumptions may occur at the same time and can either offset or 
compound the overall impact on the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation.

These sensitivities have been calculated using the same methodology as used for the main calculations. The weighted average duration of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation is 25 years.

Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.50% (10.6%)
Price inflation 0.25% 3.60%

An increase of one year in the assumed life expectancy for both males and females would increase the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation by 2.9% as at 30 April 2017 
(2016: 2.9%). The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to previous years.

Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s currency exposures comprise those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income as well as gains and losses on consolidation which go to reserves. Such exposures reﬂect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved and the Group’s investment in net assets in currencies other than US$. Note 3 
shows the impact on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of foreign exchange gains in the year ended 30 April 2017 (2016: gain).
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal exposures in relation to market risks are the changes in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the Euro, British Pound and 
Japanese Yen as well as changes in US Dollar LIBOR interest rates. The table below illustrates the sensitivities of the Group’s results to changes in these key 
variables as at the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position date. The analysis covers only ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held at the consolidated statement

Capital risk management
The Group’s objective when managing its capital structures is to minimize the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against volatility 
in earnings and net asset values. The strategy is designed to maximize shareholder return over the long-term. The relative proportion of debt to equity will be 
adjusted over the medium-term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group. 
The only ﬁnancial covenant attaching to these new facilities relates to the Revolving Facility, which is subject to an aggregate net leverage covenant only in 
circumstances where more than 35% of the Revolving Facility is outstanding at a ﬁscal quarter end. The facility was less than 35% drawn at 30 April 2017 
and therefore no covenant test is applicable.

A deferred tax credit to equity of $23.0m (2016: $8.5m) arises during the year in relation to share based payments. The increase in this credit as compared 
to the prior year is due to the signiﬁcant increase in the company’s share price during the year ended 30 April 2017.
The deferred tax asset relating to other temporary differences of $23.7m as at 30 April 2017 (2016: $26.9m) includes temporary differences arising on ﬁxed 
assets, short-term timing differences and the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme.
Deferred tax assets are recognized for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realization of the related tax beneﬁt through the utilization of future taxable 
proﬁts is probable. The Group did not recognize deferred tax assets in relation to the following gross temporary differences, the expiration of which is determined 
by the tax law of each jurisdiction:

Share based payments
The Group has various equity-settled share based compensation plans details of which are provided below.
a) Incentive Plan 2005
On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 (“LTIP”) which permits the granting of share options to executive 
directors and senior management. The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over 
a three year performance period. Prior to 18 April 201 1 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least 
equal to Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) plus 1 1% (at which point 25% of awards will vest), 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for 
full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum. RPI is the general index of the UK retail prices (for all items) published by 
the Ofﬁce of National Statistics or any similar index replacing it. Straight-line vesting will apply between these points. 
Awards granted on or after 18 April 201 1 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns (“ASR”) over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a 
combination of both. ASR is deﬁned as the average closing share price over the period of ﬁve days ending on the day prior to the vesting date less the reference 
price plus the total of all dividends and cash distributions and any other measures as determined by the Remuneration Committee between the award date and 
the vesting date. Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum 25% of awards will vest, with full vesting 
is achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum. Straight line vesting will apply between these points. Where the award is subject to ASR, 
the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more. 
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report on pages 70 to 91.

(2016: between 1.40% and 2.10%). The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on statistical daily 
share prices over the last three years.

The Remuneration Committee also awarded a number of Additional Share Grants (“ASG”s) to a number of senior managers and executives, critical to delivering 
the anticipated results of the acquisition of TAG which completed in November 2014. Grants could be made to no more than 15 people within 18 months of the 
Completion date. ASGs are nil cost options over Ordinary Shares. The number of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASGs will be a maximum of 2.5% of the Share 
Capital. The ASGs will become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition, on the third anniversary of the TAG acquisition or 
1 November 2017, whichever is earlier (the ‘vesting date’) and will remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the TAG acquisition. 
The performance condition is that the percentage of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASG which may be acquired on exercise on or after the vesting date is 
as follows:
(i) 0% if the Shareholder Return Percentage (as deﬁned below) is 50% or less;
(ii) 100% if the Shareholder Return Percentage is 100% or more; and
(iii) A percentage determined on a straight line basis between (i) and (ii) above.
The ‘Shareholder Return Percentage’ will be calculated by deducting 819.425 pence per share (the “Reference Price”), being the average of the 20 days before 
3 June 2014 (being the date of the heads of agreement relating to the proposed combination of Micro Focus and Attachmate between Micro Focus, Wizard, 
Golden Gate Capital and Francisco Partners Management LP), from the sum of the ‘Vesting Price’ (calculated as the average closing share price over the period 
of 20 days ending on the day prior to the vesting date) plus the total of all dividends per share between 20 November 2014 and the vesting date. This will be 
divided by the Reference Price, multiplying the resulting ﬁgure by 100 to obtain the Shareholder Return Percentage.
The amount charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of the scheme was $6.6m for the year ended 30 April 2017 
(2016: $7.6m). In addition to this $7.0m (2016: $2.8m) was charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of national insurance 
on these share options.

The weighted average fair value of options granted was £6.47, determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. The signiﬁcant inputs into the model were 
weighted average share price of £1 1.05 at the grant date, expected volatility of between 25.81% and 26.1 1%, expected dividend yield of between 2.90% and 
3.30%, an expected option life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate of between 1.71% and 2.08%. The volatility measured at the standard 
deviation of continuously compounded share returns is based on statistical daily share prices over the last three years. 
c) Sharesave and Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2006
In August 2006, the Company introduced the Micro Focus Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2006 and the Micro Focus Sharesave Plan 2006, approved by 
members on 25 July 2006. The Group operates several plans throughout the world but the two main plans are the Sharesave Plan (“Sharesave”) primarily for UK 
employees and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) for employees in the USA and Canada. The Sharesave and ESPP provide for an annual award of 
options at a discount to the market price and are open to all eligible Group employees. Under this plan employees make monthly savings over a period of three 
years linked to the grant of an option over Micro Focus shares with an option price which can be at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares on 
grant. The option grants are subject to employment conditions and continuous savings.
Further Sharesave and ESPP grants were made during the year to 30 April 2017.

Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these 
opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of ﬁnancial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 – whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
 – the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and 
 – the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ 
judgments against available evidence, forming our own judgments, and 
evaluating the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable basis 
for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the 
effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we consider whether 
those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements of Micro Focus 
International plc for the year ended 30 April 2017.

  In January 2012 a Return of Value was made to all shareholders amounting to $129.0m in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $0.6m. As a result of this a 
capital redemption reserve was created following the redemption of the B shares. In November 2012 a further return of value was made to all shareholders amounting to $128.8m 
in cash after including a foreign exchange contract gain of $2.4m. In September 2012, a further $47,079,000 was added to the capital redemption reserve following the 
redemption of the B shares. In November 2014, a further $59,380,000 was added to the capital redemption reserve following the redemption of B shares.
2
  On 20 November 2014 the TAG acquisition was completed. As a result of this a merger reserve was created of $1.4bn. The acquisition of TAG was structured by way of a share for 
share exchange, this transaction fell within the provisions of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 (merger relief) such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the 
shares issued. The Company chose to record its investment in TAG at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have 
been recorded had section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable (i.e. equal to the difference between the fair value of TAG and the aggregate nominal value of the 
shares issued). This merger reserve was initially considered unrealized on the basis it was represented by the investment in TAG, which is not considered to represent qualifying 
consideration (in accordance with Tech 02/17 BL (Guidance on the determination of realized proﬁts and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006)). 
Immediately following the acquisition of TAG, the Company’s investment in TAG was transferred to another Group Company in exchange for an intercompany loan. To the extent 
this loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realized.
3
  The merger reserve is an unrealized proﬁt until it can be realized by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration. $650.0m of the intercompany loan is 
expected to be settled in qualifying consideration during the year to 30 April 2018 (2016: $180.0m) and as such an equivalent proportion of the merger reserve is considered 
realized and therefore has been transferred to the proﬁt and loss account.
As at 30 April 2017 the value of distributable reserves was $660,164,000.

Company statement of cash ﬂows 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 I Statement of compliance
The Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in compliance with 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 
102, “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and 
Republic of Ireland” (“FRS 102”) and the Companies Act 2006. 
II Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The basis of preparation and the principal accounting policies adopted in the 
preparation of the Company ﬁnancial information are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to all years presented. The Company 
has adopted FRS 102 in these ﬁnancial statements. 
A Basis of preparation
The Company ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on a going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and all applicable UK accounting standards. 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with FRS 102 requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting 
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or 
areas where assumptions and estimates are signiﬁcant to the ﬁnancial 
statements are disclosed in note III. 
B Going concern
The directors, having made enquiries, consider that the Company has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and 
therefore it is appropriate to maintain the going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements.
C Exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102
FRS 102 allows a qualifying entity certain disclosure exemptions. The Company 
has not taken advantage of any available exemption for qualifying entities.
D Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of the Company is US dollars. Foreign currency 
transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation 
at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognized in the proﬁt and loss account.
E Employee beneﬁts
a) Short-term beneﬁts
Short-term beneﬁts, including holiday pay and other similar non-monetary 
beneﬁts, are recognized as an expense in the period in which the service 
is received. 
b) Deﬁned contribution pension plan
The Company operates a deﬁned contribution plan for which it pays 
contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on 
a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions 
are recognized as employee beneﬁt expense when they are due. Prepaid 
contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or 
a reduction in the future payments is available.
c) Share-based payments
The Company operated various equity-settled, share based compensation 
plans during the year.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of the shares or options is recognized as an expense. The total amount to be 
expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the shares or options granted. Non-market vesting conditions are included 
in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of 
the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognizes 
the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the proﬁt and loss 
account and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining 
vesting period.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the 
employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by 
reference to the grant date fair value, is recognized over the vesting period as 
an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding 
credit to equity in the parent entity ﬁnancial statements.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the 
share options is considered an integral part of the grant itself and the charge 
is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
The shares are recognized when the options are exercised and the proceeds 
received allocated between called up share capital and share premium account.
d) Employee beneﬁt trust
Transactions, assets and liabilities of the Company sponsored Employee 
Beneﬁt Trust are included in the Company Financial Statements as it is 
considered to be an intermediate payment arrangement. In particular, the 
Trust’s purchases of shares in the Company remain deducted from 
shareholders’ funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
F Taxation
Corporation tax is payable on taxable proﬁts at amounts expected to be paid, 
or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized to take account of timing differences between the 
treatment of transactions for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and their treatment 
for tax purposes. A deferred tax asset is only recognized when it is probable 
that there will be a suitable taxable proﬁt from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
G Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Costs incurred relating to acquisition of subsidiaries, yet to be completed, 
are included within prepayments. Upon Completion these costs are transferred 
to investments in subsidiaries.
H Financial instruments
The Company has chosen to adopt Sections 1 1 and 12 of FRS 102 in respect 
of ﬁnancial instruments.

statements and notes Additional information
17 1 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements 
for the year ended 30 April 2017 II Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
a) Financial assets
Basic ﬁnancial instruments, including cash at bank and in hand and amounts 
owed by Group undertakings, are initially recognized at transaction price, 
unless the arrangement constitutes a ﬁnancing transaction, where the 
transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts discounted 
at a market rate of interest. Such assets are subsequently carried at amortized 
cost using the effective interest rate method. 
At the end of each reporting period, ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized 
cost are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. If an asset is impaired, 
the impairment loss, which is the difference between the carrying amount and 
the present value of the estimated cash ﬂows discounted at the asset’s original 
effective interest rate, is recognized in proﬁt or loss. 
Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash 
ﬂows from the asset expire, are settled or substantially all the risks and rewards 
are transferred to another party.
b) Financial liabilities
Basic ﬁnancial liabilities, including amounts owed to Group undertakings, are 
initially recognized at transaction price, unless the arrangement constitutes a 
ﬁnancing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of 
the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Such liabilities are 
subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the liability is extinguished, that is 
when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
I Called up share capital, share premium and dividend 
distribution
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable 
to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of 
tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognized as a liability 
in the Company’s ﬁnancial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognized 
when declared.
J Related party transactions
The Company discloses transactions with related parties which are not wholly 
owned within the same group. It does not disclose transactions with members 
of the same group that are wholly owned. 
III Critical accounting judgments and estimation 
uncertainty
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
a) Critical judgments in applying the Company’s accounting policies
The Company makes an estimate of the recoverable value of investments in 
subsidiaries. When assessing impairment of investments management 
consider both internal and external indicators. There have been no other critical 
judgments made in applying the Company’s accounting policies. 
b) Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group has made its 
best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the ﬁnancial 
statements, giving due consideration to materiality. The Group regularly reviews 
these estimates and updates them as required. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Unless otherwise indicated, the Group does not believe that 
it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported related to the 
accounting estimates and assumptions described below. The Group considers 
the following to be a description of the most signiﬁcant estimates, which 
require the Group to make subjective and complex judgments, and matters 
that are inherently uncertain.
A Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant 
judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. 
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax 
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group 
recognizes liabilities for anticipated settlement of tax issues based on estimates 
of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these 
matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such 
differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the 
period in which such determination is made.
The Group carries appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax 
computations are agreed with the taxation authorities.
B Acquisitions
When making acquisitions, the Group has to make judgments and best 
estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price. Where 
acquisitions are signiﬁcant, appropriate advice is sought from professional 
advisors before making such allocations otherwise valuations are done by 
management using consistent methodology used on prior year acquisitions 
where appropriate professional advice was sought. The valuation of goodwill 
and other intangibles is tested annually or whenever there are changes in 
circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
These tests require the use of estimates. Note 9 gives details of the Group’s 
impairment reviews.
C Development expenditure
The Group invests in the development of future products in accordance with 
the accounting policy I(c). The assessment as to whether this expenditure will 
achieve a complete product for which the technical feasibility is assured is a 
matter of judgment, as is the forecasting of how the product will generate 
future economic beneﬁt. Finally, the period of time over which the economic 
beneﬁt associated with the expenditure occurred will arise is also a matter of 
judgment. These judgments are made by evaluating the development plan 
prepared by the research and development department and approved by 
management, regularly monitoring progress by using an established set of 
criteria for assessing technical feasibility and benchmarking to other products.
D Revenue recognition
The key areas of judgment in respect of recognizing revenue are the timing of 
recognition and the fair value allocation between Licence and Maintenance 
revenue, speciﬁcally in relation to recognition and deferral of revenue on support 
contracts where management assumptions and estimates are necessary.
E Provisions
The Group has made key judgments relating to provisions. Provisions include 
onerous leases and dilapidations, restructuring and integration, legal and other. 
Key judgments included determining the time to sublet vacant properties, 
restructuring and integration liabilities and the potential outcome of legal cases.

173 Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 VII Share-based payments
The Company has various equity-settled share-based compensation plans, details of which are provided in note 33 of the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on pages 152 to 156. The only employees of the Company are the directors and the interests of the executive directors in share options are as below.
a) Incentive Plan 2005
On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 (“LTIP”) which permits the granting of share options to executive 
directors and senior management. The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over 
a three year performance period. 
Awards granted on or after 18 April 201 1 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns (“ASR”) over a three year period, cumulative EPS growth or a 
combination of both. ASR is deﬁned as the average closing share price over the period of ﬁve days ending on the day prior to the vesting date less the reference 
price plus the total of all dividends and cash distributions and any other measures as determined by the Remuneration Committee between the award date and 
the vesting date. Where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to Retail Prices Index (“RPI”) plus 3% per annum 25% of awards 
will vest, with full vesting achieved when the cumulative EPS growth is RPI plus 9% per annum. Straight line vesting will apply between these points. RPI is the 
general index of the UK retail prices index (for all items) published by the Ofﬁce of National Statistics or any similar index replacing it. Where the award is subject 
to ASR, the resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more. 
Further details are provided in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 70 to 91.

b) Additional Share Grants
The Remuneration Committee also awarded a number of Additional Share Grants (“ASGs”) to a number of senior managers and executives, critical to delivering 
the anticipated results of the acquisition of TAG which completed in November 2014. Grants could be made to no more than 15 people within 18 months of the 
Completion date. ASGs are nil cost options over Ordinary Shares. The number of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASGs will be a maximum of 2.5% of the 
Enlarged Share Capital. The ASGs will become exercisable, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition, on the third anniversary of the date of 
Completion or 1 November 2017, whichever is earlier (the ‘vesting date’) and will remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of Completion. 
The performance condition is that the percentage of Ordinary Shares subject to the ASG which may be acquired on exercise on or after the vesting date 
is as follows:
(i) 0% if the Shareholder Return Percentage (as deﬁned below) is 50% or less;
(ii) 100% if the Shareholder Return Percentage is 100% or more; and
(iii) A percentage determined on a straight line basis between (i) and (ii) above.
The ‘Shareholder Return Percentage’ will be calculated by deducting 819.425 pence per share (the “Reference Price”), being the average of the 20 days before 
3 June 2014 (being the date of the heads of agreement relating to the proposed combination of Micro Focus and Attachmate between Micro Focus, Wizard, 
Golden Gate Capital and Francisco Partners Management LP), from the sum of the ‘Vesting Price’ (calculated as the average closing share price over the period 
of 20 days ending on the day prior to the vesting date) plus the total of all dividends per share between Completion and the vesting date. This will be divided by 
the Reference Price, multiplying the resulting ﬁgure by 100 to obtain the Shareholder Return Percentage.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation model was £nil. The signiﬁcant inputs into the 
model were weighted average share price of £1 1.24 at the grant date, exercise price shown above, expected volatility of 26.1 1%, expected dividend yield of 3.2%, 
an expected option life of three years and an annual risk-free interest rate of 2.08%. The volatility measured at the standard deviation of continuously 
compounded share returns is based on statistical daily share prices over the last three years. 
c) Sharesave Plan
In August 2006, the Company introduced the Micro Focus Sharesave Plan 2006, approved by members on 25 July 2006. The Sharesave Plan (“Sharesave”) is 
primarily for UK employees. The Sharesave provides for an annual award of options at a discount to the market price and are open to all eligible Group employees. 
Under this plan employees make monthly savings over a period of three years linked to the grant of an option over Micro Focus shares with an option price which 
can be at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares on grant. The option grants are subject to employment conditions and continuous savings.

Company information  Forward-looking statements
Certain statements contained in this Annual Report, including those under 
the captions entitled Executive Chairman’s statement, Financial review, 
CEO Review – Micro Focus Product Portfolio, CEO Review – SUSE Product 
Portfolio, Directors’ report, Corporate governance report and Remuneration 
report constitute ‘forward-looking statements’, including, without limitation, 
those regarding the Company’s ﬁnancial condition, business strategy, plans 
and objectives. These forward-looking statements can be identiﬁed by the 
use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms ‘believes’, ‘estimates’, 
‘anticipates’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’, ‘may’, ‘will’ or ‘should’ or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology. Such forward-looking 
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, 
which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the 
Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, 
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking 
statements. Such forward looking-statements are based on numerous 
assumptions regarding the Company’s present and future business strategies 
and the environment in which the Company will operate in the future. Such 
risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the level of 
expenditure committed to development and deployment applications by 
organizations; the level of deployment-related revenue expected by the 
Company; the degree to which organizations adopt web-enabled services; 
the rate at which large organizations mitigate applications from the mainframe 
environment; the continued use and necessity of the mainframe for business 
critical applications; the degree of competition faced by Micro Focus; growth in 
the information technology services market; general economic and business 
conditions, particularly in the United States; changes in technology and 
competition; and the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel. 
These forward-looking statements are made by the directors in good faith 
based on the information available to them at the time of their approval of this 
Annual Report. Except as required by the Financial Conduct Authority, or by law, 
the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly 
any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, 
future events or otherwise.
