Hansteen Holdings PLC is a leading owner and asset 
manager of a very diverse portfolio of European 
industrial property, mainly located in Germany, the UK 
and the Netherlands. 
We look for investments that are priced attractively 
and which will create a sustainable and high-yielding 
industrial property portfolio.
There are few equivalent platforms to Hansteen’s in the 
high-yielding property sector. The combination of a large 
high-yielding portfolio with opportunities to add value 
and an improving investment market means that the 
Group looks forward to the future with con dence.

Operational  Highlights Chairman’s Review
RESULTS
Normalised Total Pro t for the year to 31 
December 2014 increased by 41 .0% to £65.3 
million (2013: £46.3 million). Normalised 
Income Pro t, which excludes pro ts or losses 
from the sale of properties (essentially the 
repeatable earnings of the business), increased 
by 22.3% to £48.2 million (2013: £39.4 million). 
Normalised Income Pro t per share increased 
by 14.5% to 7 .1p (2012: 6.2p). Had it not been 
for the fall in the value of the Euro compared 
with 31 December 2013, Normalised Total Pro t 
for 2014 would have been £1 .9 million higher. 
Basic earnings per share were 17 .6p (2013: 
9.1p) and diluted EPRA earnings per share were 
5.2p (2013: 5.0p). Pro t before tax increased by 
100.9% to £131 .2 million (2013: £65.3 million). 
The Group’s EPRA Net Asset Value was 102p 
per share (2013: 91p), an increase of 12.1% 
despite the adverse currency movement. 
DIVIDEND
Hansteen has paid a covered dividend every 
year since the  rst dividend distribution in 
2006 and during that period, it has increased 
by 66.7%. Our dividend policy is designed 
to re#ect the high income generated by the 
business and we remain committed to a 
prudently progressive dividend policy. The 
Board already increased the interim dividend 
paid on 20 November 2014 by 5.3% to 2.0p per 
share (November 2013: 1 .9p per share) and will 
pay the second ongoing dividend, increased 
by 3.4% to 3.0p per share (May 2013: 2.9p) 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 5.0p, 
a 4.2% increase on 2013. 
 
In 2014, Hansteen took advantage of a strong 
investment market to sell £315.3 million 
of property from the owned or co-owned 
portfolio, crystallising pro ts of £26.1 million 
over the 31 December 2013 valuation and £47 .7 
million over gross acquisition cost. The Board 
£65.3m
Normalised Total 
Proﬁt increased by 
41.0%
I am pleased to present the results for  
the year ended 31 December 2014  
and the Company’ s Strategic Report.
Hansteen’s aim is to provide investors with consistent, high and 
realised returns from predominantly industrial property. 2014 has been 
a year in which all elements of our business model have excelled and 
I am delighted to report record results in terms of pro ts and value 
growth, re#ected in an increased interim dividend together with a 
special dividend. 
6
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Chairman’s Review proposes to re#ect this success in the payment 
of a special dividend of 3.0p per share, which 
will be paid in addition to the ‘ongoing’ interim 
dividend also of 3.0p per share.
The total dividend of 6.0p will be payable on 21 
May 2015 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 24 April 2015. A Property 
Income Distribution of 1 .4p is included in this 
second interim dividend payment.
OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
Hansteen is a leading owner and asset 
manager of a very diverse portfolio of European 
industrial property, mainly located in Germany, 
the UK and the Netherlands. We look for 
investments that are priced attractively and 
which will create a sustainable and high-yielding 
industrial property portfolio. We also assess 
other more opportunistic and management 
intensive acquisitions which, although lower 
yielding, will provide greater potential for capital 
growth. Our strategy is achieved through a 
detailed assessment of opportunities in the 
UK and Continental Europe. In many cases 
our purchases are ‘off market’ and can involve 
patiently assembling or reconciling stakeholder 
interests in a deal. Our acquisition of the HBI 
portfolio in the Netherlands is a good example 
of this. 
After purchase, our strategy is to maximise the 
rental income and occupancy of our properties 
through active asset management initiatives 
leading to increased values. We aim to realise 
and distribute these pro ts to our shareholders 
over the course of a property cycle either by 
sales of individual lots or by larger portfolio 
disposals. 
Our people are at the centre of our success. We 
have 15 of ces with experienced management 
teams across the UK and our regions in 
Continental Europe. We work hard at creating 
the right relationships with our stakeholders so 
that we are in the prime position to act when 
opportunities arise.
BOARD CHANGES
Stephen Gee retired as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company at the Annual General 
Meeting in 2014 and Richard Mully will retire as 
a Non-Executive Director of the Company at the 
Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2015.
As part of the process of succession planning 
for Non-Executive Directors, Melvyn Egglenton 
and Rebecca Worthington were welcomed 
to the Board on 10 June 2014. Melvyn and 
Rebecca were also appointed as members 
of both the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee, effective from the 
same date.
Richard Mully will retire from the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting in June 2015. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank Richard 
Mully for his substantial contribution and 
commitment to Hansteen’s growth and success 
over the past nine years. His knowledge and 
experience of continental property markets has 
been exceptionally valuable to the Board.
FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
The LTIP is based on the growth of EPRA NAV 
plus dividends, which was put in place for the 
Joint Chief Executives at the time of the initial 
#oatation in 2005 and which has not paid out 
to date. However, if the current performance 
continues until the end of 2015, the joint Chief 
Executives will receive a signi cant reward. 
Details are set out below in the  nance report. 
The potential award can only be estimated at 
this stage and is dependent on the performance 
over this three year period.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Chairman’s Review OUTLOOK
Further improvements in both the occupational 
and investor markets across all three of our 
core regions have enabled the business to 
produce another year of record results. We 
have sold a signi cant amount of property into 
a very buoyant UK investment market releasing 
capital and allowing Hansteen to make some 
noteworthy acquisitions. These acquisitions, 
having a high initial yield and a material vacant 
element,  t our business model perfectly.
Hansteen has a very diverse, high yielding 
portfolio of light industrial property located 
across Germany, the UK and Benelux. The 
income from the Group’s portfolio has proved 
robust throughout the recession years and 
should continue to be so in the future. Our 
asset management teams have proved adept at 
improving occupancy and the rent roll and also 
at realising opportunities. Business con dence 
and the underlying economy are improving in 
each of our regions providing an improving back-
drop to our business. However, these levers 
for growth have now been supported and in 
some areas outstripped by the extraordinarily 
low interest rate environment within which we 
are operating and, more recently the weight of 
capital buying property for yield.
Our optimism for the future must however be 
tempered by the current uncertainties in the 
euro zone and the potential for the volatility of 
the Euro.
At the time of our last half year results we 
highlighted that the then current interest rate 
environment was extraordinarily low. Since 
then rates have approximately halved and 
there is a general acknowledgement that these 
rates are likely to stay low for longer than 
was hitherto expected. Such a background 
to the operation of a high yielding property 
business is outside the experience of most 
people working today but the likelihood must 
be that it will provide scope for continued 
yield compression and further liquidity in the 
property sector.
Improvements in both the occupational and investor 
markets across all three of our core regions have 
enabled the business to produce another year of 
record results

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Chairman’s Review Joint Chief Executives’ Review  
and Finance Report
The Group has completed £583.0 million of 
sales and purchases during 2014. The increase 
in investor appetite for multi-let light industrial 
property, particularly in the UK, has enabled 
us to sell pro tably £315.3 million of property. 
Despite increased competition, we have still 
managed to acquire £267 .7 million of property 
on terms that we believe offer excellent value 
and future growth potential. 
At the property level, our portfolio that is 
owned or co-owned, comprises 4.2 million 
sq m or 45.4 million sq ft at a passing yield of 
8.5%, occupancy of 86.0%, and over 6,000 
tenants, none of whom account for more than 
1 .2% of the entire rent roll. All three regions 
(UK, Germany and Benelux) made signi cant 
contributions to the  nancial success in 2014.
Our management platform now comprises 
15 of ces spread across Europe which is 
an enormous asset to the business and an 
acknowledged market leader at managing this 
type of property. Implementing the strategy

IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY
Hansteen has a buy, work and sell business 
model. We endeavour to buy assets when 
they are at a relatively low point both in relation 
to the property cycle and at the asset level. 
In particular, we like to buy properties with a 
vacant element. We then apply our particular 
brand of intensive management to increase the 
occupancy, increase the rent and reduce the 
irrecoverable costs. Ideally, we then crystallise 
the value added at a relatively strong point in 
the cycle.
In the years 2008 to 2013 the markets were 
both depressed and distressed. During that 
period we acquired £1 .6 billion of property 
and sold £649.0 million from the owned or 
co-owned portfolio. The acquisition prices 
paid were low and in virtually all cases the 
acquisitions were directly or indirectly from 
banks that had taken control following a 
borrower defaulting on a loan.
In 2014, with the market gathering momentum, 
the  gures were £315.3 million sold and 
£267 .7 million purchased. Given a market with 
improving liquidity all aspects of our strategy 
were positive.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (“KPI’S”)
FINANCIAL KPI’S
We believe that returns are best measured 
by looking at normalised pro ts and valuation 
growth. 
Normalised Total Pro t for the year to 31 
December 2014 increased by 41 .0% to £65.3 
million (2013: £46.3 million). Normalised Income 
Pro t, which excludes pro ts or losses from the 
sale of properties (i.e. essentially the repeatable 
earnings of the business), increased by 22.3% 
to £48.2 million (2013: £39.4 million).  
This is the ninth consecutive year in which 
Hansteen’s Normalised Income Pro t has 
increased. Normalised Income Pro t per share 
increased by 14.5% to 7 .1p (2013: 6.2p). 
The table below sets out the results for 
Normalised Income Pro t and Normalised Total 
Pro t including our share of associates.
10
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report In addition to pro ts in 2014 all regions produced positive valuation 
growth. The total uplift of £135.8 million was the highest in any 
year for Hansteen. As a result the Group’s EPRA Net Asset Value 
at 31 December 2014 was 102p per share (2013: 91p), an increase 
of 12.1%. This combined with dividends paid in the year of 5.4% 
equates to a return in excess of 17.0%. Excluding adverse currency 
movement and the LTIP provision, the underlying performance 
increased by more than 20.0%.
PROPERTY PORTFOLIO
In total, the portfolio that is owned or co-owned 
by Hansteen is valued at £1 .6 billion, has a rent 
roll of £137 .7 million per annum and 14.0% 
vacancy. If the portfolio was fully occupied at 
our view of market rents, the rent roll would be 
£171 .4 million per annum, re#ecting a yield of 
10.6%. 
Hansteen’s attributable property investments, 
at 31 December 2014, was valued at £1 .2 billion 
(2013: £1 .1 billion). Had the currency remained 
unchanged throughout the year, the portfolio 
would have been worth an additional £59.1 
million. At 31 December 2014, this attributable 
portfolio comprised 3.2 million sq m, an increase 
from 2.8 million sq m at the start of the year 
mainly due to the acquisitions in Germany and 
the Netherlands. The portfolio has a yield of 
8.6% (2013: 8.7%). The analysis of the portfolio

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report PROPERTY VALUATION
The value of the total portfolio under 
management has increased by £135.8 million  
or 9.2% from December 2013. The wholly 
owned portfolio increased by £62.9 million with 
the three UK funds increasing by £73.0 million. 
Hansteen’s share of these fund increases was 
£25.1 million giving an attributable valuation 
increase to Hansteen of £88.0 million from 
31 December 2013. 
The value of the German portfolio increased by 
€44.0 million or 6.0%. The UK wholly owned 
portfolio increased by £8.6 million or 7 .6% and 
the Benelux portfolio valuation increased by 
€23.7 million or 8.2%. The Netherlands portfolio 
purchased in June 2014 accounted for all of the 
increase in the Benelux.
HPUT II values have increased by £18.7 million 
or 11 .4% and AIF values increased by £49.1 
million or 13.1%. The value of Saltley Business 
Park in Birmingham, which is now owned in a 
50/50 joint venture with Brockton Capital LLP , 
has also increased by £5.2 million or 16.8%. 
ASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM
The platform has grown further during 2014, 
mostly in the Netherlands following the portfolio 
acquisition in June 2014. We opened a new 
of ce in Utrecht bringing the total number 
of of ces to 15. During 2014, the team have 
secured 1,776 new leases and lease renewals 
across the total portfolio generating £39.2 
million of new or renewed annualised rental 
income. This is more than twice the number 
handled in 2013 (850 new leases and renewals) 
and highlights how well the regional asset 
management teams have performed this year. 
Our asset managers are focussed primarily on 
direct tenant relationships and the marketing 
of vacant units either for sale or to rent. They 
are also heavily involved in the management 
of the properties in their region, although the 
day-to-day management of our properties is 
undertaken by local property managers who 
are contracted on a third-party basis. With a 
substantial platform in place across all our 
regions, we are ideally positioned to absorb 
additional properties without a corresponding 
proportionate increase in costs. As we continue 
to take the marketing of our properties in-
house, the fees paid to third party marketing 
agents relative to rent generated from new 
lettings and lease renewals has decreased 
further during 2014. Letting fees paid were £0.8 
million on new lettings and renewals of £39.2 
million compared to letting fees of £1 .0 million 
on new lettings and renewals of £24.6 million 
in 2013.
OCCUPANCY AND PASSING RENT
Like-for-like net occupancy (measured by taking 
the vacant area at the start of the year, adding 
vacancy on purchases and then comparing 
with the vacancy at the end of the year) has 
improved by 195,000 sq m across the portfolio 
under management. This represents 4.6% 
of the total portfolio under management at 
31 December 2014 or 29.2% of the vacant 
area at the start of the year. This excellent 
achievement has come through a combination 
of letting vacant space and selling vacant units, 
both important components of the Hansteen 
business model. For the third year in a row, all 
three of our core regions have contributed to 
this increase in occupancy.
The passing rent of the portfolio under 
management at the start of the year was 
£134.9 million per annum. The net effect of 
sales and acquisitions was a rent increase of 
£5.2 million per annum, the reduction due to 
exchange rate movements was £4.1 million per 
annum and the closing rent was £137 .7 million 
per annum. This resulted in a net like-for-like 
improvement of £1 .7 million or 1 .2%.

50.3% of Hansteen’s attributable property 
investments, has again performed well with 
like-for-like income, occupancy and value, all 
improving during 2014. The passing rent in 2013 
was €62.1 million per annum and the net effect 
of sales and acquisitions was a rent increase of 
€3.6 million per annum. The closing rent at 31 
December 2014 was €67 .2 million per annum,

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report a net improvement of €1 .6 million per annum 
or a 2.4% improvement in the like-for-like rent 
roll. The like-for-like occupancy improvement 
totalled 26,000 sq m. At the end of the year the 
portfolio had 185,000 sq m vacant, representing 
11 .5% of the total #oor area (2013 vacancy: 
12.3%).
In 2014 we also completed the re nancing of 
both the HBOS and UniCredit debt facilities 
which were due to expire in October 2014 
and February 2015 respectively. A  ve-year, 
€235 million facility has been provided by a 
consortium of lenders led by Landesbank 
Hessen-Thüringen Girozentrale (Helaba). We 
have hedged 80% of the interest on the loan, 
resulting in an interest cost of 3.5% per annum 
at the time of re nancing, excluding fees. HSBC 
provided a  ve-year, €108 million facility which, 
with a €55 million interest rate hedge, gave an 
interest cost of 2.9% per annum at the time 
of re nancing, excluding fees. The combined 
terms equated to an all-in average rate of 3.8% 
per annum, including fees. We were delighted 
to secure these well priced facilities with new 
lenders and Hansteen has already built on the 
relationship with HSBC who also provided the 
bank debt for the acquisitions concluded at the 
end of the year.
Seven properties in Germany were sold for 
€23.2 million generating €3.0 million of pro t 
above the December 2013 valuation and €4.9 
million above gross acquisition costs. The 
biggest of these was our Delta Forum estate 
in Ginsheim-Gustavsburg which was sold to 
a fund managed by CBRE Global Investors 
for €16.0 million. With the estate almost fully 
occupied, it was identi ed as ripe for sale and 
because the light industrial property sector had 
not been previously recognised by institutions, 
the sale was a signi cant step forward for both 
Hansteen and the whole sector.
A portfolio of nine properties (the “Pisces 
portfolio”) was purchased in December 2014 for 
€56.6 million, adding 140,000 sq m of space to 
the portfolio. There is currently 19.0% of good 
quality, lettable vacant space which presents a 
signi cant opportunity to increase income and 
capital values. The rent roll stands at €5.3 million 
per annum and when fully let, the portfolio 
is expected to produce rent of €6.7 million 
per annum. In addition, Hansteen has also 
exchanged a conditional contract to purchase 
a further estate for €1 .5 million with the 
transaction expected to complete by the end 
of the  rst quarter 2015. The acquisitions were 
funded from existing cash resources along with 
a new €40.0 million,  ve-year loan facility which 
has been agreed with HSBC. The assets are all 
located in regions which we know well and will 
be managed by our existing regional teams.
Netherlands, Belgium  
and France
At 31 December 2014, Benelux accounted for 
approximately 20.1% of Hansteen’s attributable 
property investments, increased from 14.2% at 
31 December 2013 due to the acquisition of the 
new portfolio announced in June 2014, referred 
to in more detail below. 2014 has been a very 
successful year with signi cant increases in 
like-for-like rent and occupancy. The passing rent 
in 2013 was €13.8 million per annum and the 
net effect of sales and acquisitions was a rent 
increase of €14.6 million per annum. The closing 
rent at 31 December 2014 was €29.4 million 
per annum, a net like-for-like improvement of 
€1 .0 million or 3.4%. The like-for-like occupancy 
improvement was 46,000 sq m or 43.4% of the 
vacancy at the start of the year. The portfolio 
ended the year with 143,000 sq m vacant or 
18.1% of the total #oor area.
In June 2014 a large portfolio of 41 estates 
in the core Randstad area of the Netherlands 
was acquired for €106 million. This followed a 
complex set of transactions where Hansteen 
had previously purchased 50% of a loan 
secured against the portfolio from Unicredit 
Bank AG. Following the acquisition of the 
Unicredit loan, Hansteen agreed to acquire the 
remaining 50% of the loan from ING, subject 
to a new €60 million  ve year loan from ING. 
Hansteen also agreed to break the swaps on 
the loan at a discount to their market value and 
subsequently agreed a consensual deal with 
the borrower, Lancelot Land BV , to acquire the 
underlying property assets.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report Hansteen has made a net investment of £40 
million of equity in the transaction which has 
contributed almost £27 .0 million to the IFRS 
pre-tax pro t. £4.0 million of  nance income 
relates to the unwinding of the discount on 
the loan that was secured on the portfolio 
and £3.2 million of operating income arose 
when the loan was satis ed in exchange for 
the properties on which it was secured. The 
valuation uplift subsequent to the acquisition 
of the entire portfolio was £19.5 million. During 
the six months of Hansteen ownership, the 
Dutch asset management team has already 
produced some impressive results reducing 
the vacancy from 22.7% to 18.5%.
 
A multi-let of ce property at Louvain La 
Neuve in Belgium where we had achieved 
full occupancy was sold for €6.1 million, 
generating a pro t of €0.6 million. Over the last 
18 months, the asset management team in the 
Benelux re-geared several leases and let almost 
all of the vacant space, to a range of local and 
national occupiers. With the property almost 
fully let, it was sold to a local investor, following 
a brief marketing exercise.
The French portfolio comprises two properties 
totalling 56,000 sq m with an annual rent roll of 
€1 .7 million.
UK
The size of the owned or co-owned UK 
portfolio changed signi cantly during 2014 
with a considerable number of disposals as 
well as further investment in HPUT II and the 
acquisition of additional units in AIF . The total UK 
portfolio as at the year-end comprised 1 .8 million 
sq m with a rent roll of £62.4 million per annum, 
a vacancy of 14.5% and a value of £765.5 
million. Hansteen’s proportion of that portfolio 
was £356.3 million, approximately 29.6% of 
Hansteen’s attributable property investments.
UK WHOLLY OWNED 
At 31 December 2014, the wholly owned 
UK portfolio had a rent roll of £8.9 million 
per annum and a value of £121 .2 million, 
representing a yield of 7 .4% with a vacancy 
rate of 18.3%. Included within this value are 
three development sites totalling 70.8 hectares 
valued at £6.7 million. Like-for-like occupancy 
increased by 3,600 sq m or 7 .4% of the opening 
vacancy and like-for-like rent (once rent free 
concessions expire) increased by £0.3 million.
AIF
AIF has had a particularly active and successful 
year as the UK team has implemented various 
asset management strategies across the 
country to improve the rent roll and occupancy

Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report as well as to sell assets into the buoyant UK 
market. The results are impressive with an 
improvement in like-for-like rent of £0.3 million 
and an increase in like-for-like occupancy 
of 75,000 sq m. At 31 December 2014, the 
portfolio was valued at £425.5 million, had a 
rent roll of £36.9 million per annum, a yield on 
the passing rent of 8.7%, and had a vacancy 
rate of 14.4%.
During the year we acquired a further 9.2% 
stake in AIF for £26.0 million increasing our 
share in the fund to 36.7%. The additional stake 
was purchased from three vendors at a price 
of 46.5p per unit, the March 2014 property 
valuation. Since then, the value of the AIF 
properties has increased by 9.9%. A further 
4.1% holding was purchased in February 2015 
for £11 .0 million bringing our total holding to 
40.8%. 
HPUT
The biggest single portfolio sale was completed 
in October when HPUT was sold, in two 
transactions, for a total of £146.1 million (after 
the deduction of rental top-ups). 41 assets 
were sold to a fund advised by Brockton Capital 
LLP in a partnership with Dunedin Property for 
£110.5 million. A separate 50/50 joint venture 
between Brockton Capital and Hansteen 
acquired Saltley Business Park in Birmingham 
for a net price of £35.6 million, an asset which 
Hansteen will continue to manage. The 42 
assets were sold at above the September 
2014 valuation and generated pro ts of £22.4 
million over gross acquisition cost. The total 
return of the fund was 55% (an IRR of 9.7%) 
and Hansteen has enjoyed the high income 
distributions together with asset management 
fees. HPUT played a key part in the return of 
Hansteen to the UK market and its success led 
to the establishment of a second fund, HPUT II 
and our re-capitalisation of AIF .
HPUT II
The Fund has acquired 35 properties in ten 
separate transactions during the year, and 
disposed of 15 properties, nearly all as part 
of larger UK portfolio sales. At 31 December 
2014, the portfolio consisted of 76 assets 
totalling 336,000 sq m with a value of £182.5 
million, a vacancy of 15.6%, a passing rent roll 
of £14.1 million per annum and a yield on the 
passing rent of 7 .7%. Like-for-like occupancy has 
increased by 6,800 sq m with the like-for-like 
rent roll remaining broadly #at.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report During the year, the Company raised £46.3 
million, net of expenses, through the issue of 
44.8 million new shares and 300,000 share 
options were exercised. As at 31 December 
2014, there were 685.0 million shares in issue 
(2013: 641 .1 million) with a further 1 .5 million 
shares under option at exercise prices below 
the market price at that time and 22.6 million 
potential shares in relation to the LTIP giving 
709.1 million shares for dilutive measures (2013: 
651 .3 million). As at 31 December 2014 IFRS 
Diluted NAV per share was 95p (2013: 85p) and 
EPRA NAV per share was 102p (2013: 91p).
FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP)
Our policy of buying value during the downturn 
and working the assets has generated capital 
and income returns well in excess of 10% per 
annum since the current LTIP measurement 
period began in January 2013. If continued, this 
performance will potentially trigger the Founder 
LTIP arrangements. The potential LTIP award 
can still only be estimated at this stage as the 
out-turn depends entirely on the performance of 
the business over the three year period ending 
31 December 2015. To the extent that growth 
in EPRA NAV plus dividends exceeds 10% 
per annum compound over three years, the 
Joint Chief Executives will each receive shares 
equating to 12.5% of the out-performance. 
In the  rst two years of the LTIP measurement 
period, EPRA NAV growth plus dividends 
amounted to a gain of 31 .7p per share. This 
represents a 38% total return. The EPRA NAV 
per share  gure requires the inclusion of a 
number of shares to re#ect a possible LTIP 
award on the basis of what the award would 
be if the measurement period were taken for 
only the two years to 31 December 2014 (22.6 
million shares). The impact of these shares is 
to reduce EPRA NAV per share from 105p to 
102p. The IFRS pre-tax pro t includes a charge 
of £13.6 million related to a potential LTIP 
award and associated National Insurance (NI) 
contributions. Only the effect of the associated 
NI contributions on the LTIP awards affects the 
NAV because, in accordance with IFRS, the 
charge for the potential LTIP award excluding 
the NI contributions is credited back through 
equity.
CONVERTIBLE LOAN STOCK
In July 2013 Hansteen issued a €100 million 
convertible bond. The money raised was 
instrumental in enabling our purchase of 
Ashtenne and the debt re nancing in Germany. 
None of the conditions that would allow a 
bondholder to convert were met during the 
year; therefore the dilutive impact of the bonds 
is excluded from EPRA NAV . The bonds are 
convertible from July 2016. However, there are 
conditions under which the bonds are capable 
of conversion in 2015 which current trends 
would support. The principal terms of the 
bonds are detailed in the notes to the  nancial 
statements.
GEARING
Net debt was £416.3 million at 31 December 
2014 (2013: £432.2 million). Debt includes a 
mark-to-market adjustment of £18.4 million  
(2013: £16.2 million) for the convertible bond. 
Excluding the mark-to-market adjustment of 
the convertible bond, net debt to property 
value at 31 December 2014 was 41 .1% (2013: 
49.3%) and net debt to shareholders equity at 
31 December 2014 was 58.8% (2013: 75.0%) 
re#ecting our continued policy of maintaining 
gearing at a prudent level.
As at 31 December 2014 the Group had 
borrowings of £526.5 million (2013: £492.9 
million) of which £239.6 million was swapped 
at an average rate of 0.9% and £96.0 million 
was capped at an average rate of 2.1%. The 
average all-in borrowing rate for the Group at 31 
December 2014 was 3.8% (2013: 3.7%).
The aggregate net assets of the Group’s 
associates at 31 December 2014 were 
£431 .7million (2013: £420.3 million). The 
aggregate bank loans of the associates were 
£234.5 million (2013: £346.0 million) which are 
non-recourse to the Group. The committed 
undrawn facilities available to the Associates 
amount to £7 .8 million (2013: £8.9 million). The 
funds drawn under the facilities bear an average 
all-in interest rate of 3.9%.

Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report FUNDING
In February 2014, Hansteen completed the 
re nancing of two facilities in Germany. Both 
the UniCredit and HBOS facilities were fully 
repaid and two new  ve-year facilities were 
secured with Helaba (€235.0 million) and HSBC 
(€108.0 million). Both banks were new to 
Hansteen. 
The acquisition of the Pisces portfolio in 
Germany in December 2014 utilised another 
facility with HSBC for €40.0 million, of which 
€34.2 million was drawn, expiring in December 
2019. 
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had total 
bank facilities of £438.3 million (2013: £391 .8 
million), of which £433.8m were drawn (2013: 
£391 .8 million). Borrowings are in the same 
currency as the assets against which they are 
secured. Cash resources at the year-end were 
£110.3 million (2013: £57 .8 million).
As a result of securing the new facilities 
detailed above, the weighted average debt 
maturity at 31 December 2014 had increased to 
3.8 years and the weighted average maturity of 
hedging was 3.1 years.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report CURRENCY
Hansteen reports its results in Sterling. As at 
31 December 2014, approximately 52% (£349 
million or €448 million) of the Group’s net assets 
were denominated in Euros. A natural currency 
hedge arises from the Group maintaining 
borrowings denominated in the same currency 
as the assets that they secure. To minimise any 
adverse changes in the Sterling: Euro exchange 
rate, and a resultant decrease in NAV , Hansteen 
has entered various foreign currency contracts. 
During the year, Hansteen replaced its two 
€100 million currency options, with two new 
€100 million options, expiring in June 2016, 
at a rate of €1 .3/£1 . In addition, the Group has 
hedged €83.5 million of its expected future 
net Euro income with four options expiring at 
six monthly intervals between 30 June 2015 
and 31 December 2016. These options are to 
put €83.5 million and call for GBP at varying 
rates from €1 .3/£1 to €1 .45/£1 with an overall 
weighted average of €1 .366/£1 . The aggregate 
of all of these currency options amounts to 
€283.5 million providing hedges against 63% 
of the Group’s €448 million Euro net assets at 
31 December 2014. The options expiring on 30 
June 2016 and 31 December 2016 were entered 
into during the year. The aggregate premiums 
for the options entered into during the year 
were £3.7 million.
After taking into account the various currency 
hedges, even in a particularly stressed position 
of the Euro collapsing by 16.8% to €1 .50:£1 
from the year end rate, the Group would only 
lose approximately £24.0 million or 3.6%  
of its net asset value.
The Group’s hedging policy, which is regularly  
reviewed by the Board, is as follows:
• Hedging instruments are used to cover a 
substantial proportion of Group Euro net 
assets and estimated net Euro income for 
the short-term.
• Hedges are implemented at levels which 
the Board believe are cost effective.
• Hedging is employed as an insurance policy 
against the impact of a signi cant fall in the 
value of the Euro against Sterling rather 
than a means to speculate for pro t.
MARKETS
Although the investment market in our sector 
in the UK has improved signi cantly in a short 
time, it feels as if this momentum will continue 
for a while due both to the proliferation of 
well priced capital (both debt and equity) and 
to the gradual but real improvement in the 
occupational market and resulting rental growth.
We believe the investment market in our sector 
in Germany is also improving and, as with 
the UK, we may be surprised by how far and 
fast values improve.  Over the last year our 
experience has been of a con dent, successful 
economy bene tting from low interest rates and 
an arti cially low currency. In our world that has 
translated into a strong occupational market, 
a competitive job market, rising construction 
costs and rising house prices, providing  
a positive back drop to our activities. 
The Benelux market is lagging behind Germany 
and the UK both in terms of the strength of the 
occupational market and investment values but 
it appears to be following a similar path.
PROPERTY CYCLE
Having a view on the property cycle is vital in 
setting the direction of the business over the 
next few years. Our business will be affected 
by the broad economy, interest rates and 
the availability of money and currency/cross 
border risks. Although every property cycle is 
unique, this current one is particularly different 
and dif cult to read due to the unprecedented 
and ongoing intervention in  nancial markets 
by the world’s central banks resulting in what 
looks likely to be a long period of relatively low 
growth and low interest rates. It feels to us that 
the current strength in both the occupational 
and investment markets has further to run and 
although there are clearly signi cant geopolitical

Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report risk concerns, were they to materialise, a 
diverse, high-yielding industrial property 
portfolio is likely to be as good a place to be 
invested as any.
OUTLOOK
As a Pan-European business that reports in 
Sterling there are risks, both currency and 
otherwise, relating to the stability of the 
euro zone. We do our best to mitigate these 
both by our choice of investment regions and 
hedging the currency risk to a large extent. 
However, notwithstanding this the outlook 
for the business is excellent.  We have a high 
yielding, diverse portfolio of properties valued 
at substantially below replacement cost. The 
regional network of of ces and teams that 
we have established over the last ten years 
has proved to be  rst class at operating the 
business. Our portfolio still has a valuable 
vacant element to drive the rent roll and rents 
which look set to grow as the economies in 
which we operate improve. Risk adjusted 
returns from industrial property look high 
relative to many other investments and there is 
a signi cant weight of capital looking to invest.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Joint Chief Executives’ Review  and Finance Report Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board recognises that risk management is essential for the Group to achieve its objectives.  
Whilst our principal risks have remained unchanged over the course of the year, senior 
management staff and the Board regularly consider the signi cant risks, which it believes are 
facing the Group, identify appropriate controls and if necessary instigate action to improve those 
controls. 
There will always be some risk when undertaking property investments but the control process 
is aimed at mitigating and minimising these risks where possible. The key risks identi ed by the 
Board, the steps taken to mitigate them and additional commentary is as follows:
Decline in property 
values
Loss of rental income
Increase in vacant 
property costs
Inability to meet 
loan repayment 
requirements
Insuf cient credit 
Facility covenant 
breaches
Changes in the general economic 
environment can lead to the failure of 
tenants to renew or extend leases, 
as well as increasing the likelihood of 
tenant default
Over-borrowing  
Signi cant rise in interest rates
The Board believes these risks are reduced 
due to its policy of assembling a portfolio 
with a wide spread of different tenancies in 
terms of actual tenants, industry type and 
geographical location as well as undertaking 
thorough due diligence on acquisitions. 
The level of exposure to individual tenants 
is regularly monitored to ensure they are 
within manageable limits. Rent deposits 
or bank guarantees are requested where 
appropriate to mitigate against the effect of 
tenant defaults. Where possible, purchases 
are achieved at low capital values and with 
due investigation of tenant  nances.
In response to these risks Hansteen 
maintains a prudent approach to its 
borrowing levels by seeking to maintain 
headroom within its debt facility covenants 
and have cash resources that exceed 
immediate loan repayment requirements. 
The Board actively monitors current debt 
and equity levels as well as considering the 
future levels of debt and equity required to 
sustain the business. Current and projected 
compliance with loan covenants are 
monitored and compliance certi cates are 
prepared on a regular basis. For all money 
borrowed consideration is given to procuring 
the appropriate hedging instruments to 
protect against increases in interest rates.
Principal Risk Cause Risk Management

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Principal Risks and Uncertainties Fluctuations in foreign

Environmental liabilities
Loss of REIT status and 
payment of additional 
corporation tax would 
arise from a breach 
of REIT compliance 
requirements
Investment in overseas countries
Non-compliance with laws and

Non-compliance with REIT legislation
In response to this risk the Group’s borrowings 
in Europe are in Euro denominated loan 
facilities and therefore, to the extent that 
investments are  nanced by debt, a self 
hedging mechanism is in place. In relation 
to the equity element of the Group’s Euro 
investments the Board monitors the level of 
exposure on a regular basis and considers 
the level and timing of when to take out the 
appropriate hedging instruments to cover 
this exposure. There is also a risk that one or 
more of the countries that the Group operates 
in could leave the Euro which may affect the 
nature of the Group’s loans and derivatives 
or introduce new volatility and currency 
exposures for the Group to manage.
Each acquisition undertaken by the Group 
includes an environmental report from a 
specialist consultancy. These reports may 
highlight the need for further investigation and 
in some cases remediation. The Group’s policy 
is then to either undertake such investigations 
or remediation or potentially reject the 
purchase as no longer viable.
The risk of a breach of certain limits imposed 
by REIT legislation is mitigated through 
regular review of the Group’s actual and 
forecast performance against REIT regime 
requirements.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The  nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as detailed in the Directors’ Report on pages 
76 - 80 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) adopted by the European Union and 
therefore the Group  nancial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The  nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investment 
properties and certain  nancial instruments. 
Certain comparative amounts have been adjusted where relevant to ensure comparability with the current year’s 
presentation. The preparation of  nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the  nancial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates 
are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those 
estimates. 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated  nancial statements incorporate the  nancial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
the  nancial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi ed separately from the Group’s equity. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and 
the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses applicable to the non-
controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interest in the subsidiary’s equity are allocated against the interest 
of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional 
investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal. 
Adjustments are made to the  nancial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred. The 
acquiree’s identi able assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the 
net amounts of identi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those 
provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets and liabilities are recognised, to 
re"ect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, 
would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year. 
Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured at the non-controlling shareholder’s proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identi able net assets. 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost. If the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the sum of 
the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised 
immediately in pro t or loss as a bargain purchase gain. This is included in the Group’s share of results of associates. 
34
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements Goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to bene t from the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there 
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated  rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classi ed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through 
a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be 
committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the 
date of classi cation.
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classi ed as held for sale, except investment properties, are measured at the 
lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Investment properties classi ed as held for sale are carried at 
fair value.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis. Where a lease incentive is granted, which does not enhance the value 
of the property, or a rent-free period is granted, the effective cost is amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Property management fees are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate 
applicable.
Revenue from the sale of trading and investment properties is recognised when the signi cant risks and returns have 
been transferred to the buyer. This generally coincides with the transfer of the legal title or the passing of possession 
to the buyer. The pro t on disposal of trading and investment properties is determined as the difference between the 
consideration received and the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus any 
additions in the period.
LEASING
Leases are classi ed as  nance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classi ed as operating leases. Where a property is held under a head lease 
it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on acquisition and the present value of minimum 
ground rent payments. The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a 
 nance lease obligation. Where only the buildings element of a property lease is classi ed as a  nance lease, the ground 
rent payments for the land element are shown within operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. When accounting for a lease 
of land and buildings, the Group considers the land and buildings elements separately. The Group does not classify those 
land elements that are held under operating leases as investment property.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual  nancial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated  nancial statements, the 
results and  nancial position of each Group company are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency 
of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated  nancial statements.
In preparing the  nancial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s 
functional currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. 
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
35
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are 
included in pro t or loss for the period in which they arise. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-
monetary items carried at fair value are included in pro t or loss for the period in which they arise except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. 
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated  nancial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates "uctuate signi cantly during that period, in 
which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classi ed as 
equity and transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as 
income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Company’s estimate of options that will eventually vest. Fair 
value is measured by use of a binomial model or the Company’s share price less the discounted value of estimated future 
dividends, as appropriate. The expected life used in the binomial model has been adjusted based on management’s best 
estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year. Taxable pro t differs from net pro t as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current and deferred tax is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities in the  nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro t, and 
is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted 
basis.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating pro t is stated after the share of results of associates and pro t on sale of subsidiaries, but before changes in 
fair value of derivative  nancial instruments,  nance income,  nance costs and foreign exchange movements relating to 
intercompany funding.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
This comprises computers,  xtures and  ttings and of ce equipment, which are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of computers,  xtures and  ttings and of ce equipment, 
less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
 Computer equipment three years
 Fixtures and  ttings  ve years
 Of ce equipment three years

Financial Statements INVESTMENT PROPERTIES
Investment properties, which comprises freehold and leasehold property held to earn rentals and/or for capital 
appreciation, are treated as acquired when the Group assumes the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership. 
Acquisitions of investment properties including related transaction costs and subsequent additions of a capital nature 
are initially recognised in the accounts at cost. At each reporting date the investment properties are revalued to their fair 
values based on a professional valuation at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of investment property are included in pro t or loss for the period in which they arise. 
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment. 
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise signi cant in"uence, but not control or joint 
control, through participation in the  nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Signi cant in"uence is the 
power to participate in the  nancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these  nancial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. 
Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in 
substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are recognised only to the extent that the Group has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is 
included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any 
excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost 
of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in pro t or loss. 
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, pro ts and losses are eliminated to the extent of 
the Group’s interest in the relevant associate. Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in 
which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
TRADING PROPERTIES
Trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are treated as acquired when the Group 
assumes the signi cant risks and rewards of ownership. Cost includes development costs speci cally attributable to 
properties in the course of development. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less further costs 
expected to be incurred to completion and disposal. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and  nancial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instrument.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
All  nancial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of an investment 
is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market 
concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those  nancial assets classi ed as at 
fair value through pro t or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classi ed into the following categories:  nancial assets ‘at fair value through pro t or loss’ (FVTPL), 
‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS)  nancial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classi cation 
depends on the nature and purpose of the  nancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FVTPL
Financial assets are classi ed as at FVTPL where the  nancial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at 
FVTPL. A  nancial asset is classi ed as held for trading if:
 •  it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; or
 •  it is a part of an identi ed portfolio of  nancial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term pro t-taking; or 
 • it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
37
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements A  nancial asset other than a  nancial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 •  such designation eliminates or signi cantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise;  
or 
 •  the  nancial asset forms part of a group of  nancial assets or  nancial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis; or
 •  it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives that can be designated as FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in pro t or loss. The net gain 
or loss recognised in pro t or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the  nancial asset.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have  xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market are classi ed as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for 
short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
AFS FINANCIAL ASSETS
Non-derivative  nancial assets that are not classi ed as loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments, are not 
held for trading and are not designated as FVTPL on initial recognition are classi ed as AFS. AFS  nancial assets are 
measured at fair value with fair value gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income. On sale or impairment 
of the asset, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassi ed to pro t or 
loss as a reclassi cation adjustment. Impairment losses on AFS  nancial assets are recognised in pro t or loss. Dividends 
on an AFS equity instrument are recognised in pro t or loss when the entity’s right to receive payment is established. 
IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred 
after the initial recognition of the  nancial asset, the estimated future cash "ows of the investment have been impacted. 
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
 • signi cant  nancial dif culty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 • default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 • it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or  nancial re-organisation.
The carrying amount of the  nancial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all  nancial assets with the 
exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When 
a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the 
allowance account are recognised in pro t or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through 
pro t or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not 
exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 
Where an AFS  nancial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income are reclassi ed to pro t and loss in the period. In the case of AFS equity instruments, if, in a 
subsequent period the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is not reversed through pro t 
and loss. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigni cant risk of changes in value.
38
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group derecognises a  nancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash "ows from the asset expire; or 
it transfers the  nancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If 
the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the 
transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may 
have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred  nancial asset, 
the Group continues to recognise the  nancial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds 
received.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classi ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. 
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACT LIABILITIES
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and are subsequently measured at the 
higher of:
 •  the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets; and 
 •  the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the 
revenue recognition policies set out above.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Financial liabilities are classi ed as either  nancial liabilities ‘at FVTPL ’ or ‘other  nancial liabilities’.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classi ed as at FVTPL where the  nancial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at 
FVTPL. A  nancial liability is classi ed as held for trading if:
 •  it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in the near future; or
 •  it is a part of an identi ed portfolio of  nancial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual 
pattern of short-term pro t-taking; or 
 •  it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. 
A  nancial liability other than a  nancial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 •  such designation eliminates or signi cantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
otherwise arise; or 
 •  the  nancial liability forms part of a group of  nancial assets or  nancial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or 
investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis; or
 •  it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives that can be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in pro t or loss. The net 
gain or loss recognised in pro t or loss incorporates any interest paid on the  nancial liability.
The convertible bond is designated as fair value through pro t or loss and is presented on the balance sheet at fair 
value with all gains and losses, including the write off of issuance costs, recognised in the income statement within net 
 nancing costs. The interest charge in respect of the coupon rate on the bonds has been recognised within net  nancing 
costs on an accruals basis.
39
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
Other  nancial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other  nancial 
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the  nancial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying 
amount on initial recognition.
DE-RECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
The Group derecognises  nancial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or 
they expire. Where an existing  nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different 
terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi ed, such an exchange or modi cation is treated as a 
de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying 
amounts is recognised in the income statement. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into a variety of derivative  nancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign 
exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and interest rate swaps and caps. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in pro t or loss 
immediately.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented 
as current assets or current liabilities.
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date 
used in preparing these accounts are:
INVESTMENT PROPERTY VALUATIONS
In determining the fair value of investment properties there is a degree of uncertainty and judgement involved. The 
valuations are based on a number of assumptions, the signi cant ones of which are the appropriate discount rates, 
estimates of future rental income and capital expenditure. The Group uses external professional valuers to provide 
independent valuations of the investment properties.
ACCOUNTING FOR COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS
The Group frequently enters into transactions for the purchase and sale of investment property, associates and other 
 nancial assets. These transactions tend to be one-off and can be complex. Accounting for the transactions requires 
judgments such as in calculating any gain or loss, and deciding upon the presentation in the  nancial statements. 
Transactions are disclosed and where their impact is signi cant then they are presented separately from the ongoing 
 nancial results of the Group.
DEFERRED TAX 
Determining the amount of tax losses to be recognised as deferred tax assets requires management to estimate 
the level and probability of future taxable pro ts that those losses can be offset against, in each relevant entity and 
jurisdiction.
CALCULATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
In calculating the expense in relation to share-based payments, including the Performance Share Plan and Founder Long-
Term Incentive Plan, the Company is required to estimate the probability of share and options awards vesting and the 
fair value of a share and option at the grant date and the balance sheet date. These estimates involve making a variety 
of assumptions concerning rents and related costs, yields, administrative costs, interest rates, exchange rates, dividend 
rates and the rate and level of property acquisitions.

qualifying activity and its balance of business which are set out in the UK REIT legislation in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

Financial Statements Included within the property valuation is £2.5 million (2013: £2.5 million) in respect of tenant lease incentives granted. 
Investment property includes £2.7 million of property (2013: £3.0 million) held under  nance leases.
Properties classi ed as held for sale at 31 December 2014 represent properties that were actively marketed as at the 
year end and have subsequently been sold, or agreements for their sale have been entered into. 
All investment properties are stated at fair value as at 31 December and have been valued by independent professionally 
quali ed external valuers CBRE, DTZ, Jones Lang LaSalle or Knight Frank LLP . The valuations have been prepared 
in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional Standards January 2014, published by The Royal Institution of 
Chartered Surveyors and with IVA1 of the International Valuation Standards.
The valuations are based on a number of assumptions, the signi cant ones of which are the appropriate discount rates, 
estimates of future rental income and capital expenditure. Rental income and yield assumptions are supported by market 
evidence where relevant.
The Group has pledged certain of its investment properties to secure bank loan facilities and a  nance lease granted to 
the Group (see note 26). 
In accordance with IFRS 13, the Group’s investment property has been assigned a valuation level in the fair value 
hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in actives markets for identical assets (Level 
1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). All of the Group’s investment property as at 31 December 
2014 is categorised as Level 3. Details of inputs used in the fair value measurement can be found in the Strategic Report. 
An increase in passing rent and a decrease in discount rate would increase the valuation.
As at 31 December 2014, the Group had entered into contracts for £2.2 million (2013: £3.7 million) of building works that 
were not complete.

During 2014, the Group acquired a further 9.2% stake in Ashtenne Industrial Fund Unit Trust, bringing its total investment 
to 36.7% (2013: 27 .5%). The Group also acquired additional units in Hansteen UK Industrial Property II Limited 
Partnership, retaining its holding of 33.3%.  
In October 2014 the Group disposed of the majority of the portfolio held in Hansteen UK Industrial Property Unit Trust 
(“HPUT”). This was facilitated by a reorganisation of legal entities during which the Group exchanged its 33% interest 
in HPUT for a 33% interest in a new unit trust, Hansteen Saltley Unit Trust, which became the legal owner of HPUT . 
Hansteen Saltley Unit Trust retained one property before disposing of the remaining portfolio by selling its investment in 
HPUT . As part of the sale of HPUT , Hansteen invested a further 17% in Hansteen Saltley Unit Trust and therefore owned 
50% at the year-end.

In July 2013, Hansteen (Jersey) Securities Limited issued €100 million of convertible bonds with a coupon of 4.0%. The 
bonds will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, be convertible into ordinary shares of the Company. The initial 
conversion price was set at a premium of 22.5% above the volume weighted average share price between launch and 
pricing, and will be subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the bonds.
Bonds can be converted at the option of the bond holder from 15 July 2016. The bonds may be converted before this date 
if Hansteen’s share price (expressed in Euro at the current exchange rate) is more than 130% of the current conversion 
price (expressed in Euro at a  xed exchange rate) for a period of 20 consecutive dealing days within the 30 dealing days 
ending on the day before the last dealing day of any calendar quarter. Bond holders can only exercise their conversion 
rights in the quarter following the quarter in which the ratio was above 130% for the required period.
Under the terms of the bonds, the Company will have the right to elect to settle any conversion entirely in ordinary 
shares of the Company, cash or a combination of shares and cash. If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased 
and cancelled, the bonds will be redeemed at par in July 2018.

 • 2005 Share Option Scheme
 • Founder Long-term incentive plan
 • Performance Share Plan
The total share-based payment charge for the year under these schemes was £12.1 million (2013: £0.4 million).
2005 SHARE OPTION SCHEME

participants. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the ordinary shares of the 
Company on the date of grant. The options have a three-year vesting period that is not subject to performance conditions. 
The options expire if they remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant. Options are normally 
forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. No options were granted under this scheme during 
the year. The following table summarises the movements in the schemes during the year:

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE SCHEME (LTIP)
The Joint Chief Executives are entitled to a bonus share award dependant on the growth in EPRA NAV . The target for the 
bonus is that EPRA NAV per ordinary share (after adding back dividends and other returns to shareholders) must exceed 
a compound growth rate of 10% per annum in a three-year period. The bonus for each Chief Executive is calculated as 
12.5% of the excess growth over the 10% growth target. 
Any amount payable under the LTIP is to be satis ed in full by ordinary shares of the Company. No shares have been 
issued under the LTIP since "otation in 2005. This bonus scheme will be repeated to reward performance in each three-
year period, the current performance period ends on 31 December 2015. 
The price per share to be used when determining the number of shares which the Joint Chief Executives are entitled to 
will be the average mid-market quotation for such shares on the Main Market for the  rst 20 dealing days immediately 
following the end of the relevant period. It is expected that a bonus share award will be earned for the current 
performance period. As such, a charge has been recognised during the current year which takes into account the excess 
growth over the performance target over the performance period, multiplied by the number of shares in issue as at the 
year end. Two thirds of the calculated bonus has been accrued in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 
2014 (2013: £nil). 
The total share-based payment charge for the year under this scheme was £11 .1 million with associated social security 
costs of £2.5 million (2013: £nil).
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP awards share options with a nil exercise price to executive directors and senior employees. The number of 
options granted is calculated with reference to the employee’s salary and the share price prior to the grant date. To 
re"ect the fact that 2012 was a transitional year between the 2005 Share Option Scheme and the PSP , two awards were 
granted to participants, one with a two-year performance period and one with a three-year performance period. Vesting 
of the awards is staggered over the three years following the performance period, with one third vesting each year if 
performance targets are met. Performance targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Net Asset Value growth, 
plus dividends, relative to a peer group of listed UK REITs.

The table below sets out the categorisation of the  nancial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2014. Where 
the  nancial instruments are held at fair value the valuation level indicates the priority of the inputs to the valuation 
technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair value fall 
within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is signi cant to 
the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES
The Group monitors and manages the  nancial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports 
which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative  nancial instruments to economically hedge 
these risk exposures. The use of  nancial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of 
Directors. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board and management on a continuous 
basis. The Group does not enter into or trade in  nancial instruments, including derivative  nancial instruments, for 
speculative purposes.
The Group’s management reports quarterly to the Board and bi-annually to the Audit Committee, an independent body 
that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements MARKET RISK
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the  nancial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest 
rates. The Group enters into a variety of derivative  nancial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign currency risk, including:
 • interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
 •  forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the 
Group’s investment in foreign operations which have the Euro as their functional currency.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency arises from the fact that there are foreign operations which transact business 
denominated in Euro, with the translation of the local trading performance and local net asset to Sterling for each  nancial 
period and at each balance sheet date giving rise to an exposure to "uctuations in the Sterling:Euro exchange rate. The 
Group’s approach to managing this exposure is to fund investments in Euro-denominated operations with equity that is 
partly hedged by forward currency options to limit the overall exposure of the Group. 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated  nancial instruments at the reporting date are as 
follows. The carrying amount of the Group’s non- nancial instruments in Euro-denominated operations is also presented.

FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The Group is exposed to the Euro through its operations in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. At 31 
December 2014 the net assets of the Group were £676.4 million (2013: £555.0 million) of which £348.8 million were 
denominated in Euro (2013: £319.0 million). At 31 December 2014 the Group had currency options in place to buy £215.1 
million for €283.5 million. 
The table below shows the impact of a 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling against the Euro in relation to 
 nancial instruments alone.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at "oating interest rates. The risk is 
managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between  xed and "oating rate borrowings, by the use of 
interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap contracts. 
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments during the year. 
 Increase/(decrease) in pro t before tax:
 Group Group Company Company 
 2014 2013 2014 2013 
 £m £m £m £m
Increase interest rates by 1% 9.6 6.5 (3.6) 2.1
Decrease interest rates by 1% (7 .5) (6.5) (0.4) (1 .7)
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity. 
INTEREST RATE SWAP AND CAP CONTRACTS
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between  xed and "oating rate interest 
amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. Under interest rate cap contracts, the Group has limited its 
exposure to increases in interest rates by capping interest payable on its borrowings. Such contracts enable the Group to 
mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued  xed rate debt held and the cash "ow exposures on 
the issued variable rate debt held. 
CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a  nancial loss to the 
Group. 
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is £128.5 million (2013: £115.2 million) comprising trade and other 
receivables and cash and cash deposits. The Group’s principal credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables of 
£9.1 million (2013: £6.2 million) which consist principally of rents due from tenants. The balance is low relative to both the 
current and net assets of the Group and the Company.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured. There is no 
concentration of credit risk within the portfolio to either geographical business segment or company as the Group has a 
well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 1% (2013: 1%) of the gross rent roll. 
Other receivables consist principally of tax and VAT receivables. These items do not give rise to signi cant credit risk. 
Cash deposits are held at banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which monitors the Group’s short, 
medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements on a regular basis. The Group manages liquidity 
risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities. As at 31 December 2014 the net debt to property value was 
41 .1% and the Group had £39.1 million of investment and trading properties that were not secured against the Group’s 
borrowings.
LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RISK TABLES
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative and derivative  nancial 
liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash "ows of  nancial liabilities based on the 
earliest dates on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash "ows. When 
the amount payable or receivable is not  xed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the interest 
and foreign currency rates as at the reporting date.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements The Directors present their Annual Report and the 
audited  nancial statements of the Company and the 
Group for the year ended 31 December 2014. The 
Corporate Governance Statement set out on page 94 
forms part of this report. 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The Company is the parent company of a group whose 
principal activities comprise property investment, 
development, management and associated business, 
focussing on industrial property investments in 
Continental Europe and the UK, although it will also 
seek to pro t from opportunistic acquisitions in other 
property sectors both in the UK and abroad. 
The subsidiary undertakings principally affecting the 
pro ts or net assets of the Group in the year are listed 
in note 18 to the  nancial statements.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The Group’s focus is on UK and Continental European 
industrial investments which in the opinion of the 
Board have high yields along with cheap  nancing 
costs. To date these investments have been in the 
UK, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. 
A smaller part of the Group’s activity is dedicated to 
opportunistic property investment opportunities which 
to date have included land and residential investments. 
More detailed information about the Group’s business, 
activities and  nancial performance is incorporated 
into this report by reference and can be found in the 
Strategic Report on pages 6 to 23.
There are no further matters to report under section 
417 of the Companies Act 2006. 
RESULTS
The results for the year ended 31 December 2014 are 
shown in the Income Statement on page 26 of the 
 nancial statements. The pre-tax pro t for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 was £131 .2 million (2013: 
£65.3 million) and the net assets are shown in the 
balance sheet as £676.4 million (2013: £555.0 million). 
The EPRA NAV per share was 102p (2013: 91p). In 
the Directors’ view the Normalised Income Pro t, 
Normalised Total Pro t and EPRA NAV growth are 
the most appropriate performance measures for the 
Group.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The Directors consider the following to be key 
performance indicators (KPIs), as disclosed in the 
Strategic Report:
Key performance indicator 2014 2013
Normalised Income Pro t £48.2m £39.4m
Normalised Total Pro t £65.3m £46.3m
Net asset value (NAV)  
(per share) 99p 86p
EPRA NAV (per share) 102p 91p
Annualised rental income £84.2m £73.5m
Net debt to value 41.1% 49.3%
Dividend (per share)  
– excluding special dividend 5.0p 4.8p
Yield  
– excluding special dividend 8.7% 8.6%
Occupancy 86% 85%
DIVIDEND
For the year ended 31 December 2014, an interim 
dividend of 2.0p per share was paid on 20 November 
2014, of which 1 .0p per share was attributable to a 
REIT Property Income Distribution (“PID”) in respect 
of the Group’s tax exempt property rental business. 
The second dividend of 3.0p per share will be payable 
on 21 May 2015 to shareholders on the register on 24 
April 2015 of which 1 .4p per share will be attributable 
to a PID. At the same time, a special dividend of 3.0p 
per share will be paid.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
The UK corporation tax rate will fall on 1 April 2015 
from the current rate of 21% to 20%. The impact of 
the proposed rate change is not material to the Group.
Michaella Hornbuckle resigned as Company Secretary 
on 18 February 2015. On the same date, Richard 
Lowes was appointed as Company Secretary. 
On 20 February 2015, the Group acquired an additional 
4.1% stake in the Ashtenne Industrial Fund Unit Trust 
for £11 .0 million.
Directors’ Report

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board agrees and reviews policies and  nancial 
instruments for risk management. Further information 
on  nancial instruments is contained in note 34 to the 
 nancial statements.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The principal risks and uncertainties to which the 
Group is exposed are detailed in the Strategic Report 
on pages 21 to 22. 
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s business activities, together with 
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position as well as the  nancial 
position of the Group, its cash "ows, liquidity position 
and the borrowing facilities are described in the 
Strategic Report on pages 6 to 23. In addition, note 
34 to the  nancial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its  nancial risk management objectives; 
details of its  nancial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity 
risk. 
The Group’s debt maturity pro le for its long-term 
funding is detailed in the Strategic Report on page 
18. As announced in February 2014 as part of the 
German re nancing, Hansteen secured new  ve year 
facilities with HSBC and Helaba. In June 2014, the 
Group entered into new facilities with ING when the 
HBI Netherlands portfolio was acquired. In December 
2014, further acquisitions in Germany led to additional 
facilities being secured with HSBC. All of these 
facilities are due to mature in 2019. As part of its risk 
management process the Group has considered its 
forecast cash "ows and forecast covenant compliance 
taking into account:
 •  the impact on the various loan covenants of 
reductions in the property valuations, decline in 
rental income and increase in interest rates; and
 •  the impact of potential events arising from 
adverse movements in general economic 
conditions on the Group’s operating cash "ow 
generation, including tenancy failures and 
increased vacancies.
These forecasts show that the Group has suf cient 
headroom and available  nance to manage 
its business risks successfully. Based on this 
assessment, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the Annual Report and Accounts.
SHARE CAPITAL
Details of the issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued 
share capital during the year are shown in note 28. The 
Company has one class of ordinary shares which carry 
no right to  xed income. Each share carries the right to 
one vote at general meetings of the Company. 
There are no speci c restrictions on the size of a 
holding nor on the transfer of shares, which are both 
governed by the general provisions of the Articles of 
Association and prevailing legislation. The Directors are 
not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights. 
Details of employee share schemes are set out in  
note 31 .
No person has any special rights of control over the 
Company’s share capital and all issued shares are fully 
paid.
DIRECTORS
The Directors who served throughout the year are 
detailed on page 71 - 73. The appointment and 
replacement of Directors by the Company is governed 
by its Articles of Association, the Companies Acts and 
related legislation. The Articles themselves may be 
amended by special resolution of the shareholders. 
In accordance with the Governance Code all the 
current serving Directors will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming 2015 
Annual General Meeting, with the exception of Richard 
Mully who will retire from the Board at the Annual 
General Meeting. 
None of the Directors had any interests in any material 
contract during the year relating to the business of the 
Group.
Subject to the Company’s Memorandum of 
Association, the Articles, any legislation and any 
directions given by special resolution, the business of 
the Company will be managed by the Directors, who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company, whether 
relating to the management of the business of the 
Company or not. In particular, the Board may exercise 
all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge any of its undertakings, 
property, assets and uncalled capital and to issue 
debentures and other securities and give security for 
any debt, liability or obligation of the Company to any 
third party.

opportunities they need to achieve their potential. 
Through grant awards and pro bono support, LandAid 
brings together charitable giving from across the 
industry to make a real difference to young lives.
There were no political donations in the year  
(2013: £nil).
CORPORATE AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
It is Hansteen’s policy to comply with environmental 
legislation and relevant codes of practice. In line with 
recent guidance issued by DEFRA (the Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), we set out 
below the required information for the year ended 31 
December 2014. 
QUANTIFICATION AND REPORTING METHODOLOGY 
We have followed the 2013 UK Government 
environmental reporting guidance. DEFRA greenhouse 
gas conversion factors have been used for the 
purposes of this report. 
We have used the operational control approach, 
which therefore only includes information regarding 
those emissions for which we have direct control 
and in"uence on. We have therefore included carbon 
emissions derived from gas, electricity, heating oil and 
district heating consumptions attributable to Hansteen.  
Energy consumption is assessed as attributable to 
Hansteen if it is used for the bene t of vacant property 
space or for common parts or communal facilities 
at properties which are held directly or managed by 
Hansteen.

Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report and the  nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
 nancial statements for each  nancial year.  Under that 
law the Directors are required to prepare the group 
 nancial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company  nancial statements under IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU.  Under Company law the Directors must 
not approve the accounts unless they are satis ed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the pro t or loss of the 
Company for that period. In preparing these  nancial 
statements, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that Directors:
 •  properly select and apply accounting policies;
 •  present information, including accounting policies, 
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, 
comparable and understandable information; 
 •  provide additional disclosures when compliance 
with the speci c requirements in IFRSs are 
insuf cient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and 
conditions on the entity’s  nancial position and 
 nancial performance; and
 •  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are suf cient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the  nancial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that the 
 nancial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006.  They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and  nancial information 
included on the Company’s website.  Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of  nancial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 
We con rm that to the best of our knowledge:
 •  the  nancial statements, prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities,  nancial 
position and pro t or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole;
 •  the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; 
and
 •  the annual report and  nancial statements, taken 
as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
OF HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
GOING CONCERN
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF 
MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
In our opinion:
 •  the  nancial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s pro t for the 
year then ended;
 •  the Group  nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union;
 •  the parent company  nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 •  the  nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group  nancial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The  nancial statements comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the 
Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in Equity, 
the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements and 
the related notes 1 to 34.  The  nancial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
parent company  nancial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the 
Directors’ statement contained within the strategic report that 
the Group is a going concern. We con rm that:
 •  we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
 nancial statements is appropriate; and
 •  we have not identi ed any material uncertainties that may 
cast signi cant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team:

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements INVESTMENT PROPERTY VALUATION
See also note 17 to the  nancial statements, and the 
Audit Committee’s Report on pages 97 to 100. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group held wholly-owned 
investment and trading properties valued at £968.1 
million, in addition to owning a share of three funds 
holding properties valued at £644.3 million.
Investment properties are held at fair value on the 
balance sheet, resulting in a net valuation gain of £62.9 
million during the year. The fair values are calculated 
using information, such as lease agreements and 
tenancy data, in addition to professional judgement 
concerning marketing conditions and factors impacting 
individual properties.
The valuation process is inherently judgemental, 
which is why we consider this to be a risk of material 
misstatement. In particular, changes in assumptions 
such as the time a property will remain vacant when a 
tenant leaves, the rent free period required to attract 
a new tenant, and the level of expenditure required 
to maintain the property can lead to signi cant 
movements in the value of the property, as can changes 
in the underlying market conditions.
 •  We tested the integrity of the information provided 
by management to the valuers by assessing 
supporting evidence, such as comparing rental 
income to the tenancy schedules and evaluating 
occupancy through physical inspection.
 •  We applied audit analytics to the tenancy and 
valuations data by analysing changes in the 
property values compared to factors such as 
market averages, occupancy rates and yields.
 •  We met with management’s third party valuers 
of the German, UK and Netherlands property 
portfolios to con rm their independence, the 
scope of the work they were requested to perform 
by management, and the valuation process 
applied. For each property we identi ed as having 
signi cant or unusual valuation movements in our 
audit analytics, we challenged the valuers on the 
key assumptions applied and, where considered 
appropriate, obtained the detailed valuation 
workings to check the validity of the assumptions 
applied and the accuracy of the calculation 
performed. We also assessed the valuations for a 
sample of other properties. Our work was led by 
senior members of the audit team, supported by 
internal property valuations specialists.
 •  We visited a sample of properties during the 
year to assess the condition of the buildings and 
validate the occupancy data in the group’s tenancy 
schedules.
 •  We also considered the value realised on disposed 
properties compared to previous valuations, to 
determine the reliability of historical valuation 
outputs.

CALCULATION AND PRESENTATION OF THE LTIP
See also note 31 to the  nancial statements, the 
Audit Committee’s Report on pages 97 to 100, and the 
Remuneration Committee’s Report on pages 102 to 114.
On 1 January 2013, Hansteen granted three-year Long 
Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) options to the joint CEOs, 
as set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 102 to 
114.
Payment under the scheme is made if the EPRA 
Net Asset Value (‘NAV’) per share of the Group at 31 
December 2015 exceeds 110.7 pence (representing a 
compound annual growth of 10% over the three year 
period). At 31 December 2014 the Group’s EPRA NAV 
per share is 101 .7 pence, as stated in Note 14. Before 
the impact of the LTIP the EPRA NAV per share would 
be 105.4 pence, or 114.9 pence when dividends paid 
are added back in line with the scheme rules. This 
equates equating to an average annual growth of 19.1% 
over the two year period.
A charge of £13.6 million (including national insurance 
costs) has been recorded in the year, which required 
signi cant judgement in considering the potential 
outcomes of the NAV growth based performance 
conditions over the remaining period of the current 
three-year scheme.
There is a further risk that insuf cient prominence and 
disclosure will result in the impact of the LTIP scheme 
not being clear to users of the  nancial statements.
In previous LTIP performance periods, the conditions 
of the scheme were not expected to be met and, 
as a result, no charge was accrued. This is the  rst 
performance period of the LTIP scheme in which 
management expects options will vest. Due to the 
level of management judgement and the size of the 
resulting charge, we have included the calculation and 
presentation of the LTIP as a risk.
 •  We reviewed minutes of the meetings of the Board 
of Directors and the Remuneration Committee, in 
addition to evaluating the scheme agreements and 
other correspondence between the Group and the 
LTIP members.
 •  We checked the mechanical accuracy of the 
calculation and challenged the key assumptions 
applied by management. As part of our work, we 
evaluated the accuracy of assumptions applied in 
previous periods for both the LTIP and other share-
settled award schemes, and we evaluated the 
sensitivity of the charge to changes in underlying 
assumptions.
 •  We met with the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
to discuss the key assumptions, the outcome of 
our audit work, and the level of disclosure in the 
annual report.
 •  We evaluated the level of disclosure in the annual 
report, in particular the presentation of the 
charge within diluted metrics and non-statutory 
performance measures.

Financial Statements SIGNIFICANT NON-RECURRING TRANSACTIONS
See also notes 10, 19 and 28 to the  nancial 
statements, and the Audit Committee’s Report on 
pages 97 to 100.
The nature of the Group’s operations give rise to non-
recurring transactions which can result in signi cant 
gains and losses. 
In the current year, the Group completed a number of 
signi cant non-recurring transactions including:
 •  the purchase of a loan receivable from ING, and 
the subsequent acquisition of the HBI Netherlands 
portfolio resulting in a total gain from these 
transactions of £17 .1 million;
 •  the placing of 44.8 million ordinary shares to raise 
gross proceeds of £47 .1 million using a ‘cash box’ 
structure;
 •  the acquisition of £26.0 million of units in the 
Ashtenne Industrial Fund (‘ AIF’);
 •  the disposal of the majority of the portfolio held 
in HPUT , resulting in a net gain of £2.9 million 
included within the share of results of associates; 
and
 •  the disposal of 16 wholly-owned properties, 
resulting in a net gain on disposal of £3.6 million. 
These transactions are, by their nature, one-off and 
often complex. There are management judgements 
inherent in their measurement, such as in calculating 
the value of the transaction or its resulting gain or loss, 
and their presentation in the  nancial statements has a 
material impact on the results for the year.
 •  We evaluated the presentation of signi cant 
non-recurring transactions in the annual report. 
Throughout our audit work we were alert to 
signi cant non-recurring transactions, in addition to 
completing a review of legal correspondence and 
Board meeting minutes, to assess whether the list 
of these transactions we considered was complete
 •  For all signi cant non-recurring transactions, we 
assessed whether:
  o  each transaction was accounted for in 
compliance with IFRS;
  o  each transaction was accurately recorded by 
agreeing the value to underlying documentation;
  o  the underlying assumptions and judgements 
in the measurement of each transaction were 
appropriate; and
  o  each transaction was fairly presented and 
disclosed in the  nancial statements. 
 •  In respect of signi cant non-recurring transactions 
that occurred during the year, our procedures also 
included:
  o  checking the valuation of the gain arising on the 
HBI transaction, and assessing the transparency 
of disclosure in the  nancial statements;
  o  agreeing the share placing to cash receipts and 
evaluating the impact of the cash-box structure 
placing on the Group’s equity reserves;
  o  agreeing the AIF unit acquisition accounting to 
purchase documentation;
  o  considering the presentation of the gain on 
disposal of the HPUT portfolio and agreeing the 
disposal proceeds to sales agreements and bank 
receipts; and
  o  checking the gains and losses recognised on 
a sample of property disposals to property 
valuation reports and sale and purchase 
agreements.

Financial Statements GOING CONCERN AND COVENANT COMPLIANCE
See also note 34 to the  nancial statements, and the 
Audit Committee’s Report on pages 97 to 100.
The Group has signi cant levels of external debt, 
including bank borrowings of £433.8 million and 
convertible bonds with a fair value of £96.3 million as 
set out in Note 26. 
Bank borrowings are subject to a number of 
 nancial covenants, including minimum loan to value 
ratios and interest cover. Compliance with these 
banking covenants at the balance sheet date and 
forecast compliance for future periods are integral 
to management’s assessment of going concern. 
They also require consideration of the sensitivity of 
covenant compliance to valuation movements, interest 
rate increases, and changes in underlying trading 
performance.
The group’s assessment of going concern is a 
judgemental process which requires estimates of 
future cash "ows based on management’s view of 
future business prospects. The key judgements applied 
by management in developing the projected cash 
"ows include occupancy rates, rental growth, capital 
expenditure on existing assets, planned acquisition or 
disposal activity, and working capital movements.
 •  We assessed the judgments and assumptions 
applied by management in their going concern 
assessment and covenant compliance forecasts 
including examining current and forecast business 
and economic trends and signi cant developments 
during and subsequent to the year ended 31 
December 2014.
 •  Our challenge of management’s assumptions 
included performing a sensitivity analysis 
to determine the extent of change in those 
assumptions that, either individually or collectively, 
could give rise to a covenant breach and considered 
the likelihood of such a movement, or combination 
of movements, in those assumptions arising. In 
addition, we reviewed the historical forecasting 
accuracy to assess the reliability of the process.

Financial Statements TAXATION
See also note 12 to the  nancial statements, and the 
Audit Committee’s Report on pages 97 to 100.
The Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (‘REIT’). 
There is a risk that signi cant tax charges may be 
payable if the group does not comply with the REIT 
requirements.
The global tax landscape of the Group gives rise to 
complexities around transfer pricing and there is 
potential exposure to tax overseas jurisdictions. There is 
judgement required in the application of tax legislation 
in overseas jurisdictions, which gives rise to a risk that 
permanent establishments may be created resulting in 
tax liabilities for which provisions need to be recorded in 
the  nancial statements.
At 31 December 2014 the Group has unutilised tax 
losses of £75.2 million for which a deferred tax asset 
has been recognised in respect of £16.0 million of 
such losses. There is a level of judgement required in 
determining the extent to which such assets should 
be recognised, where the losses are not ring-fenced 
as a result of the Group’s REIT status. The judgements 
include the application of local tax legislation, and the 
level of anticipated future pro ts to offset the unutilised 
losses.
 •  We challenged the assumptions and judgements in 
management’s assessment of current and forecast 
REIT compliance. Our challenge of management’s 
assumptions included performing a sensitivity 
analysis to determine the extent of change in those 
assumptions that, either individually or collectively, 
could give rise to non-compliance with REIT 
conditions and considered the likelihood of such a 
movement, or combination of movements, in those 
assumptions arising.
 •  We evaluated the appropriateness of 
management’s assumptions and estimates in 
relation to the likelihood of generating suitable 
future taxable pro ts to support the extent of 
recognition of deferred tax assets by considering 
the performance of the companies for the year 
and performing sensitivity analysis on the business 
forecasts.
 •  We considered compliance with overseas tax 
regulations and assessed the judgements 
made in assessing tax exposures by reviewing 
correspondence with tax authorities and performing 
recalculations for entities with signi cant tax 
balances or judgements, and on a sample of tax 
computations, using our overseas tax specialists.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Financial Statements Last year our report included one other risk which is not included in our report this year:
 •  accounting for derivative  nancial instruments – the complex initial recognition and presentation of the 
convertible bond was completed in the year ended 31 December 2013 and the instrument is now held at the 
publicly traded value.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the signi cant issues considered by the Audit 
Committee discussed on pages 97 to 100.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the  nancial 
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the 
 nancial statements is not modi ed with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an 
opinion on these individual matters.
OUR APPLICATION  
OF MATERIALITY
We de ne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
 nancial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or in"uenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £9.5 million (2013: 
£9.0 million), based on professional judgment, the requirements of 
auditing standards and the  nancial measures most relevant to users 
of the  nancial statements. We have used 1 .5% (2013: 2%) of net 
assets as the benchmark for determining materiality.  
In addition to net assets, we consider EPRA earnings per share to be 
a critical  nancial performance measure for the group on the basis 
that it is a key metric to analysts and investors. EPRA earnings per 
share is based on the group’s EPRA earnings of £36.3m, which is 
reconciled to IFRS pro t after tax attributable to equity holders of the 
parent in Note 14 of the  nancial statements. We applied a lower 
threshold of £1 .9 million (2013: £1 .8 million) for testing all balances 
impacting EPRA earnings, which represents 5% (2013: 6%) of EPRA 
earnings.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £190,000 (2013: 
£180,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our 
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.  We also reported 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identi ed 
when assessing the overall presentation of the  nancial statements.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Financial Statements AN OVERVIEW OF THE 
SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group 
and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement.
As in the prior year, our Group audit scope focused primarily on the 
audit work in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, 
where full audits were carried out based on our assessment of 
the identi ed risks of material misstatement identi ed above. The 
Group audit team performed the audits of the entities in the United 
Kingdom and Germany, and a component auditor performed the 
audits of the entities in the Netherlands based on instructions from 
the Group audit team. In addition, the Group team also tested 
the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures 
to con rm our conclusion that there were no signi cant risks of 
material misstatement of the aggregated  nancial information of 
the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of speci ed 
account balances.
The components subject to a full audit represent the principal 
business units of the Group and account for 97% (2013: 96%) of the 
Group’s revenue, 99% (2013: 97%) of the Group’s pro t before tax 
and 97% (2013: 97%) of the Group’s net assets.  Our audit work was 
executed at levels of materiality applicable to each component which 
were lower than group materiality, and ranged between £5.2 million 
and £7 .1 million.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed so that either the Senior Statutory 
Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team visits 
each of the Group’s principal business units at least once every three 
years, including the overseas components audited directly by the 
Group audit team. In the year ended 31 December 2014, we visited 
operations in the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
In years when we do not visit a signi cant component that is 
audited by a component auditor, we will include the component 
audit partner in our team brie ng, discuss their risk assessment, and 
review documentation of the  ndings from their work. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor or another senior member of the Group audit team 
participated in all of the close meetings of the Group’s principal 
business units.

SCOPE OF THE AUDIT 
OF THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the  nancial 
statements and for being satis ed that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the  nancial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our 
quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the  nancial statements suf cient to give reasonable 
assurance that the  nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of signi cant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the  nancial statements. In addition, we 
read all the  nancial and non- nancial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited  nancial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Corporate  Governance Chairman’s Corporate  
Governance Statement
Introduction
As Chairman, I am responsible for the Group’s corporate governance 
framework. During the year the Board achieved and maintained high 
standards of corporate governance and will continue to adapt this 
framework as necessary in 2015.

BOARD EVALUATION
The Board formally evaluates its performance and 
that of its Committees annually. Having undertaken 
its  rst externally facilitated Board evaluation in 2013 
in line with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Board undertook the 2014 
evaluation using a series of questionnaires. In addition, 
I met with each of the Non-Executive Directors 
on a one-to-one basis to evaluate their individual 
performances and the Non-Executive Directors all met 
without me present to evaluate my performance as 
Chairman. 
Overall, the  ndings of the evaluation were positive, 
recognising the amount of work that the Board and 
senior management team has undertaken during the 
year to improve procedures in a number of areas. The 
Board is con dent that the performance of the Board 
and the Committees was and is effective and that 
all Directors demonstrate full commitment in their 
respective roles.
Following the Board evaluation, I remain satis ed 
that the performance of all the Directors proposed 
for re-election continues to be effective and that each 
Director demonstrates commitment to their role. 
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Stephen Gee retired as a Non-Executive Director 
of the Company at the Annual General Meeting in 
2014 and Richard Mully will retire as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company at the Annual General 
Meeting on 8 June 2015.
As part of the process of succession planning for Non-
Executive Directors Melvyn Egglenton and Rebecca 
Worthington were welcomed to the Board on 10 June 
2014. Melvyn and Rebecca were also appointed as 
members of the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee effective from the same date.
Also at the Annual General Meeting Richard 
Cotton will retire as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and be succeeded by Melvyn Egglenton.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Richard 
Mully for his substantial contribution and commitment 
to Hansteen’s growth and success over the past nine 
years.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Corporate  Governance Corporate Governance 
Framework
The Company complied with the main principles of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
published by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2014 throughout the year with the 
exception of, for the period to 10 June 2014, the 
composition of the Remuneration Committee. Prior 
to 10 June 2014 the Remuneration Committee 
comprised only two independent Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chairman who was considered 
independent on appointment. The Company 
recognises that only having two independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Remuneration Committee 
until 10 June 2014 did not comply with the provisions 
of the Code however, we believe that for a Company 
with only 111 employees, as at 31 December 2014, 
two independent Non-Executive Directors, one of 
whom held the role of Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, together with the Non-Executive 
Chairman (considered independent on appointment) 
was an appropriate composition. Following the 
appointments of Melvyn Egglenton and Rebecca 
Worthington to the Remuneration Committee on 
10 June 2014 the composition of the Remuneration 
Committee is currently Code compliant.
The Company complies with the Corporate 
Governance Statement requirements pursuant to 
the Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules by virtue of the information 
included in this Corporate Governance Statement on 
page 94 together with information contained in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 76 - 80.
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible to the shareholders of the 
Company for the strategy and future development 
of the Group and the ef cient management of its 
resources. As a result, the Board has a schedule of 
matters reserved for its decision, which includes 
approval of annual budgets, acquisition and 
divestment policy, approval of major capital projects, 
the raising of  nance and management policies. 
The Board is supplied, in a timely fashion, with the 
information it needs to enable it to discharge its 
duties. The Board is also kept informed of changes 
in relevant legislation and changing commercial 
risks, and each Director has access to independent 
professional advice and the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. The Board meets at least  ve 
times a year with ad hoc meetings as required.
BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board currently comprises six independent 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and 
three Executive Directors. The biographies of these 
Directors are set out on pages 71 - 73. The Board is 
satis ed that the Non-Executive Directors, each of 
whom is independent from management and has no 
commercial or other connection with the Company, 
are able to exercise independent judgement. Richard 
Mully is the Senior Independent Director.
All directors, except Richard Mully, will offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting. 
THE CHAIRMAN AND JOINT CHIEF EXECUTIVES 
ROLES
The division of responsibilities between the role of 
Chairman, and the roles of the Joint Chief Executives, 
is clearly de ned, set out in writing and reviewed 
annually by the Board. The Chairman is responsible 
for the leadership and effective working of the Board, 
ensuring that all members of the Board, including 
in particular the Non-Executive Directors, have an 
opportunity to contribute effectively, and that there 
is appropriate and timely communication with 
shareholders. 
The Board has delegated executive responsibility 
for running the Group to the Joint Chief Executives 
who are responsible for the strategic direction and 
operational and  nancial performance of the Group. 
The appointment of new Directors is a matter for the 
Board as a whole, following recommendations made 
by the Nomination Committee.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Corporate  Governance Report of the Audit Committee
COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE
The Board has established an Audit Committee 
(the “Committee”) in accordance with the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”). In the 
period from 1 January 2014 to 9 June 2014 Humphrey 
Price was Chairman of the Committee with Richard 
Mully and Stephen Gee as the other members. 
With effect from 10 June 2014, following Stephen 
Gee’s retirement from the Board, the Committee 
comprised Humphrey Price as Chairman with Richard 
Mully, Melvyn Egglenton and Rebecca Worthington 
as the other members. All committee members 
are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Humphrey Price, Melvyn Egglenton and Rebecca 
Worthington all have recent and relevant  nancial 
experience as required by the Code. No members 
of the Committee have links with the Company’s 
external auditor. 
Senior representatives of the external auditors, 
Executive Directors and senior management may be 
invited to attend the meetings at the Committee’s 
discretion. The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to the Committee.
The Company believes the Committee contains the 
right balance of knowledge, skill and experience to 
support the business in achieving its strategy.
The Committee meets regularly during the year 
aligned to the  nancial reporting timetable. During 
2014 the Committee met three times for scheduled 
meetings and details of members attendance at each 
meeting is shown on page 96. 
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee is satis ed that it receives suf cient, 
reliable and timely information from management 
in order to allow it to ful l its objectives and 
responsibilities.
The Committee’s principal 
responsibilities include: 
 •  reviewing the content of the annual report and 
 nancial statements and advising the Board on 
whether, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and 
strategy;
 •  ensuring that management has systems and 
procedures in place to ensure the integrity of 
 nancial information;
 •  developing and implementing the policy for the 
provision of non-audit services by the auditor; 
 •  maintaining an appropriate relationship with 
the Group’s external auditor, reviewing the 
effectiveness, objectivity and independence of 
the external auditor, considering both the scope 
of their work and the fees paid to them for audit 
and non-audit services;
 •  considering all matters relating to the 
recommendation for appointment, re-
appointment, remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the Group’s external auditor; 
 •  monitoring the Group’s internal audit 
requirements, internal  nancial controls and the 
audit process; 
 •  reviewing the interim and full year  nancial 
statements prior to their submission to the Board, 
applying the Group’s accounting policies and any 
changes to  nancial reporting requirements; and
 •  undertaking a review of the Group’s risks on a 
bi-annual basis.
The full terms of reference of the Committee, 
reviewed in 2014, are available on the Company’s 
website www.hansteen.co.uk.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Corporate  Governance FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Committee reviewed and considered 
the following areas in respect of financial 
reporting and the preparation of the 
interim and annual financial statements:
 •  the appropriateness of accounting policies used;
 •  compliance with external and internal  nancial 
reporting standards and policies;
 •  signi cant judgments made;
 •  statutory disclosures; and
 •  whether the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements are fair, balanced and understandable.
No issues arose from this review.
In order to carry out this work, the Committee 
considered the work and recommendations of the 
Finance team led by the Finance Director, Richard 
Lowes. In addition, the Committee received regular 
reports from the external auditor setting out their 
views of the accounting treatments and judgements 
included in the  nancial statements. The reports from 
the external auditor are based on a full audit of the 
annual  nancial statements and a review of the interim 
 nancial statements. 
The significant issues considered by the 
Committee in relation to the financial 
statements were:
 •  Valuation and presentation of the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) charge
 •  HBI Netherlands transaction
 •  Cash box accounting for the share issue
 •  Investment property valuations
 •  Going concern, debt maturity and covenant 
compliance 
 •  Recognition of overseas deferred tax assets 
 
In addition to requesting that the 
external auditor focus on these areas 
and report to the Committee with their 
findings the Committee also undertook 
the following actions:
 •  The Committee reviewed and challenged 
management’s assumptions supporting the 
valuation and presentation of the LTIP charge
 •  The Committee reviewed the substance of the 
HBI transaction and the presentation of the 
resultant gain
 •  The Committee considered the structure of 
the share placing and reviewed management’s 
accounting
 •  Members of the Committee with relevant and 
current expertise in property valuations met with 
valuers of the Group property portfolio to discuss 
the valuations
 •  Reviewed the underlying assumptions in the 
going concern forecasts and the reasonableness 
of the stress tests carried out in relation to those 
forecasts
 •  Considered the supporting evidence for 
recognition of overseas deferred tax assets.
No issues arose from the above. 
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Committee keeps under review the Company’s 
need for an internal audit function. The majority of 
the processing and accounting for the day-to-day 
transactions of the Group is outsourced to third-party 
suppliers. Management maintain a close relationship 
with these suppliers and perform regular detailed 
reviews of their work and report to the Committee 
if any signi cant concerns are raised by these 
reviews. The Committee regularly reviews the internal 
controls to ensure that they are adequate for the 
size and complexity of the business. On this basis 
the Committee believes that the internal procedures 
performed by management are performed to the 
same degree as an internal audit function. The 
Committee and the Board will continue to monitor this 
position on an ongoing basis.
The Group has in place a formal whistle blowing 
policy and a dedicated independent whistle blowing 
hotline, as part of the arrangements set up and 
monitored by the Committee, so that employees are 
98
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Corporate  Governance able to report any matters of concern.  The Board has 
appointed Humphrey Price as the Board member 
with responsibility for the Company’s whistle blowing 
arrangements.
EXTERNAL AUDITORS AND THEIR INDEPENDENCE
The Group’s external auditor is Deloitte LLP 
(“Deloitte”). In forming their opinion on the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the Committee takes into account the safeguards 
operating within Deloitte and they are asked to 
provide a formal statement of their independence to 
the Company annually. In addition, to safeguard that 
independence, the Company ensures compliance with 
its policy governing the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor under which Deloitte may not 
provide a service which places them in a position 
where they may be required to audit their own work.
Speci cally, Deloitte are precluded from providing 
services relating to bookkeeping or other services 
relating to accounting records or  nancial statements 
of the Group,  nancial information system design 
and implementation, appraisal or evaluation services, 
actuarial services, any management functions, 
investment banking services, legal services unrelated 
to the audit, remuneration related services or 
advocacy services. 
To fulfil its responsibilities regarding 
the external auditor, the Committee 
reviewed:
 •  the scope of the audit as set out in the external 
auditor’s engagement letter;
 •  the external auditor’s overall work plan;
 •  the external auditor’s fee proposal;
 •  a report from the external auditor describing their 
arrangements to ensure objectivity and to identify, 
report and manage any con#icts of interest; and,
 •  the extent of non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor to ensure that they are not placed 
in a position to audit their own work.
During 2014, services provided by Deloitte and their 
associates to the Group, in addition to acting as 
external auditor, included tax advice in respect of UK 
and overseas income tax, VAT and property tax. The 
Committee believes that it receives particular bene t 
from certain non-audit services being provided by 
the external auditor due to their wide and detailed 
knowledge of the Company and so discretion is used, 
subject to the controls set out above, in obtaining such 
services from Deloitte. 
Where non-audit services are provided, the fees are 
based on the work undertaken and are not success 
related. Consideration is given to the nature of and 
remuneration received for other services provided 
by Deloitte to the Group and con rmation is sought 
from them that the fee payable for the annual audit is 
adequate to enable them to perform their obligations 
in accordance with the scope of the audit. The 
Committee has fully evaluated all non-audit work 
undertaken by Deloitte during the year against its 
policy and remains comfortable that it is appropriate 
and the fees justi ed.
Payments made by the Group for audit and non-audit 
fees for the year are disclosed on page 45
EXTERNAL AUDIT EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee has adopted a formal framework in 
its review of the effectiveness of the external audit 
process which includes a review of the audit partner, 
the audit team, the planning and scope of the audit, 
including identi cation of risks, the execution of the 
audit, the role of the Company and the management 
team in an effective audit process, communications 
by the auditor with the Committee, how the external 
auditor supports the work of the Committee, how 
the audit contributes insights and adds value, and the 
independence and objectivity of the audit  rm and the 
quality of the formal, audit report to shareholders. 
A comprehensive auditor assessment questionnaire 
is completed annually by each member of the 
Committee and the Finance Director. In addition, 
feedback is obtained from members of the senior 
management team, including the Joint Chief 
Executives, and from the wider  nance team. The 
responses are collated and the resulting analysis 
considered by the Committee and any concerns 
are discussed with the external auditor. Every third 
year the external audit partner will meet with the 
Committee Chairman and Finance Director to formally 
discuss the quality of the external audit process using 
this evaluation framework and the outcome of those 
discussions will feed into the audit process for the 
subsequent three years.
The effectiveness of the management 
team’s role in the external audit process 
is assessed principally using the 
following performance measures:
 •  the timely identi cation and resolution of areas of 
accounting judgement; 
 •  the quality and timeliness of papers analysing 
those judgements;
99
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Corporate  Governance  •  the management team’s approach to the value of 
independent audit and the booking of any audit 
adjustments arising; and
 •  the timely provision of draft public documents for 
review by the auditor and the Committee. 
The Committee meets as considered necessary 
with the external auditor without management being 
present.
During the  nancial year under report, the Committee 
gave particular focus to the effectiveness of the audit 
of the Group’s HBI Netherlands transaction, the cash 
box accounting for the share issue and accounting for 
the LTIP .
EXTERNAL AUDITOR APPOINTMENT
Deloitte have been the Group’s external auditor 
since 2006 when the Group prepared its  rst Annual 
Report and Financial Statements. The audit partner 
responsible for the Group’s audit matters is changed 
every  ve years in accordance with the Ethical 
Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. The 
current audit partner is in his second year in of ce. The 
Committee is aware of the emerging requirements for 
listed companies regarding mandatory tendering every 
ten years and has established a tendering policy based 
on these requirements which will apply to the  nancial 
year ending 31 December 2015. 
INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the most signi cant risks faced by the 
Group has been in place throughout the year and 
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. That process, which accords with the 
Turnbull guidance and the Board’s review of that 
process, is set out below. 
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for 
the Group’s system of internal controls, including the 
review of its effectiveness and suitable monitoring 
procedures, in order to safeguard shareholders’ 
investment and the assets of the Group as well as 
the integrity of its accounting records and provide 
reliable information for use within the business and 
for publication. The Directors acknowledge that such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Directors have reviewed, as part of the year-end 
procedures, the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls for the period under review and up to the 
date of this report, the key element of which is a risk 
management process whereby key risks to achieving 
our objectives and strategy as well as related controls 
and monitoring procedures in respect of those risks 
are identi ed in a risk register. The risk register is 
reviewed bi-annually and updated where appropriate 
and reports received from the executive on control 
procedures, and any areas for improvement are 
agreed for subsequent action. The Company’s principal 
risks and uncertainties are reported in the Strategic 
Report on pages 21 - 22  and include the judgements 
and uncertainties used in determining the fair value of 
investment property, #uctuations in foreign exchange 
rates, taxation and the variability of rental income.
This process is supported by:
 •  Management structure   
There is a clear organisational structure with well-
de ned lines of reporting and responsibility.
 •  Financial reporting   
There are reporting disciplines including 
performance monitoring and pro t and cash 
forecasting.
 •  Investment appraisal  
The Group has a clearly de ned framework 
for capital and development expenditure and 
subsequent on-going appraisals.
In addition, the key internal controls include regular 
meetings of the Board and Committee whose overall 
responsibilities are set out above.
During the course of its reviews of the system of 
internal controls, the Board has not identi ed nor been 
advised of any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be signi cant. Therefore a con rmation 
in respect of necessary actions has not been 
considered necessary.

HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Corporate  Governance COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE
The Board has established a Nomination Committee 
(the “Committee”), the majority of members of which 
are independent Non-Executive Directors as required 
by the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code. The 
Committee comprises James Hambro (Chairman), 
Humphrey Price, Richard Cotton, Richard Mully and 
any one of the Joint Chief Executives, Ian Watson 
and Morgan Jones, at any one time. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee is required, in accordance with its 
terms of reference, to meet at least once a year. 
During 2014 the Committee met twice to recommend 
the appointment of Melvyn Egglenton and Rebecca 
Worthington to the Board and to approve the Terms of 
Reference for the coming year.
The full terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, reviewed in 2014, are available on 
the Company’s website www.hansteen.co.uk. 
The terms and conditions of the Non-Executive 
Directors appointments are available for inspection 
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting or at the 
Company’s registered of ce.
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE
The role of the Committee is to keep under review 
the composition of the Board, to plan for its 
refreshment, with regard to balance and structure, 
and to consider issues of succession. 
The Committee is responsible for a number of 
matters relating to the composition of the Board and 
its committees. In particular it is responsible for:
 •  reviewing the structure, size and composition of 
the Board and making recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes required;
 • succession planning for Directors;
 •  identifying and nominating, for Board approval, 
candidates to  ll Board vacancies as and when 
they arise;
 •  reviewing annually the time commitment 
required of Non-Executive Directors; and
 •  making recommendations to the Board regarding 
membership of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees in consultation with the Chairman of 
each Committee.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated 
as part of the internally managed Board evaluation 
exercise undertaken in relation to the year ended 31 
December 2014 and the Committee was found to be 
operating effectively. 
ACTIVITIES DURING 2014 
The Committee’s focus in 2014 was on the 
development of the Board’s succession plan, 
in particular the appointment of two additional 
Non-Executive Directors to join the Board. These 
appointments  ll the vacancy created by Stephen 
Gee’s retirement in 2014 and the forthcoming 
vacancy which will arise when Richard Mully retires 
from the Board at the Annual General Meeting 
in 2015. The Committee engaged the services of 
an external executive search consultancy with no 
prior relationship with the Company, to assist in 
the recruitment process. From an initial list of 31 
candidates put forward and meeting criteria agreed 
by the Committee, a short list of four was drawn up 
based on their level of relevant experience. The four 
candidates on the shortlist were invited to meet me 
and other members of the Board and as a result of 
those discussions we welcomed Melvyn Egglenton 
and Rebecca Worthington to the Board on 10 June 
2014. Both Melvyn and Rebecca strengthen the 
Hansteen board with their breadth of knowledge, 
skills and experience and I look forward to working 
with them both to deliver Hansteen’s strategy. 
As a result of the recommendations of the 
Nomination Committee both Melvyn Egglenton and 
Rebecca Worthington were appointed to the Audit 
Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
In addition the Board accepted the Committee’s 
recommendation to appoint Melvyn Egglenton 
as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in 
succession to Richard Cotton as Chairman of that 
Committee.

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014
Corporate  Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee
1. Annual Statement
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to introduce 
the Report of the Remuneration Committee (the 
“Committee”) for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The primary role of the Committee is to determine 
and recommend to the Board the speci c pay and 
bene ts packages for the Executive Directors, to 
ensure that they are fairly, but responsibly, rewarded 
for their individual contributions to the Group’s overall 
performance. The Committee’s objective is to support 
the business strategy of the Group, to promote the 
Group’s long term success and to align remuneration 
with shareholders’ returns. The Committee also 
administers the Group’s share incentive plans. During 
the year, the Committee carried out the following 
activities:
 •  Review of the achievement of the 2013 annual 
bonus scheme performance measures against 
target;
 •  Review of base salaries for Executive Directors;
 •  Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year ended 31 December 2013;
 •  Review of the  nal outcome of Annual General 
Meeting voting for the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2013 
and consideration of shareholder feedback;
 •  Approval of an award under the Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”) to the Executive Directors 
and members of the Senior Management Team; 
 •  Agreeing the design of, and targets for, the 
annual bonus scheme for the year ending 31 
December 2014; and
 •  Review of the Committee’s terms of reference 
and performance during the year.
PERFORMANCE AND REWARD
The Group’s performance has been excellent, as 
re#ected in a 22% increase in Normalised Income 
Pro t per share; a 41% increase in Normalised Total 
Pro t per share and a 12% increase in EPRA NAV . In 
this context, the Committee is satis ed that the level 
of payment under the annual bonus scheme 
for the Executive Directors is merited (97 .5% of the 
maximum). In respect of PSP awards with a three 
year performance period ending 31 December 2014, 
under which 50% of each award is measured against 
NAV targets and 50% against TSR targets, 100% of 
the NAV part is expected to vest while 0% of the 
TSR part is expected to vest. Base salary increases 
for the Executive Directors were at a level below the 
aggregate increase for employees across the Group. 
POLICY FOR 2015
No changes to the structure of remuneration for 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors were made 
in the year ended 31 December 2014 and none are 
proposed for the year ending 31 December 2015. 
The following report has been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
as amended, and meets the relevant requirements 
of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Report is presented in two main parts – the 
Remuneration Policy Report and the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The Remuneration Policy was 
approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held on 9 June 2014 and it is intended 
that the policy will apply for three years from that 
date.  The Remuneration Committee anticipates 
reviewing the Remuneration Policy in late 2016/
early 2017 and submitting it to the shareholders for 
approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held in 
2017 .  An ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 8 June 2015 
to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration and 
this Annual Statement, both of which are subject to 
an advisory vote.

Corporate  Governance PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
For 2015, each Executive Director will be awarded 
nil-cost share options under the PSP with a value at 
grant of 75% of his base salary. The award will vest 
based on two separate performance conditions: 50% 
will vest by reference to the Group’s TSR ranking and 
50% by reference to the Group’s EPRA Net Asset 
Value ranking, in each case relative to a comparator 
group over a three-year performance period. Awards 
that meet the performance conditions are exercisable 
in three equal annual instalments following the end of 
the performance period.
The comparator group is determined by the 
Committee and comprises a peer group of companies 
in the property sector. When granting awards, the 
Committee reserves the right to vary the constituents 
of the comparator group or take such other actions as 
it considers reasonable in the event that any member 
of the comparator group ceases to exist, or its shares 
cease to be listed in the Of cial List of the London 
Stock Exchange or other recognised stock exchange, 
or it is so changed as to make it, in the opinion of 
the Committee, unsuitable as a member of the 
comparator group. The percentage of the award that 
vests is subject to the following schedule:

SHARE SCHEMES - PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The value included under share schemes is an 
estimate of the value of the PSP awards that will vest 
subject to TSR and NAV performance targets for the 
three year period that ended on 31 December 2014. 
Based on an assessment of performance targets as 
at 27 February 2015, it is estimated that the Group will 
achieve 0% of the TSR ranking and 100% of the NAV 
growth ranking (i.e. a total vesting of 50%).  The value 
of the share awards expected to vest is based on the 
average share price of £1 .04. To the extent that the 
share awards vest, they will be exercisable in three 
equal instalments from June 2015 to June 2017 .
In the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year 
ended 31 December 2013, it was estimated that the 
Group achieved 100% of the TSR ranking and 25% 
of the NAV growth ranking at the time of publishing 
the report. The actual rankings were 88% of the TSR 
ranking and 25% of the NAV growth ranking. The 
share price used to calculate the value of the awards 
in 2013 was £1 .08. The share price on the day that the 
awards vested was £1 .07 . The comparative amounts 
disclosed in the 2013 table above have been restated 
to re#ect these changes to the estimated value.

The share price used to calculate the number 
of shares under each award was determined by 
reference to the average mid-market price of an 
ordinary share of the Company over  ve consecutive 
dealing days immediately preceding the award date. 
The Directors did not exercise any of the vested 
options during the year.
The three-year performance period for the second 
award ended on 31 December 2014.  It is estimated 
that 50% of those share options will vest and are 
exercisable in three equal instalments from June 
2015 to June 2017 , subject to continued employment 
of the Director. The number of share options that are 
exercisable will include a number with an aggregate 
market value, at the date of exercise, equal to the 
value of the dividends that would have accrued 
on those share options being exercised from the 
beginning of the performance period. 
As noted on page 107 , the PSP awards vest based on 
a TSR and NAV growth ranking and 25% of the PSP 
awards vest if the minimum performance threshold is 
met. The performance targets are the same for all the 
awards issued under the PSP to date.
FOUNDER LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
As part of the founder arrangements established at 
IPO in 2005, the Joint Chief Executives are entitled to 
a share award dependent on Company performance. 
Any amount payable under the Founder LTIP is to 
be satis ed in full by the award of ordinary shares of 
the Company. The number of shares awarded under 
the Founder LTIP will depend on the Company’s net 
asset value growth per share (including dividends and 
other returns to shareholders) exceeding a compound 
growth rate of 10% per annum (the “Target NAV”) 
over a de ned three-year period. For the purposes of 
this scheme, net asset value is taken to be the diluted 
net asset value adjusted in accordance with the 
guidelines issued by the European Public Real Estate 
Organisation (“EPRA NAV”). The Committee believes 
that EPRA NAV is the most appropriate methodology 
for calculating NAV but it has the discretion to 
use such other NAV basis as the Committee shall 
determine as appropriate if EPRA NAV is no longer 
reasonably regarded as the appropriate market 
benchmark for the Company. To the extent that EPRA 
NAV per ordinary share (including dividends and other 
returns to shareholders) exceeds the Target NAV per 
110
HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC
Corporate  Governance share, 12.5% of such excess multiplied by the number 
of ordinary shares in issue will be payable to each of 
the Joint Chief Executives as an award. This award 
scheme repeats automatically to reward performance 
over consecutive three-year periods. The current three-
year period commenced on 1 January 2013 and will 
run to 31 December 2015. 
The price per share to be used when determining the 
number of shares which the Joint Chief Executives 
would be entitled to pursuant to the Founder LTIP 
will be the average mid-market quotation for such 
shares on the Main Market for the  rst 20 dealing days 
immediately following the end of the relevant three-
year period. 
D. DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDINGS AND SHARE 
INTERESTS
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
The Company introduced a policy requiring Executive 
Directors to maintain a minimum holding of shares in 
the Company at the 2013 Annual General Meeting. 
Within three years of their appointment, Executive 
Directors are expected to build, and then maintain, a 
holding of shares in the Company equal to one year’s 
base salary. 
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors 
compared to their respective base salaries are: Ian 
Watson - 1090%, Morgan Jones - 1090% and Richard 
Lowes - 268%.

None of the ordinary shares held by Directors have 
performance measures. Ian Watson and Morgan 
Jones each purchased 23,809 shares during the year. 
PSP awards issued are detailed above.
As described on page 110, the Joint Chief Executives 
participate in the Founder LTIP . Provided that the 
performance conditions are met, the number of 
shares that will be issued at the end of the current 
three-year period (31 December 2015) depends on the 
Group’s net asset value growth per share. As a result, 
the number of shares that will be issuable is not yet 
known.

E. PERFORMANCE GRAPH AND TABLE
The following graphs compare the Company’s total 
shareholder return (TSR) to a composite of two FTSE 
Real Estate indices. TSR measures share price growth, 
with dividends deemed to be reinvested on the 
ex-dividend date. Prior to 6 October 2009, the index 
used for comparison is the FTSE All-Share Real Estate 
Investment & Services Index (which up until that point 
the Company would have been a constituent member 
of). From 6 October 2009, the index used 
 
 
for comparison is the FTSE All-Share Real Estate 
Investment Trusts Index, to re#ect the Company’s 
conversion into a REIT with effect from that date. 
These indices have been chosen by the Committee as 
they are considered the most appropriate benchmarks 
against which to assess the relative performance of 
the Company for this purpose. The graphs are based 
on underlying data provided by Thomson Reuters 
Datastream.

Corporate  Governance H. THE COMMITTEE AND ITS ADVISERS
During the year, the Committee was made up of 
Richard Cotton (as Chairman), Richard Mully and, 
from 10 June 2014 onwards, Melvyn Egglenton and 
Rebecca Worthington, all of whom are considered 
independent by the Board, and James Hambro, 
Chairman of the Board, who was considered to be 
independent on his appointment as Chairman. The 
Committee meets regularly, and no less than twice 
a year, and no member of the Committee has any 
personal  nancial interest, other than as a shareholder, 
in the matters decided. Committee members have no 
day-to-day involvement in the running of the Company. 
Details of attendance at meetings can be found in the 
Corporate Governance Report.
The performance of the Committee was assessed 
during the year as part of the internal evaluation of 
the Board and its Committees and was found to be 
operating effectively. The full terms of reference of the 
Remuneration Committee, updated following a review 
undertaken in December 2014, are available on the 
Company’s website at www.hansteen.co.uk.
The Committee seeks external advice to assist it 
where appropriate. The Committee consulted New 
Bridge Street (“NBS”), which is part of AON plc, 
during the year and approved fees to them of £5,000, 
excluding VAT , for independent remuneration advice. 
NBS provided no other service to the Company 
during the year and the Committee is satis ed that 
the advice provided by NBS is both independent and 
objective. NBS is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and abides by its Code of Conduct 
which requires it to provide objective and impartial 
advice. The Committee seeks internal support from 
the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary 
where necessary, and they may all attend Committee 
meetings by invitation, but are not present for 
any discussions that relate directly to their own 
remuneration.
