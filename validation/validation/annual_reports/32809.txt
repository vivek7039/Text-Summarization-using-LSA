TRANSFORMING 
OUR BUSINESS
Chairman’s Report
I am delighted to present the Annual Financial 
Statements of Bushveld Minerals for the year ended 
28 February 2017 . I am particularly pleased to be 
doing this at a transformational point in the 
Company’s development, as we transition from  
a junior exploration company to a producing 
company. Though commodity markets have 
markedly recovered since the lows of 2015/16, 
capital markets remain challenging particularly for 
junior miners for whom access to capital continues 
to be largely constrained. 
We articulated a commodity-focused platform 
strategy in 2014 based on which we would develop 
each of the Company’s three platforms, comprising 
Bushveld Vanadium, Greenhills Resources and 
Lemur Resources, with a view to building each on  
a path to independent existence with dedicated 
resources. At the same time we outlined our 
intention to prioritise vanadium as the flagship of 
the Company. Finally, we outlined four key pillars 
guiding the development of our projects, being (a) 
choosing commodities with a positive market 
outlook; (b) developing assets with a low cost curve 
positioning; (c) executing a clear realisable path to 
production and, thus, cash flows and finally (d) 
ensuring scalability. 
I am pleased to report that the Company has been 
disciplined and consistent in delivering on this 
strategy. Each of the three platforms has made 
strides in realising its objectives. At Lemur 
Resources, the efforts to secure an Independent 
Power Producer licence for the project continue 
apace and we hope that the licence will be agreed 
shortly. I am encouraged to see the prominence  
and attention given to the Lemur Power Project  
by the government, including the Presidency of 
Madagascar at the recent Madagascar Investment 
Conference hosted by the South African Government 
in Pretoria during mid-June 2017 . The power project 
will provide a captive market for the Imaloto Coal 
Project and see the planned project capital 
investment grow from an initial estimate of  
US$16m to over US$200m. 
Meanwhile, the acquisition of a 49.5% interest in the 
Uis Tin Project provides Greenhills with the critical 
mass necessary for a stand-alone tin platform. The 
“ We articulated a commodity-focussed platform 
strategy in 2014 based on which we would 
develop each of the Company’s three platforms, 
comprising Bushveld Vanadium, Greenhills 
Resources and Lemur Resources, with a view  
to building each on a path to independent 
existence with dedicated resources.” 05 
Bushveld Minerals
Annual Report 2017
Financial Statements Administration Governance Business Review
fact that the Uis Tin Project comes with a mining 
licence and a pilot plant that can be refurbished is  
an additional benefit that allows the project path  
to production to be accelerated. Efforts to list the 
Greenhills Resources platform separately are now 
well underway and expected to be completed during 
the next financial year.
It is in the flagship vanadium platform, however,  
that the most progress has been made. Most 
notable is the completion of the acquisition on 
6 April 2017, by Bushveld Vametco Limited (BVL), 
co-owned 45:55 with Yellow Dragon Holdings 
Limited, of the primary vanadium mining and 
processing company, Vametco Alloys (Proprietary) 
Limited. The Company also completed the 
acquisition of the Brits Vanadium Project, the 
development project which potentially hosts a 
significant strike extension of the current Vametco 
mine ore body. The acquisition of Vametco could  
not have been completed at a better time, with 
vanadium prices on a solid upward trajectory. 
Vametco is a quality low-cost producer with a  
sound financial position that has allowed us to use  
a significant amount of debt funding for the 
acquisition. That BVL has been able to pay back all 
the external debt and facilitate a BEE transaction for 
Vametco within three months of the completion of 
the transaction is testament to the strong balance 
sheet and cash-generation capacity of this important 
asset. In acquiring Vametco, BVL has not only 
acquired a quality operating mine and processing 
facility, but a management team with extensive 
experience in the vanadium industry combining 
more than 100 years of industry experience. In 
addition, the management team has worked on 
every one of the primary vanadium-processing 
plants in South Africa.
This intellectual capital will be important as we look 
to grow the combined Bushveld vanadium platform 
from its current 3.5% market share of the global 
vanadium supply to a share projected at more than 
10% in the next three to five years. 
I am also pleased to note the significant progress 
made by Bushveld Energy in establishing the market 
opportunity for vanadium redox flow batteries in 
Africa. Bushveld Energy has established an 
invaluable working relationship with its local partner, 
the Industrial Development Corporation of South 
Africa. Through delivery on our agreed objectives, 
we are on plan to vindicate the IDC’s choice of 
large-scale energy storage as one of the significant 
new industries to support in South Africa. I look 
forward to seeing continued progress on what has 
been achieved to date over the course of the 
coming year.
All this progress is praiseworthy. It happens, 
however, amidst a time of significant uncertainty  
in the global political and economic sphere. The UK 
Brexit vote, US elections and elections in France 
where there was much at stake in terms of the 
future direction of these important economies, all 
contributed to an environment of general political 
and economic uncertainty. In South Africa, 2017 is 
an important year for the African National Congress 
(the country’s ruling political party), which holds its 
congress to elect a new national leader at the end  
of the year. The significance of this lies in the nature 
of South Africa’s constitutional democracy, with the 
party that wins the elections effectively appointing  
the president of the country. We watch this election 
process, one of the most contested in recent years, 
with much interest.
The South African government recently attempted 
to gazette a new Mining Charter, placing greater 
obligations on mining companies. It proposes 
greater representation of historically disadvantaged 
persons in procurement opportunities, shareholding, 
management and the board composition of mining 
companies. The Mining Charter has, however, since 
been suspended pending an outcome of legal 
challenges brought by the South African Chamber  
of Mines. 
An important antidote to this uncertainty, however, 
has to be a sound and functional democratic system 
within which the politics play out. This presents a 
source of confidence in the long-term investment 
case of South African based projects. South Africa 
enjoys a constitutional democratic order that is 
sound and effective and is underpinned by an 
effective independent judiciary and chapter  
9 institutions such as the Public Protector. 
Geology plays a significant part in primary vanadium 
producers’ resource bases. South Africa has the 
largest and best quality primary vanadium resource 
base of any nation. As a consequence Bushveld 
Minerals is well positioned as it develops its 
integrated vanadium platform. Moreover, with over 
90% of its costs being Rand denominated and more 
than 95% of its forecast revenues being foreign-
currency denominated, Bushveld has a natural 
hedge against any potential deterioration of local 
economic conditions, in addition to its already low 
cost curve positioning. 
As the Company continues in its quest to become  
a significant vanadium producer and undertakes the 
listing of Greenhills Resources, it will see the already 
lean management team stretched across the two 
distinct platforms, imposing the need for more 
human capital. Accordingly in the coming year we 
will bolster the management team and the Board to 
ensure that the Company has the requisite capacity 
for the journey ahead, a journey I am delighted to be 
a part of.
I would like to thank our management team for their 
considerable efforts in what has been a challenging 
but exciting time for our Company. The business is 
dependent upon the hard work, dedication and skills 
of all our team. I would in particular like to thank our 
CEO Fortune Mojapelo, who has led the team in an 
exemplary way. Also, to my colleagues on the board, 
I extend my appreciation for their wise council and 
advice that I have received this year.

Business Review
Chief Executive Officer’s Report
It gives me great pleasure to present this annual 
report, following an eventful and indeed 
transformational year for Bushveld Minerals Limited. 
We have continued the disciplined execution of  
our strategy for our three key platforms, Bushveld 
Vanadium, Greenhills Resources and Lemur 
Resources, guided by our four key principles:  
(a) commodity choice with robust market 
fundamentals; (b) attractive cost position; (c) a 
realisable path to production; and (d) scalability.
THE VANADIUM FLAGSHIP
Nowhere are these principles given better 
expression than in the development of Bushveld 
Minerals’ flagship vanadium platform:
• Vanadium – a commodity with a robust and 
growing demand profile amid a constrained and 
concentrated supply environment resulting in a 
sustained structural deficit with no significant 
new supply in the near future;
• With some of the highest primary vanadium 
grade in the world, a low-cost open-cast simple 
mining proposition and access to brownfield 
processing infrastructure that can be acquired at 
a small fraction of its replacement cost, Bushveld 
will be one of the lowest production platforms 
on the vanadium cost curve;
• The participation alongside Yellow Dragon 
Holdings in the acquisition of Vametco gives the 
Company exposure to a production asset with a 
significant share of the global vanadium market 
and with scope to scale up production in future;
• A healthy pipeline of resources and 
complementary processing infrastructure to 
support the Company’s growth aspirations.  
The acquisition of the Brits Vanadium project 
presents significant opportunities to significantly 
increase the Company’s resource base, while the 
existence of several additional brownfield assets 
in South Africa in close proximity to the 
Company’s vanadium deposits creates low cost 
and quicker opportunities for scale up.
Consequently we have crafted a vision to build the 
largest, lowest-cost vertically integrated 
vanadium company.
• The largest primary vanadium platform means 
having the largest high-grade primary vanadium 
resource base and the largest primary vanadium 
production in the world;
Executing on  
our strategy to 
deliver growth
“ The acquisition consideration of US$16.47 
million represents less than 10% of the 
replacement value of Vametco and the strong 
cash flow generating ability of the underlying 
operations enabled the acquisition to be largely 
debt-funded (US$14.0million).”

• The lowest cost means targeting the lowest cost 
position on the vanadium production cost curve, 
leveraging the high in-situ and in-magnetite V

grades and the open-cast mining proposition of 
Bushveld Minerals’ deposits as well as access to 
low-cost brownfield processing infrastructure;
• The most vertically integrated primary vanadium 
platform means development of downstream 
operations beyond production of end-use 
vanadium products to also include development 
and deployment of vanadium applications in 
industries such as the energy storage market, 
where Bushveld intends to manufacture 
vanadium electrolyte and to build large-scale 
vanadium based VRFBs.
THE VAMETCO TRANSACTION
An important part of realising this vision was the 
Company’s 45% participation with Yellow Dragon 
Holdings Limited (55%) in the acquisition, from the 
Evraz Group S.A. of a 78.8% shareholding in Strategic 
Minerals Corporation, the parent company for the 
primary vanadium mining and processing plant  
of Vametco Alloys (Proprietary) Limited.
The transaction, completed on 6 April 2017,  
was completed less than four years since the 
company announced, in November 2013, its focus 
on developing the vanadium platform. Since this 
announcement, we have made significant strides, 
including completing a Scoping Study on the 
Mokopane Vanadium Project in April 2014, followed 
by a Prefeasibility Study delivered in February 2016.
The Vametco vanadium mine is a high-quality, 
low-cost producer with a trademark vanadium 
product and a global vanadium customer base. 
Vametco is one of the cheapest primary producers 
of vanadium in the world. It currently has an 
approximate 3.5% share of global supply capacity 
and provides a solid platform for growing this 
production base. It is intended to leverage its 
processing capacity and broaden its product base  
to include vanadium chemicals, such as VRFB 
electrolyte. Our participation in the acquisition of 
Vametco as described in this report is therefore 
aligned with the Company’s aspirations in the global 
energy storage market by providing capacity for 
potential electrolyte manufacturing.
The Vametco transaction gives impetus to the 
Company’s vision to develop the largest, lowest-cost 
vertically integrated primary vanadium platform in 
the world. The transaction could not have been 
completed at a better time, with vanadium prices 
having staged a strong recovery. Vametco has an 
ungeared financial position and a healthy cash 
generation ability which enabled BVL to fund the 
acquisition largely through debt. US$14 million of 
the US$16.5 million acquisition consideration was 
fully repaid within three months of the completion  
of the transaction.
I am pleased that BVL was able to transfer customer 
contracts from Evraz Group seamlessly within a 
month of completion of the transaction, thanks  
in a large part to our partnership with Wogen 
Resources Limited, which brings decades of 
experience in metals trading, with a global footprint 
and established relationships with several of the 
Vametco customers.
Meanwhile Vametco has been delivering solid 
operational and financial performance. Production 
volumes in 2016 were a solid 2 804MTV, a 16% 
increase on 2015 volumes of 2 419MTV. The volume 
increase and weakening South African exchange rate 
(from ZAR12.75:US$1 in 2015 to ZAR$14.71:US$1) in 
addition to improved operational performance saw 
Vametco improve its already low production costs 
from US$17.23/kgV to US$14.50/kgV. Consequently 
EBITDA performance improved between the two 
years from ZAR15.7 million (US$1.2 million) to 
ZAR47.5 million (US$3.2 million). This performance 
improvement has continued into 2017 supported  
in part by the significant rises in vanadium prices.  
At ZAR85.5 million (US$6.5 million) EBITDA for the 
first half of 2017 is already 80% higher than that of 
the entire 2015. 
Going forward, BVL will leverage the solid Vametco 
platform, its experienced management team and 
the South African base to grow production volumes, 
drive down costs and add new vanadium products 
to its portfolio.
FOUR KEY PRIORITIES
To give effect to this vision we identified four key 
priorities that guide the Company’s action 
programme. I am pleased with the progress the 
Company has made on all of them:
a) Advance Mokopane Vanadium Project
Notwithstanding the growing focus on the Vametco 
mine and processing plant, the Mokopane Vanadium 
Project is an important part of Bushveld’s future 
plans. With a resource of 298Mt, a completed 
Pre-Feasibility Study and a Mining Right under 
application, this project is an important part of our 
vanadium portfolio. The project Pre-feasibility Study, 
completed in February 2016, reported a pre-tax NPV 
and IRR of US$418m and 24% respectively against  
a capital expenditure of US$298 million for a project 
producing 9,525 mtv of 99.8% V
2
O
5
. The 
attractiveness of the project is under-scored by the 
conservative long term average price of US$7.50/lb 
V
2
O
5
 which is conservative relative to vanadium 
prices at the date of this report (US$9.40 mid Metal 
Bulletin, 4 August 2017).
Significant progress was made during the year in our 
efforts to secure a new order mining right, including 
securing environmental authorisation for the 
project. We look forward to finalising the mining 
right and developing the project going forward. 
Efforts to find partnerships for the project are 
continuing. Furthermore, the Company will explore 
opportunities for supplying unprocessed ore or 
concentrate to vanadium-processing facilities 
around the world that are starved of 
vanadium feedstock.
b) Identify and secure quality brownfield 
processing infrastructure
Bushveld’s vanadium deposits are located in  
a mining region with established logistics 
infrastructure and a deep history of beneficiation. 
The Company investigated several opportunities 
and, as mentioned earlier, in 2016 negotiated and 
agreed, in partnership with Yellow Dragon Holdings, 
the purchase of a 78.8% in SMC in April 2017.
Our participation in the acquisition of an operating, 
profitable low-cost producer of vanadium at less 
than 10% of its replacement value is testament to 
the value in this approach. 
The Company continues to explore further 
brownfield opportunities that are in close proximity 
to and are complementary with the Company’s 
vanadium assets. This we will do by leveraging the 
strong technical skills within Bushveld Minerals and 
Vametco. Combining over 100 years of vanadium 
industry experience, the Vametco team has in-depth 
knowledge of vanadium mining, processing 
and marketing. 
c) Support vanadium role in energy storage
The success of VRFBs in the burgeoning global 
energy market is important for the vanadium market 
– growing and diversifying the demand profile of  
a commodity that today is dominated by the steel 
industry with about 90% of vanadium consumption. 
In addition, the energy storage market itself offers  
a compelling commercial proposition for Bushveld 
Minerals. Yet the success of VRFBs must overcome 
two key hurdles: (a) security of supply and (b) 
security of cost of the VRFBs, both of which are 
accentuated by the significant reduction of supply  
in the past 18 months, with no significant new 
capacity in the horizon, as well as the more than 
150% increase in vanadium prices to an 8 year high 
in the past 18 months.
We believe that the answer to these hurdles lies  
in a vertically integrated business model involving 
low-cost vanadium production assets. Bushveld is 
more than ever ideally placed, through its energy 
storage dedicated company Bushveld Energy 
Limited, to play a catalytic role in driving VRFB 
adoption in the global market by effectively 
addressing these two hurdles. This vertically 
integrated model is pursued through smart  
strategic partnerships along the value chain. 
I am pleased that in the review period Bushveld 
added to its strategic relationship with technology 
partner UniEnergy Technologies, a leading US-based 
manufacturer of large-scale VRFBs, by signing a 
Cooperation Agreement with the Industrial 
Development Corporation of South Africa. Bushveld  08
Bushveld Minerals
Annual Report 2017
Business Review
Energy could not have found a better partner in the 
IDC. I am pleased with the positive outcome of the 
two completed studies in respect of VRFBs; these 
now pave the way for pursuing the VRFB 
opportunity further. 
In addition, Bushveld Energy is developing optimal 
sites for large-scale VRFB demonstration systems of 
multiple megawatt hours in South Africa in parallel 
with building up a short-to-medium-term energy 
storage project development backlog across Africa 
to tap into the multi-gigawatt-hour opportunity for 
large-scale energy storage.
I am pleased to note that the benefits of VRFBs are 
increasingly recognised – long life cycle, low levelised 
cost of energy, etc. Bushveld Energy has and 
continues to play a key role in this respect, including 
being an important part of the Vanitec Energy 
Storage Committee, through which the vanadium 
industry cooperates to support the VRFB industry.
d) Consolidate primary vanadium resources
Bushveld Minerals believes the future of vanadium 
supply lies with high-grade primary vanadium 
suppliers. This is underscored by the structural 
challenges faced by vanadium-slag-producing steel 
plants, which account for as much as 64% of 
vanadium feedstock supply and yet whose viability  
is structurally challenged on account of their high 
magnetite iron input costs, high processing costs  
and general lack of influence on the low steel prices 
afflicting their profitability. Nowhere are the 
consequences of these constraints clearer than the 
shutdown of Highveld Steel and Vanadium 
during 2015. 
The Company’s efforts in this regard were focussed 
on completing the acquisition of the Brits Vanadium 
Project, which comprises prospecting rights on 
several farms adjacent to the producing Vametco 
plant. The Company was, as at the reporting date,  
in the process of securing regulatory approval in 
terms of section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum 
Resources Development Act for change of control  
in respect of the acquired Sable Metals & Mining 
Limited’s subsidiaries. Following approval, Bushveld 
Minerals will commence with activities to delineate 
the project’s extensive shallow resource.
UNLOCKING VALUE FROM THE  
OTHER PLATFORMS
While our focus has been on the vanadium platform, 
we will continue to execute a strategy for the other 
two platforms – Greenhills Resources (tin) and 
Lemur (coal and power generation) – aimed at 
crystallising and realising value for our shareholders, 
as outlined in this report. 
• For Greenhills Resources Limited that strategy 
entails consolidating a critical mass of tin 
resource inventory, implementing a pilot 
production programme and exploring options 
for a potential listing of Greenhills Resources.
• For Lemur this entails securing a power purchase 
agreement for a 60MW thermal coal power 
project as well as tying up partnerships with 
financial and EPC (Engineering, Procurement and 
Construction) partners ahead of a potential 
spin-off of Lemur.
Greenhills Resources Limited
Subsequent to the year in review saw Greenhills 
Resources complete the acquisition of a 49% interest 
in Dawnmin, which owns an 85% interest in the Uis  
Tin Project in Namibia. 
With valid mining licences in place and an old 
processing plant (albeit in need of refurbishing), 
Greenhills Resources intends to accelerate this 
project into production. Greenhills Resources’ 
approach to bringing this mine into full-scale 
production includes:
• Mapping out the higher-grade greisened zones 
that are the target for early stage mining;
• Completing the mineralogical and metallurgical 
studies to fine-tune the pilot plant for a 
consistent production phase based on which 
techno-economic parameters for the scaled up 
larger plant can be confirmed;
• Completing the refurbishment of the old pilot 
plant and running it on a consistent basis for 
several months; and
• Confirm the existing Uis Project resources in 
accordance with the JORC standards.
Having achieved a critical mass of tin resource 
inventory, and with a valid mining licence for the Uis 
Tin Project, Greenhills Resources is well positioned 
for life as a stand-alone platform through an IPO on 
AIM in the near term, efforts for which are now 
already underway. This will allow Greenhills 
Resources to attract the dedicated resources 
(financial and human capital) to be successful as an 
African focused tin and associated metals champion. 
Lemur Resources Limited
The past year has seen significant progress in the 
development of Lemur’s Imaloto coal project in 
Madagascar. The Company’s strategy for the 
development of the project involves securing an 
Independent Power Producer licence and a Power 
Purchase Agreement for a thermal coal fired power 
station next to the coal mine, thereby providing a 
captive market for the Imaloto project run-of-mine 
coal. Negotiations with the Madagascar authorities 
regarding the PPA have progressed well during the 
year under review. 
In addition, I am pleased that Lemur signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with Sinohydro, a 
subsidiary of PowerChina, for the development of a 
60MW thermal coal power plant in Madagascar. The 
MoU provides a sound framework for cooperation 
between Lemur and Sinohydro, which has extensive 
experience investing in and developing large-scale 
power projects in Africa. It further provides for 
Sinohydro funding the bankable feasibility for  
the power project, which will provide a ready and 
captive market for the Imaloto coal project. Since 
the signing of this MoU, Lemur has led a delegation 
to Madagascar intended, among other things, to  
help identify the optimal site for the power plant. 
Meanwhile, Lemur has also engaged the services

represent Lemur in our engagement with Sinohydro, 
Jirama (the Madagascar national power utility) and 
external funders for the project, undertake several 
studies that form a part of the bankable feasibility 
study for power project and ensure that all 
environmental studies are done to internationally 
accepted standards. 
The development of the Imaloto project, including 
the mine and the power plant, will see the region 
receiving new infrastructure and stable energy 
access. Thousands of new jobs will be created, over 
US$1 billion in new government revenue will be 
generated and approximately US$300 million in new 
investment in the country will be achieved. The 
design and location of the project are such that it will 
immediately increase the country’s power supply by 
15% and be able to scale up to supply more power to 
new electricity users in the region in the longer term. 
GENERAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
The economic environment for mining and South 
Africa in particular remains a challenging one. 
Uncertainty relating to the new Mining Charter 
presents risks to Bushveld’s South African operations, 
as does the overall political uncertainty prevailing in 
South Africa. We note, however, that political 
uncertainty is as much a global phenomenon as it is 
South African. Our assets are of a high quality and 
their export proposition, coupled with a local cost 
base, present a natural hedge against any adverse 
developments in the local economy.
A proactive strategy in dealing with various 
stakeholders is essential. Bushveld and its operating 
subsidiaries are well positioned to address issues 
with respect to stakeholder engagement at all major 
levels of government, communities and employees. 
Bushveld’s transaction in support of a new Black 
Economic Empowerment partner for Vametco, 
Jaxson 640 (Proprietary) Limited (“Jaxson”), in terms 
of which Bushveld provided loan financing of 
approximately US$1 million for Jaxson to buy out  
the previous BEE shareholders in Vametco Holdings 
is an example of this proactive approach. As a 
consequence of this transaction, the local 
landowners and affected communities’ shareholding 
in Vametco increased from 3.75% to about 12%.
Bushveld Minerals continues to make strides in 
developing its projects across all its three platforms 
in spite of the constrained operating environment. 
FINANCIAL REPORT
As mentioned elsewhere in this report, the most 
significant transaction during the current financial 
year was the Company’s participation in the 
Vametco acquisition by Bushveld Vametco Limited, 
which was completed post year end. The strong cash 
flow generating ability of the underlying operations 
enabled the acquisition to be largely debt-funded 
(US$14.0 million). BVL’s equity component of 
US$2.47 million was settled in two parts, US$1.65 
million during the current financial year, with a 
further US$0.82 million settled post year-end upon 
completion of the acquisition in April 2017 . 
Total cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of 
the financial year amounted to £478,619. During the 
current financial year Bushveld raised approximately 
£3.4 million from three separate capital raisings,  
as well as various warrant-for-share conversions by 
shareholders. The cash raised from these capital 
raises were largely used to pursue the Company’s 
participation in the Vametco acquisition, plus 
associated due diligence and other expenditures,  
as well as settling all of our obligations (principal  
and interest) to Darwin Strategic. The Directors 
maintained tight discipline over cash operating 
expenses, which decreased by 10% from the 
previous financial year to approximately £1.4 million.
 
During the current financial year the Company’s cash 
resources have materially been applied as shown in 
the table below:

THE YEAR AHEAD
In the year ahead Bushveld will continue to execute 
on its stated strategy, focusing on:
• Working with Yellow Dragon Holdings to grow 
Vametco’s production volumes and exploring 
further brownfield opportunities complementary 
to the Company’s vanadium assets. 
• In addition, Bushveld Energy will work with its 
VRFB technology partners to unlock the 
potential for vanadium electrolyte production 
within the global energy storage market; 
• Unlocking value in its Madagascar coal project 
through securing an IPP licence and continuing 
the feasibility studies on a 60MW thermal coal 
power project; 
• Completing the listing of Greenhills Resources 
and thus establishing an AIM-listed dedicated 
African tin champion well placed to consolidate 
quality tin assets in Africa; and
• Growing our human capital base to meet the 
growing demands of a growing company. I look 
forward to building on our existing team and 
introducing more senior-level leadership in the 
areas of operations, investor relations and 
project development. At the same time, the 
Company will look to further strengthen the 
board of directors to ensure it is well suited to 
provide the kind of oversight and support 
required by management.
CONCLUSION
The year under review has been an eventful and 
transformational one underscored by BVL’s 
acquisition of the Vametco primary vanadium mine 
and processing plant. This has reflected in a 641% 
surge in the Company’s share price from 1.53p to 
9.80p between 1 August 2016 and 31 July 2017.  
The re-rate to a market capitalisation of more than 
£78 million at the beginning of August 2017 reflects 
our on-going transformation into a portfolio that 
includes a mining operation with access to cash 
flows and a potential for further returns to our 
shareholders. Notably during the same period, 
Bushveld shareholders suffered only a modest 
dilution as a consequence of the Company’s capital 
raising, increasing its issued shares from 591.6 million 
to 806.6 million. We believe there is significant 
growth yet to be realised as we execute on 
our strategy. 
The BVL acquisition was not without its challenges; 
not least initially looking to raise financing that, at 
the time of the agreement execution, was more than 
Bushveld’s market capitalisation and during a 
challenging capital raising environment for junior 
mining companies. Bushveld Minerals and its 
strategic partner in BVL, Yellow Dragon Holdings, are 
grateful to Wogen Resources Limited and the Barak 
Fund, who believed in our proposition and provided 
the needed financing to complete the transaction. 
I am thankful for the support of the entire Bushveld 
Minerals team for continuing to show incredible 
commitment to the Company. I am also thankful for 
the support of the Board and most importantly of 
our shareholders. I believe Bushveld Minerals is at  
a critical transformational point in its story and look 
forward to the next chapter in its development.
We are excited about what the future holds as we 
continue on our journey to build the world’s largest, 
lowest cost and most vertically integrated 
vanadium platform.

Business Review
Business Model
Bushveld Minerals’ approach to project development rests on four key principles, all of which are critical to 
success. The approach recognises the need for commodities with sound economic outlook, projects with a  
low cost proposition and a clear path to production (and thus generating cash flows) while possessing scalability 
attributes. This philosophy is core to the Company’s strategy in developing projects and is encapsulated below:
A clear model 
for long-term 
growth
AN IDENTIFIED PATH  
TO PRODUCTION
3
The path to production is, in part, a function  
of project capital requirements and complexity 
of development. We look to develop projects 
where we have visibility to production and  
cash flow generation. 
We therefore target brownfield processing 
assets that can be acquired at a fraction of  
their replacement cost, or develop greenfield 
projects that have a low up-front capex and  
are scalable. 
SCALABILITY
4
Scale, combined with the other three criteria, 
will allow for a multiplier of exit value to be 
achieved. It also places our projects on the 
radar of major industry participants, creating 
significant opportunities for partnerships  
and/or outright sale.
THE RIGHT  
COMMODITY
1
We adopt a rigorous approach in analysing 
market dynamics for each of our chosen 
commodities to understand industry structure, 
current and future supply/demand balance  
and implications for the underlying price.
Our preferred commodities are those that are 
in, or have the potential of, a structural deficit 
and therefore have a positive price outlook.
LOW COST  
CURVE POSITION
2
A low cost curve position acts as a natural 
hedge against commodity price fluctuation, 
ensuring healthy average margins and 
protection against price downswings.
We prefer projects or assets that show 
potential for first or second quartile  
cost positioning. 11

The vanadium market is characterised 
by a structural deficit, supported by 
robust demand anchored in the steel 
market with further upside impetus 
derived from the growing energy 
storage market.
Supply is both concentrated and 
constrained, shrinking by >15% 
between 2015 and 2017, with limited 
new production on the horizon. This 
has resulted in a >150% increase in 
vanadium prices since their nadir in 
January 2016.
Bushveld’s vanadium assets offer a 
low cost proposition due to the high 
in-situ grades, open-cast mining 
methodology and access to existing 
brownfield processing infrastructure.
BVL’s Vametco operation has the 
lowest all-in production cost of any 
primary vanadium producer. 
The acquisition of Vametco Alloys  
by BVL post year end, a primary 
vanadium mining and processing 
plant, at less than 10% of its 
replacement cost, allowed the 
Company to accelerate its path to 
production achieving production 
within four years of announcing its 
focus on a vanadium platform.
Bushveld’s large resources base  
and exploration upside, combined 
with complementary brownfield 
assets available in the market, offer 
opportunities to significantly scale  
up production from its current level  
of 3.5% of global market share.
The potential for VRFBs in the  
energy storage market could also 
provide further significant scalability 
of this platform.

The tin market has been in deficit  
for the past five years. Demand is 
anchored in the electronics industry 
where tin is used as solder while 
supply is generally constrained,  
with few new development projects 
on the horizon. 
Greenhills Resources’ tin assets  
are typically open-cast propositions 
whose metallurgy is generally 
amenable to simple gravity-based 
processing with good recoveries. 
Tin processing plants can be built in 
small, modular and scalable format, 
which allows for modest initial capex 
requirements. The Uis project in 
Namibia already has a mining license 
with an old pilot processing plant 
which, when refurbished, will provide 
proof-of-concept tin concentrate 
production. 
Greenhill Resources’s tin assets 
provide a critical mass of mineable 
deposits that will form the basis  
for its scale-up plans.
In power-starved Madagascar, coal 
offers the best and quickest solution 
for low-cost power generation.  
The country therefore has a captive 
market for the Imaloto coal project, 
one of only three coal assets in 
Madagascar, and the only one that has 
been granted an exploitation licence.
By adding the downstream thermal 
coal power generation project (initial 
capacity of 60MW), the integrated 
project is set to deliver power at a 
competitive rate, cheaper than most 
other sources of power in Madagascar.
The power project has modest 
estimated capex of ~US$200m.  
Its development will be enabled  
in partnership with Sinohydro, a 
subsidiary of PowerChina (a major 
Chinese SOE with experience  
and expertise in power project 
development in Africa). The granting 
of a PPA licence with the Madagascar 
power utility, and offtake agreements 
with several industrial users, are key 
enablers to access project financing, 
including developmental financing.
The power project will be a major 
catalyst for economic development  
in southern Madagascar, which can  
in turn be expected to support further 
demand for power. 
The project is designed to be scalable 
through addition of further units up  
to > 100 MW capacity.
Scope to export coal to other markets, 
once infrastructure is in place, provides 
additional upside to the project.

Resources
Bushveld Minerals’ resources base comprises:
a) The Mokopane Vanadium Project in Limpopo 
Province, with a 298Mt JORC resource;
b) The Brits Vanadium Project in Brits, North West 
Province, which contains strike extensions of the 
Vametco mine and whose resource quantum is 
yet to be determined;
c) A 45% interest in the majority owner of Vametco 
in Brits, North West Province, which is a primary 
vanadium mining and processing company with 
a 136Mt JORC resource.
Together, the three deposits constitute the largest 
primary vanadium resource base globally, with a 
434Mt JORC resource base, including 66Mt of JORC 
reserves. The resource vanadium grades are some  
of the highest primary grades in the world with over 
2.0% V
2
O

 (in magnetite). These high-grade deposits 
are located on the Bushveld complex, which is host 
to the world’s largest primary vanadium resources.
Processing 
Bushveld Minerals intends to build its core 
processing capacity around brownfield processing 
infrastructure in close proximity to its primary 
vanadium resources. The attraction of brownfield 
processing facilities lies in the potential for 
significant reductions in capital expenditure  
and lead-time to achieve production. 
Vametco primary vanadium mine and processing 
plant is a low-cost vanadium producing operation 
supplying more than 3.5% of the global vanadium 
market. It is only but one of the attractive vanadium 
brownfield targets the Company has identified.  
Post year end BVL completed the acquisition of 
Strategic Minerals Corporation, which owns 78.8% 
of Vametco’s parent company, Vametco Holdings 
(Proprietary) Limited. Bushveld Minerals owns a  
45% interest in SMC’s acquiring vehicle, Bushveld 
Vametco Limited. 
The Company continues to search for and evaluate 
complementary brownfield processing facilities  
in close proximity to its current resources. 
Bushveld Energy
Developing a fully integrated vanadium platform 
allows Bushveld Minerals to consider other 
vanadium application opportunities. In this context, 
Bushveld Minerals has identified the fast-growing 
energy storage market as a key and attractive 
downstream industry where vanadium-based 
large-scale battery systems have the potential to 
take a significant share of the energy storage 
market. According to our research, some experts 
consider the overall energy storage market could 
grow to as large as US$350 billion by 2030. 
Bushveld Minerals has accordingly established 
Bushveld Energy Limited to capture a share of this 
attractive market.

THE PROJECTS
Mokopane Vanadium Project
The Mokopane Vanadium Project is a key part  
of Bushveld Minerals’ vanadium strategy. The 
project comprises one of the world’s largest primary 
vanadium resources as well as high in-situ (1.4%)  
and in-concentrate (1.75%) V
2
O

 grades. 
Location
The project is located on the central portion of the 
northern limb of the Bushveld Complex, the second 
largest host of vanadium resources in the world.  
The project is in the Mokopane District of Limpopo 
Province, approximately 65km west of Polokwane. 
 
Licensing
The Mokopane Vanadium Project has a prospecting 
right (LP95PR), which incorporates five farms, these 
being Vogelstruisfontein 765 LR, Vriesland 781 LR, 
Vliegekraal 783 LR, Schoonoord 786 LR and Bellevue 
808 LR. The Project’s mineral prospecting right 
covers several minerals including iron ore, vanadium 
and titanium. An application for a Mining Right  
was lodged in March 2015 and is currently still being 
processed by South Africa’s Department of Minerals 
Resources. In September 2016, Bushveld Minerals 
was granted an Integrated Environmental 
Authorisation by the South African Mineral 
Resources Department in terms of section 24 L  
of the National Environmental Management Act  
(Act 107 of 1998) for the project.
The Environmental Impact Assessment was 
compiled as part of the Mining Right Application 
submitted on 12 March 2015. The next step in the 
application process is the approval of the Company’s 
mine works programme and social and labour plan 
which will pave the way for the granting of the 
Mining Right.
Geology & Resources 
The Mokopane Vanadium Project deposit is a 
layered ore body along a 5.5km north-south strike at 
a dip of between 18° to 22° to the west. The Project 
comprises three adjacent and parallel magnetite 
layers namely the Main Magnetite Layer (“MML”), 
the Main Magnetite Layer Hanging Wall layer 
(“MML-HW”) and the AB Zone. The project has 
298Mt (JORC) reserves and resources, across three 
parallel overlying magnetite layers – the MML, the 
MML Hanging Wall and the AB Zone, with grades 
ranging from 1.6% to over 2% V

 product. The study yielded a pre-tax NPV  
of US$418 million and a pre-tax IRR of 24%  
after a capital expenditure of US$298 million. 
Bushveld Minerals believes the Mokopane 
Vanadium Project is robust enough to advance to a 
bankable feasibility study. The Company continues 
to evaluate the potential to bring the asset into 
production in the most cost efficient manner 
possible. The intention remains to develop the 
project with a strategic partner at an appropriate 
point in the near future. 
Vametco Alloys (Proprietary) Limited 
Bushveld Minerals has an interest in Vametco 
through its 45% shareholding in Bushveld Vametco

VANADIUM INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
The vanadium market is characterised by a 
robust and growing demand profile and a 
constrained and concentrated supply. Vanadium 
supply has seen significant reductions in the past 
24 months resulting in a significant structural 
deficit projected to continue for the foreseeable 
future. This structural deficit has resulted in 
vanadium prices increasing from a low of 
US$13.55/kgV in January 2016 to US$23.60/kgV 
in December 2016. This price improvement has 
continued through 2017 , with prices currently 
averaging in excess of US$40/kgV. Vametco 
achieved an average price of $18/kgV during 
2016, which rose to an average of US$27/kgV for 
the first six calendar months of 2017 . 
Vanadium demand prospects look attractive. 
Approximately 90% of vanadium demand is still 
anchored in the steel industry, where growing 
intensity of use is expected driven primarily by 
greater enforcement of standards in China 
requiring higher-grade rebar (which requires 
greater amounts of vanadium). Meanwhile, 
reported growth in vanadium demand includes 
increased usage in non-ferrous alloys (consuming 
4.5% of vanadium output) and the chemical 
industry (consuming 3.5%). The most significant 
driver of vanadium demand is expected to come 
from the energy storage sector. Industry 
estimates envisage vanadium flow batteries’ 
share of vanadium consumption growing from 
approximately 1% in 2014, to 3% in 2016 and on 
to approximately 20% by 2030.
Vanadium supply, on the other hand, is 
significantly constrained. The closure of Evraz 
Highveld Steel and Vanadium’s plant and 
Mapochs mine, as well as the suspension of 
operations at Vanchem in 2016, removed more 
than 15% of vanadium supply from the market 
and left the Vametco mine and Glencore’s 
Rhovan operation as the only South African 
producers of vanadium, significantly contributing 
to the current global strain in vanadium feedstock. 
The bulk of the supply feedstock in China comes 
from steel plants that process low-grade 
vanadium-bearing magnetite ores to produce steel 
and a vanadium slag which is then further 
processed through a process similar to the primary 
production processes – salt roast and leach 
operations. This source of vanadium is also 
significantly constrained on account of:
a) High input costs as a result of mining and 
processing low-grade captive ores, relative  
to the higher-quality and low-cost seaborne 
haematite ore;
b) High processing costs of complex steel plants 
that have to be designed for extraction of 
titanium and vanadium resulting in operating 
costs that are significantly higher than  
simple blast furnace operations processing 
haematite ore;
c) No leverage on steel prices as a consequence  
of the small share of steel production that  
the high-cost vanadium and titanium bearing 
magnetite ore processing steel plants have.
As a consequence, these plants are under 
enormous economic pressure, with some resorting 
to blending their ores with cheaper and higher-
quality hematite ores (that contain no vanadium) 
resulting in further supply reductions. Meanwhile 
any new meaningful supply will requires higher 
vanadium prices to be sustained, and even then, 
there are limited new projects with the required 
vanadium grade to be economic for primary 
vanadium processing. However, persistent higher 
vanadium prices will likely provide an incentive  
for some suppliers to start producing vanadium, 
notably stone coal miners in China which host 
sedimentary style vanadium deposits. These 
operations, though, pose substantial 
environmental threats, which threaten the 
feasibility of bringing additional supply onto 
the market.  16

Projects Overview 
continued
Revenue performance saw improvements largely  
on the back of production and vanadium price 
improvements. Vametco experienced difficult 
trading conditions during the first half of 2016,  
with depressed vanadium prices, but these 
improved markedly in the second half of 2016. Since 
early 2016 vanadium prices (as published by Metal 
Bulletin) have been on the increase, rising from a low 
of US$13.55/kgV in January 2016 to US$23.60/kgV  
in December 2016. This price improvement has 
continued into the first half of 2017 , with an average 
price for the period of US$27.71/kgV. This has 
reflected in increased revenues, although this 
increase has been tempered by a strengthening 
exchange rate, with the South African Rand 
strengthening from ZAR14.71 to the US dollar in 
2016 to ZAR13.22 in the first half of 2017. 
Supply shortages are expected to continue driving 
vanadium prices higher. By the end of July 2017 , 
above US$44/kgV prices were being reported by 
Metalbulletin in Europe and in China the prices were 
passing US$50/kgV.
Vametco’s total cash production costs of US$14.50/
kgV (equivalent US$3.55/lb V
2
O

) during the year 
ended 31 December 2016 were among the lowest  
in the world, partly driven by increasing production 
by the 16% increase in production volumes, thus 
placing Vametco in the bottom quartile of the 
international vanadium production cost curve. 
During the first half of 2017 cash costs (excluding 
selling expenses) have increased by only 7% over  
the 2016 financial year, a testimony to management 
initiatives focusing on tight cost control over all 
major components of the production value chain. 
Earnings before interest, depreciation and tax for 
the year 2016 was ZAR47.5 million (in large part  
due to the low average vanadium prices realised), 
reflecting a 203% improvement from ZAR15.7 
million in 2015. During the first half of 2017, this has 
grown to ZAR85.5 million, an 80% increase (260% on 
an annualised basis).
VAMETCO ALLOYS
Vametco is an integrated mining and processing 
plant situated 8km to the north-east of Brits in the 
North West Province of the Republic of South Africa. 
Vametco owns the new order minerals rights for 
vanadium and other associated minerals over 
Portion 1 of the farm Uitvalgrond 431 JQ and Portion 
1 of the farm Krokodilkraal 426 JQ in Brits. Vametco 
operates an open pit mine supplying ore to its 
vanadium processing plant located on the 
same properties. 
Resource & Mining
The processing plant at Vametco is fed ore from  
the co-located Vametco mine. The Vametco mine  
is an open pit mine along a 3.5km strike running  
west to east and dipping at between 14° and 20°  
in a northerly direction. The mineral resource is 
estimated to be 136Mt (JORC) with average grades 
of 2.10% V

 in magnetite. This includes ore 
reserves of 27Mt (JORC) which have been shown to 
have some of the highest in-magnetite vanadium 
pentoxide (V
2
O
5
) grades in the world, averaging 
2.55% V
2
O

 in magnetite. 
The ore reserves are sufficient to support the 
operations for 24 years at current production levels. 
Reserves and resources are based on the April 2016 
completed competent person’s report (prepared by 
VBKom). Scope exists to increase the reserve base by 
targeted exploration of the inferred resources.
 
Processing
Vametco employs the standard salt roast and leach 
process to produce a trademark vanadium carbon 
nitride (VCN) product called Nitrovan
™
. The process 
comprises the following stages:
• STEP 1: Crushing, Milling and Magnetic 
Separation to produce a magnetite concentrate 
with average grades of approximately 2.0% V
2
O
5
;
• STEP 2: Salt roasting of concentrate involving 
roasting of the concentrate with sodium salts in  
a kiln at approximately 1,200 oC to form a water 
soluble sodium vanadate material;
• STEP 3: Leaching and purification involving 
dissolution of roasted vanadium concentrate in 
water, purification and precipitation of vanadium 
through the addition of ammonium sulphate 
followed by drying and rotary calcining in a 
reducing environment to produce a modified 
vanadium oxide product;
• STEP 4: Nitrovan
™
 production – the modified 
vanadium oxide is briquetted and fed into  
an induction shaft furnace under a nitrogen 
atmosphere to produce Nitrovan
™
.
Vametco has a current annual plant capacity of 
approximately 3,000MTV in the form of Nitrovan
™
,  
a patented vanadium product used in the steel 
industry and modified vanadium oxide (“MVO”  
or “V
2
O
3
”). In 2015, Vametco produced 2,419  
metric tonnes of Nitrovan
™
 and MVO from its own 
magnetite concentrate production. Production grew 
during 2016 by 16% to 2,804MTV, reflecting a 3.7% 
share of global production. The first half of 2017  
saw production levels similar to 2016 with 1,441MTV 
produced. Vametco has commenced a multi-phased 
expansion project to increase annual production  
to more than 5,000MTV over the next three to  
five years.  17

PROJECT OVERVIEW – BUSHVELD ENERGY
Bushveld Energy is an 84% held subsidiary of 
Bushveld Minerals Limited, established to 
participate in the large and growing commercially 
attractive global energy storage market through 
vanadium-based utility-scale batteries. In 2014 
Bushveld Minerals identified the utility-scale energy 
storage applications of vanadium based redox flow 
batteries as presenting a significant commercial 
proposition as well as potential opportunity to 
support and diversify the vanadium demand profile.
The energy storage market is fast growing and 
forecast to reach US$350 billion by 2030. Of this 
market, the VRFBs are well positioned to take a 
significant share of the stationary energy storage 
market, on account of unique features that give 
them an edge in large-scale, stationary and long 
duration energy storage applications. 
Bushveld Minerals is targeting 1,000MWh of energy 
storage capacity by 2020 focused in Africa with 
revenue potential in excess of US$500 million.  
The business has a technical partner in UniEnergy 
Technologies (“UET”), a U.S. firm that manufactures 
VRFBs and a financial partner in the Industrial 
Development Corporation of South Africa to 
determine the economic viability of VRFB use  
and manufacture in South Africa.
Key to capturing this market opportunity is 
overcoming two hurdles in the development  
of VRFBs – security of supply and stability of 
vanadium costs:
• Security of supply
 A 1GWh VRFB system requires approximately 
5,000 metric tons of vanadium-in-electrolyte 
– more than 6% of current annual global 
vanadium consumption. With industry experts 
forecasting as much as 34GWh in energy storage 
requirements by 2025, a mere 10% market  
share of this industry for the VRFBs would 
require more than 15,000MTV, equivalent  
to approximately 19% of 2016’s total global 
vanadium production. To date, the amount  
of vanadium deployed into VRFBs is growing 
exponentially. Accordingly, the ability to 
guarantee supply of vanadium for VRFBs  
will be key to the success of these systems. 
Bushveld can mitigate this risk through its large, 
high-grade, low-cost resource base and scalable 
processing capacity. 
• Stability of vanadium costs
 Vanadium makes up 30-40% of the cost of  
a VRFB system. Sustainable adoption of VRFBs 
thus depends on the relative and absolute 
vanadium price. Bushveld can insulate VRFBs 
from price volatility, as it is a low-cost producer 
with significant production capacity and  
can guarantee supply at fixed prices for  
a longer period. 
Bushveld believes that the key to capturing this 
opportunity lies in a vertically integrated vanadium 
business model that provides both upstream and 
downstream enablers for the success of VRFBs in the 
global energy storage industry:
• Upstream: Bushveld Energy’s efforts are focused 
on solving the security of supply and cost of 
vanadium input into VRFBs through Bushveld’s 
upstream vanadium mining and processing 
operations. Given vanadium makes up between 
30% and 40% of the total cost of a VRFB system, 
and in the constrained vanadium supply outlook, 
the ability to solve these two risks and secure 
supply and low cost for the vanadium inputs  
is critical to the success of the VRFB systems  
in the global energy storage market. 
• Downstream: Bushveld Energy will provide 
market development capacity to secure 
megawatt scale opportunities for energy 
storage, localisation of vanadium input costs 
through further beneficiation into vanadium 
electrolyte, VRFB assembly and ultimately VRFB 
manufacturing in South Africa. This is important 
as energy markets are highly structured and 
heavily regulated, requiring a concerted effort 
targeting multiple stakeholders to build a market 
opportunity for VRFBs at the scale that provides 
critical mass for the VRFB industry. The awarding 
of a 200MW/800MWh tender to Rongke Power 
in Dalian peninsular in China (over multiple sites) 
is typical of the sort of opportunities that 
Bushveld Energy seeks to develop. In this regard, 
Bushveld Energy has assembled and is growing  
a team of energy professionals that combine 
deep expertise and experience in the targeted 
utility-scale energy storage market, and is thus 
well placed to unlock market opportunities  
for VRFBs. 
VRFBs have several features that make them 
ideal for utility scale, stationary energy  
storage applications:
a) Lifespan cycles – able to charge and 
discharge repeatedly (>35,000 times) 
giving it a long (>20 years) lifespan;
b) Capacity for 100% discharge without 
performance degradation is unique;
c) Capacity to store large quantities of 
energy and scalable up into the 
MW-range;
d) Very fast response time (<70kms);
e) Only one battery element – therefore no 
cross-contamination – unique among 
flow batteries; and
f) 100% of vanadium is reusable upon 
decommissioning of the system.

Business Review
• Building a bankable financial model for the 
processing facility;
• Identifying potential South African and 
international partners to jointly develop and 
operate the facility.
In addition, optimal sites for a large-scale VRFB 
demonstration system of multiple megawatt hours 
are being developed in South Africa. Bushveld 
Energy is doing this in parallel with building up  
a short-to-medium-term energy storage project 
pipeline to tap into the multi gigawatt-hour 
opportunity for large-scale energy storage  
afforded by the development backlog across Africa.
Management
Bushveld Energy’s management and advisory  
team combines technical expertise, business 
acumen and mineral beneficiation experience.  
The team combines:
• Executive-level experience in mining and power 
industries, including managing national utility 
power stations and pumped storage schemes;
• Senior strategy and policy experience in power 
sectors across Africa;
• Renewable generation and energy storage 
acumen including testing of utility scale battery 
applications;
• Extensive geological and metallurgical 
development expertise. 
Partnerships
Smart partnerships along the value chain ensure 
that operating capacity and intellectual property  
can be developed quickly. Bushveld Minerals has  
the following existing partnerships:
Uni Energy Technologies – In April 2016, Bushveld 
Energy signed a MoU with UET, a US based 
manufacturer of turn-key, large and medium-scale 
energy storage systems for utility, micro-grid, 
commercial and industrial, and other applications. 
The core of the UET system is an advanced 
vanadium redox flow battery, with breakthrough 
electrolyte, state-of-the-art containerised design, 
mature large-scale stacks, and optimised power 
electronics and controls. The MoU with UET 
provides a platform for collaboration with a credible 
technology partner that not only has a strong track 
record in the technology development of VRFBs  
but is also a commercial manufacturer of quality 
VRFB systems. 
 
Industrial Development Corporation – In June 2016, 
Bushveld Energy signed a cooperation agreement 
with South Africa’s national development finance 
institution, the Industrial Development Corporation. 
The partnership is focused on jointly determining 
the economic viability of vanadium redox flow 
batteries for use and manufacture in South Africa. 
As a leading primary vanadium producer and 
exporter, South Africa serves as the logical base  
for VRFB manufacturing. 
The IDC has committed ZAR14 billion in support of 
renewable energy projects in the past five years and 
it has prioritised energy storage as one of the eight 
most attractive new industries in terms of financial 
and developmental returns. The IDC also has 
important stakeholder linkages with the South 
African government, regulators and utilities and 
other key players that are necessary to provide  
a catalytic stimulus for the energy storage industry 
as they have for the renewable industry to date. 
As part of the cooperation agreement signed 
between Bushveld Energy and the IDC, the parties 
have completed two important studies in respect of 
VRFBs: a study for the market potential of VRFBs and 
vanadium electrolyte, and a techno-economic study 
of vanadium electrolyte in South Africa. 
Market study for VRFBs in the  
African market
The market study confirmed attractive African 
demand for VRFBs and global demand for vanadium 
electrolyte. It showed that the three main uses for 
VRFBs in Africa are expected to be energy-intensive 
storage applications requiring locational flexibility. 
These are (in order of magnitude) mini/micro-grids 
(focusing on six-hour storage duration systems), 
decentralised power grid applications and regular 
grid storage (focusing on four-hour storage duration 
systems). It also showed that, at present, the 
vanadium electrolyte supply industry is heavily 
concentrated in China; moreover, whilst smaller 
production capacity exists in Europe and North 
America, there is none in the southern hemisphere 
or Africa / Middle East, regions of direct interest  
to Bushveld Energy.
Techno-economic study for the local 
manufacturing of vanadium electrolyte  
for the global VRFB market
The techno-economic study focused on a 
production facility of at least 200MWh in annual 
production. It would have the flexibility to double 
production and also adjust the manufacturing 
process to cater for electrolyte formulations with 
varying acids and vanadium molarity levels. Initial 
estimates show highly favourable internal rates of 
return at globally competitive electrolyte pricing, 
and these are being detailed via a financial model. 
The largest cost driver for electrolyte production is 
operating expenses, of which over 85% are reagent 
costs, primarily vanadium. This confirmed the 
essential need for local, cost-effective and reliable 
supply of vanadium as the critical factor to 
electrolyte production.
Based on the highly favourable findings and 
recommendations of the techno-economic study, 
both Bushveld Energy and the IDC have decided to 
pursue this opportunity further by:
• Studying possible locations within South Africa 
for the electrolyte production facility, taking into 
account environmental requirements, logistics 
costs, ability to in-stream with existing vanadium 
processing and government incentives;

Industry overview 
The energy storage market can be divided into 
mobile applications and stationary applications. 
While mobile applications have enjoyed the bulk  
of the energy storage market share, stationary 
applications, particularly in utility-scale applications 
are growing and are expected to claim a significant 
share of the overall energy storage market. In this 
market, the vanadium redox flow batteries are  
well positioned to take a significant share of the 
stationary energy storage market, on account  
of unique features that give them an edge in 
large-scale, stationary and long duration energy 
storage applications. 
The stationary energy storage (ESS) market has 
continued to grow exponentially in the past few 
years and can well be considered to be at a tipping 
point. While market forecasts vary significantly,  
all experts concur that the market is set for 
exponential growth.
Citigroup estimates that the energy storage  
market will be greater than US$350 billion by 2030. 
According to the Energy Storage Association,  
the US market alone grew by 280MW in 2016 and  
is expected to reach nearly 500MW in 2017 and  
over 1,600MW by 2020. the deployment of energy 
storage systems through 2017 looks set for 
exponential growth. In 2017 , Navigant expects the 
global market to grow 47% from the already record 
breaking year in 2016, when roughly 900MW of new 
ESS capacity was deployed. Through 2020 Navigant 
forecasts over 5GW of new ESS to be deployed  
in emerging markets across all sectors and a 
compound annual growth rate of 50 per cent. 
 
The ESS market is also expanding into long duration 
systems, which prioritise energy (watt hours) over 
power (watts). This trend is especially favourable  
to VRFBs, which become especially cost-effective  
at higher energy configurations, usually from four 
hours of duration and up. Although lithium ion 
technology currently dominates the ESS market 
globally, deployment of large VRFBs is also 
increasing. The largest ESS installed in 2015 was  
a 15MW/60MWh VRFB by Sumitomo in Japan.  
The largest ESS expected for 2017 deployment  
is the 100MW/400MWh phase I of Rongke Energy’s 
VRFB in China.
Despite this growth in large ESS, Bushveld Energy 
expects the market for ESS to eventually focus on 
2MW-10MW-sized systems with four hour duration. 
Such battery sizes are ideal for utilites that plan to 
use all the capabilities of ESS, including its location 
benefits within a distribution network. This would 
also allow utilites to “stack” revenues and benefits 
from ESS, increasing the absolute amount of ESS 
needed within increasingly smarter and more 
resilient grids. Such sizes also ideally suit grid-
connected commercial and industrial electricity 
customers looking to either reduce their electricity 
costs or stabilise price increases for the future. 
Off-grid and island ESS installations, often paired 
with solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, are also 
expected to be of similar size and configuration.  
This market is especially large for Africa due to  
low penetration of transmission and distribution 
networks that leaves most inhabitants and 
businesses without grid-supplied electricity access.

The Tin Projects
The Mokopane Tin Project
The Mokopane Tin Project comprises prospecting 
rights over five farms on the northern limb of the 
Bushveld Complex, where four tin mineralisation 
targets have been identified. A fifth target is on  
an additional licence, which is the subject of the 
Company’s prospecting right application. The five 
targets are all in close proximity to each other and 
comprise open-cast tin deposits hosted in granites. 
The mineralisation is disseminated cassiterite hosted 
in granite rocks of the Bushveld Complex, and is 
easily beneficiated using gravity-based methods 
such as spirals and shaking tables. Metallurgical 
test-work has demonstrated good recoveries  
in excess of 70% for a concentrate grade of  
74.59% SnO
2
. 
The two deposits combine a total resource of  
18,447 tons of contained tin, made up as follows:
• Groenfontein deposit (at a 0.1% Sn cut-off) with 
5,995 tons of contained tin comprising mineral 
resources of 3,095,000 tons at 0.15% Sn (4,792 
tons contained tin, Measured and Indicated) and 
898,000 tons at 0.13% Sn (1,203 tons contained 
tin, Inferred).
• Zaaiplaats Deposit (at a 0.07% Sn cut-off) with 
12,452 tons contained tin comprising mineral 
resources of 1,231,000 tons at 0.09% (1,110 tons 
contained tin, Indicated) and 10,503,000 tons at 
0.108 % Sn (11,342 tons contained tin, Inferred). 
A scoping study was completed in August 2014 
confirming a base case production scenario of 
691,000 tons run-of-mine processed into 1,380 tons 
per annum of 51.4% Sn concentrate, which would be 
smelted to produce approximately 700tpa of 99.5% 
Sn metal. The base case produced a pre-tax NPV  
of US$18 million and a pre-tax IRR of 49.8% with  
a payback period of two years from commissioning 
at a capital spend of US$16.7 million. Unit cash 
operating costs were estimated at US$14,276/mt 
against a forecast tin price of US$22,928/mt Sn. 
Should the project only produce a concentrate 
product, the operating costs would be US$6,902 per 
ton of Sn concentrate (equivalent to US$13,482 per 
ton Sn metal contained) and the capex would be 
reduced to US$16.6 million.
In June 2016, Bushveld Minerals presented the 
results from pilot-scale metallurgical test work and 
plant design at its Groenfontein Tin Deposit. The 
Groenfontein test work was intended to assess tin 
recovery on a plant-scale, gain insight into potential 
concentrate grades, and fine-tune plant flowsheet 
design parameters. The results of the test work 
included expected recovery using gravity 
concentration of over 70% for grind sizes of -1mm 
and achieved commercial concentrate grade of 
74.59% SnO
2
 (cassiterite – equivalent to 58.75% Sn).
A flowsheet was developed for gravity separation, 
with crushing and screening and rod-milling 
to -1mm. Run-of-mine material will be concentrated 
via spirals and shaking tables to maximise recovery 
and SnO
2
 concentrate grade. The plant design 
envisages a 164,160 tpa operation producing up  
to 510 tons per annum SnO
2
.
In November 2016, Greenhills and VBKom 
(Proprietary) Limited (“VBKom”) agreed an MoU for 
the joint development of the Mokopane Tin Project. 
VBKom is a South African specialist consulting 
company operating primarily in the mining industry. 
The company was established in 2008 with 
extensive experience and specialist knowledge in 
mining engineering, geology, mineral processing, 
industrial engineering and project management.
Under the terms of the MoU, VBKom committed to 
conduct due diligence on the Mokopane Tin Project 
for a period up to 31 January 2017, following which 
the parties would enter into binding agreements  
for the provision of capital and technical support  
to develop the Mokopane Tin Project. Under the 
terms of the MoU VBKom could earn an equity 
participation in the project, not exceeding 50%.  
At the time of compiling this report, Greenhills  
and VBKoM were still in discussions regarding  
an optimal project development strategy.
TIN PLATFORM OVERVIEW
Greenhills Resources represents Bushveld 
Minerals’ tin platform containing a pan-African 
portfolio of low-cost open-cast deposits in 
historically tin producing regions, with a 
near-term production profile. The three assets 
in the portfolio are the Uis Tin Project in 
Namibia and the Mokopane and Marble Hall 
Tin Projects, both located in South Africa. 
Greenhills Resources is an attractive 
stand-alone platform with quality strategic 
partners and a strong dedicated management 
team to deliver long-term shareholder value. 
Greenhills Resources aims to capitalise on  
the solid supply/demand fundamentals of tin 
by developing a critical mass of tin resource 
inventory and achieving production in the near 
term and further scaling up production by 
consolidating tin assets in Africa.

Marble Hall Tin Project
The Marble Hall Tin Project comprises a prospecting 
right over four farms surrounding the Vlakfontein  
tin mine in Limpopo province, South Africa. An 
application to extend the prospecting area to  
include the additional portions of the identified 
mineralisation is yet to be finalised. The project 
hosts mineralisation in 1-8m thick gently dipping 
breccia. Historical drilling work sourced from Gold 
Fields Ltd includes 60 boreholes, which intersected 
significant mineralisation at relatively shallow depths 
of over 200m and recorded grades of 1.27% SnO
2
 
over 5m, 0.47% SnO
2
 over 2m and 0.53% SnO
2
 over 
3m. A potential (non-JORC) resource of 3.75Mt at 
0.32% SnO
2
, representing 12,000 tons of contained 
tin, was calculated historically but the project was 
not pursued by Gold Fields. 
The Uis Tin Project
In December 2016, Bushveld Minerals agreed terms 
to acquire a significant interest in the Uis Tin Project 
in Namibia through its wholly owned subsidiary, 
Greenhills Resources. In terms of this transaction, 
completed in April 2017 , Greenhills Resources 
purchased a 49.5% interest in Dawnmin Africa 
Investments Ltd from a consortium of Namibian 
shareholders. Erongo Tin Ltd (“Erongo”) holds the 
balance of Dawnmin shares. Dawnmin’s interest in 
the Project is held through its 85% shareholding of 
Guinea Fowl Investments 27 (Pty) Ltd (“Guinea 
Fowl”), while the remaining 15% shareholding is  
held by the Small Miners of Uis, a Namibian 
Government entity. The acquisition positions 
Greenhills Resources as a significant tin platform. 
The acquisition also provided for Erongo, the 
majority shareholder in Dawnmin, to invest up to 
A$2.0 million towards a scoping study, including the 
acquisition of processing equipment where deemed 
appropriate by the Board and technical team of 
Dawnmin. While Erongo will hold an initial majority 
interest in Dawnmin, it has agreed to grant 
Greenhills Resources an ever-green option to 
acquire a controlling interest in Dawnmin through 
the acquisition of an additional 1% interest in 
Dawnmin for a total consideration of US$1.2 million;
The Uis Tin Project is one of the largest undeveloped 
open-cast hard rock tin deposits in the world and 
has a history of significant tin production. The 
project is located in the Erongo Region of Namibia 
and comprises three mining licences: ML 134, ML 
129 and ML 133. Historic work suggests potentially 
significant tin resources on these licences, the 
largest of which is a historical estimate (non-JORC) 
of 70.3Mt at 0.14% Sn for a total potential resource 
of over 90,000 of contained tin within ML 134. In 
addition to this, ML 134 also contains the old Three 
Aloes Mine which is known to have produced 
tantalum concentrate in the past. ML 133 contains 
the old Nainais Tin-Tan Mine and ML 129 hosts the 
C1 and B1 pegmatites, which have small surface 
workings created by artisanal miners. 
During its due diligence on the Uis Project, 
Greenhills’s technical team identified large 
mineralised pegmatite ore bodies with localised 
samples of >0.3% Sn commonly found in greisenised 
zones. Greenhills estimated that these greisenised 
zones could host as much 20,000 tons of contained 
tin. Greenhills also found that the old existing plant 
at Uis could be refurbished for an initial 10tph pilot 
scale production of tin concentrate while geological 
work was undertaken to confirm a JORC compliant 
resource in support of feasibility studies towards 
larger scale production. Finally, Greenhills also 
identified the potential to increase plant feed grade 
through various ore sorting methods and targeting 
potential higher grade zones. These findings form 
the basis for the work carried out by Erongo 
pursuant to the completion of the Greenhills 
acquisition of a 49.5% interest in Dawnmin Africa 
Investment Limited described above.
The following work has been completed to date  
by Erongo Tin, the controlling shareholder of the  
Uis Tin Project:
1. Detailed geological mapping of eight previously 
mined pits at the Uis Tin Project within ML134 
(containing over twelve pegmatite bodies) to 
characterise and delineate the higher-grade 
greisenised portions of the ore-body. An 
exploration target of more than 20,000 tons  
of contained tin will be the focus of further work 
(including drilling).
2. Grab sampling of pegmatites in the various 
licences (ML129, ML133 and ML134), with tin 
grades of over 0.6% Sn reported and numerous 
samples with over 0.3% Sn.
3. Size grading analysis of pegmatite from the  
V1/V2 pit within licence ML134 (containing the 
largest pegmatite body identified thus far), 
which shows that much of the cassiterite (SnO
2
) 
is coarse and may be liberated as relatively large 
particle sizes (over 250 µm), and that 
classification of the ore into various size fractions 
could improve recovery efficiency in the plant.
4. Dense Media Separation (DMS) tests which 
showed that clean, saleable concentrate grades 
are achievable via a single stage of DMS, and that 
excellent separation occurs at a density of 2.90 
and at coarse size fractions of -6 mm, with 
recoveries of over 70% achievable. 
The results of this work will inform the exploration 
programme at the Uis Project, with the aim to drill 
and define a JORC-compliant resource. An existing 
pilot plant at the Uis Mine is currently being used to 
test gravity separation using jigs, spirals and shaking 
tables, with over 2 tons of cassiterite concentrate 
produced thus far. The size grading analysis results 
will help to improve the flowsheet at the plant  
and to further optimise recoveries at a pilot-scale. 
Additionally, the DMS results have indicated the 
suitability of DMS as a recovery method for the Uis 
cassiterite, and the intent is to incorporate a DMS 
plant into the pilot plant and to run this plant on  
a continuous basis, aimed at demonstrating the 
techno-economic parameters for a larger plant. 
TIN INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
Tin was the second best performing metal in 
2016. A tin industry forecast by BMI Research  
in the same year indicated an increase in tin  
prices from US$17,500/t to US$19,500/t in 2017. 
BMI Research also predicts an increase to 
US$22,000/t by the year 2020. According to  
BMI Research high global demand for the metal 
amidst limited production growth will lead the 
market into a deficit, expected to deepen to 
9,400t by 2020 by when they predict prices  
could reach US$22,000/t.
The growing demand for tin is led by the 
construction and consumer electronics sectors, 
mainly in leading emerging markets including 
China, Taiwan, South Korea and in the US. Such 
demand is expected to keep the market tight in 
support of prices. These countries are leading 
global electronic producers and consumers for 
consumer electronics in which tin is used 
extensively as solder. The International Tin 
Research Institute (ITRI) believes that a potential 
opportunity exists for the use of tin in energy  
storage, which could further support the 
long-term growth of the tin industry.
The tin market is supported by strong 
fundamentals, with increasing demand and strong 
prices supported by a supply deficit that is 
expected to continue into the foreseeable future. 24

Business Review
The Imaloto project is located in the Sakoa Basin in 
south-west of Madagascar. It has a total of 136Mt 
JORC compliant mineral resource (2012), of which 
92Mt is measured. A valuation study completed in 
2014 showed a positive NPV (10% real discount rate) 
of US$36 million for an operation with a capacity  
of up to 1.5Mtpa with a 19-year mine life and initial 
capex of US$12 million. In addition, Lemur has two 
exploration permits covering a combined 87.5km
2
  
in close proximity to the Imaloto project. 
Since 2008, Lemur has invested approximately 
US$10 million on developing the project. From  
a geographical location and development phase 
perspective, the Imaloto Power Project is perfectly 
positioned to address the persistent power supply 
challenges that Madagascar faces as a country – 
especially in the least developed southern region. 
The Imaloto project is located in an area of 
Madagascar that is far from the country’s hydro 
power stations (located in the north) and is in need 
of power both for the inhabitants and an emerging 
number of mining operations. The southern region 
currently does not have a power grid and is almost 
entirely electrified by isolated generators (“Gen 
Sets”), with a combined capacity of no more  
than 20MW. 
Therefore, not only will the initial revised 60MW 
capacity of the Imaloto Power Project substantially 
increase generation capacity, it will create a 
southern power grid and provide a reliable source  
of high quality electricity for residential and 
commercial offtakers, at tariffs that are substantially 
lower than the current Gen Set tariffs, which retail 
for up to US$0.25/kWh.
Our studies to date indicate that the Imaloto Power 
Project tariffs will be more aligned with international 
benchmark tariffs of newly-built power plants in the 
Sub-Saharan African region.
Lemur’s strategy for the development of the project 
involves securing an Independent Power Producer 
(IPP) Concession and a Power Purchase Agreement 
(PPA) for a thermal coal fired power station next to 
the coal mine thereby providing a captive market for 
the Imaloto project run-of-mine coal. The company 
is in discussions with the Madagascar authorities 
regarding the Concession. 
After concluding an MoU with Jiro Sy Rano Malagasy 
(JIRAMA), the national power utility, the company 
has been in discussions with JIRAMA since 2012 
regarding a PPA, which will allow the next stage in 
the development of the project to be implemented 
as an integrated mine to power and transmission 
project, providing a captive market for its coal 
resource and unlocking the intrinsic value in the 
underlying project. 
Apart from JIRAMA, Lemur is simultaneously in 
discussions with various private mining and 
industrial companies for potential power off-take  
for the power plant. 
In 2013, the company completed the following 
technical studies:
• Pre-feasibility Study for a 45MW power plant; 
• Pre-feasibility Study for a 200km transmission line;
• Scoping study for the coal mine (following the 
completion of a full drilling programme).
In March 2017 , the company finalised an MOU  
with Sinohydro, to cooperate on a technical and, 
potentially, financial basis. Under the terms  
of the MoU: 
• shall complete the bankable feasibility study 
(BFS) for both a revised 60MW power plant and a 
200km transmission line on behalf of Lemur; 
• Sinohydro will be the Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction (EPC) and Operations and 
Maintenance (O&M) partner;
• The parties will explore debt financing and 
equity participation options with Sinohydro  
as well as with other Chinese funders.
Pursuant to the signing of the MoU with Sinohydro,  
a delegation of PowerChina’s technical team 
(consisting of 13 engineers from PowerChina and 
Sinohydro) undertook a site visit in May 2017 to, 
among other things, investigate the potential site for 
the power plant. The site visit marked the final stages 
of work before the commencement of the BFS and 
subsequent construction phase, which is subject to 
financial close and currently expected within the next 
18 months.

PROJECT OVERVIEW –  
COAL & POWER
Lemur Resources Limited is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Bushveld Minerals and is the 
Company’s coal and power platform. The 
Company’s flagship project is the Imaloto coal 
mine which is located in the southwest of 
Madagascar and has four exploration permits 
and one mining and exploitation permit 
covering a total area of approximately 81.25 
square kilometres. Lemur has the only coal 
mining exploitation licence in the country.  
In 2012, Lemur took the decision to expand  
the scope of the project from coal mining only 
to include a 45MW coal power plant and a new 
200km transmission line, developed in parallel 
as one of Madagascar’s leading independent 
power producers. 25 
Bushveld Minerals

Financial Statements Administration Governance Business Review
Furthermore, Lemur is in discussions to appoint  
an Owner Engineering team to guide the various 
studies that constitute part of the BFS for the  
power project to be jointly funded with Sinohydro. 
On the mining side, the company is in discussions 
with a number of mining and mine services 
companies regarding strategic partnerships  
in contract mining and coal processing services.
Lemur has also started discussions with potential 
domestic industrial offtakers of coal. The company 
expects the coal supply offtakes to commence 
before the power plant starts operations,  
thus providing early cash inflows and revenue 
diversification over the life of the project.
Finally, Lemur has initiated preliminary project 
finance discussions with financial institutions,  
which it will progress upon the successful 
completion of a favourable BFS by Sinohydro. 
Overall, the plant commissioning date is expected  
in 2020/21, subject to approvals and financial close 
on approximately US$200 million of funding.
COAL INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
The coal price performed exceptionally well  
in 2016 following a 5-year long decline period, 
reaching an all-time low in Q1 of 2016. Prices 
improved by 29% in October 2016 and later 
rebounded by as much as 100% in less than  
a year. The Energy Information Administration 
(EIA), together with the World Bank, predicted  
a slight increase in coal prices for 2017 due  
to demand outweighing supply. 
The fact that the Imaloto Project is specifically 
tailored to supply a mine-mouth power plant 
means that it is insulated from the volatility  
of world coal prices. Notwithstanding this, in 
addition to supplying domestic coal customers 
at cost-reflective prices, Lemur will keep an 
option to export some of its thermal from time 
to time, depending on favourable global market 
coal prices and favourable logistics costs.
Coal has been the driver of baseload power 
production for many years and the continent 
continues to tap into the resource for 
development purposes. The Brics New 
Development Bank and the African 
Development Bank both advocate for the 
development of coal-based power generation  
as a priority for development. 
The Madagascan Government has developed  
a Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), aimed at 
improving the country’s economy and fighting 
against poverty. The goals for the MAP are highly 
reliant on the power sector, which is currently 
facing major challenges. Electricity demand in 
Madagascar has increased by 5%  
per annum over the last 20 years. In 2015, the 
country’s electrification fulfilled only 15% of the 
national electricity requirements. Madagascar’s 
power sector is in dire need of improved 
distribution and transmission capacity. 
Electricity challenges in the country have 
resulted in an undesirable business 
environment, despite the country’s high 
resource potential and opportunities.
The development of Lemur’s Imaloto project 
including the mine and the power plant will see 
the region earning new infrastructure and stable 
energy access, thousands of new jobs created, 
over US$1 billion in new government revenue 
and approximately US$300 million in new 
investment in the country. The design and 
location of the project are such that it will 
immediately increase power supply by 15%  
in the country and be able to supply up to  
1GW of power to new electricity users in  
the region in the long term. 
OTHER RELATED PROJECTS
The PQ Iron & Titanium Project
The PQ Iron & Titanium Project (“PQ Project”) 
is a multi-commodity project based on the 
same licence as the Mokopane Vanadium 
Project, located 45km north-northwest of 
Mokopane town in Limpopo Province, South 
Africa. The PQ Project has a JORC compliant 
resource of 939Mt with an average grade of 
31% Fe and 14% TiO₂. The project boasts some 
of the highest in-magnetite grades of titanium 
in the world and could be developed as a 
titanium and pig iron project in the long run 
depending on the development of methods  
for processing the ore that are less capital 
intensive. To this end, the Company is following 
with interest the metallurgical processing 
approaches used for similar deposits and 
exploring partnerships with technology 
partners. No further work is planned on the 
project at this stage.
The PQ Phosphate Project
The PQ Phosphate Project immediately 
overlies the iron ore and titanium resource  
of the PQ Project. The Company reported on 
3 June 2014 a maiden phosphate resource 
statement for the PQ deposit of 442Mt,  
with average phosphate grades of 3.6% P₂O₅. 
Although the grades are low, the PQ Phosphate 
deposit is in the immediate hanging wall of the 
PQ Project and would be mined concurrently 
with the stripping of the latter. Of particular 
interest is the 37% P₂O₅ concentrate grade 
achievable with this deposit.
Progress to date has been limited to 
understanding the economic parameters 
necessary for success and how the project can 
be configured in line with the Company’s 
approach of developing projects. No further 
work is planned on this project while the 
Company advances its vanadium platform.

Business Review
Principal Risks
In order to manage the risks that are inherent in the exploration and development of our natural 
resource projects, we have conducted a detailed analysis, together with mitigation measures. 
The risks and uncertainties that are described below are the material risk factors which could 
impact our ability to deliver on our long-term strategic objectives. As such, we have put 
significant efforts into analysing these risks and put in place initiatives to manage them.
Risk
Mineral rights and tenure security
Obtaining and maintaining mineral prospecting and mining rights
How we mitigate the risks that impact us 
Secure mineral title on all our projects is of primary importance to Bushveld Minerals. The Company has a dedicated mineral rights tenure manager responsible  
to ensure that its mineral rights are in good standing.
The two key threats to mineral title security the Company proactively manages are political risk and regulatory compliance.
a) Political risk
Discussions on increased revenue realisation by the state in the form of imposition of increased taxes and increased role of government in the sector remain  
topical in South Africa and Madagascar, as in many other African countries.
While no such action has been implemented in the two countries in which we operate to date, we believe that governments will continue to recognise the  
importance of a viable minerals and energy sector to the prosperity of all and the duty to uphold all aspects of the constitution, including the protection of  
private property ownership.
b) Regulatory compliance
i) Black Economic Empowerment (BEE)/Community partnerships
South Africa and Madagascar have robust World Bank compliant mineral laws underpinned by the respective constitutions and independent functioning  
judiciary systems. 
The following are examples of regulatory compliance risks Bushveld Minerals management manages:
 – BEE partnerships: The South African Mining Charter requires economic participation in mining projects by historically disadvantaged South Africans. The Mining 
Charter outlines several metrics spanning equity participation, management representation and preferential procurement, among others. Bushveld Minerals is in 
full compliance with the Mining Charter on all its active projects.
 – Community involvement: Beyond the equity participation of the BEE partners in our projects, Bushveld Minerals continues to pursue a broad-based approach to 
empowerment and social responsibility. The Company proactively engages with its BEE partners and communities to realise the objectives of the Mining Charter 
in a sustainable manner.
ii) Environmental and safety legislation
Bushveld Minerals regularly monitors the environmental and safety legislation particularly in relation to reclamation, disposal of waste products, protection  
of wildlife and other environmental protection issues, to ensure compliance and that the Company is well-versed with various potential legislative amendments. 
Management also adopts a proactive approach to integrate processes and procedures pertaining to sustainable development into project development plans. 27

Risk
Infrastructure
Dependence on local utilities and logistics infrastructure
How we mitigate the risks that impact us 
South Africa continues to realise the benefits of significantly increased investment in the country’s power generation capacity. We expect this positive trend  
to continue into the medium term. 
A number of multi-national mining companies operate successfully in the Bushveld Complex using the existing road and rail infrastructure network. It is widely 
recognised that further investment is required in the rail network to optimise the South African and Madagascan railway network and ports to create sufficient 
capacity to effectively transport minerals in the volumes anticipated.
The need to provide adequate support to Madagascar’s increasing energy demand is central to Lemur Resources’ independent power production strategy  
in the country.
Risk 
Funding
Raising capital to fund project development
How we mitigate the risks that impact us
The state of capital markets remains challenging in an environment particularly characterised by limited mine/project acquisitions and substantially low investment 
in new projects. This has had a direct impact on mining companies’ ability to raise capital. Bushveld Minerals continues to be as innovative as possible in raising 
capital as typified by the successful acquisition of Lemur Resources which provided access to a significant balance sheet as well as the recently announced proposed 
acquisition of Vametco’s mining and processing operations. The Vametco acquisition will give the Company access to a cash flow producing operation within a short 
time frame and substantially reduced future capital investment requirements.
Bushveld Minerals will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop strategic partnerships that have the potential to provide alternative sources of funding for  
its projects.
Risk
Human Resources
Retention of skilled personnel
How we mitigate the risks that impact us
The Company is aware of the potential impact of losing a key member of the team. Bushveld Minerals has over the years attracted a highly experienced team with 
multi-disciplinary skills who all share our long-term vision. The Company’s remuneration structure has been recently modified to ensure the management team  
will share in the successes of the Company and that limited pressure is placed on the Company’s cash resources, as is the case with other companies our size. 
Management and the Board believe this will assist in the Company’s ability to retain key skills. 28

The Directors who were in office on the date of approval of these financial statements have confirmed that, as far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditor is unaware. Each of the Directors has confirmed that they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors  
in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that it has been communicated to the auditor.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Guernsey company law requires the Directors to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. The Directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”).
 
The financial statements of the Group are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs at the end of the financial year and of the 
profit or loss of the Group and are required by IFRS as adopted by the EU to fairly present the financial position performance of the Group. 
The Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that year. 
 
In preparing the Group financial statements, the Directors are required to:
i. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
ii. make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
iii. state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU; and
iv. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions, disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group, and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with applicable law. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website. Legislation in Guernsey 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm they have discharged their responsibilities as noted above. 33

As an AIM-quoted company, Bushveld is not required to produce a corporate governance report that satisfies the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code. However, the Directors are committed to providing information on a transparent basis as far as is relevant for a company of this size and nature.
The key elements of the Group’s corporate governance are as follows:
• The Group Board will conduct a review (at least annually) of the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls. A review should cover all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems. The review will also incorporate an analysis of the regulatory 
and fiscal position in the countries in which the Group operates. 
• The roles of chairman and chief executive are not to be exercised by the same individual. 
• The Group has two independent Non-executive Directors and the Group Board is not to be dominated by one person or group of people. 
• All Directors will be submitted for re-election at regular intervals subject to continued satisfactory performance. The Group Board will ensure planned and 
progressive refreshing of the Group Board.
The Directors make no statement of compliance with the Code overall and do not explain in any detail aspects of the Code with which they do not comply.

The Group Board has taken professional international tax advice as to maintaining the tax residency of the Company in Guernsey. The Company is managed and 
centrally controlled in Guernsey. All Group Board meetings are held outside the UK.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE  
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and comprises exclusively Non-executive Directors, Ian Watson (Chairman) and Jeremy Friedlander. The Chief 
Financial Officer, Geoff Sproule, attends Audit Committee meetings by invitation. This committee is responsible for:
• reviewing the annual financial statements and interim reports prior to approval, focusing on changes in accounting policies and practices, major judgemental 
areas, significant audit adjustments, going concern and compliance with accounting standards, stock exchange and legal requirements; 
• receiving and considering reports on internal financial controls, including reports from the auditors and reporting their findings to the Board; 
• considering the appointment of the auditors and their remuneration including reviewing and monitoring their independence and objectivity;

OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
We have audited the group financial statements on pages 36 to 57 . The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
In our opinion, the financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 28 February 2017 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
• are in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• comply with the requirements of The Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER – GOING CONCERN
In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in the accounting policies on 
page 41 of the financial statements concerning the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Group incurred a loss for the year ended 28 February 2017 of 
£1,720,067 . Further funds will be required to finance the Group’s working capital requirements and development of the Group’s assets. These conditions, along with 
the other matters explained on page 41 of the financial statements, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a 
going concern. 
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements arising from the requirements of International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at http://www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where The Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
• we have failed to obtain all the information and explanations which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, are necessary for the purposes of our audit.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As more fully explained in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 32, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
We read the other financial and non-financial information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any 
material inconsistency with the financial statements or with knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit, or any material misstatement of fact 
within the other information. We also read the information in the directors’ report and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any material 
inconsistency with the financial statements.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 262 of The Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

2. ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS
Accounting standards adopted during the year
New standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations to existing standards effective in 2016, with their dates of adoption adopted by the Group 
and brief description:
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 
2014–2016 Cycle* 
1 January 2017 & 
1 January 2018
The improvements in this amendment clarify the requirements of IFRSs and eliminate 
inconsistencies within and between standards, including clarification of the scope of IFRS 12.
Amendments to IAS 12: Recognition  
of Deferred Tax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses* 
1 January 2017 Clarifies deferred tax on unrealised losses generated by debt instruments carried at fair value. 
Amendments to IAS 7: 
Disclosure Initiative*
1 January 2017 The amendments clarify and improve information provided to users of financial statements about 
changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. 
* not yet endorsed by the EU.
Following the adoption of these standards there has been no change to the Group accounting policies and there has been no material impact on the financial 
statements of the Group.
Accounting standards and interpretations not applied
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group:
Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification 
and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions*
1 January 2018 Amendments to provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting 
conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments, share-based payment 
transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations, and a modification  
to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the 
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. 
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions 
and Advance Consideration*
1 January 2018 Provides requirements about which exchange rate to use in reporting foreign currency 
transactions (such as revenue transactions) when payment is made or received in advance. 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018 Replacement to IAS 39, built on a logical, single classification and measurement approach for 
financial assets which reflects both the business model in which they are operated and their cash 
flow characteristics. Also addresses the so-called “own credit” issue and includes an improved 
hedge accounting model to better link the economics of risk management with its accounting 
treatment. It is a change from incurred to expected loss model.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts  
with Customers (IFRS 15 clarifications 
not EU-endorsed)
1 January 2018 Introduces requirements for companies to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or 
services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects  
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Also results in enhanced disclosure about 
revenue and provides or improves guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed 
comprehensively and for multiple-element arrangements.
IFRS 16 Leases* 1 January 2019 The new standard recognises a leased asset and a lease liability for almost all leases and requires 
them to be accounted for in a consistent manner. This introduces a single lessee accounting model 
and eliminates the previous distinction between an operating lease and a finance lease. 
* not yet endorsed by the EU.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group, subject to any future business combinations. 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards and 
Interpretations (collectively “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) as adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRS”), and are in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. Historical cost is 
generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Going concern 
The directors have considered the current financial position of the Group and the likely future cash flows for the period of 12 months following the approval of these 
financial statements in preparing the 2017 financial statements. Further funds will be required to finance the Group’s working capital requirements and development 
of the Group’s assets. If cash flow from existing sources was not sufficient to meet the Group’s commitments the Directors are confident that additional funds would  
be successfully raised from other sources. However, there are no binding agreements in place to date. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty 
which may cast significant doubt about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if 
the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.  42

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has  
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully 
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values  
of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred 
includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest  
in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured  
to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When 
necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies.
Disposal of subsidiaries
When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying 
amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, 
joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the 
Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified  
to profit or loss.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling shareholders that present 
ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of the net assets upon liquidation are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes 
in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Associates
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the 
voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at 
cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s 
investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive 
income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses  
in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has 
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent 
to share of profit/(loss) of associates in the income statement.
Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements 
only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment  
of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement. 43

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-
maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the steering committee that makes 
strategic decisions.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentational currency
The individual financial statements of each Group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate (its functional 
currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in Pound Sterling, which 
is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where  
items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates  
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income 
as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are 
presented in the income statement within “finance income or costs”. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement.
Group companies 
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different 
from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet;
b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative 
effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Finance income
Interest revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest 
revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax charge is based on taxable profit for the year. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and  
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the “balance sheet liability” method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable  
profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to  
the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based upon rates enacted and substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items credited or charged to other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in  
other comprehensive income.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets
All costs associated with mineral exploration and evaluation including the costs of acquiring prospecting licences; mineral production licences and annual licences 
fees; rights to explore; topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies; exploratory drilling; trenching, sampling and activities to evaluate the 
technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource; are capitalised as intangible exploration and evaluation assets and subsequently 
measured at cost.
If an exploration project is successful, the related expenditures will be transferred at cost to property, plant and equipment and amortised over the estimated life  
of the commercial ore reserves on a unit of production basis (with this charge being taken through profit or loss). Where a project does not lead to the discovery of 
commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and is relinquished, abandoned, or is considered to be of no further commercial value to the Group, the related 
costs are recognised in profit or loss.
The recoverability of deferred exploration costs is dependent upon the discovery of economically viable ore reserves, the ability of the Group to obtain necessary 
financing to complete the development of ore reserves and future profitable production or proceeds from the extraction or disposal thereof. 44

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets 
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the asset is reviewed for impairment. Assets are 
also reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date in accordance with IFRS 6. An asset’s carrying value is written down to its estimated recoverable amount 
(being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use) if that is less than the asset’s carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment review is undertaken when indicators of impairment arise but typically when one of the following circumstances applies:
• unexpected geological occurrences that render the resources uneconomic; or
• title to the asset is compromised; or
• variations in mineral prices that render the project uneconomic; or
• variations in the foreign currency rates; or
• the Group determines that it no longer wishes to continue to evaluate or develop the field.
Warrants
The warrants issued by the Company are recorded at fair value on initial recognition net of transaction costs. The fair value of warrants granted is recognised as an 
expense or as share issue costs, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value of the warrants granted is measured using the Black Scholes valuation model 
for options without market conditions and using the binomial method for those with market conditions, taking into account the terms and conditions under which 
the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of warrants that vest.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation is provided on all plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value, using the 
straight-line method over their estimated useful life of the asset as follows:
• The mining assets amortised over the life of the mine or 20 years whichever is the lesser;
• Geological equipment over one to three years; 
• Motor vehicles over three years; and
• Fixtures and fittings over two years to five years.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end and adjusted if necessary.
Gains or losses on disposal are included in profit or loss.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
At each statement of financial position date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount  
of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicate a possible impairment in a cash-generating unit, the recoverability of the net book value relating 
to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil prices and future costs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the 
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating 
unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount,  
in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of  
any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. Financial instruments are classified into specified categories dependent upon the nature and purpose of the instruments and are determined at the 
time of initial recognition. All financial assets are recognised as loans and receivables or available for sale investments and all financial liabilities are recognised as 
other financial liabilities. 45 
Bushveld Minerals
Annual Report 2017
Administration Governance Business Review Financial Statements
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Financial assets and liabilities continued
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration receivable less any impairment. Impairment provisions are recognised when 
there is objective evidence that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts due under the terms of the receivable, the amount of such a provision being the 
difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
Trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at hand and deposits on a term of not greater than three months.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Available for sale financial assets
Listed shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale and are stated at fair value. The fair value of such 
investments is determined by reference to quoted market prices.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with  
the exception of impairment losses. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the 
investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive the dividends is established.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities (including loans and advances due to related parties) and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.  
When the terms of a financial liability are negotiated with the creditor and settlement occurs through the issue of the Company’s equity instruments, the equity 
instruments are measured at fair value and treated as consideration for the extinguishment of the liability. Any difference between the carrying amount of the 
liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued is recognised in profit or loss.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other  
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised if the revision 
affects only that year, or in the year of revision and in future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
Management’s critical estimates and judgements in preparing the financial statements relate to the going concern assumption (see above) and the valuation of 
intangible exploration assets of £60.2m (2016: £56.4m).
Determining whether an exploration and evaluation asset is impaired requires an assessment of whether there are any indicators of impairment, including  
by reference to specific impairment indicators prescribed in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources. If there is any indication of potential 
impairment, an impairment test is required based on value in use of the asset. The valuation of intangible exploration assets is dependent upon the discovery  
of economically recoverable deposits which, in turn, is dependent on future vanadium, iron ore and tin prices, future capital expenditures and environmental, 
regulatory restrictions and the succesful renewal of licences. The directors have concluded that there are no indications of impairment in respect of the carrying 
value of intangible assets at 28 February 2017 based on planned future development of the projects and current and forecast commodity prices. 46

10.  LOSS PER SHARE
From continuing operations
The calculation of a basic loss per share of 0.28 pence (2016: 0.39 pence), is calculated using the total loss for the year attributable to the owners of the Company  
of £1,705,920 (2016: £1,699,000) and the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 601,801,830 (2016: 460,361,182). There are no potentially 
dilutive shares in issue.

The Company’s subsidiary, Bushveld Resources Limited has a 64% interest in Pamish Investment No 39 (Proprietary) Limited (“Pamish”) which holds an interest in 
Prospecting right 95 (“Pamish 39”). Bushveld Resources Limited also has a 68.5% interest in Amaraka Investment No 85 (Proprietary) Limited (“Amaraka”) which 
holds an interest in Prospecting right 438 (“Amaraka 85”).
Under the agreements to acquire the licences within Bushveld Resources, the Group is required to fully fund the exploration activities up to the issue of the 
corresponding mining licences. As the non-controlling interest party retains their equity interest, the funding of their interest is accounted as deemed purchased 
consideration and is included in the additions in the year to exploration activities. A corresponding increase is credited to non-controlling interest.
The Company’s other directly owned subsidiary, Greenhills Resources Limited, has a 74% interest in Renetype (Proprietary) Limited (“Renetype”) which holds an 
interest in Prospecting right 2205 (“Renetype 2205”). 
Brits Vanadium Project
The Company completed the purchase during the year of the following licences totalling £535,631 through the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings of Sable Metals  
& Minerals Limited which have been treated as assets in additions rather than business combinations:
• NW 30/5/1/1/2/11069 PR – held through Great Line 1 (Pty) Ltd;
• NW 30/5/1/1/2/11124 PR – held through Great Line 1 (Pty) Ltd; and
• GP 30/5/1/1/02/10142 PR – held through Gemsbok Magnetite (Pty) Ltd.
The Company is in a process to secure regulatory approval in terms of section 11 of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) for change  
of control in respect of the acquired Sable Metals & Mining Ltd’s subsidiaries. Following approval, Bushveld Minerals will commence with activities to delineate the 
shallow resource on the Uitvalgrond farm portion.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, three of the Group’s exploration licences remain due for renewal. Applications have been submitted for 
renewal of these licences as they become due and the directors have no reason to believe that these renewals will be unsuccessful. 49

The Group is exposed to the risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the objectives, policies and processes of the Group for managing 
those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising returns to shareholders. In order to 
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares or arrange debt financing. 
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital and retained losses.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases for recognition  
of income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3.
Principal financial instruments 
The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows:
• Trade and other receivables. 
• Cash at bank.
• Trade and other payables.

General objectives, policies and processes
The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Group’s risk management objectives and policies. The Board receives reports through which it 
reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets.
The overall objective of the Board is to set polices that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s competitiveness and flexibility. 
Further details regarding these policies are set out below:
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s cash balances with further risk arising due to its other receivables and amounts due from the associate. Credit risk is the  
risk that the counterparty fails to repay its obligation to the Group in respect of the amounts owed. The Group gives careful consideration to which organisations  
it uses for its banking services in order to minimise credit risk. The Group has no sales hence credit risk relating to other receivables is minimal. There are no formal 
procedures in place for monitoring and collecting amounts owed to the Group. A risk management framework will be developed over time, as appropriate to the  
size and complexity of the business.
The concentration of the Group’s credit risk is considered by counterparty, geography and by currency. The Group has a significant concentration of cash held on 
deposit with large banks in South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom with A ratings and above (Standard and Poor’s).  54

South African Rand 92,913 49,622
Australian Dollar 3,154 83,135
131,155 478,619
There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date.
At 28 February 2017 , the Group held no collateral as security against any financial asset. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, 
net of any allowances for losses, represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. At 28 February 
2017 , no financial assets were past their due date. As a result, there has been no impairment of financial assets during the year. An allowance for impairment is made 
where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. Management considers 
the above measures to be sufficient to control the credit risk exposure. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk 
management rests with the Board of Directors. The Board manages liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the Group’s gearing levels, cash-flow projections and 
associated headroom and ensuring that excess banking facilities are available for future use. 
The Group maintains good relationships with its banks, which have high credit ratings and its cash requirements are anticipated via the budgetary process.  
At 28 February 2017 , the Group had £131,155 (2016: £478,619) of cash reserves.
Market risk
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group was exposed to minimal interest rate risk during the year. For this reason, no sensitivity analysis has been performed regarding interest rate risk.
Foreign exchange risk
As highlighted earlier in these financial statements, the functional currency of the Group is Pound Sterling. The Group also has foreign currency denominated assets 
and liabilities. Exposures to exchange rate fluctuations therefore arise. The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
liabilities, all in Pound Sterling, are shown below in the Group’s functional currency:

Other receivables 465,278 441,855
Trade and other payables (331,291) (206,686)
230,054 367,926
The Group is exposed to a level of foreign currency risk. Due to the minimal level of foreign transactions; the Directors currently believe that foreign currency risk is  
at an acceptable level.
The Group does not enter into any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. 55

The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the Pound Sterling against the Rand and the Australian Dollar. 10% is the 
sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonable 
possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their 
translation at the year end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The table below shows the effect of a 10% weakening and strengthening of the Pound Sterling

Completion of Bushveld supported Black Economic Empowerment (“BEE”) transaction
In connection with the transaction, on 22 February 2017 the Company agreed to facilitate a change in the ownership of one of Vametco Holdings’ BEE partners. 
Bushveld agreed terms with Jaxson 640 (Pty) Limited (“Jaxson 640”) to support Jaxson 640’s acquisition of a controlling interest in the BEE shareholdings in Vametco 
(the “Jaxson Transaction”).
Jaxson 640 completed the Jaxson Transaction on 5 June 2017 with payment of ZAR8,522,103 (US$655,189) to the Avacap (Proprietary) Limited consortium (“Avacap 
Consortium”) to replace the Avacap Consortium as major BEE partner to SMC. Jaxson 640 together with the local communities, on whose land the Vametco mine 
deposit and processing plant are located, hold a 25% shareholding in Vametco.
Under the terms of the agreement Jaxson 640 agreed to purchase the Avacap Consortium’s interest in Vametco for a total sum of ZAR8,522,103 (US$655,189), 
comprising a purchase consideration of ZAR5,000,000 (US$384,405), the settlement of a shareholder loan, with interest, of ZAR2,000,000 (US$153,762) principal  
and an additional ZAR1,000,000 (US$76,881) premium. In addition, Jaxson assumed its share of the existing debt of approximately ZAR39.5 million (US$3.04 million) 
historically incurred in establishing the existing BEE shareholding in Vametco.
Accordingly, the total outlay by Bushveld in respect of the BEE transaction was ZAR16,200,087 (US$1,245,480), comprising: 
• A vendor funding agreement with Jaxson 640 in terms of which Bushveld provided to Jaxson 640 the requisite ZAR8,522,103 (US$655,189) transaction funding  
to enable it to complete the transaction. The funding was provided in the form of a vendor loan and will be repaid to Bushveld from dividends due to Jaxson 640 
from Vametco over a period of 5 years from acquisition date; and
• A Settlement and Undertaking Agreement with Gingko Trading (Proprietary) Limited (“Gingko”) for the payment of ZAR7 .678 million (US$0.59 million) to Gingko 
to replace Gingko as co-lender to Vametco’s BEE shareholding structure.
Imaloto Independent Power Producer MoU signed with Sinohydro
On 5 April 2017 the Company announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) between its wholly owned subsidiary, Lemur Holdings Limited 
(“Lemur”) and Sinohydro Corporation Limited (“Sinohydro”). The MoU gives both companies exclusive rights to work with each other on the development of an initial 
60 MW independent power producer (“IPP”) coal power plant and associated 200 kilometre transmission line in southern Madagascar (the “Project”). It is anticipated 
that the coal fuel for the power station will be provided from Lemur’s coal mining permit area in Madagascar.
The MoU’s objectives include:
• Development of a Bankable Feasibility Study (“BFS”) and a Project Implementation Proposal for the project by Sinohydro, at its own cost, within 12 months  
of signing the MoU;
• Preparation by both parties of an Environmental Impact Assessment for the Project;
• Preparation by both parties of EPC and O&M contracts for the IPP plant and the EPC contract for the transmission line within 18 months;
• Cooperation between the two parties to secure both debt and equity funding for the project;
• Potential establishment of a future company for the Project upon completion of the BFS, in which Sinohydro’s parent company, PowerChina, may take an 
equity interest; and
• Lemur will continue the development of its asset in order to supply coal to the Imaloto IPP .
Lemur has to date completed a conceptual study, followed by more detailed pre-feasibility studies (“PFS”) for the mine, power plant and transmission line. These 
studies demonstrated favourable project economics, including the existing and future demand for electricity in the area. Sinohydro will use its vast expertise in 
power plant and transmission line engineering and construction to build on the work already done by Lemur in the PFS.
The Project stands to have a transformational impact on Madagascar. At present, no electricity grid exists in the southern part of the island. The Project would be able 
to not only supply electricity cheaper to existing mining and industrial operations in the region, but to also deliver electricity to tens of thousands of people currently 
without access to power. Realising this, the Madagascar power utility, Jirama, is currently negotiating an offtake agreement with Lemur for electricity for the IPP . 57

21.  EVENTS AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE CONTINUED
Greenhills’ acquisition of the Uis tin project 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Greenhills Resources Limited (“Greenhills”) completed the acquisition of a 49.5% interest in Dawnmin Africa Investments 
Limited (“Dawnmin”) from a consortium of Namibian shareholders (the “Sellers”). In accordance with the terms of the signed Sale of Shares and Claims Agreement, 
41 million ordinary shares of 1.6 pence each in Bushveld (“Consideration Shares”) were issued to the Sellers and admitted to trading on AIM on 21 June 2017 .
Dawnmin’s interest in the Uis tin project (the “Project”) is held through its 85% shareholding of Guinea Fowl Investments 27 (Proprietary) Limited (“Guinea Fowl”). 
The remaining 15% shareholding in Guinea Fowl is held by the Small Miners of Uis, a Namibian Government entity.
Under the terms of the transaction:
• The Consideration Shares are subject to a six months trading encumbrance and/or sale restriction from the date of issue;
• Erongo, the majority shareholder in Dawnmin, will spend up to A$2.0 million (two million Australian Dollars) to complete a scoping study at the project, including 
the acquisition of processing equipment where deemed appropriate by the board of Bushveld and Technical team of Dawnmin, which will be comprised of 
representatives from Bushveld and Erongo;
• Greenhills was granted an ever-green option to acquire a controlling interest in Dawnmin through the acquisition of an additional 1% interest in Dawnmin for  
a total consideration of US$1.2 million, plus a further option to earn an additional 20% in Dawnmin following Erongo’s completion of the scoping study, as follows:
• An additional 10% shareholding in Dawnmin in return for providing funding of up to US$1.0 million to take the Project to pre-feasibility stage; 
• A further 10% shareholding in Dawnmin in return for providing an additional up to US$1.0 million to deliver a bankable feasibility study; and
• Greenhills has appointed two directors to the boards of Dawnmin and Guinea Fowl to sit alongside the two Erongo-nominated directors;
• No regulatory approvals were required from the Namibian Minister of Mines for the acquisition.
Uis Tin Project
The Uis Tin Project is one of the largest undeveloped opencast hard rock tin deposits in the world and has a history of significant tin mining and an estimated 70.3Mt 
non-JORC resource at 0.14% Sn for a total potential resource of over 90kt of contained tin.
The Project is located in the Erongo Region of Namibia and comprises three mining licences, ML 134, ML 129 (B1 and C1) and ML 133. Historic work confirmed a 
significant tin resource on all three licences, the most significant of which is the ML 134 resource estimated at 70.3Mt at 0.14% Sn for a total potential resource of 
over 90kt of contained tin.
• Due diligence confirms large well developed pegmatite ore body with 0.3% Sn commonly found in greisenised zones, estimated to host approximately 20,000 
tons of tin.
• Intent to confirm JORC compliant resource, advance feasibility studies, while simultaneously refurbishing an old existing plant for a 10tph pilot scale production  
of tin concentrate, with a view to scale up targeting the identified high grade zones.
Following due diligence work recently completed, the Company has identified significant high grade zones that it recommends form the basis for early production 
with pilot scale production, at the existing plant which is currently being refurbished by Erongo, targeted for the second half of 2017 . 
The Company continues to advance its stated strategy to build a critical mass of tin resources with a near term production profile, to advance the projects towards 
production and to establish Greenhills as a stand-alone tin platform offering exposure to a pan-African tin portfolio to investors. Options for listing Greenhills as a 
stand-alone platform are currently being considered by the Company.
