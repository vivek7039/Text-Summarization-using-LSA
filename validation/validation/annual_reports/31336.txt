Strategic Report
Keywords is better placed than ever to continue to 
capture share of its high growth market by deepening 
its relationships with clients that already trust it with 
their high value IP , having significantly extended its 
services and geographical reach during the year.
Investment Summary
Access to high growth market
Keywords operates in an exciting high growth 
market, without the risk of direct exposure to 
the successes or failures of individual game 
titles and our focus on content means that  
we are platform agnostic. The increased 
sophistication of games and complexity of 
the video games market is driving demand  
for larger, professional, outsourced specialists, 
such as Keywords, in a highly fragmented 
supplier market.
Market leading position
Keywords has a market leading position as 
the only global provider of fully integrated 
outsourced creative and technical services  
to the global video games industry. With an 
industry reputation for quality, reliability and 
flexibility, our scale and reputation mean we 
are well placed to take advantage of the trend 
for clients to move to more collaborative 
partnerships with fewer, larger suppliers. 
Strong growth record
In addition to delivering strong like-for-like 
growth, we have successfully acquired and 
integrated 25 acquisitions since IPO adding 
three new services (Art Creation, Customer 
Support, and Engineering); extending  
our existing service lines to bring us even  
closer to our clients, by adding embedded 
technical services, co-development and 
content management systems; and 
expanding our geographical reach. We are a trusted partner to leading 
companies around the world, with a 
strong market position, providing 
services to 23 of the top 25 most 
prominent games companies, including:
05 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Opportunity to grow further
Having made strong progress in extending 
the Group’s client base, market penetration, 
geographic footprint and service lines, we 
now see significant potential for increased 
cross-pollination of our service lines and 
geographic locations, including taking 
advantage of our dual shore capabilities,  
as we increasingly become strategic  
partners to our clients. 
A strong business model
Keywords’ flexible resourcing and charging 
model, with charges levied for time or  
output rather than a fixed price, combined 
with relatively low working capital and  
capital expenditure requirements support  
its ability to grow the business whilst also 
achieving strong cash conversion. 
Adjacent market potential
Our expertise in providing outsourced 
solutions to the video games industry  
is already being sought after in adjacent 
markets such as film and television, and 
Keywords is well placed to deliver this. 06 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
Significant  
growth globally
The Group’s strong performance  
reflects the continuation of  
our proven strategy. 
Ross Graham
Chairman 07 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
I am delighted to report another excellent 
performance, with the Group having 
delivered significant revenue growth,  
whilst maintaining margins, to achieve  
a 55% increase in adjusted profit before  
tax to €23.0m in the year (2016: €14.9m). 
The Group’s strong performance reflects  
the continuation of our proven strategy  
to supplement strong organic growth with 
acquisitions that further extend the Group’s 
services and geographical reach to position 
us as the leading creative and technical 
services provider to the global video games 
industry. We made eleven acquisitions during 
the year, including two of our largest to date, 
VMC and Sperasoft. These acquisitions have 
enabled us to form a new Engineering service 
line of scale, add co-development expertise, 
expand the capacity of and capabilities  
within our existing service lines considerably 
and extend our geographical reach into 
Eastern Europe. 
In addition, we have invested in expanding 
capacity at many of our studios including 
Montreal, Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid 
and Tokyo during the year with further 
investments in expansion planned for 2018. 
Managing and funding growth
Part of the success of the Group can be 
attributed to the ability of the management 
team to source, execute and integrate 
acquisitions effectively across the globe  
and across our service lines whilst retaining 
the Keywords culture, which is a particular 
competency the team has built since IPO. 
That this has been accomplished across  
all of our service lines, now embracing  
over 40 studios in 20 countries, during  
2017 is a notable achievement. 
During the year, we raised £75m via a  
placing (before expenses), which was very 
well subscribed and we would like to thank 
our shareholders for their continued support. 
Since the year end, we have agreed terms  
for a new bank facility, initially for €75m over  
a three-year term with the option to extend 
the facility to €105m and by a further two 
years. The new facility replaces the existing 
€35m facility and is on improved terms. 
Together with our strong cash generation  
(the Group finished 2017 with €11.1m of  
net cash) this gives us further headroom  
to make acquisitions.
We are very comfortable with this level of 
debt, given that a high proportion of the 
Group’s revenues can be predicted with 
some certainty, and seek to maintain a  
mix of funding for our growth strategy  
which both gives us the flexibility to  
act on our investment decisions and 
enhances shareholder value. 
People and Board
The Group’s progress is a great credit to 
every single Keywords person who has 
helped make it happen. During the year  
our CEO, Andrew Day, was accorded the 
honour of being voted as CEO of the year  
at the Grant Thornton Quoted Company 
Awards 2018, a much-deserved tribute for 
someone who has been the very essence  
of Keywords – its dynamism, client focus  
and culture – but the award is also a tribute  
to the whole Keywords team.
I would like to thank my fellow Directors, 
whose complement has been strengthened 
by the appointments of Charlotta Ginman 
and Georges Fornay during the year. Both 
have added their own strengths to the  
Board, which benefits from a diversity of 
views in its highly constructive discussions 
which I believe ensures the Board operates 
effectively, to the benefit of the Group  
as it grows. Charlotta brings with her 
extensive investment banking, technology 
and mobile industry and PLC experience 
whilst Georges brings with him strong  
video games industry expertise.
I would also like to thank the senior 
management team and all the hard-working 
employees within the Group. There is a 
tremendous spirit within the businesses which 
makes Keywords a success, with a culture of 
continuous improvement which encourages 
everyone to make their own contributions 
towards consistently ensuring we provide  
the best service possible to our clients. 
Dividend
In line with our progressive dividend policy, 
and allowing for the need to retain resources 
to fund future growth of the Group’s business 
and its strategic aims, the Board is pleased  
to recommend a final dividend of 0.98p  
per share which, following the interim 
dividend payment of 0.48p per share,  
will make the total dividend for the year 
ending 31 December 2017 1.46p per share, 
an increase of 10% compared to 2016. 
Summary and outlook
Following a highly successful 2017, we 
entered 2018 with pro forma revenues of 
€225m derived from a more diversified, 
better balanced business with an expanded 
range of services and locations that will 
support our aim to increasingly become  
a key strategic partner to the major  
games companies.
It is a pleasure to Chair a Group which has  
a strong business model that supports 
profitable growth and high cash conversion, 
where the strategic aims are clearly defined, 
and that serves an industry which is growing 
fast in which we can increase our share by 
offering an expanding array of services. 
The Keywords team remains highly focussed 
on delivering the high standard of work we 
have come to be known for and maintaining 
the trust and confidence of our clients as  
we grow both organically and by acquisition.  
I am, therefore, confident that the Group will 
make further progress as it continues to build 
upon its strengthened services platform with 
considerable scope for further growth.

Strategic Report
The leading provider  
in a growing market
Market Overview
No signs of slowing
The global games market is constantly 
growing and developing with consumers 
spending more time than ever on games,  
as regular updates to consoles smooth and 
lengthen their cycles, whilst a trend towards 
the portability of consoles helps extend 
“screen time”. The millennial generation  
in particular are perpetuating this trend  
as games now cater to a much wider  
variety of interests. 
This has clearly been proven in recent years 
as revenues in the global games market have 
surpassed the $100 billion mark (Source: 
NewZoo Global Games Market Report, June 
2017). Data suggests this won’t be stopping 
any time soon, with revenues set to reach 
almost $130 billion by 2020 representing a 
Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”)  
of around 6%. Mobile continues to lead the 
charge, with smartphones accounting for 32% 
of global revenue in 2017 and representing 
the largest single category contributor and 
the fastest growing end-market in gaming. 
Goldman Sachs anticipates this could reach 
40% by 2021 (Source: Entering the halcyon 
days of Gaming’s digital age, Goldman Sachs 
Investment Research, September 2017).
Games companies are no longer simply 
producing games and increasingly are turning 
game IP into entertainment franchises which 
has forced them to rethink their position in 
the broader entertainment industry, which in 
turn increases demand to engage outsourced 
service providers such as Keywords.
Keywords operates in an exciting high growth market,  
without the risk of exposure to the successes or  
failures of individual game titles.

Service provision
The market continues to be very fragmented 
with a large number of small specialist 
suppliers available to choose from and,  
in order to meet the growing demand from 
the global video games market, companies 
are having to adapt their service provision for 
the most part due to the changing demands 
from customers.
Increasingly customers are looking to 
outsource multiple services to providers  
who can offer all of these under one umbrella, 
by way of strategic partnerships, as well as 
exploring more co-development, in which 
significant parts of, or even full games, are 
developed on behalf of game developers  
or game publishers. This trend shift makes 
groups with a diverse and broad offering  
very attractive, particularly to smaller  
service providers looking to become  
part of a larger organisation. 
According to Goldman Sachs, an M&A cycle 
should benefit the scale players such as 
Keywords. With rising barriers to entry across 
the sector, they expect to see consolidation  
in the sector as larger firms use growing  
cash balances to acquire high-quality smaller 
companies, particularly in the mobile  
sector – the largest and fastest-growing 
gaming market (Source: Goldman Sachs, 
September 2017). 10 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Our strategy
To grow organically and by acquisition to 
extend the Group’s client base, service  
lines and geographical penetration, where 
the Group can use its existing expertise, 
multi-service platform, scale and global  
reach to generate synergies in a highly 
fragmented games service industry.
Geographic reach represents an important 
component of our strategy, where we seek  
to gain access to markets for the best talent 
or to be close to our clients.
As a more diversified, better balanced 
business with an expanded range of services 
and locations to offer our clients, we see 
many opportunities to extend our existing 
relationships and become a strategic partner 
to major games companies, both through 
providing additional services to existing 
customers and through providing dedicated 
outsourced services.
Our vision
To be the “go to” global service delivery 
platform for the video games industry.
• Added new services to the  
Group, including Engineering, 
co-development, Game Porting  
and Live Support Services,  
as well as a dedicated content

“Joining as a junior tester 11 years ago, 
Keywords has given me the tools and

Teamwork
“We used to be fierce competitors of 
Keywords so, since acquisition, our shared

Environment
“Standardised induction across the Group in 
every studio helps ingrain our culture in new 
acquisitions from the outset, and integration 
of the support services such as HR and 
Finance enables our team members to go 
out and do what they do best, be it 
Localisation, Audio or Engineering.”

Joining the  
Keywords Family
Group culture is at the centre of 
everything we do and ensuring the 
companies we acquire are aligned with 
the Keywords culture is a crucial step  
in our integration process. We have 
developed a set of guidelines, which  
we call “The Keywords Rule of Nine”, 
which sets out our culture. 
• We communicate openly
• We focus on projects
• We act as an extension of our clients
• We empower our people
• We are passionate about games
• We love our clients
• We have a “can do” attitude
• We recognise the importance of flexibility
• We learn at every opportunity
With each new acquisition, we deploy our Integration 
Memorandum, a unified communication package delivered 
by an existing member of the Keywords executive team,  
in order to ensure a smooth transition. 16 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Chief Executive’s Review
An excellent 
performance and  
a strengthened 
services platform
2017 saw Keywords successfully execute  
11 acquisitions as we continue to  
selectively consolidate our market.
Andrew Day
Group Chief Executive Officer 17 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The Group has delivered another strong 
performance, with good like-for-like growth 
from the existing businesses combined  
with successfully securing and integrating 
acquisitions that have significantly enhanced 
our services platform in line with our strategy. 
Delivering on our strategy
We continue to execute well in pursuit of our 
strategy to build the world’s leading creative 
and technical services platform focused  
on the most complex of interactive content  
– video games. 
We operate in a service provision industry 
which remains highly fragmented despite  
the scale and global nature of the major  
video games publishers and developers,  
and the trend towards those clients 
outsourcing a greater proportion of their 
games development and in-game support  
to manage the demands for increasingly 
sophisticated content whilst limiting their 
fixed costs. 
The key pillars of our strategy are, therefore, 
to grow organically and by acquisition  
to extend the Group’s service capacity, 
capabilities and geographical reach –  
where we seek to gain access to markets  
for the best talent or to be close to our  
clients. By generating synergies across our 
expanding multi-service global platform,  
we are increasingly becoming a key strategic 
partner to our customers. 
2017 acquisitions 
2017 saw Keywords successfully execute  
11 acquisitions as we continue to selectively 
consolidate our market. These businesses  
are spread across multiple geographies  
and added to all seven of our service lines 
demonstrating the strength of our leadership 
team which comprises both regional and 
service line management. All of the acquisitions 
in 2017 have been or are being integrated.
In particular, the addition of Engineering 
services as our seventh service line during 
2017 has filled an important gap in our 
palette of services and we look forward to 
continuing to build this business in 2018  
and beyond. This was initially formed by our 
acquisition of GameSim in May and expanded 
through our acquisitions of d3t in October 
and Sperasoft in December, providing the 
Group with game development, game porting 
and live operations support talent totalling 
some 400 people.
We have also successfully extended our 
geographic reach adding operations in 
Eastern Europe for the first time through our 
acquisition of Sperasoft, giving us access to 
talent in a market known for strong technical 
skills, particularly in software development. 
Sperasoft brought with it scale and expertise 
in Engineering and Art services, with a 
particular strength in co-development in 
which significant parts of or even full games 
are developed on behalf of game developers 
or publishers. This further enhances our 
positioning as a strategic partner to game 
developers and publishers who are 
increasingly relying upon co-development 
arrangements to provide them with broader 
development support for their games that  
are increasingly bigger and higher definition, 
whilst we continue to ensure we are not 
directly exposed to the commercial 
performance of individual titles. We expect  
to be able to grow this way of working with  
our clients, combining Sperasoft’s strength  
in co-development with our broader service 
range for a more integrated service delivery.
Sperasoft’s 370 talented engineers, game 
designers, artists and project managers  
are based in St. Petersburg, Krakow and 
Volgograd and we are now looking at  
seeding some of our other services into  
these locations.
VMC, acquired in October for $66.4m, 
brought the Group leadership and scale in 
functional testing and significantly increased 
our presence in player support services. It 
also brought to the Group specialist expertise 
in managing “Embedded Technical Services”, 
through which VMC provides Testing, 
Customer Support and other services in-situ 
at clients’ facilities. VMC was a carve out from 
the publicly quoted Volt Information Sciences 
Inc. Its operations are in the US and Canada 
and its integration, which is nearly complete, 
includes consolidation of facilities and of 
management teams and the migration of  
the business to Keywords’ core operating  
IT platforms. The integration is being led  
by Nicolas Liorzou, our Regional Managing 
Director for the Americas who has led the 
successful integration of two previous 
acquisitions, Babel Media (acquired in 2014) 
and Enzyme (acquired in 2016). 
Our simultaneous acquisitions of the 
Paris-based audio and localisation  
businesses of La Marque Rose, Around the 
Word, Dune Sound and asrec in August  
are being integrated with our existing audio  
and localisation business there, which we 
acquired with the acquisition of Synthesis in 
2016. Led by Michel Golgevit, CEO of Around 
the Word, these businesses are planning to 
move to custom-built, state-of-the-art audio 
recording studios in 2018. Also in the Audio 
service line, LOLA in Mexico City was acquired 
just before the end of the year and they are 
working with the management of Kite Team  
in Mexico, which joined the Group in 2015,  
to integrate the two businesses. 
In our Art Service line, which saw a change  
of leadership at the end of the year with  
the retirement of Fred Stockton and the 
appointment of Ashley Liu as Service Line 
Director, the acquisitions of SPOV in London 
and Red Hot with its facilities in Shanghai, 
Dalian, Zhengzhou, Chengdu and Yogyakarta 
have performed to expectations and are 
integrating well. 
XLoc, a technology company with a 
proprietary content management solution 
that helps clients manage and automate the 
complex process of localising games content 
across multiple languages and platforms,  
was acquired in May. There have already been 
some successes in cross selling this platform 
alongside our localisation services which  
we believe will further embed us in to the 
localisation processes of games developers. 
Organic growth and investment
We have continued to drive organic growth 
across the business, having achieved a 15.1% 
increase in like-for-like revenue in 2017 (which 
is calculated on the basis of revenues being 
included for 2017 acquisitions from the date 
of acquisition and for the equivalent period  
in the prior year in order to provide a clearer 
measure of the organic growth of all of the 
businesses now within the Group). Audio  
had a particularly tough comparator with 
Synthesis having produced an exceptional 
performance in 2016 while all other service 
lines posted strong like-for-like growth. 
Functional Testing and Customer Support 
produced particularly strong growth. We  
have seen some beneficial impact from the 
burgeoning eSports market as we respond to 
demands for translation services, marketing 
materials and customer support related to  
the events being staged and we are seeing 
demand for our services from outside the 
games industry as other industries seek  
out the skills and technology to make their 
content interactive.  18 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Strategic Report
A combination of our organic and acquisitive 
investment meant we finished the year  
with 42 operating locations in 20 countries 
compared to 27 locations in 17 countries  
in 2016. 
The acquisitions of VMC and Sperasoft  
will result in the Group’s share of revenue 
denominated in US Dollars growing from 46% 
in 2017. Recent weakness in the US Dollars 
compared to a number of other currencies  
in which the Group trades, such as the 
Canadian Dollar, Euro, Yen, Renminbi  
and Rupee, is being monitored and some  
US Dollars denominated pricing may be 
adjusted accordingly. 
Service line review
Art Creation  
(17% of Group revenues in the year)
Art Creation services revenue grew 58%  
to €26.2m (2016: €16.6m). On a like-for-like 
basis, Art grew by 14% year-on-year, reflecting 
a year in which Lakshya Digital consolidated 
the very strong growth of 2015 and 2016 and 
the remaining studios made good progress 
including Red Hot which we acquired in May. 
Including Sperasoft, we concluded the year 
with over 1,000 artists on our payroll of which 
the majority are in India and China. Through 
Liquid Development and Volta we manage 
further pools of freelance artists numbering 
about 200 in total. This talent base makes 
Keywords one of the largest art services 
businesses in the highly fragmented global 
video games art services market.
Our Art studios are increasingly working  
with each other to leverage their respective 
capacities, to deliver top quality work to their 
global client base. Likewise, with our recent 
investments in Engineering services, these 
two service lines are working together in a 
co-development model to produce complete 
game development services for game 
developers and publishers. 
Under the leadership of Ashley Liu (previously 
CEO of Mindwalk), the objective for our Art 
Creation services line is to continue to grow 
capacity to meet demand (including internal 
demand from our co-development activities), 
whilst maintaining our reputation for quality 
and reliability of delivery to our customers’ 
timescales. In addition, we aim to extend our 
capabilities in areas such as visual special 
effects, user interface design, cinematics and 
motion graphics, which we have started to  
do with the acquisition of Spov early in 2017. 
Engineering  
(2% of Group revenue for the year)
With Sperasoft only being included since 
December, d3t from October and GameSim 
from May, our Engineering service line is 
being built through acquisition in much  
the same as we have built our Art Creation 
service line which started in October 2014 
with the acquisition of Lakshya Digital. We 
have had some very early successes with 
cross selling our engineering capabilities into 
clients who use other Keywords services and 
we look forward to continuing to build our 
Engineering service line in 2018 and beyond.
Audio  
(14% of Group revenue for the year)
Our Audio service line increased revenues  
by 20% to €20.7m (2016: €17.3m) including 
contributions from La Marque Rose, Around 
the Word, Dune Sound and asrec, all of which 
were acquired in August and LOLA which was 
acquired in December. On a like-for-like basis, 
revenues in our Audio service line declined  
by approximately 10%, in part reflecting  
the exceptionally strong performance of 
Synthesis in the prior year. Also, the video 
games voice actors’ strike which effected  
the video games voice recording market  
in Los Angeles was resolved in September 
2017 and we look forward to more buoyant 
conditions there in 2018.
We opened an audio studio in Tokyo, 
strengthened our management of the 
combined Kite Team, Synthesis and Sonox 
operations in Madrid and also that of our  
Los Angeles studio. In 2018, we plan to invest 
in state of the art audio recording facilities  
in Paris and London.

by further strong progress with extending  
our client relationships, as evidenced by  
a 45% increase in clients using three or  
more services from 64 in 2016 to 93 in 2017. 
As announced at the half year, we also 
launched an ambitious programme of 
investments in many of our studios to add 
capacity in locations including Montreal, 
Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid and  
Tokyo, with new recording studios planned  
for London and Paris in 2018.

Acquisition strategy
We continue to operate in a  
highly fragmented market
As a Group we are highly selective in which companies we 
chose to acquire, and they must meet the following criteria:
• Cultural fit – our most important: 
• We don’t engage if the business is clearly not a good fit;
• However, we have acquired Groups with different 
cultures and successfully changed them.
• Valuation – we don’t overpay but are fair:
• Most targets have a financial fragility despite being 
very good suppliers; 
• Valuations have averaged 1x revenue or 5-10x EBITDA.
• Financial performance – the least important for us:
• We know how to make money from the businesses  
we operate through achieving operational excellence.
As a result, underperforming businesses represent an 
opportunity for us.
Key Stat

Acquisitions in 2017. Integration and driving synergies
Our approach to integration, driving synergies and 
margins is tailored to each type of business
Type one – Standalone studios: 
• With new territories and new service 
lines, we focus on business processes  
to optimise margins over time;
• Subsequently, the access to a larger 
client base improves the business’ 
pipeline and improves utilisation rates.
Type two – Studios with strong overlap:
This is used when a business is acquired near 
an existing Keywords hub, or where no new 
services are added:
• We focus both on gross margins and  
on SG&A and operational expenditure 
costs, with immediate impacts; 
• For example, in the Montreal hub, Babel 
went from making losses to achieving 
20%+ EBITDA in the second year.
As a result of this, acquired companies 
almost always grow revenues strongly under 
Keywords ownership. We encourage them,  
to grow, to be bold, and to invest, and they 
benefit from being part of well-respected 
Group with known behaviour; we are easy  
to do business with, flexible, scalable, put the 
interests of the project first, financially solid 
and transparent.

Functional Testing  
(20% of Group revenue for the year)
Our Functional Testing services grew by 248% 
to €30.0m (2016: €8.6m), including a ten-week 
contribution from VMC which was acquired in 
October 2017. The service line also grew by 
an impressive 52% on a like-for-like basis. 
Some 50% of VMC’s €47m annual revenues 
fall into the Functional Testing service line  
and the service line management team  
have been instrumental in integrating the 
functional testing businesses in Seattle and 
Montreal, slimming down the combined 
management team, standardising tools and 
processes and making efficient use of office 
space. As a result, we anticipate improved 
margins from the VMC business as signalled 
at the time of acquisition.
The organic growth of Functional Testing  
has driven demand for increased capacity  
in Montreal and New Delhi and we have 
invested during the year in additional  
space in both locations and are evaluating 
options for expansion in other locations.
During the year we also invested in Player 
Research, the play testing business we 
acquired in October 2016, with the opening  
of a purpose-built play test laboratory  
in our Montreal building.
Localisation  
(28% of Group revenue in the year)
Our Localisation activities, including 
contributions from XLoc acquired in May,  
La Marque Rose, Around the Word, Dune 
Sound, asrec and VMC which were acquired  
in August, increased revenues by 30%, to 
€42.0m (2016: €32.4m), and continued its 
excellent record of growth with a like-for-like 
increase of 20%. 
The business produced around 250 million 
translated words during the year as our 
Localisation service line continued to benefit 
from the trend towards “games as a service” 
which necessitates fresh content being added 
to the game on a frequent basis to expand 
the game worlds and keep players engaged. 
Another driver of growth has been eSports 
where our localisation expertise has been 
called upon for the production of marketing

content, customer support materials and  
“live translation” of event content. We are  
the leading localisation provider for video 
games and enjoy a strong position in the 
fast-growing mobile games segment of  
the market, where content additions to  
the many leading games that we support 
result in continuous localisation work for  
the Group in as many as 30 languages.
During the year we completed the internal 
rollout of our proprietary localisation  
project management system, BPS, and we 
continue to invest in enhancements to the 
software to improve the efficiency of our 
localisation teams. Cross selling
The largest single opportunity for 
Keywords comes from our own ability 
to guide clients who already trust us to 
other services we could provide to 
them from within the Keywords Group
The continuous nature of game development lends  
itself well to cross selling. Keywords provides services  
at all six stages of the games lifecycle, creating ample 
opportunities to refer business to other studios.  
See pages 12 and 13 for more detail.
We have a strong and clear management structure  
which encourages a culture of pursuing more and more 
cross selling opportunities. Approach is clearly achieving 
results and we are constantly working on cross-selling 
opportunities. 93 of our 646 clients now use three or 
more services, up from 64 in 2016.

Localisation Testing  
(13% of Group revenue in the year)
Our Localisation Testing operations grew  
by 22% on an absolute basis to €19.9m  
(2016: €16.2m) helped by the addition  
of revenues from VMC and full year 
contributions from Synthesis and Enzyme 
which were acquired in April 2016 and 
November 2016 respectively. On a  
like-for-like-basis, growth was a more modest 
3%. The integration of VMC’s Localisation 
Testing business is progressing well.
With secure localisation testing studios in 
Montreal, Dublin, Milan, Singapore and Tokyo 
we believe this service line is the largest 
provider of localisation testing in the video 
games market. We look forward to continuing 
to serve our clients around the world while 
optimising our production efficiency, assisted 
by our increased scale, and developing our 
talent pool of games passionate professionals 
of over 30 different nationalities.
Customer Support  
(6% of Group revenue for the year)
Revenues for this service line benefitted  
from a significant contribution from VMC  
and grew by 64% to €9.2m (2016: €5.6m).  
On a like-for-like basis, the business grew  
by 16% thanks to new client wins and 
successful cross selling efforts.
Our Customer Support business which 
includes live operations support functions  
like community management, fraud 
prevention, bot hunting and VIP services, 
continues to perform strongly and is 
achieving strong organic growth. 
Among the highlights for this business  
line has been the growth of the Manila- 
based customer support operation spun  
out from our client, Ankama in March 2016 
from the then 23 staff to over 350 today. 
We’ve also been pleased with the success  
of our customer support teams based in  
our studio in Tokyo, where they service  
both Japanese and non-Japanese clients. 
During the year we opened a multilingual 
customer support studio in Madrid alongside 
our audio and localisation businesses there 
and in 2018 we are considering establishing  
a support centre in Eastern Europe as we 
leverage our presence there following the 
Sperasoft acquisition.
Whilst our Customer Support service  
line remains a relatively small part of the 
Group, we believe our specialist teams  
offer an attractive alternative to traditional 
large customer support call centres. Our 
customers are highly focussed on keeping 
gamers in their games for longer. We believe 
our model of using teams of passionate 
gamers with deep knowledge of the games 
they are supporting provides improved user 
satisfaction and will enable us to increase  
our share of this growing market over time.
People
The Group employed an average 3,167  
people in 2017 (2016: 1,818). Well balanced 
across our three regions, we employed  
1,142 in The Americas, 609 in Europe and 
1,416 in Asia. As the growing games industry 
continues to produce more content for 
industries as diverse as retail, urban planning, 
advertising, education, architecture and 
automotive which adopt the use of game 
engines to make their content more 
interactive and engaging, so we see the 
demand for human capital increase. Our 
broad and deep pool of highly experienced 
and games passionate co-workers provide  
an outsourced resource for our clients to  
tap into as and when they need in order to 
get their content to market in a flexible and 
cost-efficient manner. 
Our culture acts as the glue that binds our 
staff around the world together. Relaxed, 
professional and humble with a focus on 
doing the very best we can for each project 
entrusted to us, this culture creates an 
environment in which games passionate 
individuals can work together with likeminded 
colleagues while enjoying the opportunity to 
work on most of the world’s leading games 
ahead of their release. Working on around 
150 games at any time in the year and  
more than 500 in total throughout the  
year, Keywords provides an excellent and 
sustainable variety of work, good career 
advancement and opportunities to work in 
many different locations. We are proud to 
serve as a stepping stone for those that go  
on to make their careers in games production 
and publishing and we are fortunate to  
have an excellent alumnus of Keywordians 
employed by many of our client companies.
Our acquisition programme also brings  
fresh talent to the Group at all levels and  
we continue to be successful at integrating 
our businesses, including providing 
opportunities for staff to move between our 
various studios. This year we have added 
game programmers, game designers and 
engineers to our ever-growing Keywords 
family. This is reflected in our senior 
leadership team, which comprises four  
people from the original Keywords business, 
seven people from acquired entities as well  
as four externally hired employees.

for games made for this platform and assist 
developers in repurposing existing games  
for the Switch. 
The astounding success achieved by battle 
arena games led by Fortnite and Player 
Unknown Battleground seem set to continue 
and we are fortunate to be providing services 
for those games too. The mobile games 
sector continues to grow faster than the 
other platform types, with much of this 
growth originating in Asia where we continue 
to expand and build upon our relationships 
with the major games publishers in China, 
Japan and Korea.
The evolution of the console gaming sector 
from packaged product, through digitally 
delivered content and into the monetisation 
models of free to play and micro transactions 
that were previously the preserve of PC and 
mobile gaming is interesting to see and brings 
with it a requirement on the part of our game 
developer and clients to continually feed their 
games with new content, the challenges of 
which we have mastered over time with our 
clients in PC, social and mobile gaming. 24 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Strategic Report
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Augmented reality has received a lot of 
attention but, as with virtual reality in 2016,  
we feel this technology is still early stage  
and the mass adoption of both content 
formats is probably a few years off. However,  
virtual and augmented reality games and 
applications continue to generate additional 
demand for our services.
The eSports market is developing strongly 
and, while we do benefit to some extent from 
this through the provision of our existing 
services to support the games being played 
and through supporting the marketing and 
communications management of the events 
themselves, we continue to seek out ways  
in which we could participate in this segment  
in a more meaningful manner. 
Outlook
As we did in 2016, in 2017 we had a strong 
finish to the year, particularly in our audio and 
testing businesses. The typically quieter first 
quarter has seen activity levels in line with  
our expectations and the positive momentum 
in the business gives us confidence in the 
outcome for the full year. 
Early wins of co-development projects in  
2018 are encouraging signs of the demand 
from game developers and publishers for 
integrated delivery of Engineering and Art  
in the form of game remastering and game 
development. We anticipate that demand  
for co-development services will continue to 
increase as the size and complexity of games 
makes it harder for any one development 
studio to undertake all the development 
themselves. We look forward to being able  
to package more of our services into 
co-development style engagements,  Strategic partnerships
The market continues to evolve, moving towards  
adopting a Strategic Partnership Model
There are currently three main models that are adopted:
• Dedicated teams:  
In this scenario, specialist teams work 
solely on one client or project, operating 
within existing Keywords offices, 
however these are made to look and 
feel like the client’s offices but using 
Keywords platforms and expertise. 
• Spin off production centres: 
Here, the client transfers control of its 
team and offices over to Keywords as 
an outsourcing agreement, building  
on existing talent and infrastructure  
to create a broader service delivery  
hub. The benefit of this option is  
that it allows clients to focus internal 
talent on core strengths. We find that 
competitive pressures have been 
causing this to be more widely adopted.
• Strategic Partnership Model: 
This is the next step in outsourcing, 
creating deep partnerships which are 
integrated in technology, processes and 
talent. Keywords and the client have a 
common innovation roadmap, involving 
multiple service lines. We take an 
adaptive approach to create customised 
solutions, offering both regional or 
global solutions on a large scale. 
Keywords’ co-development expertise, 
unique talent, technology, knowledge 
and scale creates supplier-client 
interdependency – which we love!

to add further value to our clients.
As a more diversified, better balanced 
business with an expanded range of services 
and locations to offer our clients, and the 
support of a global sales and marketing 
function, we see many opportunities to 
extend our existing relationships and  
become a strategic partner to major  
games companies, both through providing 
more integrated services and through  
the provision of dedicated outsourced  
or embedded services.
Each service line is pursuing a growth 
strategy formulated for its own market 
opportunity, with some including a larger 
acquisition component than others to add 
scale or capabilities that we do not currently 
have within the Group, with the aim of a  
good balance between all seven service  
lines over time. 
We have entered 2018 with a considerably 
enhanced platform and a healthy acquisition 
pipeline and we fully expect to grow our 
business organically as well as through 
selectively acquiring complementary 
businesses as we continue to consolidate  
the highly fragmented market for video  
games services in 2018.

Financial and Operating Review
2017 has seen the Group deliver another  
year of significant increases in revenue,  
profit and underlying cash generation.
David Broderick
Chief Financial Officer 27 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Group performance
2017 has seen the Group deliver another year 
of significant increases in revenue, profit and 
underlying cash generation driven by good 
organic growth, substantially complemented 
by acquisitions which have further extended 
its service offering, market penetration and 
geographic reach. 
Revenue
Revenue for 2017 was up 57% at €151.4m 
(2016: €96.6m). This growth was generated 
across all seven service lines of the business 
through a combination both organic and 
acquisitive growth. The like-for-like revenue 
growth rate, which provides a 2016 
comparative as if all of the 2017 and 2016 
acquisitions had been owned for the same 
period in 2016 as they have been in 2017, was 
15% for the year which was down from 24%  
in 2016 due to the tough comparative as a 
result of the exceptional 2016 performance  
of Synthesis while all other service lines grew, 
with Functional Testing, Customer Support 
and Localisation being particularly strong. 
Excluding Synthesis from both periods the  
like-for-like growth was 18.1% which was  
in line with our expectations and a strong 
growth rate from a larger base. 
 
Gross margin 
Gross profit for the year was €55.1m (2016: 
€36.7m). As expected the gross margin 
percentage declined slightly to 36.4% (2016: 
38.0%) as the Group absorbed the lower 
margin VMC business with its strengths  
in Embedded Technical Services where  
the services are hosted by the client with 
correspondingly lower operating costs. 
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of operating 
profit used by the Board, which excludes 
depreciation, amortisation, share option 
expenses and one-time costs related to 
acquisitions. For 2017, Adjusted EBITDA 
increased 57% to €26.3m compared with 
€16.7m for 2016. As a percentage of revenue, 
Adjusted EBITDA has been maintained  
at 17.4% compared to 17.3% for 2016.
Operating expenses, excluding depreciation, 
increased by €8.6m to €28.4m (2016: €19.8m) 
mainly as a result of the new acquisitions 
made during the year. The continued 
additional investment in strengthening 
Keywords’ management to successfully 
manage the growth of the Group also 
contributed. However, the continued drive on 
achieving synergies across the Group helped 
these costs decrease from 20.5% to 18.8% of 
revenue, with teams increasingly combining 
the Group’s services and resources effectively 
to meet clients’ needs. 
Net finance costs
During 2017, there was a net finance cost  
of €4.4m compared to a cost of €2.0m in  
2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign 
exchange losses. Foreign exchange losses  
of €3.6m (2016: loss of €1.7m) were in large 
part due to the effect of translating net 
current assets held in foreign currencies.  
The increase in interest expense to €0.6m 
(2016: €0.2m) is largely due to a secured 
credit facility with Barclays of up to €35m  
over a five-year period of which €18.25m  
was drawn down at the year end. 
Adjusted profit before tax
Adjusted profit before tax is used by the 
Board to measure the more meaningful 
underlying profit generation of the Group. 
This measure adds back one-time expenses, 
such as acquisition and integration expenses, 
share option charges, foreign currency 
exchange gains or losses and amortisation  
of intangibles to the statutory profit before 
tax. Adjusted profit before tax for 2017 
increased by 55% to €23.0m compared  
with €14.9m in 2016.
Revenue mix
Revenues increased across all lines of business in 2017, resulting in our seven service lines 
accounting for the following proportion of Group sales in the year:

Strategic Report
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate has decreased 
again in 2017. The reduction in the federal 
income tax rate for businesses in the US will 
further help the Group manage its effective 
tax rate not withstanding some effective tax 
planning we were able to achieve through  
the acquisition of VMC. We continue to make 
steady progress in making better use of our 
Ireland-based operational headquarters in 
contracting and treasury management such 
that we expect our effective tax rate to 
continue to reduce despite our exposure  
to higher tax jurisdictions in most of the 
territories we operate in. The Group’s 
effective tax rate, based on the adjusted 
measure of profit before taxation in the 
period (as set out in the financial overview 
above), was 20.5% (2016: 21.7%).
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share for the year,  
before one-time costs of acquisitions  
and integration, share option charges, 
amortisation of intangibles, and foreign 
exchange movements, increased by 52% to 
31.18c compared with 20.59c for 2016. Basic 
earnings per share based on the statutory 
profit after tax was 12.37c (2016: 11.22c).
Cash flow and debt
The Group generated operating cash flow  
of €13.6m for the year, down from €15.0m  
in 2016. A better measure of underlying cash 
flow is adjusted operating cash generation, 
which was €21.9m in 2017, up from €14.8m  
in the prior year. This figure is cash flow from 
operations plus acquisition related expenses 
of €3m (2016: €1.3m), plus exceptional 
working capital costs related to the VMC 
acquisition of €3.0m (2016: €nil), plus €2.3m  
in VMC receipts held by a third party on  
behalf of the Group and passed to the  
Group post year-end. 
During the year the Group also received 
MMTCs in Quebec of €3.4m (2016: €2.8m). 
Previous delays in receiving the multimedia 
tax credits were not encountered in 2017  
and the total multimedia tax credit accrual 
amounted to €10m as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: €3m). The VMC acquisition accounted 
for €6.6m of the closing accrual. In the 
comparative year, multimedia tax credits 
(“MMTC”) of €1.6m were received in respect  
of claims prior to 2015.
The Group made eleven acquisitions to 
strengthen the business during the year  
with a net cash outflow on consideration 
payments of €87m, and an additional €3.0m 
in acquisition and integration expenses. 
Investment in fixed assets amounted to 
€3.8m (2016: €2.3m) reflecting the cost  
of increasing the capacity of the Montreal 
studio, improvements to both the Dublin  
and Tokyo studios. Additionally, there  
were ongoing purchases of games  
testing equipment. 
Following the investment of €87.0m net cash 
consideration for acquisitions in 2017, and a 
successful £75.0m equity placing in October 
2017, cash and cash equivalents increased  
to €30.4m from €17.0m excluding accrued 
multimedia tax credits of €10.0m (2016: 
€3.0m). The loans and borrowings were 
€19.3m at 31 December 2017 (2016: €8.4m) 
having utilised €18.3m of its €35m revolving 
credit facility, giving a net cash position  
of €11.1m.
Foreign exchange
Keywords does not hedge foreign currency 
profit and loss translation exposures. The 
effect on the Group’s results of movements  
in exchange rates and the foreign gains and 
losses incurred during the year mainly relate 
to the effect of translating net current assets 
held in foreign currencies.
Dividend
The Group has a progressive dividend policy, 
subject to the retention of funds needed to 
fund future growth of the Group’s business 
and its strategic aims. 
Following the interim dividend payment  
of 0.48p per share in October 2017, the  
Board has recommended a final dividend  
of 0.98p per share, which will make the total 
dividend for the year ending 31 December 
2017 1.46p per share, a 10% increase over 
2016. Subject to shareholder approval  
at the Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 22 June 2018 to all 
shareholders on the register at 1 June 2018 
and the shares will trade ex-dividend on 
31 May 2018. The cash cost of the final 
proposed dividend will be an estimated 
€0.7m, subject to currency fluctuations.

Events after the reporting period
The Group has agreed heads of terms on a 
revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank plc, 
HSBC Bank plc and Lloyds Banking Group plc 
for an initial €75m over a three-year term,  
with the option to extend the facility to 
€105m and by a further two years. The new 
facility replaces the existing €35m facility  
and is on improved terms. This increased 
facility is in keeping with the growth of the 
Group and its financial performance and 
provides support for the Group’s ongoing 
acquisition strategy.
On 9 April 2018, we announced that the 
Group acquired Cord Worldwide Limited and 
Laced Music Limited from the Cutting Edge 
Group for a total consideration of £4.5m 
comprised of an initial cash consideration of 
£3.375m on completion and 73,744 in shares 
to be issued two years after the acquisition. 
Cord and Laced generated combined revenue 
of £6.5m and EBITDA of £675,000 in the year 
ended 30 June 2017. 
On 22 March 2018, Keywords acquired 
Maximal Studio for an initial cash 
consideration of €0.3m, with up to €0.2m of 
deferred consideration due over the following 
two years, subject to its performance. 
Key performance indicators
We monitor our financial performance 
against a number of different benchmarks. 
These are set in agreement with the Board 
and used to evaluate progress against  
our strategy.
Financial performance is measured by: 
Revenue growth 
Revenue growth is measured by line of 
business and overall against the Board’s 
strategic goal to grow organically and  
by acquisition.
Gross profit
Gross profit is a key measure of the Group’s 
pricing strategies, use of resources and its 
ability to optimise resource utilisation while 
allowing for changes in the mix of business 
and services delivered on client premises, 
where the Group’s gross margin typically 
reduces but our operating costs are also 
significantly reduced.
Operating costs 
The Board monitors the overheads to ensure 
the operating costs of the Group are in line 
with the level of business being generated.
Adjusted EBITDA margin
The Board uses an adjusted measure of 
EBITDA to monitor the performance of  
the Group. This measure excludes foreign 
exchange gains or losses, any one-time 
expense and the cost of employee share 
option awards.
Adjusted operating profit margin
The Board also uses an adjusted measure of 
operating profit to monitor the performance 
of the Group. This measure excludes foreign 
exchange gains or losses, amortisation, any 
one time expenses and the cost of employee 
share option awards.
Non-financial performance is measured by: 
Resource deployment
The Board reviews the efficiency at which the 
Group is utilising its staff resources to ensure 
optimum staffing strategies are deployed and 
to maximise utilisation rates.
Business won/lost
The Board reviews the levels of new business 
won and lost, and monitors the reasons  
for both, to ensure that the services being 
offered to the market are appropriately 
priced and relevant.
Customer satisfaction and quality  
of service delivery
The Board monitors the quality and 
timeliness of service delivery on an ongoing 
basis and reviews the level of repeat revenue 
from existing customers, as a key measure  
of customer satisfaction.

External risks (including links to strategy) Movement
Exposure to large clients
 
The Company’s client base principally comprises global game companies whose revenues are in 
the billions and hundreds of millions of dollars. Our top five clients account for 29% (2016: 28.4%) 
of the Company’s revenues. These companies have exacting standards and demand a high-quality 
of service. Any failure in this regard or breakdown in the relationships at the top level could cause 
considerable damage to the business. The potential impact is partially mitigated through the 
Company’s highly flexible resource base and its expansion continues to reduce its exposure  
to any single large client.
The City and investors
Keywords floated on AIM in July 2013 with an expressed set of objectives of growing the business 
organically and by acquisition. Should the Company lose the confidence of investors, the Company’s 
rating will suffer and this in turn will affect its ability to raise money for or place shares to pay for 
acquisitions. However, the Company makes every effort to communicate regularly with investors 
via announcements and face-to-face contact and this effective communication of the continued 
opportunities for growth in the sector, how it continues to execute on its stated strategy and 
successfully integrate the businesses it acquires should continue to maintain the confidence  
of its investors.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Keywords is a fast-growing but relatively small Group operating 
in a widespread geography. The markets we operate in are 
fragmented in terms of the suppliers of services but our client 
base is relatively concentrated with a number of very large, 
global companies at the head and a large tail of small, 
independent developers.
Managing risks efficiently
The market is highly dynamic, with technology, 
business models and consumer tastes evolving 
constantly. In this environment Keywords has 
the objective of becoming the leading global 
supplier of localisation, testing, audio, art, 
engineering and other related services to  
the industry and sees the following risks  
as it pursues this objective.
The principal risks associated with the 
Group’s strategy can be divided into:
• General business risks for any 
international company;
• Industry-related risks; and
• Those specific to the Keywords  
Group and its strategy.
Beyond the general business risks associated 
with any international company, the principal 
risks related to the industry or more specifically 
to Keywords and its strategy, as identified  
by the management and the Board, are set  
out below.
Internal risks (including links to strategy) Movement
Acquisitions
Keywords has an active acquisition strategy to reinforce its global growth. Managing such acquisitions 
successfully and embedding the Keywords culture is a crucial ingredient of success, and as Keywords 
continues to make larger acquisitions, the risk associated is heightened. Failure to do so will have 
adverse consequences such as management distraction, disposal and reduced profit. Since IPO,  
the Company has involved a broader number of senior managers in the acquisition and integration 
process, building on the considerable experience that exists at Board level thus providing further 
bandwidth to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions. 
Service delivery
   
Most of Keywords’ services are of a time-critical nature with delays or service delivery failures 
potentially impacting the development or launch plans for games. Timely delivery and the resourcing 
flexibility to enable delivery to tight deadlines has been an integral part of the Company’s modus 
operandi, and Keywords’ approach to project management is applied across the Group. With the 
expansion of the Group, measures are being taken to assess ongoing delivery performance beyond 
the regular project post-mortems that are routinely conducted.
Cross contamination
 
As the Group succeeds in delivering multiple services to the same clients, so the risk of failure  
in one service line contaminating the relationship with the client across the other service lines 
increases. Whilst the introduction of co-development adds to this risk in some respects, it also 
helps to mitigate it. Adhering to Keywords’ strong standards of delivery and efficient communication 
across service lines is key to managing this risk. 31 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
External risks (including links to strategy) (continued) Movement
Sudden business 
interruption
Keywords is a global business and needs to minimise business interruptions and be able to continue 
servicing customers. This threat could be internal such as a major failure in its IT systems but also 
external such as the Group experienced and managed during the 2011 Tokyo earthquake and 
tsunami. The Group’s multiple, full-service, delivery hubs provide for a good level of contingency 
and, supported by a solid business continuity plan and comprehensive insurance, the effects of 
such disasters can be managed.
Technology and  
information security
 
The Company uses various third party and proprietary tools and technologies for process control 
and productivity purposes. Continued investment in these tools is important to ensure the Groups’ 
effectiveness. New technologies for automated testing, machine translation and crowdsourcing, 
could pose a threat to the Group in the long-term. The Company participates directly and with 
clients in various pilot programmes for new technologies to keep abreast of the state-of-the-art.  
The industry requires the highest standards of security within a company offering services such  
as Keywords. Cyber security breaches may lead to piracy, disruption of clients’ marketing plans,  
loss of competitive edge and could result in compensation claims. Keywords maintains physical  
and data security policies and procedures which are regularly audited by its larger clients.
Global political risk  
and uncertainty
We operate and own assets in a large number of geographic regions and countries, and, as a result, 
we are exposed to a wide range of political, economic, regulatory, social and tax environments. 
Policies or laws in the countries in which we do business may change in a manner that may be 
adverse for us, even those with stable political environments e.g. many governments have sought 
additional sources of revenue by increasing rates of taxation. However the diversification and spread 
of activities geographically mitigates the risk of disruption in any one location and the tax strategy 
adopted is designed for improved efficiency and we eschew aggressive or artificial practices.
The Board has assessed the risk of Brexit on Keywords and concluded that for now this 
constitutes a minor risk for the Group as its UK operations are small relative to the rest of  
the Group.
Financial risks (including links to strategy) Movement
Adequate financial and 
operational controls
 
As a business like Keywords grows rapidly, global financial controls and regular audits need to  
be in place to ensure smooth, timely and accurate reporting to satisfy the relevant accounting 
bodies to local branches as well as the Board. Failure to accurately report or forecast financial 
results through error or fraud would damage the Group’s reputation. Therefore, the Group has 
invested and continues to invest in its financial reporting functions to facilitate strong reporting 
and management control as it grows.
Human resources/ 
talent management
 
Keywords management structure has been fundamental to the Group’s success, enabled by 
embedding a Group culture that binds the teams together, with a common set of standards.  
In addition, special emphasis is placed on workplace harmony and the prevention of any forms  
of discrimination, harassment or malpractice in the workplace recognising that any sense of 
dissatisfaction can be very disruptive. As a separate dimension, failure to attract, retain or develop 
high-quality entrepreneurial management across the business could impact on the attainment  
of strategic objectives. The Group is focused on these areas with the implementation of globally 
managed service lines, management development and remuneration programmes, incorporating 
long and short-term incentives. Regular staff surveys are undertaken and a new Global HR Director 
was appointed in 2017 to further drive improvements and be alert to employee concerns or 
departures from the spirit of the Keywords culture. 
Legal and ethical 
standards
A material failure to comply with applicable legal and ethical standards could result in penalties, 
costs, reputational harm and damage to relationships with suppliers and customers. The Group 
promotes a culture of “Doing the Right Thing” in all activities. Business conduct guidelines are  
in place and are supported by more detailed policies and procedures where needed, including 
anti-bribery, whistleblowing, competition, inside information, confidentiality and fair dealing with 
customers and suppliers.  32 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

The Annual Report & Financial Statements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and 
financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can cause results 
and developments to differ materially from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available  
at the date of preparation of this Annual Report & Financial Statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-
looking statements. Nothing in this Annual Report & Financial Statements should be construed as a profit forecast. 
Dividends
The results for the year are set out on page 46. Dividends paid and proposed are set out on page 62. The Board is proposing a final dividend  
of 0.98p per share following the payment of an interim dividend of 0.48p per share in October 2017.

Ginman and David Broderick.

Going concern
In view of the Group’s resources, cash at 31 December 2017 of €30.4m, cash flow from operations in 2017 of €13.6m, and the overall financial 
condition of the Group, the Directors have reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation for the

A list of Directors, their interests in the ordinary share capital of the Company, their interests in its long-term performance share plan and 
details of their options over the ordinary share capital of the Company are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 40.

or any of its operating companies at any time during the year.
The names of all persons who, at the year end, were Directors of the Company can be found on page 32 under the Board of Directors.
Corporate governance
Compliance with UK Corporate Governance Code
Keywords is committed to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group. As a company whose shares are traded on AIM, it is 
not required to comply with all the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2016 (“the Code”). However, the Board recognises the 
importance of, and is committed to, ensuring that effective corporate governance procedures are in place as appropriate for a public company 
of its size and complexity and in the light of the risks and challenges it faces.
The Group’s corporate governance arrangements are set out below:
The Board
The Board is comprised of two Executive and five Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that Ross Graham, David Reeves, George 
Fornay and Charlotta Ginman are independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect their independent judgement.
The Board is responsible for the overall management of Keywords, our strategy and long-term objectives. It provides leadership to Keywords 
having regard to the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Charlotta Ginman. Ross Graham and David Reeves are the other Committee members. The Audit Committee  
is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its financial and risk responsibilities. The Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting, risk 
management and internal control procedures. The Audit Committee advises the Board on the appointment and removal of the external auditor 
and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the auditors. The Audit Committee reviews the extent of non-audit services provided 
by the auditors and reviews with them their independence and objectivity.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration of the Chairman, Executive Directors, the Company Secretary 
and senior executives of Keywords.
Governance 
Internal controls and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls. The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Directors believe that the Group has internal control systems in place appropriate to the size and nature of the business. The key elements are:
• Group Board Meetings, at a minimum of eight times per year, with reports from and discussions with senior executives on performance and 
key risk areas in the business;
• Monthly financial reporting, for the Group and for each subsidiary, of actual performance compared to budget and the prior year;
• Annual budget setting; and
• A defined organisational structure with appropriate delegation of authority.
Substantial shareholdings
At 31 December 2017, the Company had been notified, in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, of the following interests in 
its ordinary share capital:
Name Shares %
P.E.Q. Holdings 4,000,736 6.5%
Octopus Investments 3,417,183 5.5%
Andrew Day 3,386,342 5.3%

Future developments
Important events since the financial year end are described on page 29 of the Strategic Report and future developments are described in the 
strategy section of the Strategic Report on page 10.
People and organisation
Keywords is, and always has been, dependent on the quality and commitment of its entire staff to provide and maintain the high levels of 
services expected by the Groups’ clients.
The average headcount reached a peak of 4,025 in December 2017. Keywords permanent staff complement averaged 3,167 during 2017.  
This permanent headcount is supplemented with employees on short-term contracts as activity changes throughout the year.
The Group continues to give full and fair consideration to applications for employment made by disabled persons, having regard to their 
respective aptitudes and abilities. The policy includes, where practicable, the continued employment of those who may become disabled 
during their employment and the provision of training and career development and promotion, where appropriate. The Group has continued 
its policy of employee involvement by making information available to employees on matters of concern to them. Many employees are 
stakeholders in the Company through participation in share option schemes and a long-term performance share plan. 
The Group has not disclosed further details on employment of disabled persons or employee involvement as it has fewer than 250 employees 
within the UK.
Corporate responsibility
Keywords seeks to be a socially responsible Group which has a positive impact on the communities in which operates. By the nature of the 
business, we employ a diverse workforce, with many nationalities. No discrimination is tolerated and we endeavour to give all employees the 
opportunity to develop their capabilities. We provide an excellent working environment, the latest technology and appropriate training. 36 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report & Financial Statements.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union (“EU”).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare 
financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment 
Market.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• State whether IFRS as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and 
Company financial statements respectively; and
• Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors as at the date of this report, whose names and functions are listed in the Board of Directors on page 32, confirm that:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• The Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial statements 
are published on the Group’s websites in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination  
of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s websites is the 
responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

incentive plan, which provide a clear link between pay and our key strategic priorities.
The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors have a duty to act in the best interests of their shareholders when determining remuneration. It is their responsibility  
to promote the long-term success of the Company while also considering the employees, suppliers, customers and other external factors which

Executive Directors will be responsible for developing and implementing remuneration strategy for the Group. Non-Executive Directors will be 
responsible for constructively reviewing and contributing to this strategy.

The remit of the Committee is primarily to determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the 
Company’s Executive Directors and the Senior Management of the Group.

of the Chairman of the Board is determined by the Executive Directors with the Remuneration Committee Chairman. The remuneration of the 
Non-Executives is a matter for the Executive members of the Board.
No Director or Senior Manager is involved in any discussion or decision about his own remuneration.

The Remuneration Committee is planned to meet at least three times a year. In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Remuneration Committee 
met on three occasions.
Directors’ emoluments and pension contributions

Awards of shares have vested or will vest on the dates shown subject to meeting the performance criteria, of which the only vesting condition is 
continuous service. In the event that a Director ceases to be an employee of the Group for reasons other than death, retirement, redundancy, 
injury, ill-health or disability before the vesting date, then the rights to the award will lapse, unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise. The Option shall lapse the day before the seventh anniversary of the Date of Grant, assuming it is not exercised before then and no 
event occurs to cause it to lapse earlier under the Rules. The fair value of the option is amortised over the vesting period, with one-third of the 
options vesting after two years, one-third after three years and the balance vests after four years.
Awards are not subject to further performance conditions once granted.
Transactions with Directors
During the year, there were no material transactions between the Company and the Directors, other than their emoluments.
All transactions between the Group and the Directors are set out in the Notes to the Financial Statements, including note 22 on related party

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
Policy and principles
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company’s policy on the structure of Executive Directors’ and if required, senior management’s 
remuneration. The objectives of this policy are to:
• Reward Executive Directors and senior management in a manner that ensures that they are properly incentivised and motivated to perform 
in the best interests of shareholders.
• Provide a level of remuneration required to attract and motivate high-calibre Executive Directors and senior management of appropriate calibre.
• Encourage value creation through consistent and transparent alignment of incentive arrangements with the agreed company strategy over 
the long term.
• Ensure the total remuneration packages awarded to Executive Directors, comprising both performance-related and non-performance-related 
remuneration, is designed to motivate the individual, align interests with shareholders and comply with corporate governance best practice.
The Board and the Remuneration Committee believe the foregoing objectives are best achieved by a remuneration structure whereby: 
• Basic pay is set at a below median level albeit sufficient for the challenges and pressures of the role.
• Annual bonuses are set at modest levels with a maximum of 30% of basic on the premise that an annual bonus doesn’t influence the 
behaviour or commitment of a senior executive.
• Long-term incentives are the means by which executives can earn significant rewards if, but only if, shareholders likewise have obtained  
a good return. 
Remuneration components
Various remuneration components are combined to ensure an appropriate and balanced remuneration package which reflects the size and 
importance of the business unit, the executive’s experience, responsibility and position in the Company as well as market practice. For this the 
Remuneration Committee takes into account the performance of the individual, comparisons with peer companies and, where considered 
appropriate, reports from external independent consultants.
The remuneration components are comprised of the following elements:
• Fixed remuneration (basic salary);
• Performance-based remuneration (variable salary in the form of an annual bonus);
• Pension contribution;
• Other benefits; and
• Long-term incentives (in the form of performance shares or share options).
For Non-Executive Directors there is only one component, a base fee determined by the Executive Directors.
Basic salaries and benefits
Basic salaries are initially determined to reflect the role, and the responsibility of the individual within that role, while also upholding the 
principle of paying no more than is necessary (below the median).
The basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior management are reviewed annually having regard to personal performance, Company 
performance, significant changes in their responsibilities and competitive market practice. With effect from 27 March 2018 salary increases of 
10% have been awarded to the Executive Directors, Andrew Day and David Broderick. These are explained by the very material rise in the size of 
the business year-on-year. Even after the salary increases both Executive Directors have a base salary and maximum bonus below the median 
salary for a company of equivalent size and therefore are in line with the Remuneration Policy as set out elsewhere.
Performance-based (annual) bonus
Under current arrangements, which will be reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors and senior management are 
eligible to participate in a bonus scheme. The bonus amount is a percentage of salary of up to 30% which is subject to the attainment of specific 
targets set for each individual. The portion of bonus earned in any one year depends on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of each 
individual’s performance and the overall performance of the Company against predetermined turnover and profitability targets for the year.
Performance targets are weighted 80% towards the Company’s financial performance and 20% towards personal performance (however, if the 
Company’s financial performance is considered to be unsatisfactory the 20% for personal performance is likely to be foregone).
The Remuneration Committee will review targets and the weighting of performance measures each year.
The bonus may not exceed the agreed percentage of the fixed salary, which level can only be achieved at a weighted target achievement of 100%. 
Pension contribution
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee the executive directors and senior management may participate in a pension scheme 
facilitated by the Company. The Company does not operate any pension scheme or make pension provision for Non-Executive Directors. 40 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Governance
Benefits
During the period since incorporation, the Company has not contributed to any employment related benefits. 
Long-term incentives
Share options
Share options programmes are in place for permanent members of staff, including the Senior Management. The focus of the share option 
programmes is to retain talent and create long-term shareholder value consistent with fulfilment of the Company’s long-term strategic goals.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The purpose of the LTIP is to incentivise delivery against total shareholder return. Share awards further the alignment of executives’ and 
shareholders’ interests.
LTIP grants are made annually to a range of senior employees across the Company. Awards are made in the form of nil-value share options which 
vest subject to performance conditions. Performance conditions are measured over three financial years and are not retested. Conditions are 
reviewed annually. 
Leaver treatment
Fair treatment will be extended to departing executives. Executives who resign or are dismissed for cause are, by default, not eligible for an 
annual bonus if they have left or are under notice at date of payment, and forfeit all unvested share options or LTIP shares.
At the Committee’s discretion good leavers (normally including such circumstances as retirement, death, disability and redundancy) may be  
eligible for an annual bonus for the proportion of the bonus year served. However, performance will be tested in line with the normal performance 
schedule. Similarly good leavers, including those who have served as Executive Directors, may be allowed to exercise a proportion of unvested

Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report continued 41 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Keywords Studios PLC (the “parent company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the year ended 
31 December 2017 which comprise the Group and Parent Company Statements of Financial Position, the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Group and Parent Company Statements of Cash Flows, The Group and Parent Company Statements of Changes in Equity, and the 
Notes to the Financial Statements including a summary of significant accounting policies. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and 
of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are 
independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, 
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with  
these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the 
Group’s or the parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months 
from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements  
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, 
including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts  
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
1 Revenue recognition – cut-off 
Key audit matter
Although the majority of the Groups revenue contracts are reasonably straightforward and non-complex in nature, there is a material work in 
progress balance as at 31 December 2017 (€5.1m). We focused on this area due to the risk of management manipulation of the timing of revenue 
recognition and the cut-off relating to work in progress at the year end. 
Related disclosures
Refer to note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for the accounting policies of the Group in relation to Revenue Recognition. 
Audit response
We have designed our audit procedures to ensure that for each material revenue stream, the correct accounting procedures have been applied and 
revenue has been recognised correctly in accordance with the Group Revenue Recognition policy. We have completed a substantive based audit 
approach across all full scope locations and completed specific audit procedures on a sample basis on less significant components of the Group. 
Our procedures included validating a sample of transactions both throughout the year and around the year end, to ensure that the stage of 
completion and therefore work in progress is reflective of the underling project status. We have validated these transactions to sales orders 
and contracts from customers, project status evidence, and subsequent billing. When examining samples of transactions around the year end 
we have ensured that the revenue has been recognised in the correct period.

2 Business combinations
Key audit matter
The Group has entered into a significant number of acquisitions and business combinations throughout the year, which have had a material 
and extensive impact on the Groups’ financial performance and position. 
Following the purchase price allocations (in which identifiable assets and liabilities assumed were recognised at fair value), €66.8m of goodwill 
has been recognised. The fair value of certain identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is different from 
their carrying amounts in the acquired statements of financial position which can give rise to fair value adjustments as part of the purchase price 
allocations of these business combinations. Accordingly, the cumulative acquisitions are material and significant judgement is required in relation 
to the purchase price allocations including the resulting goodwill.
Management, determined the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and notably the value of the customer relationships. The valuation 
of these assets were primarily based upon the expected future cash flows related to these acquisitions. 
A number of these acquisitions have also included deferred consideration in the form of shares and other cash payments at future dates, which 
add further complexity with regard to the acquisition date fair value of such consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange 
for the acquisitions and business combinations. 
Related disclosures
Refer to note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for the accounting policy in relation to business combinations. In addition, detailed 
disclosures have been made in relation to each business combination in note 28 to the financial statements. 
Audit response
We have reviewed the underlying contracts and share purchase agreements to each acquisition to ensure that the basis for treatment of the 
acquisitions is in accordance with the accounting policy and International Financial Reporting Standard 3 – Business Combinations. 
We have assessed the carrying value of each material balance at the date of acquisition, and have reviewed managements’ assessments of the 
fair value of the asset and liabilities acquired, and in particular, the methodology applied in the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. 
Our procedures include:
• We reviewed the methodology applied to identify the categories of intangible assets;
• We validated that the cash flow forecasts used in the valuation are consistent with information approved by the Board and have reviewed 
the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts in order to assess the reliance which can be placed upon managements forecasting; 
• We have challenged the key assumptions such as the growth factors and discount rates by comparing them to relevant market rates and 
historic acquisitions to verify that management had been consistent in its approach to valuations; and
• We evaluated the adequacy of the acquisition disclosures in the Group’s financial statements.
In addition, we have examined the terms of all business combinations to ensure that the fair value of any deferred/contingent consideration is 
treated appropriately in accordance with the Group accounting policy and IFRS 3.
We also examined the key post-combination employment contracts of former shareholders of the acquired entities, reviewing the substance of 
the transactions in order to ensure they have been appropriately accounted for in line with the Group accounting policy and the requirements 
of IFRS 3.

3 Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets
Key audit matter
As a result of both the current year, and prior year acquisitions, the Group has amassed significant intangible assets and goodwill balances. 
These balances are material to the financial statements, with goodwill carrying value of €109m, and intangibles carrying value of €23.5m. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. Other intangible assets are tested for impairment when a triggering event has 
been identified that indicates the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets is significant 
to our audit due to the fact that the impairment test calculations are based on several key assumptions which are estimated by management, 
and are by nature judgemental. Key assumptions include the expected future cash flows for the forecasting period, the discount rates and 
perpetual growth rate.
The Directors have concluded that there is one cash generating unit (“CGU”) in the Group, for the purposes of impairment assessment. 
Disclosures relating to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are enclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
Related disclosures
Refer to note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for the accounting policy in relation to business combinations, intangible assets and 
goodwill. In addition, detailed disclosures have been made in relation to each business combination in note 28 to the financial statements. 
Detailed disclosures are made in note 11 relating to goodwill, and note 12 in relation to intangible assets. 
Audit response
We have reviewed management’s assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. We have challenged the Directors 
assumptions in relation to CGU identification, cash flow forecasting, discount rates applied, and future growth rates. 
Our procedures included:
• We have validated that the CGU identified is the lowest level at which management monitors goodwill and intangible assets;
• We have verified the accuracy of the cash flow forecasts used, and ensured that these represent those which are reviewed by the Board; 
• We have reviewed and assessed the accuracy of the historical forecasts prepared by the Group to ensure that reliance can be placed upon 
their accuracy;
• We have assessed the key estimates and inputs into the discounted cash flow models, including the growth rates assumed, and verified this 
where possible to supporting evidence such as post year-end activities; 
• We have completed our own sensitivity analyses in relation to the cash flow models and have stress tested all key assumptions used; and
• We have considered the appropriateness of the disclosures relating to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets in the financial statements. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluation the effect of misstatements. We consider 
materiality to be the magnitude by which misstatements, including omissions, could influence the economic decisions of reasonable users that 
are taken on the basis of the financial statements. 
Importantly, misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial, as we also take into account the nature of identified 
misstatements, and in particular the circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole.
We determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole to be €1.2m, which represents 10% of profit before income tax and represents 
less than 1% of equity. We consider profit before income tax to be the most significant determinant of the Group’s financial performance used by 
shareholders and other users and therefore consider this as an appropriate basis for materiality. Our materiality is higher than the level we set 
for the year ended 31 December 2016 (€0.9m), due to the higher profits of the Group. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all individual differences identified during the course of our  
audit in excess of €60,000 (2016: €47,000). We also agreed to report differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting  
on qualitative grounds.  44 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Financial 
Statements
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement identified at Group level. The Group has operations in 21 locations, and 55 wholly owned 
subsidiary entities. 
Based on that assessment, we have completed full scope audit procedures in relation to the following entities; Keywords Studios PLC, VMC 
Consulting Corporation, Volt Canada Inc, Volt Canada Sciences BC, Keywords International Inc, Synthesis SGSS, Sillabit S.R.L and Binari Sonori 
S.R.L. In addition, specific audit procedures have been completed in relation to certain material balances and transaction streams in Babel 
Games Services Inc, Kite Team SRL, GVGS Europe Inc and Keywords International Co. Limited (Japan) and Sperasoft Inc, Sperasoft Studio LLC, 
and Alchemic Dream Inc. The above entities represent 75% of Group revenues and 87% of Group profits before tax.
Whilst materiality for the financial statements as a whole was €1.2m, each component of the Group was audited to a lower level of materiality. 
Audits of these components were performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate to 
the relative scale of the business concerned. 
The Group auditor, BDO Dublin, has audited Keywords Studios PLC, Keywords International Limited, Keywords International Inc, VMC Consulting 
Corporation and Volt Canada Inc directly. Their involvement in the work performed by other component auditors varies by location and involves, 
at a minimum, direction of the audit procedures to be completed, and review of the reports received in relation to the results of the audit work 
undertaken by component audit teams. 
In the current year, the Senior Statutory auditor or senior members of the Group audit team have visited the following reporting locations on 
planned visits: Japan (Keywords International Co. Limited) and Spain (Kite Team SL). These visits are to direct and review the work performed 
by component auditors. 
At the parent company level we have also tested the consolidation process and carried out additional procedures to confirm our conclusion 
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject 
to full scope or specific procedures. 
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other 
than the financial statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information 
and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have 
performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 36, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary 
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,  
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Auditor’s Report.

Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements
1 Basis of Preparation
Keywords Studios PLC (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in the UK. The consolidated financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) made up to 31 December 2017. The Group was formed on 8 July 2013 when 
Keywords Studios PLC (formerly Keywords Studios Limited) acquired the entire share capital of Keywords International Limited through the 
issue of 31,901,332 ordinary shares. 
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Accounting Standards and interpretations (collectively IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as 
adopted by the European Union (“adopted IFRSs”). 
The financial statements have been prepared in thousands (€’000) and the financial statements are presented in Euro (€) which is the 
functional currency of the Group.
New Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Effective from 1 January 2017
The Group has applied the requirements of IAS 7, Disclosure Initiative, effective from 1 January 2017. The disclosures are included within note 30.
None of the amendments to Standards that are effective from 1 January 2017 had a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements.
New Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Not Yet Effective
Impact of IFRS 9
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, is mandatorily effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted.  
The Group has not adopted IFRS 9 early, however, is currently assessing the impact of its implementation. 
IFRS 9 establishes the measurement principles for both financial assets and financial liabilities, at both initial recognition and subsequent 
re-measurement. 
Financial assets
The majority of the Group’s financial assets include:
• Cash;
• Short-term receivables including trade receivables, accrued income, and multimedia tax credits; and
• Intragroup balances and receivables (parent company only).
These assets are considered to be part of the “hold to collect” model, and therefore measured at amortised cost. 
Our financial assets are short-term in their nature, and no receivables have significant credit terms or interest charged accordingly. 
The Group is expecting to apply the simplified approach to applying lifetime expected credit losses on certain financial assets, and while our 
assessment is ongoing, we are not expecting a material difference to the carrying value of our financial assets as a result of the implementation 
of the new standard. 
From the Company Statement of Financial Position perspective, we are assessing the impact which the standard will have on the valuation of 
our receivables due from intergroup entities. 
Financial Liabilities
The most significant of the Group’s financial liabilities include:
• Bank loans and borrowings;
• Trade payables; and
• Contingent consideration arising as part of business combinations. 
The Group expects to continue to value bank loans and borrowings at amortised cost, and to value contingent consideration at fair value 
through profit and loss model (“FVTPL”).
When valuing the financial liabilities under the FVTPL model, the Group will need to assess any changes in its own credit status, however, this is 
not expected to result in any significant changes to the valuation of such financial liabilities. 
Impact of IFRS 15
On review of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the five key points to recognise revenue have been assessed: 
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer;
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
Step 3: Determine the transaction price;
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. 54 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC 
Financial 
Statements
Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements continued
1 Basis of Preparation continued
On the basis of the contracts in place, the Group do not envision a material impact on the financial statements once IFRS 15 is implemented. 
However, given the acquisitive nature of the Group, and the new revenue streams, this process of assessment will be ongoing.
Impact of IFRS 16
There are a number of operating leases across the Group. In accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, their change in treatment in the financial 
statements from 1 January 2019 will impact the Statement of Financial Position, increasing both long-term assets and liabilities.
On the adoption of IFRS 16 on Leases on 1 January 2019, the Group will recognise right-of-use assets and related liabilities for all material lease 
arrangements over 12 months in duration. Material lease arrangements in the Group relate primarily to leases on premises. The main impact 
on the financial statements will be to increase both assets and liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position in relation to leases currently 
considered as operating leases at present value. In the Statement of Changes in Equity, leases will be recognised in the future as capital 
expenditure on the purchasing side and will no longer be recorded as operating expenses. As a result the operating expenses under otherwise 
identical circumstances will decrease, while depreciation and amortisation and the interest expense increase. This will lead to an improvement 
in EBITDA. Based on leases outstanding at the end of 2017, the Group’s initial assessment of the impact is that the comparable additional Asset 
and Liability will be in the order of €17m. The Groups’ Cash Flow Statement will include additional detail on the Cash Flow Statement to separate 
Interest repayments and capital repayments on leases.
2 Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation
Where the Company has control over an investee, it is classified as a subsidiary. The Company controls an investee if all three of the following 
elements are present: power over the investee, exposure to variable returns from the investee, and the ability of the investor to use its power 
to affect those variable returns. Control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these 
elements of control.
De-facto control exists in situations where the Company has the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee without 
holding the majority of the voting rights. In determining whether de-facto control exists the Company considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances, including:
• The size of the Company’s voting rights relative to both the size and dispersion of other parties who hold voting rights;
• Substantive potential voting rights held by the Company and by other parties;
• Other contractual arrangements; and
• Historic patterns in voting attendance.
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated in full.
The acquisition of Keywords International Limited was deemed to be a “combination under common control” as ultimate control before and 
after the acquisition was the same. As a result, these transactions were outside the scope of IFRS 3 “Business combinations” and have been 
accounted for under the principles of merger accounting as set out under UK GAAP from the date on which control is obtained until the date  
on which control ceases. 
As part of the Group reconstruction in 2013, the Company issued 31,901,332 shares at a value of £1.23 each, being the flotation price, as part  
of a share for share exchange with the shareholders of Keywords International Limited. The £0.01 nominal value of the shares issues was 
accounted for in Issued Share Capital. On the 2013 consolidated balance sheet, the difference between the nominal value of shares issued by 
the Company as consideration for the shares in Keywords International Limited, and the nominal value of the shares in Keywords International 
Limited was treated as a merger reserve arising on Group reconstruction. On the Company balance sheet, the excess of net book value of the 
assets held by Keywords International Limited, at the date of the share for share exchange, over the nominal value of the shares issued was 
treated as a merger reserve.
Business Combinations
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In the Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values  
at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control  
is obtained. They are deconsolidated until the date on which control ceases.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and is split between current liabilities and long-term 
liabilities depending on when it is due. At each balance sheet date the fair value of the contingent consideration will be revalued and any change 
will be recognised in the Statements of Comprehensive Income. 
For deferred consideration which is to be provided for by the issue of a fixed number of shares at a future defined date, where there is no 
obligation on Keywords to offer a variable number of shares, the deferred consideration is to be classified as an Equity Arrangement and the 
value of the shares is fixed at the date of the acquisition. 55 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over, in the case of business combinations completed prior to 1 January 
2010, the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired and, in the case of business 
combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired.
For business combinations completed prior to 1 January 2010, cost comprised the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. Changes in the estimated value of contingent consideration arising on business 
combinations completed by this date were treated as an adjustment to cost and, in consequence, resulted in a change in the carrying value 
of goodwill.
For business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010, cost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity 
instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree plus, if the business combination is achieved in stages, the 
fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the 
case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, re-measured subsequently through profit or loss. For business combinations 
completed on or after 1 January 2010, direct costs of acquisition are recognised immediately as an expense.
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, separately identified from goodwill acquired as part of a business combination, are initially stated at fair value. The fair value 
attributed is determined by discounting the expected future cashflows to be generated from net margin on the business from the main customers 
taken on at acquisition. The assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which is deemed to be five years.
There are no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Impairment
Impairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year 
end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group  
of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows; its cash generating units (“CGUs”). Goodwill is allocated  
on initial recognition to each of the Group’s CGUs that are expected to benefit from a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill. 
The Group has one CGU. This CGU represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group and the lowest level at which 
management captures information for internal management reporting purposes about the benefits of the goodwill. Impairment charges are 
included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the Statement of Financial Position and on the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include 
cash on hand, on call deposits with financial institutions.
Foreign Currency
Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate 
(their “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. The functional currency for the Company is Euro. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into Euro at rates approximating to this ruling when the transactions took 
place. All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the  
rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas 
operations at actual rate are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign exchange reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in profit or loss in Group entities’ separate financial statements on the translation of long-term items forming 
part of the Group’s net investment in the overseas operation concerned are classified to other comprehensive income and accumulated in the 
foreign exchange reserve on consolidation.
Exchange differences on capital loans are recorded as other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation 
up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 56 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognised represents the consideration received or receivable for the rendering of services, net of sales taxes, rebates discounts and 
after eliminating intercompany sales. Services are provided based on agreed client instructions and when projects are in progress at the period 
end, revenue is recognised to the extent that services have been provided net of any provisions. 
Revenue on services provided is recognised on the basis of words translated, studio time completed, testing hours or player support hours 
finished, or milestones reached in art creation or engineering as a proportion of the estimate total to complete the projects, by the expected 
revenue accruing on completion.
This revenue recognition policy is unchanged at the full adoption of IFRS 15 from 1 January 2018, as the performance obligations on 
services provided are considered as performance obligations satisfied over time, in accordance with S 35 of IFRS 15, Revenue from  
Contracts with Customers.
Revenue in relation to software licence sales is recognised over the period of the use by the client of the licence. 
Where there are separate performance obligations inherent in a contract, the related revenue streams are considered separately for 
performance measurement.
MMTC Grants
The multimedia tax credits received in Montreal on testing services are a credit against staff costs. Accordingly they are treated as a deduction 
against direct costs. The nature of the grants are such that they are not dependent on taxable profits.
Share-based Payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees and Directors under a share options plan and a long-term 
incentive plan (“LTIP”). 
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. At each reporting date, the Company revises 
its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact 
of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. The Company has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options 
in cash.
Where share-based payments are issued to employees of subsidiary companies, the annual cost of the option is expensed in the holding 
company and recharged to the subsidiary company through intercompany charge.
Share Option Plan
These are measured at fair value, taking into account market vesting conditions but not non-market vesting conditions on the grant date  
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which calculates the fair value of an option by using the vesting period, the expected volatility of  
the share price, the current share price, the exercise price and the risk-free interest rate. The fair value of the option is amortised over the 
vesting period, with one-third of the options vesting after two years, one-third after three years, and the balance vest after four years. The only 
vesting condition is continuous service. There is no requirement to revalue the option at any subsequent date. The charge that is recognised is 
adjusted to reflect failure to vest due to non-achievement of a non-market vesting condition but not failure to vest due to the non-achievement 
of a market vesting condition.
LTIP
An alternative share plan was introduced to give awards to Directors and staff, subject to outperforming the Numis Small Cap Index (excluding 
Investment Trusts) in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period. For the awards up to 2015, there were three award levels: one-third of 
the share options vest if the Company shall exceed the Total Shareholder Returns of the Numis Small Cap Index by not less than 10%, two-thirds if 
the shareholder return exceeds by over 20% and 100% if the shareholder return exceeds by over 30%. This was amended for the 2016 and 2017 
awards to 100% if the shareholder return exceeds by over 45%, and a pro-rated return between 10% and 100% if the shareholder return exceeds 
by between 0% and 45%.
These are measured at fair value, taking into account market vesting conditions but not non-market vesting conditions, at the date of grant, 
measured by using the Monte Carlo binomial model. The charge that is recognised is adjusted to reflect failure to vest due to non-achievement 
of a non-market vesting condition but not failure to vest due to the non-achievement of a market vesting condition. 
Dividend Distribution
Final dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Group’s shareholders. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxation
Provision for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the tax legislations and applicable tax rates in force at the reporting date in the 
countries in which the Group companies have been incorporated. 57 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised where the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial 
position differs from its tax base, except for differences arising on:
• The initial recognition of goodwill;
• The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting or taxable profit; and
• Investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the difference and 
it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of the asset or liability is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and 
are expected to apply when the deferred tax liabilities/(assets) are settled/(recovered).
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the 
deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on either:
• The same taxable Group company; or
• Different Group entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the 
liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled  
or recovered.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprise computers, leasehold improvements, and office furniture and equipment, and are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Carrying amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written 
down immediately to its recoverable amount.
Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are valued at fair value on the date of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of fixed assets on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. 
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
%
Computers and software 33.33
Office furniture and equipment 10.00
Building and leasehold improvements over the length of the lease
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are included in the consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income.
Financial Assets
Loans and Receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of services to customers (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary 
asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue and are 
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
The Group’s receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position.
Trade receivables, which principally represent amounts due from customers, are initially recognised, thereafter, are recognised at amortised 
cost. An estimate for doubtful debts is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according 
to the original terms of receivables. Bad debts are written off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents are necessary for the working capital requirements of the Group. They include cash in hand, deposits held at call 
with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments. Where cash is on deposit with maturity dates greater than three months, it is 
disclosed as short-term investments.
Share Capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.  
The Group’s ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Financial Liabilities
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. 58 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

2 Significant Accounting Policies continued
Leased Assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group (“operating lease”), the total rental payables are 
charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Finance Leases
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to the Group (a “finance lease”), 
the asset is treated as if it had been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as an asset is the lower of the fair value of the leased 
property and the present value of the minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. The corresponding lease commitment is 
shown as a liability. Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. The interest element is charged to the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income over the period of the lease and is calculated so that it represents a constant proportion of the lease liability. The 
capital element reduces the balance owed to the lessor.
Employee Benefit Trust
Ordinary shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the parent company under the Terms of the Share Option Plan are 
deducted from equity on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Income. No gain or loss is recognised in relation to the purchase, 
sale, issue or cancellation of the parent company’s ordinary shares.
3 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that effect the 
application of policies and reported amounts.
The areas requiring the use of estimates and critical judgements that may significantly impact the Group’s earnings and financial position the 
computation of income taxes, the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisitions, the valuation of multimedia tax credits and  
the valuation of the defined retirement benefits for employees in Italy. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based  
on historic experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates and assumptions.
Income Taxes
The Group is subject to income tax in several jurisdictions and judgement may be required in determining the provision for income taxes. 
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain.  
As a result, the Company recognises tax liabilities based on an understanding of taxation legislation in particular jurisdictions and any related 
estimates of whether taxes and/or interest will be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of 
complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,  
such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Arising on Acquisition
The value of goodwill and intangible assets recognised on the Group’s acquisitions during 2017, at €67m and €19m respectively, were derived 
from the projected cashflows for those businesses at the time of acquisition, the balance sheet information provided and on management 
forecasts. The accuracy of the valuation would therefore be compromised by any differences between the forecasts and the levels of business 
activity that the entity may be able to generate.
On an annual basis, the full value of intangibles is assessed through an impairment review.
Multimedia Tax Credits
The submissions for the repayment of Multimedia Tax Credits in Montreal are made on an annual basis to Investment Quebec and Revenue 
Quebec. Both the costs and basis of the claim are subject to audit by the authorities prior to approval and payment of the claim. While the 
Group complete a detailed exercise in relation to the claim and to the accrual there may be occasions where the actuals amounts may be  
more or less than accrued which will lead to a change in the amounts recognised within the financial statements.
Employee Defined Retirement Benefit
In line with statutory requirements in Italy, the subsidiaries in Milan maintain Employee Defined Benefit schemes. On leaving the Company, 
each employee is entitled to 1/13.5 of their final salary for each year of service. 
At year end, the Group commissioned an actuarial valuation of the related liability, based on salaries, length of service and variables including 
employee turnover, estimated salary increases and cost of capital.
The liabilities at year end are recorded as long-term. The actuarial loss is recorded separately as other comprehensive income.

During the period, goodwill arose on the acquisitions of Spov, XLOC, GameSim, Red Hot, Around the Word, asrec, Le Marque Rose, d3t, VMC, 
Sperasoft and LOLA. 
The Group assesses the carrying value of goodwill each year on the basis of budget projections, assumptions on revenue growth rates, current 
gross margins, operating expense growth and effective tax rates. The discount rates used at 12.5% are consistent with the latest valuation of 
WACC which is based on external measures.
The carrying value at €109m compares to the calculated value in use amount of €371m. 64 KEYWORDS STUDIOS PLC

As part of the value in use calculation, management prepared an initial cash flow forecast, approved by the Board of Directors, covering the 
period to 31 December and the following five years. The long-term growth rate of 2% has been used to determine a terminal value for the CGU. 
The result of the value in use calculations was that no impairment is required in this period.

Reserves
The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within owner’s equity:
Reserve Description and purpose
Retained earnings Cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign exchange reserve Gains or losses arising on retranslation of the net assets of the overseas operations into Euro.
Share premium The share premium account is the amount received for shares issued in excess of their nominal value, net  
of share issuance costs.
Share option reserve The share option reserve is the credit arising on share-based payment charges in relation to the Company’s 
share option schemes.
Shares to be issued For deferred consideration which is to be provided for by the issue of a fixed number of shares at a future 
defined date, where there is no obligation on Keywords to offer a variable number of shares, the deferred 
consideration is to be classified as an Equity Arrangement and the value of the shares is fixed at the date  
of the acquisition. 
Merger reserve The merger reserve was initially created following the Group reconstruction, when Keywords Studios PLC 
acquired the Keywords International Limited Group of companies.
When the Group uses Keywords Studios PLC shares as the 100% consideration for the acquisition of an 
entity, the value of the shares in excess of the nominal value, net of share issuance costs are also recorded 
within this reserve, in line with S612 of the 2006 UK Companies Act.
Non-controlling interest reserve The non-controlling interest reserve represents the share of net assets/(liabilities) at the reporting date 
which is attributable to the holders of the non-controlling interest.

19  Employee Defined Benefit Plan
In line with statutory requirements in Italy, the subsidiaries in Milan maintain Employee Defined Benefit schemes. On leaving the Company, 
each employee is entitled to 1/13.5 of their final salary for each year of service. 
At year end, the Group commissioned an actuarial valuation of the related liability, based on salaries, length of service and variables including 
employee turnover, estimated salary increases and cost of capital.
The liabilities at year end are recorded as long term. The actuarial loss is recorded separately as other comprehensive income. The movements 
through the year are detailed:
Group

Service cost 198 193
Interest cost 11 10
Benefits paid (5) (30)
Actuarial loss recorded 25 63
Closing liability position as at 31 December 1,055 826
The Directors have considered the key specific risk factors which the Group faces due to the employee defined benefit plan which is in place. 
Having fully considered all specific elements of these plans the Directors believe that the key issues faced are as follows:
• The plan is currently 100% unfunded, there are no specific assets to meet the future liabilities as they fall due. As such there will be a 
significant cash flow impact as the liabilities must be met with current working capital as they fall due.
The Group has taken no specific actions to mitigate against these factors as due to the long-term nature of the plans it is expected that there 
will be no sudden financial impact on the Groups results caused by any of these factors.
In 2017, the Group expects the costs of the employee benefit plan to be in line with current year levels, as staff levels in the Italian operations 
stay stable. 71 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017
The actuarial valuation is based on the Projected Unit Credit Method, in line with IAS 19.

Assumptions Underlying the Actuarial Valuations and Sensitivities of the Assumptions
For the actuarial valuations the following demographic and economic and financial assumptions were applied:
Demographic Assumptions
• The probabilities of death were derived from the bill of the Italian population by age and sex, as recorded by the Government Statistics 
Office in 2000 and reduced by 25%.
• The probabilities of elimination for absolute and permanent disability of the employee are taken from the disability tables currently used  
in practice separate reinsurance for age and sex.
• The probabilities of employees leaving due to resignations and dismissals in accordance with Company management have been placed at 
4.25% per annum.
• The probabilities of requesting an advance have been estimated on the basis of Company history 2010 to 2017, and placed equal to 2.19% 
per annum with an average rate of advance equal to 61.99%.
• For retirement for the general working population, it is assumed that the first of the pension requirements is valid for the mandatory 
general insurance.

23  Financial Instruments and Risk Management
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The Group’s income and 
operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest changes. The management monitors interest rate fluctuations 
on a continuous basis and acts accordingly.
Where the Group has a significant amount of surplus cash, it will invest in higher earning interest deposit accounts. 
Due to interest rate conditions, the interest rates for short-term deposits are at similar levels to those achieved for longer-terms. The Group is 
not unduly exposed to market interest rate fluctuations, and no interest rate sensitivity analysis has been presented as a result.
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises when a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations could reduce the amount of future cash inflows from financial 
assets on hand at the reporting date.
The Group closely monitors the activities of its counterparties and maintains regular contact which enables it to ensure the prompt collection 
of customers’ balances.
The Group’s main financial assets are cash and cash equivalents as well as trade and other receivables and represent the Group’s maximum 
exposure to credit risk in connection with its financial assets. Trade and other receivables are carried on the statement of financial position  
net of bad debt provisions estimated by the Directors based on prior year experience and an evaluation of prevailing economic circumstances.
Whenever possible and commercially practical the Group invests cash with major financial institutions in each jurisdiction where it operates. 
The Group periodically monitors the credit rating and stability of these institutions.
The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired can be analysed as follows:

Company
Intercompany trade receivables of €14,624k were not past due at 31 December 2017 (2016: €13,519k).
Currency Risk
Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
The foreign exchange risk arises for the Group where assets and liabilities arise and are held in overseas subsidiaries in a currency other 
than the Euro and to a lesser extent where individual Group entities enter into transactions denominated in currency other that their 
functional currency. 
The Group’s policy, where possible, is for Group entities to manage foreign exchange risk at a local level by matching the currency in which 
revenue is generated and the expenses incurred and by settling liabilities denominated in their functional currency with cash generated from 
their own operations in that currency. Where Group entities have liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency (and 
have insufficient reserves of that currency to settle them), cash already denominated in that currency will, where possible, be transferred from 
elsewhere within the Group. 
Over the course of the year the Group’s currency has increased and diversified due to the addition of the newly-acquired subsidiaries. The Group 
is predominantly exposed to currency risk on the balances held within working capital within the Group and the exposure is concentrated in the 
movement of the Canadian Dollar, US Dollar and Sterling against the Euro. The effect of a strengthening and weakening of 10% of these currencies 
against the Euro at the reporting date on the working capital balances held at this date would, all other variable held constant, have resulted in the 
following pre-tax profit/(loss) impact for the year as follows:
10%

Sterling to Euro 620 (620)
Total Financial Assets and Liabilities
The carrying amount of the financial assets and liabilities shown in the Group and Company statements of financial position are stated at 
fair value.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the financial charges on its debt instruments.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it will have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. 
The following are the contractual maturities (representing undiscounted contractual cash flows) of the Group’s and Company’s financial liabilities:

VMC contributed €7,768,858 revenue and €824,189 profit before tax to the Group between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date. 
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, revenue for the year to 31 December 2017 of €50,345,062 would 
have been contributed to the Group. The acquisition was a carve-out from a group of existing companies, so the comparable pre-acquisition 
profit is not easily measurable. It is expected that the comparable profit before tax would have been in the order of 10% of revenues.
Acquisition costs of €1,690k have been charged through to the Comprehensive Income Statement.

The main factors leading to recognition of goodwill on the acquisition of LOLA are the presence of certain intangible assets in the acquired 
entity, including expertise in Latin American Spanish dubbing and sound expertise. 
The deferred consideration on LOLA is payable based on sales targets. At the reporting date, there is no reason to believe that these targets 
will not be met. 
As the acquisition happened so close to year end, LOLA contributed minimal revenue and profit before tax to the Group between the date  
of acquisition and the balance sheet date. If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, revenue for the year to 
31 December 2017 of €997,366 would have been contributed to the Group, and €68,136 profit before tax.
