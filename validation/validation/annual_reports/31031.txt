Michael Karg, PhD
Group Chief Executive Officer
Ebiquity’s long-term ambition  
is to be the world’s leading,  
tech-enabled independent marketing 
and media consultancy, the ‘left brain’ 
adviser to the CMO.
Final results for 
the year ended 
31 December 2017
Ebiquity plc, (‘Ebiquity’ or ‘the 
Company’) a leading, tech-enabled 
independent marketing and media 
consultancy, announces final results 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. 
Ebiquity provides services to over 
80 of the top 100 global advertisers, 
with 20 offices across 14 countries.
Highlights
Outlook
Taking advantage of the rapid changes 
in media and marketing – driven by 
changes in technology, consumer 
behaviour, and data – requires players 
in the industry to adjust their business 
models. As many of our clients and 
partners have embarked on this journey, 
so have we. The sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business now better 
focuses Ebiquity on service areas 
offering structural market growth. 
The actions that have been taken in 
2017, has positioned the business for 
faster revenue growth in 2018 and 
beyond. With an expectation of a 
turnaround in performance in the US in 
2018, together with continued revenue 
growth outside of the US, we remain 
confident of delivering against the 
financial goals we set out in the 
Growth Acceleration Plan.
 
Michael Karg, CEO, commented:
“ 2017 was a year of change for Ebiquity. 
The planned sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, in particular, 
was significant and resource intensive. 
While our financial performance was 
held back by disappointing results in the 
US, we achieved important milestones 
on our multi-year transformational 
journey. The underlying changes that 
we are driving throughout our business 
are designed to align our services with 
client-side trends – as well as 
competitive dynamics – which provide 
mid- to long-term growth 
opportunities. 
We are positioning Ebiquity to become 
the preferred, independent adviser to 
marketers at world-leading brands. 
We have a clear, focused and 
differentiated destination and are 
implementing the relevant changes to 
get these, now and going forward.”

Michael Higgins
Non-Executive Chairman
Chairman’s statement
In 2006, when I became Chairman of 
Ebiquity (then Thomson Intermedia), 
the Company operated from four 
offices – three in London and one in 
New York. At that time, three-quarters 
of our revenue came from clients 
headquartered in the UK. I stand 
down from the Board this year with 
a business that spans the globe, with 
20 offices in 14 countries, and proud 
to count over 80 of the world’s 100 
largest advertisers among its clients.
The marketing industry has been 
through a period of substantial change 
during this time, bringing with it 
extraordinary complexity. In 2006, 
Facebook celebrated its second 
birthday and Twitter was born. 
Meanwhile, eight-year-old Google was 
already valued at $50 billion. Now it’s 
over 17 times that figure, and these 
three companies alone generated over 
$130 billion of advertising revenue in 
2017. Add to this the ever-evolving 
capabilities of technology and the 
creation of a totally pervasive online 
ecosystem, and the balance of 
relationships and the level of 
complexity within marketing today 
has fundamentally changed.
“ I have greatly enjoyed being part 
of Ebiquity’s evolution over the past 
12 years and believe that, with 
Rob Woodward’s arrival, we have the 
right leadership at the Board’s helm 
to support the executive team, led 
by Michael Karg, in seizing Ebiquity’s 
unique market opportunities.”
6 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 In 2006, Ebiquity was already focusing 
on transparency and accountability. 
One key issue then was the need to 
verify whether adverts that had been 
paid for had actually appeared in 
newspapers. We were able, in part, 
to apply technology to the old-style 
vouching process. From 2007 through 
2015, the underlying platform for the 
business we have today was 
assembled – mainly through 
acquisition – and we established our 
market-leading position in media 
benchmarking internationally. We 
acquired additional skills to address 
some of the emerging opportunities, 
and our Marketing Performance 
Optimisation segment was created. 
Since 2016, there has been substantial 
progress in defining our strategic 
direction and delivering a simplified 
and streamlined service offering as 
One Ebiquity around the world. This 
initiative is designed to ensure that our 
clients recognise us as one business 
with uniform capability and to 
reposition our service offering around 
our clients’ needs. There have also been 
some important new hires of senior 
executives, individuals with both 
operational and industry-based skills 
who will help us capitalise on our 
position in the marketplace.
Transparency and accountability 
remain the most significant challenges 
for the marketing industry. The 
revelations and recommendations that 
came out of the 2016 ANA report were 
pivotal in creating advertisers’ 
prevailing and enduring mindset. 
For Ebiquity, it not only put us at the 
heart of the debate. It also increased 
awareness of the need for an 
independent party with the right skills 
to help advertisers create clarity 
around the results that their 
investments in media deliver, and the 
returns they generate.
The Chief Executive Officer’s report 
sets out last year’s financial 
performance in detail, as well as our 
developments and achievements 
throughout the year. It explains how 
we will be running our business going 
forward, by our Media, Analytics, and 
Tech practices. This aligns our business 
with the challenges that our clients 
face, and it follows the planned 
divestment of the Advertising 
Intelligence business. 
On behalf of the Board, I must thank 
everyone who works at Ebiquity for the 
great commitment they show in 
deploying their skills for the benefit 
of our clients.
I would also like to thank my Board 
colleagues, and welcome Rob 
Woodward, my successor, to Ebiquity. 
Rob has a set of skills and experience 
ideally suited to our business as well as 
to today’s opportunities and 
challenges.
Ebiquity is now well-positioned at the 
heart of the marketing industry. 
We have a significant opportunity to 
deploy our experience, skills, and talent 
for our clients’ benefit from our 
uniquely independent position.

Ebiquity plc Strategic report
Market overview
Marketing continues to experience a 
period of constant change and dynamic 
innovation. Driven by a change in 
consumer behaviour, the ongoing and 
incremental opportunities that digital 
tools, technologies, and social media 
platforms can offer, marketers can find 
it hard to keep up with this relentless 
pace of change. It can feel as if they’re 
running to stand still. The rewards for 
getting it right can be huge, but the 
risks of getting it wrong mean the role 
of the Chief Marketing Officer (‘CMO’) 
has never been more challenging. At the 
same time, CMO tenure is one of the 
shortest in the C-suite. 
Among big-spending consumer brands, 
CMOs are in post for three-and-a-half 
years. That’s two years less than 
typical CFOs, and less than half as 
long as CEOs, The Wall Street Journal 
recently reported
1
. Marketing leaders 
are faced with the paradox of needing 
to achieve more but having less time in 
which to do it.
As a result, executions in promising but 
niche areas can often capture 
marketers’ attention. At times, too 
much activity is focused on short-term, 
tactical wins. This is at the expense of 
strategic marketing that delivers 
business impact and real and tangible 
return on investment.
In addition to marketers’ growing desire for media transparency across partners and suppliers, we believe that 
this change in attitudes and behaviour is driven by three further, interconnected trends.
First
Heightened scrutiny of digital 
marketing performance. It is 
undeniable that digital 
advertising was given too much 
of a free pass as it developed. 
Many brands overinvested with 
insufficient emphasis on ROI. The 
exponential increase in data, 
algorithms, and data processing 
power are now being harnessed 
by some leading brands to 
measure what matters.
Second
Ever-more complexity in both 
technology and data. Before 
digital advertising, there were 
typically just agencies and 
publishers between brands and 
their customers. Today, there are 
dozens of different links in the 
transactional chain; the World 
Federation of Advertisers (‘WFA’) 
estimates as many as 50. This 
poses obvious challenges to 
marketers looking to run 
impactful campaigns, but the 
new ecosystem also offers the 
potential for transformational 
returns for those who get it right.
Third
Increased focus on evidence-
based marketing, particularly 
in leveraging data to drive 
better customer experiences 
and enhanced marketing 
performance. Today’s marketers 
operate in a paradoxical 
environment, where it’s never 
been more challenging and at the 
same time never more possible to 
use data to drive evidence-based 
decision-making.
Today’s marketing ecosystem is complex, at times confusing, 
and often opaque. It has never been more challenging to be an 
effective marketer or marketing procurement professional.
Over the last 12 months, several 
marketers have started to get more 
involved in the details of how their 
marketing spend is allocated. Some 
very well-known high-profile marketers 
are taking the lead on the issues that 
have held the industry back during 
digital advertising’s teenage years. 
Principal among these issues has been 
media transparency. And following the 
lead of the two marketers with the 
world’s biggest budgets – P&G’s Marc 
Pritchard and Unilever’s Keith Weed 
– the global marketing community is 
now routinely putting transparency 
high on the agenda.

“ My guess is that the biggest challenge for 
marketers this year will be GDPR. If 2017 
was the year of digital media transparency,  
then 2018 may well be the year of data 
transparency and ensuring that all of our  
data is kept safe and secure.”
David Wheldon 
president of the WFA
It is undeniable that the dominant 
theme of marketing in 2017 was media 
transparency. The practical steps 
that everyone can take to secure 
greater transparency governed the 
tone and content of the debate. 
With reference to the arrival of the 
EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation in May of this year, the 
president of the WFA, David Wheldon, 
said in January 2018
2
:
At Ebiquity, we agree with David’s 
analysis, but would go further. Our role 
– indeed, our declared purpose – at 
Ebiquity is ‘creating clarity for our 
clients’. This means ensuring that 
marketers work with their partners to 
choose the level of transparency which 
is right for them. It means subjecting 
digital marketing to ever-greater 
scrutiny. It means harnessing advances 
in technology and data for their 
advantage. And it means taking an 
evidence-based approach to 
measurement and evaluation. It is 
encouraging to hear Marc Pritchard, 
in his recent address at ISBA, put 
increased focus on data and analytics, 
but change will take time in an industry 
obsessed with shiny new objects often 
at the expense of employing rigour to 
drive real business impact.
The media industry in general – and 
digital media in particular – will never 
truly become simple and 
straightforward, and the issues that 
have dogged marketing for many years 
– from ad misplacement to fraud, from 
brand safety to non-human traffic 
– won’t disappear overnight. It is 
encouraging that the industry is taking 
steps in the right direction, but we 
firmly believe that there is much more 
that needs to be done.
“ My guess is that the biggest challenge 
for marketers this year will be GDPR. 
If 2017 was the year of digital media 
transparency, then 2018 may well be 
the year of data transparency and 
ensuring that all of our data is kept 
safe and secure.”

Michael Karg, PhD
Group Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive Officer’s review
2018 starts with two pieces of 
significant news. 
As previously announced, we have 
appointed a new Chairman, 
Rob Woodward, who joined Ebiquity 
on 1 March. Rob succeeds Michael 
Higgins who will retire after 12 years 
as Chairman of Ebiquity, following the 
AGM on 9 May.
Rob brings a wealth of both media 
and senior Board-level experience to 
Ebiquity. He was CEO of STV Group 
plc for nearly 11 years where he led 
their successful transformation into a 
pre-eminent digital media group. Prior 
to joining STV, Rob was Commercial 
Director at Channel 4 Television for 
four years and was previously a 
Managing Director with UBS 
Corporate Finance and lead partner 
for Deloitte’s TMT industry group in 
Europe. Rob is an experienced leader 
who has an inspiring track record in 
building teams and delivering 
successful outcomes. His approach 
and personality are a great fit for 
Ebiquity and I am looking forward to 
partnering with him.
I would like to express our deep 
gratitude to Michael Higgins for his 
significant contribution over the past 
12 years, where his guidance has been 
invaluable in the successful 
development of the Company. We wish 
him all the very best for the future. 
Additionally, in February 2018, we 
announced that we had entered into 
an agreement to sell our Advertising 
Intelligence business to Nielsen. The 
sale is subject to UK Competition and 
Markets Authority (‘CMA’) approval, and 
completion is anticipated to take place in 
the second quarter of 2018, assuming 
the CMA provides clearance following its 
high-level Phase 1 examination. If the 
CMA instead refer the transaction for a 
more detailed Phase 2 investigation, the 
completion would likely take place in Q4 
2018. The Advertising Intelligence 
business represents in excess of 90% of 
the reported revenue and underlying 
operating profit within the Market 
Intelligence (‘MI’) segment, and 25% 
of Group revenues and contributed 
£4.4 million to operating profit before 
allocation of overheads, and for this 
reason we refer in places of this report 
to revenue growth excluding the 
MI segment.
2017 financial  
performance overview
Revenues for the year to 31 December 
2017 grew 4.6% to £87.4 million. With 
the majority of revenue denominated 
in non-sterling currencies, revenue was 
boosted by sterling being on average 
weaker against the euro and the dollar 
in 2017 than in 2016. In total, currency 
movements benefited revenue by 3.4%, 
with acquisitions further increasing 
revenue by 0.4%. This resulted in 
like-for-like, constant currency revenue 
growth of 0.8%.
Excluding performance of the MI 
segment, which contains the Advertising 
Intelligence business, revenue growth 
was 6.7% and 2.3% on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis. Revenue was 
more evenly phased across 2017 than 
in 2016, when revenue was front-half 
weighted. Like-for-like, constant 
currency revenue growth was 5.5% in 
the second half of 2017 compared with 
the second half of 2016. 
“ I would like to express our deep gratitude 
to Michael Higgins for his significant 
contribution over the past 12 years, where 
his guidance has been invaluable in the 
successful development of the Company. 
   We wish him all the very best  
for the future.”
10 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 As previously highlighted, revenue 
performance from the US business 
was well below management 
expectations, and this impacted the 
Group’s revenue growth year-on-year. 
In our US MVM segment (excluding 
FirmDecisions, our contract 
compliance business), the trend we 
observed in the first half of the year of 
clients facing cuts to their marketing 
and advertising budgets and 
consequently deferring Media 
benchmarking spending, continued 
into the second half.
In the US MPO business unit, after 
delivering greater than 50% revenue 
growth between 2014 and 2016, 
revenue declined in 2017. The US MPO 
business had a high concentration of 
revenue with a small number of clients. 
The two biggest clients reduced spend 
– mainly driven by internal 
reorganisations – which caused 
revenue to fall by 19.8% in 2017. US 
MPO revenues were higher in H2 2017 
than H1 2017, through the addition of 
new clients in Q4 2017. Given the scale 
of the US advertising market, and our 
relative size, we feel positive about our 
mid- to long-term opportunities. With 
new leadership of our US MPO and US 
Media business units now in place we 
expect to see a sustained turnaround 
in 2018. Excluding the performance of 
the US MVM and MPO segment (but 
including US FirmDecisions), the MVM 
and MPO segments grew by 10.0% 
and 7.4% respectively on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis.
The MVM segment reported revenue 
up 9.2%, an increase of 5.2% on a 
like-for-like, constant currency basis. 
As clients focused on the issue of 
media transparency, this significantly 
benefited FirmDecisions, which 
recorded exceptional revenue growth 
in 2017. Outside of the US, MVM 
revenue was in line with management 
expectations, with continued good 
progress in Europe, South-East Asia, 
and Australia offsetting slightly 
weaker performance in China, resulting 
from a change in management post 
the end of the earn-out period.
In the MPO segment, reported revenue 
fell by 2.3% compared to 2016 and was 
down by 7.7% on a like-for-like, 
constant currency basis. Performance 
from the MPO segment was impacted 
by the significant decline in revenue 
from the US MPO segment. Revenue 
from the MPO segment outside of the 
US grew by 6.4%, with revenues from 
MPO Effectiveness services outside of 
the UK representing 10% of total 
revenue. The year saw a scaling up of 
our MPO Effectiveness services in 
Continental Europe and our MPO 
practice in APAC. The UK MPO 
business continued to deliver double-
digit revenue growth of 17.1%, while 
revenue from our MPO team in Spain 
(acquired as part of Media Value in 
February 2016) declined in 2017, 
reflecting high staff turnover during 
the year.
Revenue from the MI segment declined 
by 0.9%, and declined by 3.1% on a 
like-for-like constant currency basis. 
Revenue from the Advertising 
Intelligence business grew by 0.1% on a 
like-for-like constant currency basis, with 
a slightly weaker second half. Revenues 
from our project based Reputation 
business declined as expected from 
£2.0 million in 2016 to £1.2 million in 
2017. In March 2018, we entered into an 
agreement to sell the trade and assets 
of our Reputation business to Echo 
Research Holdings Limited. Completion 
will take place on 31 March 2018. 
Underlying operating profit was 
£12.0 million. This represents a drop in 
operating margin from 2016 of 1.7pp 
to 13.8%. This reflects lower 
profitability from the US MPO 
business, combined with planned 
investment in our Growth Acceleration 
Plan – notably in investing in MPO 
Effectiveness resources in new 
markets. Investment in the Growth 
Acceleration Plan was scaled back 
during 2017 and cost control 
measures  were implemented in the 
US MPO business during 2017, but 
these were not sufficient to offset 
the revenue decline.
Margins in the MVM segment were 
consistent with 2016, as strong 
performance from our Contract 
Compliance business offset lower 
profitability from our US Media 
benchmarking business. Margins in the 
MPO segment declined sharply in 2017, 
reflecting the revenue decline in the 
US MPO business, together with the 
investment in the expansion of the 
MPO segment in Europe and APAC. 
Central costs, which are not allocated 
to a segment, were in line with the 
prior year.
Underlying profit before tax was 
£11.0 million. Statutory operating 
profit was £5.5 million, down from 
£7.8 million in 2016, and statutory 
profit before tax decreased to 
£4.5 million, from £6.6 million in 2016. 
The lower statutory operating profit 
and profit before tax reflect both 
lower underlying profitability as well 
as an increase highlighted items. 
Highlighted items are detailed in the 
CFO’s report.

‘Creating clarity’ is the North Star 
which guides everything we do. This 
includes how we advise and guide our 
clients, and is the foundation that 
underpins our long-term strategic 
ambition to become the leading 
media and marketing analytics 
consultancy, globally.
For the past few years, we have gone 
to market with three, core practice 
areas: Media Value Measurement, 
Marketing Performance Optimisation, 
and Market Intelligence.
 
Media Value 
Measurement (‘MVM’)
Ebiquity is the global market leader in 
media performance benchmarking, 
media agency management, and 
contract compliance.
We enable our clients to increase 
media efficiency and transparency 
through media performance reviews, 
benchmarking, and measurement.
Dietmar Kruse 
Practice Principal,  
Media Performance
“ Advertisers face many challenges in 
media today. Transparency, 
programmatic, and meaningful 
metrics for walled-garden 
platforms like Google and Facebook 
– to name but three. By defining 
digital media benchmarks, we help 
our clients to create clarity.”
And we enable them to make the 
right, long-term decisions – including 
finding and working with the right 
agency partners.
Laetitia Zinetti 
Practice Principal, Media 
Consulting
“ Good relationships between brands 
and their agencies need constant 
vigilance. With the right support 
and a thought-through, end-to-end 
process, brands can ensure their 
agency relationships – both 
well-established and new – deliver 
for the long-term future.”
We also assess agencies’ compliance 
with contractual terms via our specialist 
contract compliance business, 
FirmDecisions. In 2017, FirmDecisions 
undertook more than 300 contract 
compliance audits covering activity 
in 70 markets. 40 of the world’s 
leading 100 advertisers consulted 
with FirmDecisions over the course 
of the year.
Stephen Broderick 
Global CEO of FirmDecisions
“ It is only through well-written, 
regularly-updated contracts that 
marketers can secure the level of 
transparency they desire. With the 
industry changing so fast, brands 
need to review and update their 
contracts regularly to stay ahead 
of the game.”

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Marketing 
Performance 
Optimisation (‘MPO’)
We guide clients to decide how much 
they need to spend on marketing, 
where to allocate, and how to optimise 
their marketing investments. We help 
them choose which analytics 
technologies to select, and how to 
improve digital customer journeys. 
Our work in this practice has two 
distinct service offerings: econometric 
modelling and customer experience 
analytics.
Mike Campbell 
Head of International Effectiveness
“ Marketers are rewarded by the 
C-suite for delivering real and 
tangible ROI. And it’s only by 
understanding the relative and 
absolute contribution of all channels 
and platforms – taking and 
attributing the Total View, online 
and offline – that they can 
accomplish this.”
Tim Hussain 
Practice Principal,  
Tech – Europe
“ There are so many options for 
marketing technology that many 
marketers don’t know where 
to turn for simple, clear, and 
impartial advice. By building 
a team from right across the 
industry – and by remaining 
staunchly independent – we are 
helping our clients make informed 
advertising technology decisions.”
Market Intelligence 
(‘MI’) 
For almost 20 years, we have provided 
clients with a clear picture of their own 
and their competitors’ in-market 
creative executions, ad spend, and 
media strategies. Our market-leading 
family of Ebiquity Portfolio media 
platforms was joined in 2017 by 
Ebiquity Portfolio Digital, providing 
comprehensive coverage of creative 
and spend data for digital advertising 
content. This is supported by specialist 
insight, market, and earned media 
research experts who combine 
automated analytics with native-
language human analysis. The sale 
process of the AdIntel business 
required significant time investment by 
our senior management over the 
course of 2017.
Morag Blazey 
Managing Principal, Intel
“ With the sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, the 
combined entity will be a strong 
global player, with the scale and 
strategic focus to continue the 
level of investment needed to keep 
the business evolving and deliver 
better long-term career growth.”

so Ebiquity is transforming and developing 
to meet the needs of the world’s 
marketers and brand custodians.
Continued transformational change in 2017

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 From 2018 onwards, we will also, 
therefore, move from segmental 
reporting as MPO, MVM, and MI, to 
reporting by 1) Media, 2) Analytics and 
Tech, and until such time as the sale of 
the Advertising Intelligence business is

Michael Karg, PhD
Group Chief Executive Officer
Christian Polman 
Chief Strategy Officer
“ By creating a three-practice 
business that addresses our clients’ 
needs in Media, Analytics, and Tech, 
we’ve made our market offering 
both more relevant and more 
buyable. We’ve shown our clients 
that we understand the challenges 
they face in the ever-more complex 
media and marketing ecosystem.”
As the media industry is changing 
rapidly, so Ebiquity is transforming 
and developing to meet the needs of 
the world’s marketers and brand 
custodians. When I joined Ebiquity 
as Group CEO in 2016, we launched 
a Growth Acceleration Plan designed 
to achieve a compound annual growth 
rate of 10% by 2021. This strategy 
is designed to make our business 
the best-equipped partner to help 
our clients to build accountability 
into their marketing investments.
The sale of our Advertising Intelligence 
business is clear evidence of our 
transformation in action. Creating 
a more operationally-aligned, 
streamlined business will allow us to 
respond better to our clients’ needs 
and focus on our Growth Acceleration 
Plan moving forward.
Accordingly, we have now restructured 
our business into three core service 
offerings. This restructure better 
reflects both advertisers’ needs 
and the reality of the media and 
marketing ecosystem today and 
for the years to come.
Operating under an agile, One Ebiquity consulting model, we have now structured ourselves as:
Ebiquity  
Media
covering services such as media 
performance benchmarking, media 
agency management, and contract 
compliance
Ebiquity 
Analytics 
incorporates areas such as 
marketing effectiveness, market 
mix modelling, total view 
attribution, and data-driven 
customer experience optimisation
Ebiquity  
Tech
comprising services such as 
strategy, vendor selection, and 
implementation for ad tech, 
martech, and data management

CREATING 
 
 
CLARITY
Inputs: 
data & insights
• Advertiser data – media, spend, 
sales, social media, market 
research/polling data
• Consumer data – behavioural, 
web-data (1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
party), customer profiles, 
attitudinal data inferred from 
behaviours
• Market data – creative assets, 
competitor performance, 
third-party demographic data
Our business model
We apply data-driven insights to help 
marketers deliver accountability of their 
marketing investment.
Our data-driven approach to creating 
clarity from complexity is hardwired 
into all our different products and 
services. It is also central to our 
business model.
Our engagements always start with 
a strategic review of where our clients 
are today, where they want to get to, 
and what their motivations are. 
This is true both for long-established 
and first-time clients. This process 
of triage enables us to determine 
the most effective order in which to 
address specific, priority tasks.
We then capture data; we cleanse, 
organise, and harmonise that data; 
we generate actionable, data-driven 
insights; and, we tell our clients 
data-driven stories from which they 
can take practical action to achieve 
their business and marketing 
objectives. In this way, we empower 
our clients to take rightful ownership 
of their digital marketing strategy, 
technology, data, and media spend.

5. Performance
Ebiquity’s 5P goals
It is our ambition to be the world’s 
leading, tech-enabled independent 
marketing and media consultancy. 
Everything we do in pursuit of this 
objective is shaped by our corporate 
purpose, ‘creating clarity for our 
clients’. We have established five-year 
goals which are grouped into 5Ps, 
covering: People, Product, Process, 
Profile, and Performance. And our 5Ps 
provides the framework for us to 
measure our progress towards our 
long-term business objectives.
How we’re doing on our five-year objectives for each strategic pillar of the 5Ps – in terms of progress, priorities, KPIs, and risks 
– is summarised on pages 22 and 23. But first, I want to focus on some of the highlights for each of the 5Ps that we’ve delivered 
during 2017.
1. People
For all the great tech, data, and smart 
use of analytics, Ebiquity is first and 
foremost a people business. During the 
course of 2017, the global Talent Team 
and our capability leaders have 
developed the first iteration of a 
Global Competency Framework.
This model allows people at all levels of 
the organisation to understand what 
behaviours and skills are required – to 
do their jobs and to meet targets. By 
marrying this with a skills map, we can 
systematically assess where we have 
skills and what the development needs 
for Ebiquity are, at both an individual 
and a company level.
The senior hires we have made and the 
roles we have developed and created 
during the course of 2017 demonstrate 
the scope of our ambitions for Ebiquity. 
So, too, do the range and diversity of 
backgrounds from which our new team 
members come, including media 
agencies, digital, consulting, and 
technology. For instance, we now have 
a global Chief Operating Officer, our 
first global chairman of media, and a 
new Chief Strategy Officer. 
We have new leadership in China and 
France, and new leadership for both 
Media and Analytics in the US. We 
have strengthened our offering across 
Europe with the launch of our Tech 
practice, and in Australia with the 
acquisition of Digital Balance. It is 
through talents like these that we 
will achieve our objective of becoming 
the world’s leading marketing 
analytics consultancy.
Everything we do is shaped  
by our corporate purpose,  
‘creating clarity for our clients’.
18 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 3. Process
In part as a legacy of a business that 
has grown through acquisition, and 
in part because operational efficiency 
across our network had not 
– historically – been identified as a 
strategic priority, a comprehensive 
analysis of operations has identified 
scope for enhanced delivery of products 
and services. This programme was 
started in Q4 2016 by the recruitment 
of new team members whose purpose 
is to drive operational efficiency and 
synergies across practices. And it has 
been strengthened considerably by the 
appointment of Jason Bailis at the 
start of 2018 as Global Chief Operating 
Officer, following a 10-year stint in 
senior operations roles at Publicis 
Groupe, for Sapient Nitro, Razorfish, 
and DigitasLBi.
Jason Bailis 
Chief Operating Officer
“ Operational excellence is a win-win. 
A win for clients, who get great 
services, delivered smarter. A win 
for our people, who do what they do 
brilliantly, but in a systematised and 
streamlined fashion.”
We have also started to put in place a 
group of senior global client partners 
to service the needs of some of our 
biggest clients better and more 
holistically. Our client partners are 
specialists in our clients’ businesses 
and generalists in the full spectrum of 
marketing and media consultancy 
advice our different practices offer. 
This enables them to bring forward the 
right service to the right client at the 
right time.
Andrew Challier 
Chief Client Officer
“ Our clients are at the heart of 
everything we do. They face very 
real challenges in securing optimal 
return on their marketing 
investments. By addressing these 
challenges directly, our teams can 
help our clients deliver real value.”
Our Media Consulting team has 
codified and standardised an 
end-to-end Ebiquity Agency Selection 
approach. Using this approach, we 
provided pitch management services 
to almost 100 national and global 
brands in 2017, with total, combined 
media billings of almost £9 billion. 
This makes Ebiquity the biggest and 
most experienced agency relationship 
management business.
Our Media practice in Australia has 
developed an innovative methodology 
to benchmark and analyse online video 
advertising performance. With 
advertisers following audiences who 
are shifting their viewing habits from 
broadcast TV towards online video, 
this methodology enables us to assess 
performance of online video 
advertising per se, and compared to 
the cost and efficiency of traditional 
TV advertising.
To help clients navigate the complexity 
of programmatic advertising, and the 
myriad choices of martech and ad tech 
providers, we launched a new Ebiquity 
Tech practice area, including hiring a 
European ad tech team based out of 
our London office. The team’s remit 
includes helping advertisers select, 
implement, and manage their digital 
programmatic trading technology. 
Our Analytics practice has developed 
and launched our pioneering Ebiquity 
Total View Attribution solution. 
Ebiquity Total View is a multi-channel 
attribution model that considers and 
weights the relative impact of all 
relevant inputs on consumer behaviour, 
online and offline. Combining top-down 
econometrics with bottom-up digital 
attribution, the Ebiquity Total View 
approach is a clear-box solution that 
lets the data decide cause and effect.
2. Product
To stay relevant and anticipate 
our clients’ needs in the constantly-
evolving digital marketing ecosystem, 
it’s critical that we continually innovate 
our products and services. At Ebiquity, 
we encourage and facilitate innovation 
from the ground up, based on the 
opportunities our teams know can help 
advertisers to meet their business and 
marketing objectives.
During 2017, our Media practice has 
completed development of and rolled 
out a new media data management 
platform called Ebiquity Connect. 
This platform is designed to help 
agencies upload our advertiser clients’ 
media data consistently, efficiently, 
and securely. Designed to drive data 
security and efficiency, Ebiquity 
Connect saves both our clients and 
media agencies partners’ time and 
resource and enables us to produce 
even more relevant and insightful 
media measurement.

the I-COM community. Whether 
speaking at our annual Global 
Summit, serving on our numerous 
boards and councils, or as 
frontrunners in our Data Science 
Hackathon, Ebiquity is partnering 
with us in our mission to help clients 
achieve competitive advantage in 
data-driven marketing.” 
4. Profile
Ebiquity’s profile is now higher than it 
ever has been. Our thought leadership 
content is sought and widely used 
around the world. Our leaders have 
spoken at more industry events than 
ever, and they are now regularly 
contacted for comment. These 
approaches are from both specialist 
marketing media and generalist 
business media, from Campaign to 
The Financial Times. Our research is 
now quoted in the analyst reports 
commentating on marketing, including 
Liberum and Bank of America.
In 2017, we published a first-of-its-kind 
study of programmatic media buying in 
the US marketplace. The study analysed 
16.4 billion impressions from 445 
completed campaigns, making it the 
most comprehensive study of its kind. 
It was conducted and published with 
the US and Canadian Associations of 
Advertisers, and AD/FIN.
Two studies on the long-term value 
and return on investment delivered 
by TV were published during the year, 
one in the UK in association with 
ThinkBox, the other in Australia in 
partnership with ThinkTV.
Our partnership with global and 
national trade bodies, including the 
ANA, World Federation of Advertisers 
(‘WFA’), and I-COM, strengthens and 
deepens. These partnerships generate 
joint research, drive client 
conversations, and result in leads. 
A sample of our thought leadership 
research in 2017 is summarised on

5. Performance
The performance of Ebiquity in 2017 
is summarised in more detail in the 
CEO review. 
Total revenue growth in 2017 was 4.6%, 
and 0.8% on a like-for-like, constant 
currency basis. Performance in our US 
Media and US MPO business units 
provided a drag on revenue growth. 
Outside of the US, we made progress 
against our revenue growth goal in 
both the MPO and MVM segments. 
During 2017, we achieved a series of 
key milestones of our Growth 
Acceleration Plan set out in September 
2016. Further detail of both revenue 
growth in 2017 and progress against 
the Growth Acceleration Plan is

RISKS
• Our talent continues to be highly in 
demand due to the breadth of 
experience that it gains through our 
unique positioning. There is a risk of 
an industry-wide talent shortage for 
data scientists in particular as 
demand by clients, agencies, internet 
platforms and publishers increases. 
We work hard on a number of 
initiatives to make Ebiquity a great 
place to work and foster retention
• The media landscape is constantly 
changing, resulting in increasing 
pressure to develop/refine 
products and services faster. 
Through evolving our delivery 
methods and creating product 
owners we aim to stay highly 
relevant to our clients
• Our clients often have complex 
decentralised management structures 
requiring considerable investment of 
time to negotiate global commercial 
agreements. We ensure we devote 
appropriate commercial and senior 
client facing resource to expedite the 
negotiation of commercial 
agreements
• Inability to capitalise on the 
opportunities arising from the 
focus on media transparency
• Some of the industry trends become 
less important or are resolved
• Identifying key talent to enable 
expansion of Marketing Analytics 
and Tech businesses could take 
longer than expected due to 
scarcity in the market
• Clients may be slower to respond to 
issues in media transparency and 
data driven marketing causing a 
delay in potential revenue growth. 
We leverage our relationships with 
clients and industry bodies to 
influence change

agency backgrounds. Our combined 
experience, tools, and approach is 
designed to help advertisers secure 
optimal return on investment on digital

Client objectives
Mazda Spain wanted to understand 
how its media investments were 
performing. As the decision to buy a 
car is long and complex, the analysis 
needed to show not just impact on 
sales, but impact all along the 
purchase funnel; from web visits to 
dealer/showroom visits, and on to final 
orders. By knowing what was working 
– and what was not – Mazda was 
looking to optimise its media buying.
Ebiquity approach
We conducted a comprehensive 
assessment of Mazda’s media 
investment, price discounts, new car 
releases, competitor activity, and PR 
activations along the whole purchase 
lifecycle. Our marketing effectiveness 
team built bespoke econometric 
models to identify Mazda’s most 
impactful sales drivers. We helped the 
company to deploy the optimal media 
mix, phase spend appropriately, and 
support the right product lines that 
work hardest for the company overall. 
We used our learnings to develop 
forecasts and simulations to enhance 
future media planning and decision-
making.
Outcomes
Our analysis enabled Mazda Spain to 
understand with absolute clarity that 
TV advertising is fundamental to 
driving ROI for them. Conventional TV 
advertising was shown to be 
more effective than programme 
sponsorship. And we identified which 
creative executions were the most 
effective, not only in generating sales 
for specific models shown but also in 
driving sales across the portfolio.
“By understanding the impact that our media spend has right 
across the purchase funnel for different models of our cars, we’ve 
been able to fine tune our media plans with precision. 
Econometric modelling is a powerful tool. It’s enabled to do more 
of what works brilliantly, less of what we were already doing 
more than enough of, and to drop altogether what’s not relevant 
or impactful in our category or for our company.”

Subway needed to understand the 
effectiveness of its social media 
activity. The marketing leadership 
team wanted to give the Board a 
rationale for what they should invest in 
which channels, based on actual social 
media impact. And as Subway is a 
franchised operation, the team needed 
to address franchisee questions about 
what central marketing delivered 
through social.
Ebiquity approach
We analysed all paid, earned, and 
owned social media content generated 
by and about Subway in the UK & 
Ireland, compared with the other three 
big players in the category. We found 
Subway generated the most positive 
and neutral sentiment across Twitter 
and Facebook. The company also 
experienced the largest percentage 
growth in fans and followers on both 
platforms, despite much less offline 
advertising. Our Effectiveness team 
found that TV and radio drove earned 
media coverage, while out-of-home 
had minimal impact.
Outcomes
The analysis of peaks and troughs 
of activity enabled Subway to plan 
social better as a properly integrated 
component of marketing. It joined 
up messaging across social and other 
channels, making best use of different 
channels to optimise engagement: 
Facebook to entertain, Twitter to give 
healthy lifestyle advice, and Instagram 
to feature product and packaging. 
This allowed Subway to outperform 
its competitors on significantly 
leaner budgets.
“Before we assessed the impact of social, we found it hard to 
make a solid business case – to the company or our franchisees 
– about how we were performing and what we should do as a 
result. By understanding what topics, issues, and types of content 
drive conversation and engagement, we’ve been able to fine-tune 
our content and engagement strategies.”

“Reviewing agencies is a major undertaking and shouldn’t be 
entered lightly or with insufficient time, energy, and resource. It’s 
important that everyone relevant in an advertiser business – across 
multiple functions and levels of responsibility – is involved. And a 
clear and methodical process should be followed, giving prospective 
partners enough time and scope to demonstrate why they’re the 
right fit – not just for today, but for the medium-term future.”

Client objectives
L ’Oréal France is one of the biggest 
advertisers in the country, and France 
is one of L ’Oréal’s top three markets 
worldwide. After more than 10 years 
in partnership with its media agency 
of record (‘AOR’), the beauty giant 
decided to benchmark the service, cost 
performance, and thinking it received 
from its agency against the market.
Ebiquity approach
Ebiquity Paris worked with L ’Oréal 
France to understand motivations for 
and expectations of agency review. We 
interviewed 30 internal stakeholders to 
shape the tender and review 
requirements. We ran workshops with 
multiple teams in different divisions to 
design the optimal review process.
Five of the six global media agency 
groups participated in the Request for 
Information (‘RFI’) stage, answering 
10 critical questions in writing and 
discussing three questions in a 
one-hour chemistry meeting. The 
request for proposals (‘RFP’) was split 
into two lots, one for all paid media 
except search, the second for search.
Outcomes
L ’Oréal France has now gone through 
a best-in-class process for AOR and 
search agency review and secured 
new partners for both. The company 
has confidence that they have ideal 
partners – not just for today, 
but for several years to come.

Client objectives
Soft-drink manufacturer Britvic runs a 
broad-ranging education programme, 
but the company’s marketing and 
insight teams needed to increase their 
understanding of media planning and 
strategy to challenge agency 
recommendations. Specifically, 
the teams wanted help ensuring that 
agency plans successfully extended 
Britvic’s reach to the broadest possible 
audience to optimise sales.
Ebiquity approach
Our media experts ran a series of 
workshops with Britvic’s marketing 
leadership to develop a best-in-class 
media planning and strategy training 
course. We helped them to plot their 
vision for better media planning and 
how to build knowledge across the 
marketing department.
Britvic has delivered its new course 
to dozens of marketing and insight 
colleagues. The course covers how the 
agency planning process works, with 
a special focus on digital planning 
practices. Real strategy documents 
and media plans were reviewed to 
identify improvements, and the 
strength of Britvic’s own data was also 
addressed. The course addresses best 
practice in briefing agencies, what they 
should expect in return, and how to 
ensure KPIs are applied to track 
improvements over time.
Outcomes
The Britvic marketing and insight 
team has established a new working 
framework with its media agency. 
The agency provides planning 
information in a report format 
of Britvic’s design that shows the 
various media choices and provides 
full visibility of costs and reach.

Alternative  
Performance Measures
In these results we refer to ‘underlying’ 
and ‘statutory’ results, as well as other 
non-GAAP Alternative Performance 
Measures. 
Alternative Performance Measures 
(‘APMs’) used by the Group are:
• constant currency like-for-like 
revenue growth;
• underlying operating profit;
• underlying operating margin;
• underlying profit before tax;
• underlying effective rate of tax;
• underlying fully dilutive EPS; and
• underlying operating cash 
flow conversion.
Underlying results are not intended to 
replace statutory results but are 
presented by removing the impact of 
highlighted items in order to provide a 
better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. The 
above APMs are consistent with how 
business performance is measured 
internally by the Group. 
Underlying profit is not recognised 
under IFRS and may not be 
comparable with underlying profit 
measures used by other companies. 
Highlighted items comprise non-cash 
charges and non-recurring items which 
are highlighted in the consolidated 
income statement as separate 
disclosure is considered by the 
Directors to be relevant in 
understanding the underlying 
performance of the business. The 
non-cash charges include share option 
charges and amortisation of 
purchased intangibles. 
The non-recurring items include the 
costs associated with potential 
acquisitions (where formal discussion 
is undertaken), completed acquisitions 
and their subsequent integration into 
the Group, adjustments to the 
estimates of contingent consideration 
on acquired entities, asset impairment 
charges, management restructuring 
and other significant one-off items. 
Costs associated with ongoing market 
landscaping, acquisition identification 
and early stage discussions with 
acquisition targets are reported in 
underlying administrative expenses.
Further detail of highlighted items 
are set out below as well as within 
the consolidated income 
statement and notes 1 and 3 
of the financial statements. 
Disposal of  
Advertising Intelligence  
and Reputation businesses 
On 13 February 2018, the Company 
announced the disposal of its 
Advertising Intelligence business to 
Nielsen Media Research Limited for 
consideration of £26 million plus 
customary adjustments for working 
capital. The disposal is subject to certain 
conditions, including approval from the 
Competition and Markets Authority. 
The Directors consider that as at 
31 December 2017 the sale of the 
Advertising Intelligence business did 
not meet the definition of being highly 
probable, and therefore the division is 
not reported as a business held for sale 
in the financial statements.
Performance outside of the US  
in line with expectations
Highlights
• 4.6% revenue growth, 6.7% revenue growth  
excluding the Market Intelligence segment
• Underlying operating profit margin of 13.8%
• Underlying diluted EPS of 9.4p
• 10% increase in proposed dividend to 0.71p per share
• Underlying cash conversion of 93%
30 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 The Advertising Intelligence business 
represents in excess of 90% of the 
revenue and operating profit of the MI 
segment. On a pro-forma basis, the 
impact of the disposal on the 2017 
results would be to reduce revenue by 
£21.9 million with a reduction of 
operating profit of £4.4 million reflecting 
the contribution to profit from the 
business before allocated overheads. 
On 19 March 2018, the Company 
entered into an agreement to sell 
the trade and assets of its Reputation 
business to Echo Research Holdings 
Limited. Completion will take place on 
31 March 2018. The consideration 
payable is dependent upon the revenue 
performance of the business during 
the 12 months following completion. 
During 2017 the business contributed 
£1.2 million of revenue and generated 
a £0.2 million operating loss.
Acquisitions
On 1 September 2017, the Group 
completed the acquisition of Digital 
Balance Pty (‘Digital Balance’), 
an independent digital analytics 
consultancy located in Perth, Australia. 
The acquisition of Digital Balance 
further extends the MPO segment in 
Asia Pacific, bringing capabilities in 
Tech and Analytics.
Digital Balance was acquired for an 
initial cash consideration of AU$475,000 
in cash. The maximum total 
consideration is AU$5 million payable 
in cash depending on the performance 
of the acquired business up to 
31 December 2020. Digital Balance 
contributed revenue of £424,000 and 
operating profit £123,000 in the period 
since acquisition.
P&L overview
Commentary on segmental 
revenues are set out within the 
Chief Executive Officer’s report.
Revenues grew to £87.4 million which 
represents 4.6% revenue growth over 
£83.6 million recorded over the 
12 months ended 31 December 2016 
(‘2016’). Revenue grew by 1.2% on a 
constant currency basis and, removing 
the impact of acquisitions, by 0.8% on 
a constant currency like-for-like basis. 
Underlying operating profit was 
£12.0 million compared with 
£13.0 million in 2016 reflecting a 
decrease in underlying operating profit 
margin from 15.5% to 13.8%. 
Operating profit margin declined in 
both the MPO and MI segments. 
Lower margins in the MPO segment 
reflect investment in the expansion of 
our Marketing Effectiveness services 
– as set out in the Growth Acceleration 
Plan – together with weaker revenue 
performance from our US analytics 
business. The MI segment operating 
profit margin decline reflects both a 
revenue decline from our project-based 
Reputation business and investment in 
our Portfolio platform within our 
Advertising Intelligence business.
Statutory operating profit decreased 
by £2.3 million from £7.8 million in 2016 
to £5.5 million in 2017, reflecting a 
£1.0 million reduction in underlying 
operating profit and a £1.3 million 
increase in highlighted items. 
Highlighted items increased in 2017 
reflecting costs associated with the 
sale of the Advertising Intelligence 
business together with severance costs 
and reorganisation changes. 
Highlighted items are set out in more 
detail below.
Net finance costs were £1.0 million 
in the year to December 2017 
(2016: £1.1 million), the reduction 
reflects lower average gross debt 
in 2017 compared with 2016.
Underlying profit before tax was 
£11.0 million in the year to 
December 2017 (2016: £11.8 million). 
Reported profit before was £4.5 million 
in the year to December 2017 
(2016: £6.6 million), due to lower 
underlying operating profit and an 
increase in highlighted items compared 
with 2016.
Highlighted items
Highlighted items total £6.5 million 
in the year to December 2017, 
(2016: £5.2 million). Highlighted items 
comprised the following:
• £2.0 million related to purchased 
intangible asset amortisation 
(2016: £1.9 million);
• £0.7 million share-based payment 
expenses (2016: £0.6 million);
• £2.4 million of severance and 
reorganisation costs including 
the cost of post-earnout 
management change in China, 
leadership change in France and 
severance costs across a number 
of markets in Europe; and
• £1.4 million in relation to acquisition 
and strategic costs including 
£1.0 million of costs in relation to 
the disposal of the Advertising 
Intelligence business, £0.2 million 
in respect of adjustments to 
contingent deferred consideration, 
and £0.1 million associated to the 
acquisition of Digital Balance.

Taxation
The total tax charge for the year ended December 2017 is £2.0 million (FY2016: £2.2 million) representing a current tax charge 
of £1.6 million (FY2016: £1.8 million) and a deferred tax charge of £20,000 (FY2016: £0.5 million).
The effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 26.4% (FY2016: 21.7%). The 
effective rate of tax is increased by a deferred tax liability booked in 2017 of £0.4 million arising from differences between IFRS 
and German GAAP. Excluding the impact of the above deferred tax liability, the underlying effective tax rate for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is 22.6% which is broadly in line with the prior year.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted earnings per share was 9.4p in the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: 11.3p), reflecting a decrease in underlying 
profit before tax combined with an increase in the effective tax rate to 26.4% (2016: 21.7%). Statutory diluted earnings per 
share was 2.6p in the year to 31 December 2017 (2016: 5.2p).

Dividend
It is the Board’s intention to pay a dividend of 0.71p per share for the 12 months ended 31 December 2017, (FY2016: 0.65p per 
share). This would represent an increase in dividend per share of 10% and would also represent the continuation of a 
progressive dividend policy which commenced with our maiden dividend paid in October 2015. The dividend will be 
recommended as a final dividend at the Company’s AGM on 9 May 2018. If shareholders approve this payment, the dividend 
will be paid on 15 May 2018 to all shareholders who were on the Register of Members at close of business on 12 April 2018.
Equity
During the 12 months to December 2017, 397,710 shares were issued upon the exercise of employee share options and a further 
600,000 were issued as deferred consideration for the acquisition of Stratigent LLC. As a result our share capital increased to 
78,197,461 ordinary shares (31 December 2016: 77,199,751).

After highlighted items are considered, reported net cash inflow from operations for 2017 was £8.0 million (FY2016: £10.8 million).
Underlying cash conversion has improved over 2016 by 6 percentage points. We continue to improve policies and processes to 
further improve the management of working capital. This will become particularly important following the disposal of the 
subscription based Advertising Intelligence business.

(31 December 2016: £3,750,000)), and a revolving credit facility of £35,000,000 (of which £32,000,000 was drawn down at 
31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £29,000,000)).
During the year the Group extended the revolving credit facility through to 30 June 2019, and increased the facility to 
£35,000,000. The term loan remains repayable by 30 June 2018. 
During the period, the Group continued to trade within each of its banking facilities and associated covenants. Net debt to 
EBITDA ratio was 2.10x at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 1.94x).
Statement of financial position and net assets
A summary of the Group’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is set out below:
         31 December 31 December 
         2017 2016 
         £’000 £’000
Goodwill and intangible assets       72,440 72,079
Other non-current assets       3,331 3,776
Net working capital        12,443 10,607
Other current liabilities        (2,014) (1,855)
Other non-current liabilities       (2,288) (2,522)
Deferred consideration        (2,094) (2,015)
Net debt         (28,926) (28,015)
Net assets         52,982 52,055
Net assets as at 31 December 2017 increased by £0.9 million to £53.0 million (2016: £52.1 million) due to an increase in goodwill 
and intangible assets of £0.4 million following the acquisition of Digital Balance and an increase in net working capital of 
£1.8 million resulting from an increase in net trade receivables of £1.7 million. These increases in asset values were offset by an 
increase in net debt of £0.9 million.
Outlook
The actions that have been taken in 2017, has positioned the business for faster revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. With an 
expectation of a turnaround in performance in the US in 2018, together with continued revenue growth outside of the US, 
we remain confident of delivering against the financial goals we set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan.

Corporate governance report
Chairman’s governance overview
I am pleased to present the corporate 
governance report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. 
The corporate governance report 
describes the framework for corporate 
governance and internal control that 
the Directors have established. 
Ebiquity is committed to robust 
standards of corporate governance 
which are appropriate to the nature 
and size of the business.
Corporate governance code
As a company listed on AIM, Ebiquity 
is not required to comply with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code but 
considers the UK Code as part of its 
overall corporate governance 
strategy, taking into account the 
Group’s size and complexity. 
Ebiquity seeks to comply with the 
Corporate Governance Code for 
Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies 
2013 produced by the Quoted 
Companies Alliance (the ‘QCA Code’). 
The Quoted Companies Alliance is the 
membership organisation which 
represents the interests of small and 
mid-size quoted companies, of which 
Ebiquity is a member.
The QCA Code contains minimum 
disclosure requirements for a company 
to meet in order for that company to 
state that it complies with the QCA 
Code. The Directors are of the opinion 
that the Company complies with these 
minimum disclosure obligations save to 
the extent referred to in the report.
My role as Chairman
It is my principal responsibility as 
Chairman to ensure that the Board is 
effective in interrogating, approving 
and monitoring the Company’s 
direction and strategy. As Chairman 
I am also responsible, in consultation 
with the Company Secretary, for 
ensuring proper information is supplied 
to the Board in a timely fashion, that 
Board meetings are conducted 
effectively and that proper debate 
is had at Board meetings. We 
acknowledge that shareholders look to 
the Board to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and, as 
Chairman, I recognise it is my role to 
provide the leadership to the Board 
to do so.
Michael Higgins
Chairman
21 March 2018
We are committed to maintaining 
appropriate standards of corporate 
governance across the Group to 
complement our aim to deliver long-term 
success on behalf of our stakeholders.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Board of Directors
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible to 
shareholders for the strategic direction 
and proper management of the affairs 
of the Group. The Directors are also 
collectively responsible for acting in the 
way which they consider, in good faith, 
is most likely to promote the success of 
the Company for the benefit of 
Ebiquity’s shareholders as a whole. 
In doing so, the Directors have regard 
(amongst other matters) to the 
interests of the Company’s employees 
and the need to foster the Company’s 
business relationships with suppliers, 
customers and other stakeholders.
A statement of the Directors’ 
responsibilities with regards to 
the annual report and financial 
statements is set out on page 49.
Composition of the Board  
and roles of the Directors
Nick Manning stood down as a Director 
of the Company on 31 December 2017. 
On 1 March 2018, Rob Woodward 
joined the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director and Chairman Designate. He 
will succeed Michael Higgins who will 
retire as Chairman following the AGM 
on 9 May 2018. The Board of Directors 
now comprises an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman, four further 
independent Non-Executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors. 
Michael Higgins (independent 
Non-Executive Chairman) is a qualified 
chartered accountant. He brings to the 
Board significant experience of 
advising smaller quoted companies 
and is a director of a number of such 
companies. The Directors are of the 
view that Michael Higgins retains his 
independence notwithstanding that he 
chairs the Board.
Michael Karg, PhD (Group Chief 
Executive Officer) is responsible for 
setting long-term strategy, developing 
appropriate annual business plans, 
agreeing management KPIs and 
leading the Executive Directors and 
the senior Executive team in the 
day-to-day running of the Group’s 
business, including chairing the 
management committees and 
communicating their decisions/
recommendations to the Board. 
He is also responsible for shareholder 
communication and ongoing 
relationships with investors.
Andrew Noble (Chief Financial Officer) 
is responsible for the Group’s 
worldwide functions in finance, 
treasury and taxation. He has 
responsibility for the Group’s finance 
systems, accounting policies and 
controls. Andrew also works closely 
with the practice principals, regional 
managing directors and finance 
leaders across Ebiquity. 
Morag Blazey (Managing Principal, 
Market Intelligence) leads the Market 
Intelligence capability globally. Her 
principal responsibilities are to raise 
Ebiquity’s profile, drive renewals and 
new business, and develop and execute 
service and product developments and 
growth strategies. In light of the 
Company’s announcement that it is 
selling its Advertising Intelligence 
business, Morag is part of this business 
and will transfer with the business. 
Richard Nichols (independent 
Non-Executive Director) is a qualified 
chartered accountant. His previous 
experience includes serving as Finance 
Director and Chief Executive Officer of 
a number of listed and private 
companies. Richard is currently Chief 
Executive Officer of Instinctif 
Partners, who provide Ebiquity with 
financial PR advice. Richard is not part 
of the Instinctif team which advises 
Ebiquity and in the event that the 
Board formally discusses Instinctif’s 
instruction by the Company, Richard 
would recuse himself from those 
discussions. Accordingly, the Board 
considers Richard to be independent.
Julie Baddeley (independent 
Non-Executive Director) has significant 
experience of serving on the boards of 
listed companies, both as an executive 
and as a non-executive director, and of 
serving on and chairing board 
committees. Julie has experience 
across industry sectors, including in 
professional services organisations 
such as Accenture. She is currently 
chairman of Harvey Nash plc, which is 
listed on AIM. Julie brings valuable 
governance experience to Ebiquity.
Tom Alexander (independent 
Non-Executive Director) has enjoyed a 
highly successful career in the telecoms 
industry. The commercialism and 
business instinct developed by Tom 
during his career is of great value to 
the Board. The Board also draws upon 
Tom’s experience of an industry 
undergoing rapid technological change 
in guiding Ebiquity’s management 
through similar changes in the sectors 
in which the Company operates.
Rob Woodward (independent 
Non-Executive Director and Chairman 
Designate) brings a wealth of 
Board-level experience to Ebiquity. He 
was CEO of STV Group plc for nearly 
11 years and is currently Chairman of 
the AIM-listed data services provider 
Blancco Technology Group plc. Prior to 
STV, Rob was Commercial Director at 
Channel 4 for four years and previously 
a Managing Director for UBS 
Corporate Finance.
Further biographical details regarding 
the Directors are contained on pages 
34 and 35.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors 
has a written letter of appointment 
with the Company. These are available 
for inspection on Ebiquity’s website. 
Each of the Executive Directors has a 
written service agreement with the 
Company. None of these service 
agreements entitles a director to 
receive more than six months’ notice 
terminating his/her employment.

Corporate governance report continued
Matters reserved for the Board
As part of good governance there 
are certain matters which are not 
appropriate to be delegated to 
management or a committee of the 
Board and should be reserved for 
consideration by the Board as a whole. 
The Board has formally approved a 
written list of such matters (which is 
available on Ebiquity’s website) and 
which include:
• approving the annual budget and 
quarterly reforecasts;
• changes to the Group’s capital 
structure;
• approving the Company’s dividend 
policy;
• reviewing non-routine regulatory 
news service announcements made 
by the Company; and
• approving material contracts to be 
entered into by the Group.
Board meetings
During the year the Board met 
formally on 10 occasions. In addition, 
there were a small number of meetings 
convened on short notice to consider 
ad hoc matters.
The Board receives monthly 
management accounts and other 
relevant information as appropriate in 
advance of each Board meeting. This 
information is made available 
electronically via an online Board 
portal. Directors are able to access 
this information at any time, including 
following Board meetings.
There are a number of standing 
agenda items reviewed by the Board 
at each regular Board meeting, 
including a business update, current 
trading and outlook. Other items are 
considered by the Board as 
appropriate, including as a minimum, 
an annual review of the Company’s 
governance arrangements. 
Detailed minutes are taken of all Board 
meetings. Minutes are circulated to the 
Board and approved at the following 
Board meeting.
Advisers to the Board and its 
committees
The Board seeks advice from external 
advisers, including legal, tax and 
financial advisers, on various matters 
as and when appropriate. The 
Company Secretary attends all Board 
meetings and is available to advise on 
any corporate governance issues which 
may arise.
The Company’s auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, attend 
meetings of the Audit & Risk Committee. 
Directors may take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense as and when necessary to 
support the performance of their 
duties as Directors of the Company.
Risk management
The Board retains ultimate control and 
direction over appropriate strategic, 
financial, organisational and 
compliance issues. The Board has put 
in place an organisational structure 
with defined lines of responsibility. 
The Company has adopted an 
authority matrix which sets out the 
delegation of authority to individual 
business units and members of staff.
The internal control system put in place 
by the Company is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Commercial 
risks are an inherent part of business 
and as such the internal control system 
cannot provide absolute assurance 
against these risks. There is an internal 
Risk Committee which regularly meets 
to review existing risks and discuss new 
risks. The output of this is fed into the 
Audit and Risk Committee of the Board. 
Board committees
The Board has constituted several 
committees to help it in the 
performance of its functions. The 
principal committees are the Audit & 
Risk Committee, the Remuneration 
Committee and the Nomination 
Committee. The roles of these 
committees are set out below.
Audit & Risk Committee
The Audit & Risk Committee, which 
meets at least three times a year, is 
chaired by Richard Nichols. The Audit & 
Risk Committee currently comprises 
Richard Nichols, Michael Higgins, Rob 
Woodward and Tom Alexander. The 
Board considers Richard Nichols to have 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
Richard is a qualified chartered 
accountant and has served as the 
Finance Director and Chief Executive 
Officer of listed and private companies. 
Richard currently serves as the Chief 
Executive Officer of a private-equity 
backed company. The purpose of the 
Audit & Risk Committee is to ensure the 
preservation of good financial practices 
throughout the Group; to monitor that 
controls are in force to ensure the 
integrity of financial information; to 
review the interim and annual financial 
statements; to assess the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management systems and consider the 
Group’s risks and to provide a line of 
communication between the Board 
and the external auditors.
The Audit & Risk Committee is 
responsible for reviewing the 
performance of the external auditors 
on an annual basis, and for agreeing 
the scope of their work. The Audit & 
Risk Committee also monitors the level 
of non-audit work conducted by the 
external auditors to ensure that 
independence and objectivity are 
safeguarded. Details of non-audit fees 
paid to the external auditors are set 
out in note 4 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Audit & Risk Committee report can 
be found on pages 40 and 41.

Introduction
The Audit & Risk Committee is a key 
component of the Group’s governance 
framework. The Board has delegated to 
the Committee oversight of the Group’s 
financial reporting and the Group’s risk 
management process which aims to 
identify and mitigate significant risks.
All of the members of the Committee 
are independent Non-Executive 
Directors with a combination of 
accounting, financial and commercial 
experience. The Board considers 
Richard Nichols, who chairs the 
Committee, to have recent and 
relevant financial experience. Richard 
is a chartered accountant with 
significant financial and commercial 
experience in both listed and unquoted 
companies. Richard’s biography and 
appointments are set out on page 35.
The Committee met on three 
occasions during the year. The 
attendance of its members is set out in 
the table on page 39. Meetings of the 
Committee are commonly comprised 
of three sections. The first section of 
meetings of the Committee are also 
normally attended by the Group Chief 
Executive Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Company Secretary and 
other members of the senior 
management together with 
representatives from the external 
auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(‘PwC’) which ensures the Committee 
and the external auditors have access 
to all financial and operational 
knowledge. Subsequently, Committee 
members also meet with the external 
auditors without the Executive 
Directors and other senior 
management in attendance, which 
ensures that the Committee maintains 
an independent view. Finally, there is a 
section of the meeting attended solely 
by the members of the Committee.
Role and responsibility of the 
Audit & Risk Committee
The Committee’s terms of reference 
can be found on the Company’s 
website. The principal responsibilities 
of the Committee include:
• monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s financial statements, 
including a review of significant 
financial reporting issues and 
judgements;
• reviewing the external auditors’ 
independence and objectivity, the 
effectiveness of the external audit 
process and the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the 
external auditors;
• reviewing the Group’s financial 
controls and other internal 
reporting systems;
• reviewing progress on implementing 
control improvements; and
• keeping under review the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Company’s 
risk management systems.
Activities during the year
The key matters the Committee 
considered during the year are 
listed below.
In respect of the Group’s financial 
statements and interim accounts:
• the assessment of the carrying 
value of goodwill and intangible 
assets: the Committee assesses on 
a twice-yearly basis whether there 
are any indicators of impairment to 
the carrying value of any 
cash-generating unit. The 
Committee reviewed the key 
assumptions in the assessment of 
goodwill and the sensitivity of these 
assumptions and impact on the 
carrying value of goodwill and 
intangible assets. On this basis the 
Committee makes recommendations 
to the Board in this regard;
40 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 In respect of risk management:
• the Committee undertook 
significant work reviewing the 
output of management’s exercise 
preparing a register of the principal 
risks relevant to the Group and its 
business together with the 
mitigation steps taken to date by 
management and planned to be 
undertaken in the future;
• the Committee reviewed and 
approved the risk management 
framework prepared by 
management which outlined how 
risk would be identified and 
managed across the business; and
• the Committee included risk as a 
standing agenda item at each 
meeting for management to 
update the Committee on 
significant changes to the risk 
register and mitigating actions.
With regard to Ebiquity’s external 
auditors, the Committee’s principal 
activities were to:
• approve the terms of engagement 
and fees to be paid to the external 
auditors;
• approve the annual audit plan;
• review the findings of the auditors 
and management’s response; and
• evaluate the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors.
External auditors
PwC have been the external auditors 
of the Group since 2012, when a full 
tender process was carried out. 
The original audit partner served from 
PwC’s appointment until completion 
of the audit for the year ended 
31 December 2016 when he rotated 
off the audit. A new partner was 
appointed for the audit of the 
Company’s financial statements for 
the year commenced 1 January 2017. 
A review of PwC’s independence is 
carried out each year before a 
recommendation is made to the Board 
to propose PwC for re-election at the 
AGM. In assessing PwC’s independence, 
the Committee received confirmation 
that, in PwC’s professional judgement, 
PwC is independent within the 
meaning of relevant UK regulatory 
and professional requirements.
Provision of non-audit services
The Committee reviews with 
management the engagement of the 
external auditors for non-audit services 
and the level of associated non-audit 
fees. Details of fees paid to PwC during 
the year are outlined in note 4 to the 
financial statements. Non-audit fees 
of approximately £46,000 were paid 
to PwC during the year in connection 
with Group restructuring activities. 
The Committee does not consider that 
auditor independence has been 
impacted by this matter.

Remuneration Committee report
Remuneration policy
The Board recognises the role of appropriate remuneration in attracting and retaining people with the industry-leading skills, 
knowledge and experience needed to develop and grow the business, and incentivising them to perform.
The Remuneration Committee has maintained the policy set out in the annual report for the period ended 31 December 2015, 
which is used to determine Executive Directors’ remuneration and as a guide for the Executive Committee in setting 
organisation-wide remuneration. 
In summary, the policy is as follows:
Element
Objective and  
link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Performance conditions 
and assessment
Base salary Provides an appropriate level 
of fixed income – 
commensurate with the role 
– to attract and retain the 
individual with the required 
capability.
Militates against excessive 
risk-taking and/or focus on 
short-term metrics by 
establishing sufficient 
balance against variable 
remuneration elements.
Paid monthly.
Used as basis for pension 
contributions and 
performance-related 
pay eligibility.
Reviewed annually, normally 
effective 1 April.
Set at role commencement. 
Updated via review against 
market comparators 
as needed.
The Committee has not set a 
maximum salary. 
The Committee ensures base 
salaries are equitable across 
all variables.
The Committee aims to 
maintain alignment between 
increases for the Directors 
and the wider workforce. It 
retains discretion to deviate 
in order to address specific 
circumstances, for example, 
but not limited to: 
• an increase in the 
individual’s scope and 
responsibilities; and
• the need to retain 
specialist expertise 
within a competitive 
talent market.
Not applicable.
Benefits  
(including 
pension)
Provides the necessary 
current and future health 
and security (for the 
individual and their 
dependents) to enable the 
individual to focus maximum 
attention on their role.
Private medical, life and 
critical illness insurances.
Defined contributions to 
personal pension.
Other benefits as considered 
appropriate by the 
Committee.
The Committee has not set 
maximum levels for benefits. 
It aims to ensure that 
individual arrangements for 
Directors are in line with 
policies applicable to the 
wider workforce.
Not applicable.
Performance 
bonus
Incentivises achievement of 
short-term financial and 
strategic performance goals.
On-target expectations 
expressed as a percentage 
of salary, relative to role.
Group financial targets set 
annually in relation to 
management expectations. 
Personal goals are set 
annually for each Executive 
Director in relation to 
strategy.
Individual participation is set 
with respect to the role 
performed.
Individual on-target 
expectation capped at 50% 
of base salary.
Maximum award of 200% of 
on-target amount in any one 
year i.e. a maximum of 100% 
of base salary for any one 
Director.
Measured over a one-year 
period.
Minimum thresholds of the 
Group’s annual financial 
performance determine the 
extent to which individuals 
may attain on-target 
expectation, which is also 
judged on individual 
performance against 
personal goals.
Long-Term 
Incentives 
(equity)
Incentivises longer-term 
growth and value creation 
through shareholder returns
Standard LTIP, with nominal 
price options subject to a 
minimum three-year vesting 
period with performance 
conditions.
Extent of individual awards 
determined with reference to 
role, performance and 
perceived future value.
Awards made in respect of 
each financial year typically 
do not exceed 100% of 
salary, subject to a maximum 
of 200% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances.
Uses appropriate targets for 
growth in earnings per share 
(and/or total shareholder 
return) over vesting period.
This policy reflects the Company’s current stage of development and anticipated growth, and balances risk and reward.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Directors exercised share options 
during the year (FY2016: nil). The 
highest paid Director exercised 
no share options, (FY2016: nil).
The Remuneration Committee consulted with its largest institutional investors during 2016/17 with the intention of amending 
its Long-Term Incentive (‘LTI’) plans to better align Directors’ (and other Executives’) interests with those of shareholders and 
with the longer-term strategy of the Group. The Company did not issue LTIs to executives during 2016 or 2017 due to this 
ongoing consultation with shareholders and the strategic review which resulted in the decision to sell the Advertising 
Intelligence business. The Company was unable to attain consensus amongst its major institutional investors and – given the 
need to retain and incentivise management – has since granted LTIs to Executives under the previously established executive 
incentive plan, details of which were shared with major institutional shareholders and are presented below.
The Remuneration Committee relies from time-to-time on advice and benchmarking from third parties in setting specifics of 
the Executive Directors’ remuneration.

Termination payments 
to Directors
One Director, Nick Manning, left 
the Company in the year ended 
31 December 2017 and has since been 
paid six months’ pay in lieu of notice 
and pension entitlements (£150,000) 
and an ex-gratia termination payment 
of £50,000 (2016: no directors, £nil).
Implementation of remuneration 
policy in 2018
The Executive Directors’ remuneration 
for the year that commenced on 
1 January 2018 includes base salary 
and benefits and an annual cash 
bonus in line with the Company’s 
remuneration policy.
The target bonus is 50% of base salary 
for the Group CEO and 30% for the 
other Executive Directors. Each 
individual must achieve the personal 
performance targets (‘KPIs’) set for 
them by the Board, and the Company 
must achieve its target levels of 
pro-forma (i.e. excluding that derived 
from in-year acquisitions) revenue and 
operating profit – which have been 
agreed by the Board and which are in 
excess of analyst expectations – for 
full 100% achievement of the 
theoretical bonus. 
Thresholds below target levels of 
revenue (minimum 97.5% of budget) 
and operating profit (minimum 90% 
of operating profit post-bonus) have 
been set to allow for pro-rata payment 
of bonuses at a level which protects 
operating profit margins and overall 
Group performance. Each Director has 
the potential to achieve up to a 
maximum of 200% of their theoretical 
target bonus as a result of exceptional 
individual and Company performance.

Acquisitions
On 1 September 2017, the Group 
completed the acquisition of Digital 
Balance Pty (‘Digital Balance’), an 
independent digital analytics 
consultancy located in Perth, Australia. 
Digital Balance is one of a small 
number of consultancies who are 
certified sales and implementation 
partners of both Google and Adobe. 
Digital Balance will provide an 
important extension to Ebiquity’s 
digital analytics services in Australia. 
Digital Balance was acquired for an 
initial cash consideration of 
AU$475,000 in cash. The maximum 
total consideration is AU$5,000,000 
payable in cash depending on the 
performance of the acquired business 
up to 31 December 2020.
Events after the reporting period
On 13 February 2018, the Company 
announced the disposal of its 
Advertising Intelligence business to 
Nielsen Media Research Limited for 
consideration of £26 million plus 
customary adjustments for working 
capital. The disposal is subject to 
certain conditions, including approval 
from the Competition and Markets 
Authority (‘CMA’). Completion is 
anticipated to take place during the 
second quarter of 2018, assuming the 
CMA provides clearance following its 
high-level Phase 1 examination. In the 
event the CMA should instead refer the 
transaction for a more detailed 
Phase 2 investigation, then Completion 
is unlikely to take place before the 
fourth quarter of 2018.
On 19 March 2018, the Company 
entered into an agreement to sell the 
trade and assets of its Reputation 
business to Echo Research Holdings 
Limited. Completion will take place on 
31 March 2018. The consideration 
payable is dependent upon the revenue 
performance of the business during 
the 12 months following completion. 
During 2017 the business contributed 
£1.2 million of revenue and generated a 
£0.2 million operating loss.

success of the business and as a result 
the Group pursues employment 
practices which are designed to 
attract, retain and develop this talent 
to ensure the Group retains its market 
leading position with motivated and 
satisfied employees. The Group has 
continued this year with its employee 
engagement programme, initiated in 
2011, measuring engagement levels 
and drivers through an annual survey 
and taking actions to further develop 
the leadership and organisation on the 
back of these findings. 
During 2017, the Company launched 
the Future Leaders programme which 
was created to ensure that the Group 
develops a pipeline of the leaders of 
tomorrow and supports the careers of 
high-potential individuals. We also 
developed and deployed a Global 
Competency Framework which is 
supporting our annual Talent Review 
process and the continuous 
development of our people’s 
behaviours, skills and knowledge.
The Group has continued its practice 
of using formal and informal 
communication channels to provide 
employees with the information they 
need to understand and achieve the 
objectives of the Group and to keep 
employees informed of matters 
affecting them as employees and the 
financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the 
Group.
The Group seeks to recruit, develop 
and employ throughout the 
organisation suitably qualified, capable 
and experienced people, irrespective of

belief, marital or civil partnership 
status or sexual orientation. The Group 
gives full and fair consideration to all 
applications for employment made by 
people with disabilities, having regard 
to their particular aptitudes and 
abilities. Where existing employees 
become disabled it is the Group’s policy 
to provide continuing employment 
wherever practicable in the same or an 
alternative position and to provide 
appropriate training. It is the policy 
of the Group that training, career 
development and promotion 
opportunities should be available 
to all employees.
Employees are encouraged to own 
shares in the Company, and many 
employees are shareholders and/or 
hold options under the Company’s 
share option schemes.
Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial 
instruments comprise bank loans and 
cash. The main purpose of these 
financial instruments is to provide 
finance for the Group’s operations. 
The Group has various other financial 
assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and trade payables, which 
arise directly from its operations. The 
operations of the Group generate cash 
and the planned growth of activities is 
cash generative. Full details of financial 
instruments are included in note 24 to 
the financial statements.

Going concern
The Board is responsible for 
considering whether it is appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis. After making 
appropriate enquiries, the Board 
concluded that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in 
operation for the foreseeable future 
and operate within banking facilities 
and the covenants therein. 
Furthermore, the anticipated proceeds 
from the sale of the Advertising 
Intelligence business would allow the 
Group to repay a significant proportion 
of its outstanding bank facility. For 
these reasons the Group continues to 
adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Independent auditors and 
disclosure of information 
to auditors
All of the current Directors have taken 
all the steps that they ought to have 
taken to make themselves aware of 
any information needed by the Group’s 
auditors for the purposes of their audit 
and to establish that the auditors are 
aware of that information. 
The Directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which 
the auditors are unaware.
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP, have indicated their willingness to 
continue in office, and a resolution that 
they be reappointed will be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the annual report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the parent 
company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising Financial 
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework (‘FRS 101’), and 
applicable law). Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the 
profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required 
to:

and then apply them consistently;

the European Union and applicable 
UK Accounting Standards

are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described 
in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the 
group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit. 
Report on the audit of the group 
financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Ebiquity plc’s 
group financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2017 and of its 
profit and cash flows for the 
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in 
the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Our audit approach
Overview
We have audited the financial 
statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements 
(the “Annual Report”), which comprise: 
the consolidated statement of 
financial position as at 31 December 
2017; the consolidated income 
statement and statement of 
comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of cash flows, 
and the consolidated statement of 
changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and the notes to the financial 
statements, which include a 
description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters 
that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Risk of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
We focused on this area because management’s assessment 
of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets 
involves complex and subjective judgements about the future 
results of the business.
No impairment was recognised during the year.
We focused on those Cash Generating Units (CGUs) we 
considered to carry more judgement because of current year 
losses or historical underperformance against budgets, or for 
which management’s impairment assessment model gave 
lower headroom relative to other CGUs.
The value in use calculations in relation to the Group’s China 
CGU (goodwill of £4,839k) was most sensitive to changes in 
key assumptions. The key judgements involved were future 
revenue growth, cost assumptions and the discount rate 
applied as set out in Note 9 to the Group financial 
statements.
We have evaluated management’s future cash flow 
forecasts, which were prepared to a sufficiently detailed 
level, including comparing them to the latest Board approved 
budgets, testing the integrity of the underlying calculations 
and assessing how both internal and external drivers of 
performance were incorporated into the projections. 
We also challenged the discount rates used by independently 
recalculating the cost of capital.
Given the China CGU has seen a weaker performance in 
2017, new management has been put in place to address 
this and the carrying value of the goodwill is dependent on 
the CGUs ability to generate profits from 2019 onwards. 
We compared 2017 financial performance to budget and 
understood the reasons for the differences from the 
forecasts prepared for the 31 December 2016 financial 
statements and their impact on the future drivers of 
improvement in profitability.
For the Group’s China CGU, we also performed sensitivity 
analysis around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts, 
in particular the revenue, growth, cost assumptions and 
discount rate. Having ascertained the extent of change in 
those assumptions that either individually or collectively 
would be required for the goodwill and intangible assets 
to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such 
movement arising in those key assumptions.
Management has built increased profitability into their 
forecasts for the CGU and we challenged them on the 
realistic impact of the actions they have taken, and intend 
to take, to improve the profitability.
Although we considered management’ expectations of the 
impact of the their actions to be reasonable in light of the 
evidence available, failure to meet these forecasts and to 
generate a profit may result in impairment of the goodwill 
associated with the China CGU.
Therefore we also examined the disclosures made in 
the financial statements and concluded that they are 
appropriate.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for contract revenue recognition
Income is recognised evenly over the period of the contract 
for Market Intelligence businesses, and in accordance with the 
stage of completion of the contract activity for the Media 
Value Measurement and Marketing Performance 
Optimisation businesses. The stage of completion is 
determined relative to the total number of hours expected 
to complete the work or provision of services.
Where recorded revenue exceeds amounts invoiced to clients, 
the excess is classified as accrued income and where recorded 
revenue is less than amounts invoiced to clients, the 
difference is classified as deferred income.
Where services are performed by an indeterminate number 
of acts over a specific period, revenue is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the specific period unless there is 
evidence that some other method better represents the 
stage of completion.
If the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, the 
contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs 
incurred that it is probable would be recoverable. Costs are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which they are 
incurred.
Careful consideration needs to be given to projects open at 
year end requiring significant judgement in respect of the 
stage of completion and the associated revenue and profit to 
be recognised.
The total amount of revenue and profit to be recognised 
under a contract can be affected by changes in conditions 
and circumstances over time, such as:
• variations to the original contract terms
• cost overruns
• scope changes that require further negotiation and 
settlement.
Variations can arise from changing client specifications, 
changes to the job based on unforeseen circumstances 
(e.g. macroeconomic factors), as well as from inefficiencies 
on the part of either party. There can be some uncertainties, 
therefore, in determining the amounts to be recovered from 
any additional work performed.
The risk is, therefore, that contract revenue is not recognised 
in the correct period or that revenue and associated profit is 
misstated.
We understood management’s policies and their controls for 
recording revenue.
We performed detailed end-to-end walkthroughs of the 
finance and operational processes, utilising our 
understanding from the prior years to reassess the design 
effectiveness of the key internal controls and identify 
changes, if any.
We reviewed a sample of the terms and conditions attached 
to revenue contracts and evaluated management’s 
judgements used to determine the timing of recognition 
of revenue.
We selected a number of contracts:
• with significant revenue recognised in the year or
• with significant accrued income
• a further sample on a random basis.
To assess whether revenue and profit is accurately recorded, 
we tested the hours complete on a sample of contracts by 
obtaining an understanding from project managers as to 
how they had estimated these hours, challenging the 
assumptions, evaluating the outturn of previous estimates 
and agreeing the actual hours incurred post-year end to the 
forecast for the period.
We also assessed how the project managers determined 
that the stage of completion was correctly calculated by 
obtaining their calculations and agreeing the inputs to 
supporting evidence and correspondence with customers. 
We found that revenue was recorded appropriately.
To test the timing of contract revenue, we challenged 
management’s judgements on the completeness of work 
for our sample of contracts by checking original contracts, 
amendments to contracts, where applicable (e.g. due to 
agreed changes in scope), and checking that the contractual 
milestones had been reached.
No significant issues were noted from our work.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to 
ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on 
the financial statements as a whole, 
taking into account the structure of 
the group, the accounting processes 
and controls, and the industry in which 
it operates.
The following matters are considered 
when determining the scope of the 
audit by component:
• We identify components which are 
financially significant to the Group;
• We identify components considered 
likely to include a significant risk of 
material misstatement to the 
Group financial statements;
• We consider the findings from prior 
year audits and assess whether it 
would provide further insight to the 
Group to revisit certain territories to 
provide an update; and
• We consider if there are any 
other components that contribute 
a significant amount to key income 
statement and balance sheet 
measures and ensure sufficient 
coverage of each material line 
item in the financial statements 
is obtained through components 
in scope.
We also considered locations visited 
and those out of scope in the prior 
three years. The scoping calculation 
is based upon obtaining sufficient 
coverage of each financial statement 
line item, which varies depending on 
the risk assessment.
The Group operates through 
subsidiaries in the US, Australia, China, 
UK, France, Germany and other 
European countries. There are three 
financially significant components 
being: Ebiquity plc, Ebiquity Associates 
Ltd, and Ebiquity Germany GmbH; for 
the purpose of obtaining required 
coverage over the group balances, we 
have also included in our scope Firm 
Decision Ltd and Ebiquity Russia Ltd 
(both incorporated in UK), Ebiquity Inc 
and Stratigent LLC (both incorporated 
in USA) and Ebiquity Pty Ltd 
(incorporated in Australia).
The scoping calculation is based 
upon obtaining sufficient coverage 
of each financial statement line 
item, which varies depending on 
the risk assessment.
The Group audit is performed in the 
UK by the same engagement leader 
and team; the German and Australia 
components have been audited by 
other network firms. As part of our 
audit procedures we have obtained 
access to the audit files of the 
components not directly audited by 
PwC UK and have reviewed the work 
performed. In the current year we 
visited the component in Germany and 
Australia and attended the clearance 
meeting with the local management.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced 
by our application of materiality. We 
set certain quantitative thresholds for 
materiality. These, together with 
qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and 
the nature, timing and extent of our 
audit procedures on the individual 
financial statement line items and 
disclosures and in evaluating the effect 
of misstatements, both individually 
and in aggregate on the financial 
statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £547,000 (2016: £587,000).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and highlighted items.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on the benchmarks used in the annual report, profit 
before tax and highlighted items is the primary measure used 
by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the 
group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was £46,000 and £489,000. Certain components were audited to a 
local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £10,000 
(2016: £10,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to 
going concern
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation to 
which ISAs (UK) require us to report to 
you when:
• the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in 
the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s ability to continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date when 
the financial statements are 
authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to 
the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of 
the information in the Annual Report 
other than the financial statements 
and our auditors’ report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the other 
information. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, any 
form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent 
material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to 
perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material 
misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work 
we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report based on these 
responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described 
above and our work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require 
us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, 
the information given in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent with the financial 
statements and has been prepared 
in accordance with applicable legal 
requirements.
In light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the group and its 
environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we did not identify any 
material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report.
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors  
for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the 
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 49, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, 
the directors are responsible for 
assessing the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the 
group or to cease operations, or have 
no realistic alternative but to do so
54 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the 
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Goodwill is allocated to each of the 
Group’s cash-generating units expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment 
at least annually or whenever there is 
evidence that it may be required. Any 
impairment is recognised immediately 
in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
the Group’s interest in an associate 
being the excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the Group’s share of 
the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets of the associate, is included 
within the carrying amount of the 
investment. The non-controlling 
shareholders interest in the acquiree 
is initially measured at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportion 
of the net fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised.
Where transactions with non-controlling 
parties do not result in a change in 
control, the difference between the 
fair value of the consideration paid or 
received and the amount by which the 
non-controlling interest is adjusted, is 
recognised in equity.
Where the consideration for the 
acquisition includes a contingent 
consideration arrangement, this is 
measured at fair value at the 
acquisition date. Any subsequent 
changes to the fair value of the 
contingent consideration are adjusted 
against the cost of the acquisition if 
they occur within the measurement 
period and only if the changes relate 
to conditions existing at the acquisition 
date. Any subsequent changes to 
the fair value of the contingent 
consideration after the measurement 
period are recognised in the income 
statement within administrative 
expenses as a highlighted item. 
The carrying value of contingent 
consideration at the statement of 
financial position date represents 
management’s best estimate of the 
future payment at that date, based on 
historical results and future forecasts.
1. Accounting policies 
General information
Ebiquity plc (the ‘Company’) and its 
subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’) 
provide independent data-driven 
insights to the global media and 
marketing community. The Group 
has 22 offices across 14 countries.
The Company is a public limited 
company, which is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange’s AIM Market and is 
incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The address of its registered office is 
CityPoint, One Ropemaker Street, 
London EC2Y 9AW.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards, International Accounting 
Standards and IFRS IC Interpretations 
(collectively ‘IFRSs’) issued by the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board (‘IASB’) as adopted by European 
Union (‘Adopted IFRSs’) and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies preparing 
their financial statements under 
Adopted IFRSs. The consolidated 
financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
The Group meets its day-to-day 
working capital requirements through 
its cash reserves and borrowings, 
described in note 17. The Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to 
operate within the level of its current 
cash reserves and borrowings, 
including continuing to meet the bank 
covenants therein. The Group 
therefore continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing its financial 
statements. The consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, as 
modified by the revaluation of financial 
assets and financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit or loss. 
The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in pounds sterling and 
rounded to the nearest thousand.
The principal accounting policies 
adopted in these consolidated financial 
statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied 
to all periods presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements 
incorporate the financial statements of 
the Company and entities controlled by 
the Company (its subsidiaries). Control 
is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. The results of each subsidiary 
are included from the date that control 
is transferred to the Group until the 
date that control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are 
made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting 
policies used in line with those used by 
the Group. All intra-group 
transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent 
the portion of the results and net 
assets in subsidiaries that is not held 
by the Group.
Business combinations  
and goodwill
The Group applies the acquisition 
method to account for business 
combinations. The cost of the 
acquisition is measured at the 
aggregate of the fair values, at the 
date of exchange, of assets given, 
liabilities assumed, and equity 
instruments issued by the Group in 
exchange for control of the acquiree. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
recognised initially at their fair value at 
the acquisition date. Goodwill is initially 
measured at cost, being the excess of 
the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred over the fair value of net 
identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed. The determination 
of the fair values of acquired assets 
and liabilities is based on judgement 
and the Directors have 12 months from 
the date of the business combination 
to finalise the allocation of the 
purchase price.
60 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 All costs directly attributable to the 
business combination are expensed as 
incurred and recorded in the income 
statement within highlighted items.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of 
the consideration received or receivable 
and represents amounts receivable for 
services provided in the normal course 
of business, net of discounts, VAT and 
other sales-related taxes. Income is 
recognised evenly over the period of 
the contract for our Market Intelligence 
businesses, and in accordance with the 
stage of completion of the contract 
activity for our Media Value 
Measurement and Marketing 
Performance Optimisation businesses. 
The stage of completion is determined 
relative to the total number of hours 
expected to complete the work or 
provision of services. Where recorded 
revenue exceeds amounts invoiced to 
clients, the excess is classified as 
accrued income and where recorded 
revenue is less than amounts invoiced 
to clients, the difference is classified as 
deferred income.
Where services are performed by an 
indeterminate number of acts over a 
specific period, revenue is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the 
specific period unless there is evidence 
that some other method better 
represents the stage of completion.
If the outcome of a contract cannot 
be estimated reliably, the contract 
revenue is recognised to the extent of 
contract costs incurred that it is 
probable would be recoverable. Costs 
are recognised as an expense in the 
period in which they are incurred.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income and expense 
represents interest receivable and 
payable. Finance income and expense 
is recognised on an accruals basis, 
based on the interest rate applicable 
to each bank or loan account.
Foreign currencies
For the purposes of the consolidated 
financial statements, the results and 
financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds 
sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company, and the 
presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements 
of the individual companies, 
transactions in currencies other than 
the entity’s functional currency 
(foreign currencies) are recorded at 
the rates of exchange prevailing on 
the dates of transactions. At each 
year-end date, monetary assets 
and liabilities that are denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated 
at the rates prevailing on the 
year-end date.
For the purpose of presenting 
consolidated financial statements, 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
foreign operations are translated at 
exchange rates prevailing on the 
year-end date. Income and expense 
items are translated at the average 
exchange rate for the period, which 
approximates to the rate applicable 
at the dates of the transactions. 
The exchange differences arising 
from the retranslation of the year end 
amounts of foreign subsidiaries and 
the difference on translation of the 
results of those subsidiaries into the 
presentational currency of the Group 
are recognised in the translation 
reserve. All other exchange differences 
are dealt with through the 
consolidated income statement.
Highlighted items
Highlighted items comprise non-cash 
charges and non-recurring items which 
are highlighted in the consolidated 
income statement as separate 
disclosure is considered by the 
Directors to be relevant in 
understanding the underlying 
performance of the business. 
The non-cash charges include share 
option charges and amortisation of 
purchased intangibles. 
The non-recurring items include the 
costs associated with potential 
acquisitions (where formal discussion 
is undertaken), completed acquisitions 
and their subsequent integration into 
the Group, adjustments to the 
estimates of contingent consideration 
on acquired entities, asset impairment 
charges, management restructuring 
and other significant one-off items. 
Costs associated with ongoing market 
landscaping, acquisition identification 
and early stage discussions with 
acquisition targets are reported in 
underlying administrative expenses. 
Taxation
The tax expense included in the 
consolidated income statement 
comprises current and deferred tax. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable 
on the taxable income for the period, 
using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted by the year-end date.
The Group is subject to corporate 
taxes in a number of different 
jurisdictions and judgement is required 
in determining the appropriate 
provision for transactions where 
the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain. In such circumstances, 
the Group recognises liabilities for 
anticipated taxes based on the best 
information available and where the 
anticipated liability is both probable 
and estimable. Where the final 
outcome of such matters differs from 
the amount recorded, any differences 
may impact the income tax and 
deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which the final determination is made.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income, in which case 
it is recognised in equity.

Internally generated intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their useful lives. Amortisation 
commences when the asset is available 
for use and useful lives range from one 
to five years. The amortisation expense 
is included within administrative 
expenses. Where an internally 
generated intangible asset cannot be 
recognised, development expenditure 
is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred.
Purchased intangible assets
Externally acquired intangible assets 
are initially recognised at cost and 
subsequently amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives, which vary from three 
to 10 years. The amortisation expense 
is included as a highlighted item within 
the administrative expenses line in the 
income statement. 
Intangible assets recognised on 
business combinations are recorded at 
fair value at the acquisition date using 
appropriate valuation techniques 
where they are separable from the 
acquired entity or give rise to other 
contractual/legal rights. The significant 
intangibles recognised by the Group are 
customer relationships which are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over 
a typical useful life of eight to 10 years.
Computer software
Purchased computer software 
intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful lives 
which vary from two to eight years.
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful 
life are not subject to amortisation and 
are tested annually for impairment. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill is grouped at the lowest levels 
for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows, known as 
cash-generating units. If the 
recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the 
carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then 
to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is 
stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the cost of assets over their 
estimated useful economic lives. 
The rates applied are as follows:
Motor vehicles  25% per annum 
reducing balance
Fixtures, fittings Five to 14 years  
and equipment   straight-line;  
or 25% per annum 
reducing balance
Computer Two to four years  
e q u i p m e n t  s t r a i g h t - li n e
Leasehold  Over the shorter of 
land and   the life or the 
buildings  estimated useful 
improvements life of the lease
Other intangible assets
Internally generated intangible assets 
– development expenditure
Internally generated intangible assets 
relate to bespoke computer software 
and technology developed by the 
Group’s internal software development 
team. During the year, the Group 
generated £1,202,000 of internally 
generated intangible assets 
(31 December 2016: £1,091,000).
An internally generated intangible 
asset arising from the Group’s 
development expenditure is recognised 
only if all of the following conditions 
are met:
• it is technically feasible to develop 
the asset so that it will be available 
for use or sale;
• adequate resources are available to 
complete the development and to 
use or sell the asset;
• there is an intention to complete the 
asset for use or sale;
• the Group is able to use or sell the 
intangible asset;
• it is probable that the asset created 
will generate future economic 
benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset 
can be measured reliably.
1. Accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Using the liability method, deferred tax 
is provided on all temporary 
differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes and their 
tax bases, except for differences 
arising on:
• the initial recognition of goodwill;
• the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction which is not 
a business combination and at the 
time of the transaction affects 
neither accounting or taxable profit; 
and
• investments in subsidiaries and 
jointly controlled entities where the 
Group is able to control the timing 
of the reversal of the difference and 
it is probable that the difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is 
restricted to those instances where it 
is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the difference 
can be utilised. The recognition of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
year-end date.
The amount of the asset or liability is 
determined using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the year-end date and are expected 
to apply when the deferred tax 
liabilities/assets are settled/recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset when the Group has a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets and liabilities and the deferred 
tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on 
either:
• the same taxable Group company; 
or
• different Group entities which 
intend either to settle current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis, 
or to realise the assets and settle 
the liabilities simultaneously, in each 
future period in which significant 
amounts of deferred tax assets or 
liabilities are expected to be settled 
or recovered.
62 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Financial liabilities
Borrowings consisting of 
interest-bearing secured and 
unsecured loans and overdrafts are 
initially recognised at fair value net of 
directly attributable transaction costs 
incurred and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The difference 
between the proceeds received net of 
transaction costs and the redemption 
amount is amortised over the period 
of the borrowings to which they relate. 
The revolving credit facility is 
considered to be a long-term loan.
Trade and other payables are initially 
recognised at their nominal value which 
is usually the original invoiced amount. 
Leases 
Where substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of a 
leased asset have been transferred to 
the Group (a ‘finance lease’), the asset 
is treated as if it had been purchased 
outright. The amount initially 
recognised as an asset is the lower of 
the fair value of the leased property 
and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments payable over the term 
of the lease. The corresponding lease 
commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between 
capital and interest. The interest 
element is charged to the income 
statement over the period of the lease 
and is calculated so that it represents 
a constant proportion of the lease 
liability. The capital element reduces 
the balance owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership are 
retained by the lessor (an ‘operating 
lease’), the total rentals payable under 
the lease are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term. The aggregate benefit 
of lease incentives is recognised as a 
reduction of the rental expense over 
the lease term on a straight-line basis. 
The land and buildings elements of 
property leases are considered 
separately for the purposes of 
lease classification.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised in the Group’s statement 
of financial position when the Group 
becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets 
as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and 
receivables are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable 
payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They arise principally 
through the provision of goods and 
services to customers (trade 
receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary assets. 
They are initially recognised at fair 
value plus transaction costs that are 
directly attributable to their 
acquisition or issue, and are 
subsequently carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate 
method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised 
when there is objective evidence (such 
as significant financial difficulties on 
the part of the counterparty or default 
or significant delay in payment) that 
the Group will be unable to collect all 
of the amounts due, the amount of 
such a provision being the difference 
between the net carrying amount and 
the present value of the future 
expected cash flows associated with 
the impaired receivable. For trade 
receivables, which are reported net, such 
provisions are recorded in a separate 
allowance account with the loss being 
recognised within administrative 
expenses in the income statement. On 
confirmation that the trade receivable 
will not be collectable, the gross 
carrying value of the asset is written 
off against the associated provision.
Assets that are subject to 
amortisation or depreciation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. If any such 
condition exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in 
order to determine the extent, if any, 
of the impairment loss. Where the 
asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other 
assets, estimates are made of the 
cash flows of the cash-generating 
unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair 
value, less costs to sell, and value in use. 
In assessing value in use, estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate appropriate to the 
specific asset or cash-generating unit.
If the recoverable amount of an asset 
or cash-generating unit is estimated 
to be less than its carrying amount, 
the carrying value of the asset or 
cash-generating unit is reduced to 
its recoverable amount. Impairment 
losses are recognised immediately 
in highlighted items in the 
income statement. 
In respect of assets other than 
goodwill, an impairment loss is 
reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that 
the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if the 
impairment loss had been recognised. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash in hand and short-term deposits. 
Cash and cash equivalents and bank 
overdrafts are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset.

Retirement benefits
For defined contribution pension 
schemes, the Group pays contributions 
to privately administered pension plans 
on a voluntary basis. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the 
contributions have been paid. 
Contributions are charged to the 
income statement in the year to 
which they relate.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability 
in the Group’s financial statements in 
the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s 
shareholders.
Critical accounting estimates  
and judgements
In preparing the consolidated financial 
statements, the Directors have made 
certain estimates and judgements 
relating to the reporting of results of 
operations and the financial position 
of the Group. Actual results may 
significantly differ from those 
estimates often as a result of the need 
to make assumptions about matters 
which are uncertain. The estimates 
and judgements discussed below are 
considered by the Directors to be those 
that have a critical accounting impact 
to the Group’s financial statements.
Critical accounting estimates include 
the terminal growth rate used in 
impairment assessments, inputs to 
share option accounting fair value 
models and amounts to capitalise as 
intangible assets. These estimates are 
reached with reference to historical 
experience, supporting detailed 
analysis and, in the case of impairment 
assessments and share option 
accounting, external economic factors. 
Critical accounting judgements include 
the treatment of events after the 
reporting period as adjusting or 
non-adjusting and the determination 
of segments for segmental reporting, 
based on the reports reviewed by the 
Executive Directors that are used to 
make strategic decisions. These 
judgements are determined at a Board 
level based on the status of strategic 
initiatives of the Group.
Where there are modifications to 
share-based payments that are 
beneficial to the employee then as well 
as continuing to recognise the original 
share-based payment charge, the 
incremental fair value of the modified 
share options as identified at the date 
of the modification is also charged to 
the income statement over the 
remaining vesting period. Where the 
Group cancels share options and 
identifies replacement options, this 
arrangement is also accounted for as 
a modification.
The grant by the Company of options 
over its equity instruments to the 
employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of 
employee services received, measured 
by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised over the vesting 
period as an increase to investment in 
subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity in the 
parent entity financial statements.
Provisions
Provisions, including provisions for 
onerous lease costs, are recognised 
when the Group has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result 
of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required 
to settle that obligation and the 
amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for 
future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the year-end date. If the 
effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects 
current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to 
the obligations.
1. Accounting policies continued
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the 
Group are recorded at the amount of 
the proceeds received, net of direct 
issuance costs.
Employee Share Ownership Plan 
(‘ESOP’)
As the Company is deemed to have 
control of its ESOP trust, it is treated 
as a subsidiary and consolidated for 
the purposes of the Group financial 
statements. The ESOP’s assets (other 
than investments in the Company’s 
shares), liabilities, income and expenses 
are included on a line-by-line basis in 
the Group financial statements. The 
ESOP’s investment in the Company’s 
shares is deducted from shareholders’ 
equity in the Group statement of 
financial position as if they were 
treasury shares.
Share-based payments
Where equity-settled share options are 
awarded to employees, the fair value 
of the options at the date of grant is 
charged to the income statement over 
the vesting period with a 
corresponding increase recognised in 
retained earnings. Fair value is 
measured using an appropriate 
valuation model. Non-market vesting 
conditions are taken into account by 
adjusting the number of equity 
investments expected to vest at each 
year-end date so that, ultimately, the 
cumulative amount recognised over 
the vesting period is based on the 
number of options that eventually vest. 
A charge is made irrespective of 
whether the market vesting conditions 
are satisfied. The cumulative expense 
is not adjusted for failure to achieve a 
market vesting condition.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 establishes three primary 
measurement categories for 
financial assets: amortised cost; fair 
value through other comprehensive 
income; and fair value through 
profit or loss. The basis of 
classification depends on the 
entity’s business model and the 
contractual cash flow 
characteristics of the financial 
asset. Investments in equity 
instruments are required to be 
measured at fair value through 
profit or loss with the irrevocable 
option at inception to present 
changes in fair value in other 
comprehensive income, not 
recycling. An expected credit losses 
model replaces the incurred loss 
impairment model used in IAS 39. 
For financial liabilities, there are no 
changes to classification and 
measurement, except for the 
recognition of changes in own credit 
risk in other comprehensive income, 
for liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 
relaxes the requirements for hedge 
effectiveness by replacing the 
bright-line hedge effectiveness 
tests. To qualify for hedge 
accounting, it requires an economic 
relationship between the hedged 
item and hedging instrument, and 
for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the 
same as the one that management 
actually uses for risk management 
purposes. Contemporaneous 
documentation is still required, but 
it is different from that currently 
prepared under IAS 39. There is an 
accounting policy choice to continue 
to account for all hedges under 
IAS 39. IFRS 9 is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018. The Group is 
implementing IFRS 9 during the first 
half of 2018. The classification and 
measurement basis for the Group’s 
financial assets and liabilities is 
expected to be largely unchanged 
by adoption of IFRS 9. 
Management’s preliminary view 
based on work performed to date 
is that no material impact on profit 
for future periods is expected. 
Management is in the process of 
assessing the impact on credit 
losses on receivables and past 
refinancings and this assessment 
is expected to be concluded during 
the first half of 2018. 
Taxation
The Group is subject to income taxes in 
all the territories in which it operates, 
and judgement and estimates of 
future profitability are required to 
determine the Group’s deferred tax 
position. If the final tax outcome is 
different to that assumed, resulting 
changes will be reflected in the income 
statement, unless the tax relates to an 
item charged to equity in which case 
the changes in the tax estimates will 
also be reflected in equity. The Group 
believes that its accruals for tax 
liabilities are adequate for all open 
audit years based on its assessment of 
many factors including past experience 
and interpretations of tax law. This 
assessment relies on estimates and 
assumptions and may involve a series 
of complex judgements about future 
events. To the extent that the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different 
than the amounts recorded, such 
differences will impact income tax 
expense in the period in which such 
determination is made.
Provisions
The Group provides for certain costs of 
reorganisation that has occurred due 
to the Group’s acquisition and disposal 
activity. When the final amount 
payable is uncertain, these are 
classified as provisions. These 
provisions are based on the best 
estimates of management.
Adoption of new standards  
and interpretations
On 1 January 2018, the Group will 
adopt the following amendments 
which are effective for accounting 
periods on or after 1 January 2018 and 
which have not yet been endorsed by 
the EU. Management is currently 
assessing the impact of these new 
pronouncements on the financial 
statements, which are not expected to 
be significant.
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. This 
standard addresses the 
classification, measurement and 
recognition of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. It replaces the 
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to 
the classification and measurement 
of financial instruments. IFRS 9 
retains but simplifies the mixed 
measurement model and 
Revenue recognition
The Group is required to make an 
estimate of the project completion 
levels in respect of contracts which 
straddle the year end for revenue 
recognition purposes. This involves 
a level of judgement and therefore 
differences may arise between the 
actual and estimated result.
Carrying value of goodwill  
and other intangible assets
Impairment testing requires 
management to estimate the value in 
use of the cash-generating units to 
which goodwill and other intangible 
assets have been allocated. The value 
in use calculation requires estimation 
of future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and the 
application of a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate present value. The 
sensitivity around the selection of 
particular assumptions including 
growth forecasts and the pre-tax 
discount rate used in management’s 
cash flow projections could 
significantly affect the Group’s 
impairment evaluation and therefore 
the Group’s reported assets and 
results. Further details, including a 
sensitivity analysis, are included in 
notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
Contingent consideration
The Group has recorded liabilities for 
contingent consideration on 
acquisitions made in the current and 
prior periods. The calculation of the 
contingent consideration liability 
requires judgements to be made 
regarding the forecast future 
performance of these businesses for 
the earn-out period. Any changes to 
the fair value of the contingent 
consideration after the measurement 
period are recognised in the income 
statement within administrative 
expenses as a highlighted item.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2017
The following new standard has been 
published that is mandatory to the 
Group’s future accounting periods but 
has not been adopted early in these 
financial statements.
• IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (effective on or 
after 1 January 2019). This standard 
replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and related 
interpretations and sets out the 
principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and 
disclosure of leases for both the 
lessee and the lessor. The standard 
addresses the definition of a lease, 
recognition and measurement of 
leases, and it establishes principles 
for reporting useful information to 
users of financial statements about 
the leasing activities of both lessees 
and lessors. A key change arising 
from IFRS 16 is that most operating 
leases will be accounted for on 
balance sheet for lessees. In future 
periods, the operating lease charge 
would be replaced by a depreciation 
charge that, whilst lower over the 
life of the lease than the current 
operating lease charge, is not 
expected to be materially different. 
The Directors are in the process of 
reviewing contracts to identify any 
additional lease arrangements that 
would need to be recognised under 
IFRS 16. IFRS 16 eliminates the two 
lease classifications that IAS 17 has 
(operating and finance leases) for 
the lessee, and instead all leases 
will have the same classification. 
Management will assess the impact 
on the Group of IFRS 16 prior to the 
effective date of implementation. 
• Although the detailed impact 
has not yet been quantified, 
management expects that the 
adoption of IFRS 16 will impact the 
accounting for those leases currently 
classified as operating leases. 
The Group will apply IFRS 16 from 
1 January 2019 and the quantitative 
impact will be included in the Group’s 
2018 interim results announcement.
1. Accounting policies continued
Adoption of new standards  
and interpretations continued
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers’. This standard 
deals with revenue recognition and 
establishes principles for reporting 
useful information to users of 
financial statements about the 
nature, amount, timing and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash 
flows arising from an entity’s 
contracts with customers. Revenue 
is recognised when a customer 
obtains control of a good or service 
and thus has the ability to direct the 
use and obtain the benefits from the 
good or service. Variable 
consideration is included in the 
transaction price if it is highly 
probable that there will be no 
significant reversal of the cumulative 
revenue recognised when the 
uncertainty is resolved. The 
standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, 
and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’, 
and related interpretations. 
The standard is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2018, and earlier 
application is permitted. The 
Group implemented IFRS 15 on 
1 January 2018 and has carried out 
a review of existing contractual 
arrangements as part of this 
process. The Directors anticipate 
there will be no material impact for 
the Media Value Measurement, 
Market Intelligence and Marketing 
Performance Optimisation revenue 
streams, based on the outputs of 
that contract review in the context 
of IFRS 15’s five step revenue 
recognition model. Under the 
existing accounting policy, revenue 
is recognised when the amounts can 
be reliability measured, which is 
considered to be when project 
milestones are reached. Under IFRS 
15, revenue can only be recognised 
when the Group has an enforceable 
right to be paid for work completed. 
Management assessed the 
likelihood of contract cancellation 
mid-flight, noting minimal instances 
of this occurring in prior periods. 
The classification and measurement 
of revenue is largely unchanged 
following the adoption of IFRS 15. 
No material impact on profit for 
future periods is expected.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 2. Segmental reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8 the Group’s operating segments are based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Directors that 
are used to make strategic decisions.
Certain operating segments have been aggregated to form three reportable segments, Media Value Measurement, Market 
Intelligence and Marketing Performance Optimisation:
• Media Value Measurement includes our media benchmarking, financial compliance and associated services;
• Market Intelligence includes our advertising monitoring, reputation management and research/insight services; and
• Marketing Performance Optimisation consists of our marketing effectiveness and multi-channel analytics services.
The Executive Directors are the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. They assess the performance of the operating 
segments based on operating profit before highlighted items. This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-recurring 
expenditure from the operating segments such as restructuring costs and purchased intangible amortisation. The measure 
also excludes the effects of equity-settled share-based payments. Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to 
segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the Group.
The segment information provided to the Executive Directors for the reportable segments for the year ended 
31 December 2017 is as follows:

Amortisation of purchased intangibles relates to acquisitions made in the current financial year of £28,000 and to acquisitions 
made in prior years of £1,924,000 (31 December 2016: £26,000 in the current financial year and £1,839,000 in prior years). 
Separate disclosure is considered relevant because amortisation of purchased intangibles has no correlation to underlying 
profitability of the Group.
In the current year, a non-cash IFRS 2 charge of £729,000 (31 December 2016: £652,000) was recorded. Separate disclosure 
is considered relevant to isolate charges and credits which are subject to volatility as a result of non-trading factors.
Total severance and reorganisation costs of £2,364,000 (31 December 2016: £nil) were recognised during the year, primarily 
consisting of £2,061,000 in relation to severances in the UK, France, Spain and China as part of one-off management 
restructuring in those countries. The remaining £303,000 relates to settlement of a client dispute. Separate disclosure is 
considered relevant as these charges are non-recurring and not reflective of the underlying operating costs of the business.

Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Total acquisition, integration and strategic costs of £1,437,000 (31 December 2016: £2,777,000) were recognised during the 
year, primarily consisting of £981,000 in relation to costs associated with the sale of the Ad Intel business (refer to note 30 
for further detail); £330,000 in relation to earn-out costs associated with the CMCG acquisition and other contingent 
consideration adjustments, net of foreign exchange differences; £68,000 in relation to the Digital Balance Australia Pty Ltd 
acquisition; and £58,000 in relation to financial restructuring costs. Separate disclosure is considered relevant as these charges 
are non-recurring and not reflective of the underlying operating costs of the business.
Contingent consideration adjustments, within acquisition, integration and strategic costs, are included as a cash item.
Current tax arising on the highlighted items is included as a cash item, while deferred tax on highlighted items is included as a 
non-cash item. Refer to note 7 for more detail.
As at 31 December 2017, £2,860,000 of the £3,711,000 cash highlighted items had been settled (31 December 2016: £1,197,000

£14,000 to the highest paid Director (31 December 2016: £14,000).
No Directors exercised share options during the year (31 December 2016: nil). In the period to 31 December 2017, the highest 
paid Director exercised no share options (31 December 2016: nil).
During the year, nil (31 December 2016: 500,000) share options were granted to Directors under the Group’s Executive 
Incentive Plan scheme. Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria (see note 23 for further details).

Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and to 18% (effective 1 April 2020) were 
substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. Further reductions to 17% (effective 1 April 2020) were substantively enacted on 
6 September 2016. As these changes have been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date, their effects 
are included in these financial statements.
Management considers that US tax reform substantively enacted by the date of these financial statements has not caused 
any material effect to the Group’s financial statements.

1. At 31 December 2017, the balance included £1,552,000 of acquired goodwill recognised following the acquisition of Digital Balance Australia 
Pty Limited. Refer to note 27 for further details.
The impairment test involves comparing the carrying value of the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated to the 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of all CGUs has been determined based on value in use calculations.
Under IFRS, an impairment charge is required for goodwill when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, defined 
as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. No impairment of goodwill was recognised in the year ended 
31 December 2017 (year ended 31 December 2016: £nil).
Value in use calculations
The key assumptions used in management’s value in use calculations are budgeted operating profit, pre-tax discount rate 
and the long-term growth rate. The Directors prepare a three-year pre-tax cash flow forecast based on the following financial 
year’s budget as approved by the Board, with revenue and cost forecasts for the following two years adjusted by segment 
and geography. The forecast takes account of actual results from previous years combined with management expectations 
of market developments.

9. Goodwill continued
Value in use calculations continued
Budgeted operating profit assumptions
To calculate future expected cash flows, management has taken the Board approved budgeted operating profit (‘EBIT’) for 
each of the CGUs for the 2018 financial year. Additionally, management charges have been allocated from the unallocated 
central costs budget back into the CGUs and thereby reducing Board approved EBIT in each CGU by this amount. 
The management charge is allocated based on 2017 actual management charges.
For the 2019 and 2020 financial years, the forecast EBIT is as per management’s three-year plan. The forecast 2020 balances 
are taken to perpetuity in the model. Management’s three-year plan uses certain assumptions to forecast revenue and 
operating costs within the Group’s operating segments beyond the 2018 budget.
Discount rate assumptions
The Directors estimate discount rates using rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risk 
specific to the CGUs. The three-year pre-tax cash flow forecasts have been discounted at between 7.0% and 8.6% 
(31 December 2016: between 7.2% and 8.7%).
Growth rate assumptions
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated at a rate of 2.25% (31 December 2016: 2.25%), which does not 
exceed the long-term average growth rate in any of the markets in which the Group operates.
The excess of the value in use to the goodwill carrying values for each CGU gives the level of headroom in each CGU. 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in all CGUs significantly exceed their carrying values with the 
exception of China.
Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s calculations of value in use for its respective CGUs are sensitive to a number of key assumptions. Other than 
disclosed below, management does not consider a reasonable possible change, in isolation, of any of the key assumptions, to 
cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its value in use. The considerations underpinning why management believes no 
impairment is required in respect of China are as follows, specifically what change in key assumptions would result in an 
impairment:
         % change leading 
        Current % to impairment
Budgeted revenue growth      15.0 (0.6) to 14.4
Budgeted cost growth       — 1
Pre-tax discount rate       10.03 0.32 to 10.35

80 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 All bank borrowings are held jointly with Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’). The committed facility, totalling 
£44,000,000, comprises a term loan of £10,000,000 (of which £1,250,000 remains outstanding at 31 December 2017 
(31 December 2016: £3,750,000), and a revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) of £34,000,000 of which £32,000,000 was drawn down 
at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £29,000,000). The term loan has a maturity date of 2 July 2018 and the RCF has 
a maturity date of 30 June 2019. The £10,000,000 term loan is being repaid on a quarterly basis to maturity, and the drawn 
RCF and any further drawings under the RCF are repayable on maturity of the facility. The facility may be used for contingent 
consideration payments on past acquisitions, to fund future potential acquisitions, and for general working capital requirements.
Loan arrangement fees of £90,000 (31 December 2016: £135,000) are offset against the term loan, and are being amortised 
over the period of the loan.
The facility bears variable interest of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.50%. The margin rate is able to be lowered each quarter end 
depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility is liable to a fee of 40% of the prevailing margin, which is set depending on 
the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio, as referred to above. The Group may elect to prepay all or part of the outstanding loan 
subject to a break fee, by giving five business days’ notice.
All amounts owing to the bank are guaranteed by way of fixed and floating charges over the current and future assets of the 
Group. As such, a composite guarantee has been given by all significant subsidiary companies in the UK, US and Germany.
Contingent consideration represents additional amounts that are expected to be payable for acquisitions made by the Group 
and is held at fair value at the statement of financial position date. All amounts are expected to be fully paid by April 2021.
All finance lease liabilities fall due within five years. The minimum lease payments and present value of the finance leases are 
as follows:

22. Reserves
Share premium 
The share premium reserve of £21,000 (31 December 2016: £nil) shows the amount subscribed for share capital in excess of 
the nominal value. 
Other reserves
Other reserves consists of the merger reserve, ESOP reserve and translation reserve.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve of £3,667,000 (31 December 2016: £3,667,000) arose on the issuance of shares at a premium on a Group 
restructure, where the premium on issue qualified for merger relief. There has been no movement in the period.
Share-based payment reserve
On 29 March 2016, the Group agreed to increase the total cap on consideration payable on the Stratigent LLC (‘Stratigent’) 
acquisition. The Group acquired Stratigent on 19 August 2013. Stratigent’s management held a 7% economic interest in 
Stratigent which was acquired by the Group for a total consideration to be determined by the financial performance of Stratigent 
over the three financial years ending 30 April 2016 and capped at $1.5 million. Stratigent’s financial performance over the first 
two financial years resulted in consideration of $1.1 million being paid to Stratigent’s management. In order to ensure that 
management remains incentivised to continue to drive and generate the financial performance achieved over the first two 
financial years, the Group agreed to increase the total cap on consideration payable to management. Accordingly, in March 2016, 
the cap on consideration was increased by an amount of $1.5 million, with any excess over and above the existing cap on 
consideration payable 25% in cash and 75% in new ordinary shares in Ebiquity plc (capped at 600,000 new shares). A share-based 
payment reserve amounting to £634,000 was created in equity representing 600,000 new shares in the Company.
The share-based payment reserve was settled on 17 November 2017 through the issuance of 600,000 new shares.
ESOP reserve
The ESOP reserve of £1,478,000 debit (31 December 2016: £1,478,000 debit) represents the cost of own shares acquired in the 
Company by the Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’). The purpose of the EBT is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by 
employees, by acquiring shares in the Company and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The EBT may 
operate in conjunction with the Company’s existing share option schemes and other schemes that may apply from time to time.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve of £2,688,000 (31 December 2016: £2,688,000) arises on the translation into sterling of the net assets 
of the Group’s foreign operations, offset by any changes in fair value of financial instruments used to hedge this exposure. 
At this time there are no hedges in place.
Retained earnings
The retained earnings reserve shows the cumulative net gains and losses recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
For detailed movements on each of the above reserves, refer to the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Executive Incentive Plan (‘EIP’)
This is a discretionary scheme for the Directors of the Company. 
On 12 May 2010, 4,200,000 options with an exercise price of 35p each were awarded under the EIP to two Directors. Vesting 
of the options was subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria designed to achieve growth of the business while at the 
same time maintaining and enhancing underlying earnings per share over the period to 30 April 2013.
On 27 January 2016, 200,000 options with an exercise price of 25p each were awarded under the EIP to an Executive Director. 
100,000 of these options will vest after six months’ service and the remaining 100,000 options will vest after 12 months’ 
service, in each case subject to the Executive Director remaining in the employment of the Company. 
Also on 27 January 2016, an additional 300,000 options with an exercise price of 25p each were granted under the EIP to an 
Executive Director. These options will vest conditionally on the satisfaction of performance criteria relating to the growth of 
the Company’s diluted adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) as described below. 100,000 options (‘tranche two’) will vest 
conditionally on the satisfaction of EPS growth. Any options from tranche one which do not vest will be rolled over into 
tranche two and will be capable of vesting along with the options granted as part of tranche two.
EPS growth, over the relevant performance period for each tranche, of 10% or more will result in all of the options in that 
tranche vesting. EPS growth of 4% over the relevant performance period will vest one-fifth of the options in that tranche. 
None of the options in a tranche will vest if EPS growth over the relevant performance period is less than 4%. Three-fifths 
of the options in a tranche will vest if EPS growth over the relevant performance period is 8%. The options in a tranche will 
vest on a straight-line basis where EPS growth over the relevant performance period is between 4% and 8% or between 
8% and 10%.
84 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 Executive share option plan (‘ESOP’)
This is a discretionary scheme, comprised of an HMRC approved schedule and an unapproved schedule. The ESOP provides a 
lock-in incentive to Executive Directors and key management. Vesting of these options is subject to the satisfaction of certain 
performance criteria and typically around the rate of growth of diluted adjusted earnings per share over a three-year period. 
Rights to ESOP options lapse if the employee leaves the Company.
Options awarded in the 2015 and May 2014 grants vest based on a sliding scale of compound growth rates of between 4% and 
10% whilst options awarded in the January 2014 and 2013 grants vest based on a sliding scale of compound growth rates of 
between 5% and 15%. In May 2014, a one-off award was made to an Executive Director in recognition of his continued service 
through to retirement. These options vest according to the rate of annual growth, in the range between 4% and 12%, in the 
total shareholder returns (‘TSR’) over a three-year period. The remaining options issued in the 2012 grant have no performance 
conditions attached.
460,000 (31 December 2016: nil) share options have been granted to employees under the ESOP in the year ended 
31 December 2017.
Enterprise management incentive scheme (‘EMI scheme’)
The EMI scheme is a discretionary share option scheme which provides that options with a value at the date of grant of up to 
£120,000, may be granted to employees. The EMI scheme provides a lock-in incentive to key management and is also utilised to 
attract key staff. Rights to EMI share options lapse if the employee leaves the Company. There are no further performance 
conditions.
No share options have been granted under this scheme since 13 April 2010 as the Group was, from that date, too large to 
qualify under the HMRC EMI scheme rules. 
Unapproved company share option plan (‘UCSOP’)
This is a discretionary scheme, which provides that options may be granted where employees were not eligible to join the EMI 
scheme. The UCSOP provides a lock-in incentive to key management. Rights to UCSOP options lapse if the employee leaves 
the Company.
No share options have been granted to any employees under the UCSOP in the year ended 31 December 2017.

continue to invest in the growth of the business and ultimately to provide an adequate return to its shareholders. The Directors 
believe the Group has sufficient capital to continue trading in the foreseeable future.

Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing those risks and the methods used to measure them are described below. Further quantitative information in respect 
of these risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Group’s exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and 
processes for managing those risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods unless otherwise stated 
in this note.
The Group is exposed through its operations to a variety of financial risks: credit risk; market risk (including interest rate and 
currency risk); and liquidity risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations.
Trade receivables
The Group operates in an industry where most of its customers are reputable and well-established multinational or large 
national businesses. When the credit worthiness of a new customer is in doubt, credit limits and payment terms are established 
and authorised by the Territory Finance Director. The Group will suspend the services provided to customers who fail to meet 
the terms and conditions specified in their contract where it is deemed necessary.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is 
represented by the carrying values as at the year end.
The credit control function of the Group monitors outstanding debts of the Group. Debtor reports are reviewed and analysed 
on a regular basis. Trade receivables are analysed by the ageing and value of the debts. Customers with any overdue debts are 
contacted for payment and progress is tracked on a credit control report. Based on these procedures, management assessed 
the credit quality of those receivables that are neither past due nor impaired as low risk. There have been no significant 
changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the Group that indicate this would change in the future.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables are reasonable approximations of their 
fair value.

The Group records impairment losses on its trade receivables separately from the gross amounts receivable. Impaired 
receivables are provided against based on expected recoverability. The movements on this allowance during the year are

Recovered amount reversed       — (119)
Foreign exchange        — 7
Closing balance        262 200
Market risk
Market risk arises from the Group’s use of interest bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments. There is a risk 
that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates (interest 
rate risk), foreign exchange rates (currency risk) or other market factors (other price risk).
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from bank loans and a revolving credit facility.
To illustrate the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, a 0.5% increase/decrease in the rate applied to the Group’s borrowings 
would have resulted in a post-tax movement of £129,000 (31 December 2016: £139,000).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency trading and intercompany balances, and also on the foreign currency 
bank accounts which it holds. These risks are offset by the holding of certain foreign currency bank borrowings. The translation 
of the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas subsidiaries represents a risk to the Group’s equity balances.
The Group’s exposure to currency risk at the year end can be illustrated by the following:

Other price risks
The Group does not have any material exposure to other price risks.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its 
debt instruments, the risk being that the Group may not meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The liquidity risk of each Group company is managed centrally by the Group. All surplus cash in the UK is held centrally to 
maximise the returns on deposits through economies of scale. The type of cash instrument used and its maturity date will 
depend on the Group’s forecast cash requirements. Throughout the year, the Group maintained a draw down facility with 
Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’) (see note 17) to manage any short-term cash requirements. At 31 December 2017: 
£2,000,000 (31 December 2016: £nil) was undrawn. The facility expires in June 2019 at which point drawn down amounts will 
be repayable.
It is a condition of the borrowings that the Group pass various covenant tests on a quarterly basis and the Group finance team 
regularly monitors the Group forecasts to ensure they are not breached.

The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair 
value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
• Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
• Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data.

The fair value of the contingent consideration of £2,094,000 (31 December 2016: £2,015,000), was estimated by applying the 
income approach. The fair value estimates are based on a discount rate of 3% forecast EBIT of FMC Ireland and Digital Balance 
Australia. This is a level 3 fair value measurement. The key assumptions in calculating the contingent consideration payable are 
the EBIT of the businesses acquired and the discount rate.

consideration of AU$475,000 (£278,000) and a further cash payment of AU$75,000 (£45,000) on 1 December 2017. 
AU$2,725,000 (£1,596,000) of contingent consideration was preliminarily recognised at acquisition however, the maximum 
total purchase consideration is up to AU$5,000,000 (£2,928,000), payable in cash, depending on the performance of the 
Digital Balance business during the period ending 31 December 2020.
The fair value of the purchase consideration for the acquisition of acquired the assets and liabilities of Digital Balance Pty 
Limited is as follows: 
          £’000

and 31 December 2020 with stage payments each year from 2018 onwards based on EBIT growth. The potential range of future payments that 
Ebiquity plc could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is between £nil and £2,928,000 and will be paid in cash.

30. Events after the reporting period
On 13 February 2018, the Group agreed to sell its Advertising Intelligence business to Nielsen Media Research Limited for 
£26,000,000 in cash. This has been treated as a non-adjusting event since the Advertising Intelligence business was not 
available for sale in its present condition, nor was a transaction highly probable, as of 31 December 2017. This determination 
was made based on the status of the potential sale as of 31 December 2017, with no agreement reached, legal terms not 
finalised and several external regulatory and other approvals not having been cleared.
The sale is subject to approval by the UK Competition & Markets Authority which, if the regulator does not refer the 
transaction to a phase two investigation, management expects will be completed during the second quarter of 2018.
On 19 March 2018, the Group entered into an agreement to sell the business assets of its Reputation division to Echo Research 
Holdings Limited. This is the remaining part of its Group’s Marketing Intelligence segment in addition to the Advertising 
Intelligence business. Completion will take place on 31 March 2018. The consideration payable is dependent upon the revenue 
performance of the business during the 12 months following completion.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Ebiquity plc
Report on the audit of the 
company financial statements
Opinion
In our opinion, Ebiquity plc’s 
company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state 
of the company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2017;
• have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, comprising 
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law); 
and
• have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial 
statements, included within the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements 
(the “Annual Report”), which comprise: 
the statement of financial position as 
at 31 December 2017 and the 
statement of changes in equity for the 
year then ended; and the notes to the 
financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and 
applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described 
in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the 
audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the 
group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed 
entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters, 
and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were 
addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. This is not a 
complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed 
the risks of material misstatement in 
the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in 
respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including 
evaluating whether there was evidence 
of bias by the directors that 
represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Our audit approach
Overview
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters 
that, in the auditors’ professional 
judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of 
material misstatement (whether or 
not due to fraud) identified by the 
auditors, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in

Matters
Materiality
• Overall materiality: £1,027,000 (2016: £912,000), based on 1% of total assets.
• To the extent balances were audited to support the Group audit opinion, materiality has been 
capped at an amount below the overall Group materiality.
• Each financial statement line item is based scoped based on the materiality level.
• Qualitative factors are also taken into account as well as the risk of understatement.
• All work is performed by PwC UK.
• Impairment of investments.

Impairment of investments
Given the Company is the ultimate parent of the group it 
holds investments in many subsidiaries.
The value of these investments is material to the accounts 
and there is a risk of impairment if the carrying values are 
deemed to be in excess of the recoverable amount.
We have reviewed investments for indicators of impairment.
Where indicators of impairment exist, for example where 
the investment’s carrying value is in excess of its net assets 
we have obtained management’s impairment assessment.
We have challenged management’s assumptions in 
their impairment assessment, recalculated models 
and agreed inputs.
We agree that no impairment is necessary.
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which it operates.
The Company operates from location and is corporate cost centre. Based on the materiality level identified, financial 
statement line items which are considered material both on a qualitative and quantitative basis are selected as in the scope 
of our testing.
The audit work performed over the Company was conducted by PwC UK, the group audit team; component auditors were 
not used.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall materiality £1,027,000 (2016: 912,000).
How we determined it 1% of total assets.
Rationale for benchmark applied Based on total assets as the entity holds a majority of the 
Group’s assets and is not a profit generating entity.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £10,000 
(2016: £10,000) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating  
to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect 
of the following matters in relation 
to which ISAs (UK) require us to 
report to you when: 
• the directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or
• the directors have not disclosed in 
the financial statements any 
identified material uncertainties 
that may cast significant doubt 
about the company’s ability to 
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting for a period of 
at least twelve months from the 
date when the financial statements 
are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events 
or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the 
company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of 
the information in the Annual Report 
other than the financial statements 
and our auditors’ report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the other 
information. Our opinion on the 
financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, 
except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in this report, 
any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the 
financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other 
information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify an apparent 
material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to 
perform procedures to conclude 
whether there is a material 
misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the 
work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of 
this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report based on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report, we also 
considered whether the disclosures 
required by the UK Companies Act 
2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described 
above and our work undertaken in the 
course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require 
us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work 
undertaken in the course of the audit, 
the information given in the Strategic 
Report and Directors’ Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 is 
consistent with the financial statements 
and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and 
understanding of the company and its 
environment obtained in the course of 
the audit, we did not identify any 
material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the financial 
statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the 
financial statements
As explained more fully in the 
Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 49, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements in accordance 
with the applicable framework and for 
being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial 
statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, 
the directors are responsible for 
assessing the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing 
as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the company 
or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with 
ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
 A further description of our 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the 
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities. This description 
forms part of our auditors’ report.

1. General information
Ebiquity plc (the ‘Company’) acts as a 
holding company and is incorporated 
and domiciled in the UK. The address 
of its registered office is CityPoint, 
One Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 
9AW.
The financial statements of the 
Company represent the results for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 whilst 
the comparatives represent the results 
for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
The financial statements present 
information about the Company as an 
individual undertaking and not about 
its group.
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the 
Company have been prepared in 
accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ (‘FRS 101’). The financial 
statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. The Company 
meets its day-to-day working capital 
requirements through its cash reserves 
and borrowings, described in note 17 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Company 
should be able to operate within the 
level of its current cash reserves and 
borrowings, including continuing to 
meet the bank covenants therein. The 
Company therefore continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements. The financial 
statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention and in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
2006. The Company has taken 
advantage of the following disclosure 
exemptions under FRS 101:
a. the requirements of paragraphs 
45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2 
‘Share-based Payment’ (details of 
the number of weighted-average 
exercise prices of share options, and 
how the fair value of goods and 
services received was determined);
Summary of significant 
accounting policies
The principal accounting policies 
adopted are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied 
to all periods presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Finance income and expenses
Finance income and expenses 
represents interest receivable and 
payable. Finance income and expense 
is recognised on an accruals basis, 
based on the interest rate applicable 
to each bank or loan account.
Foreign currency transactions
The results and financial position of 
the Company are expressed in pounds 
sterling, which is the functional 
currency of the Company and the 
presentation currency for the 
Company financial statements.
Trading transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at the exchange rate ruling 
when the transaction was entered 
into. Assets and liabilities expressed in 
foreign currencies are translated into 
sterling at rates of exchange ruling at 
the end of the financial period.
All transactions involving foreign 
exchange gains and losses are dealt 
with through the income statement 
as and when they arise.
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity-settled 
share-based payments to its 
employees and employees of 
subsidiaries using the Company’s 
equity instruments. These are 
measured at fair value (excluding the 
effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions) at the date of grant and 
expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the 
Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest and adjusted for the 
effect of non-market-based vesting 
conditions. A corresponding credit is 
recorded in equity.
Notes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2017
100 Ebiquity plc
Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 For share options without performance 
conditions, fair value is measured by use 
of the Black–Scholes Model. The 
expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimates, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, 
and behavioural considerations.
The grant by the Company of options 
over its equity instruments to the 
employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Group is treated as a capital 
contribution. The fair value of 
employee services received, measured 
by reference to the grant date fair 
value, is recognised over the vesting 
period as an increase to investment in 
subsidiary undertakings, with a 
corresponding credit to equity in the 
parent entity financial statements. 
Retirement benefits
For defined contribution pension 
schemes, the Company pays 
contributions to privately administered 
pension plans on a voluntary basis. The 
Company has no further payment 
obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. Contributions are charged 
to the income statement in the period 
to which they relate.
Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when 
the right to receive payment is 
established.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the 
Company’s shareholders is recognised 
as a liability in the Company’s financial 
statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Intangible assets
Computer software
Purchased computer software 
intangible assets are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over their useful lives 
which vary from four to five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is 
stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any recognised 
impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write 
off the cost of assets over their 
estimated useful lives and is recognised 
in the income statement within 
administrative expenses. The rates 
applied are as follows:
Fixtures, fittings 20% per annum  
and equipment   straight-line
Computer 
equipment  25% straight-line
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are held 
at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
Where the purchase consideration 
for the acquisition of an interest in a 
subsidiary is contingent on one or more 
future events, the cost of investment 
includes a reasonable estimate of the 
fair value of the amounts of 
consideration that are expected to 
be payable in the future. The cost of 
investment and the contingent 
consideration liability is adjusted 
until the ultimate payable is known.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise 
cash in hand and short-term deposits. 
In the statement of financial position, 
bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities.
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the 
Company are recorded at the amount 
of the proceeds received, net of direct 
issuance costs.
Deferred taxation
Recognition of deferred tax assets is 
restricted to those instances where it 
is probable that taxable profit will be 
available against which the difference 
can be utilised. The recognition of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
year-end date.
The amount of the asset or liability is 
determined using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the year-end date and are expected 
to apply when the deferred tax 
liabilities/assets are settled/recovered.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities 
are recognised in the Company’s 
statement of financial position when 
the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the 
instrument.
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial 
assets as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans 
and receivables are non-derivative 
financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not 
quoted in an active market. They arise 
principally through the provision of 
goods and services to customers 
(trade receivables), but also 
incorporate other types of contractual 
monetary asset. They are initially 
recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or 
issue, and are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method, less provision 
for impairment.

Directors’ remuneration
Fees paid to the Company’s Directors

Employee Share Ownership Plan 
(‘ESOP’)
The ESOP’s investment in the 
Company’s shares is deducted from 
shareholders’ equity in the statement 
of financial position as if they were 
treasury shares, except that profits 
on the sale of ESOP shares are not 
credited to the share premium account.
Critical accounting estimates  
and judgements 
In preparing the Company financial 
statements in conformity with FRS 
101, the Directors are required to make 
certain estimates and judgements 
relating to the reported results of 
revenue and expenses during the 
period and the financial position of the 
Company at the reporting date. Actual 
results may differ from those 
estimates. 
Due to the nature of operations, the 
key area of judgement that has the 
most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Company financial 
statements, is the review for 
impairment of the carrying value of 
investments in subsidiaries.
3. Company results for the year
The Company has taken advantage of 
the exemption allowed under section 
408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
present its own income statement in 
these financial statements.
The movement in reserves of the 
Company includes a loss for the year of 
£1,913,000 (31 December 2016: loss for 
the year of £1,380,000).
2. Basis of preparation continued
Financial instruments continued
Financial liabilities
Borrowings consisting of 
interest-bearing secured and 
unsecured loans and overdrafts are 
initially recognised at fair value net of 
directly attributable transaction costs 
incurred and subsequently measured 
at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The difference 
between the proceeds received net of 
transaction costs and the redemption 
amount is amortised over the period of 
the borrowings to which they relate. 
The revolving credit facility is 
considered to be a long-term loan.
Trade and other payables are initially 
recognised at their nominal value which 
is usually the original invoiced amount. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the 
Company has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result 
of past events, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required 
to settle that obligation and the 
amount can be reliably estimated. 
Provisions are not recognised for 
future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the year-end date. If the 
effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a pre-tax rate which reflects 
current market assessments of the 
time value of money and, where 
appropriate, the risks specific to 
the obligations.

£44,000,000, comprises a term loan of £10,000,000 (of which £1,250,000 remains outstanding at 31 December 2017 
(31 December 2016: £3,750,000)), and a revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) of £34,000,000, (of which £32,000,000 was drawn down

maturity date of 30 June 2019. The £10,000,000 term loan is being repaid on a quarterly basis to maturity, and the drawn RCF 
and any further drawings under the RCF are repayable on maturity of the facility. The facility may be used for contingent 
consideration payments on past acquisitions, to fund future potential acquisitions, and for general working capital requirements.
Loan arrangement fees of £90,000 (31 December 2016: £135,000) are offset against the term loan, and are being amortised 
over the period of the loan.

depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility is liable to a fee of 40% of the prevailing margin. The Group may elect to 
prepay all or part of the outstanding loan subject to a break fee, by giving five business days’ notice.
All amounts owing to the bank are guaranteed by way of fixed and floating charges over the current and future assets of the 
Group. As such, a composite guarantee has been given by all significant subsidiary companies in the UK, US and Germany.

for merger relief. There has been no movement in the year.
Share-based payment reserve
On 29 March 2016, the Group agreed to increase the total cap on consideration payable on the Stratigent LLC (‘Stratigent’) 
acquisition. The Group acquired Stratigent on 19 August 2013. Stratigent’s management held a 7% economic interest in 
Stratigent which was acquired by the Group for a total consideration to be determined by the financial performance of 
Stratigent over the three financial years ended 30 April 2016 and capped at $1.5 million. Stratigent’s financial performance 
over the first two financial years resulted in consideration of $1.1 million being paid to Stratigent’s management. In order 
to ensure that management remains incentivised to continue to drive and generate the financial performance achieved 
over the first two financial years, the Group agreed to increase the total cap on consideration payable to management. 
Accordingly, in March 2016, the cap on consideration was increased by an amount of $1.5 million, with any excess over 
and above the existing  cap on consideration payable 25% in cash and 75% in new ordinary shares in Ebiquity plc (capped 
at 600,000 new shares). A share-based payment reserve amounting to £634,000 was created in equity representing 
600,000 new shares in the Company.
The share-based payment reserve was settled on 17 November 2017 through the issuance of 600,000 new shares.

purpose of the EBT is to facilitate and encourage the ownership of shares by employees, by acquiring shares in the Company 
and distributing them in accordance with employee share schemes. The EBT may operate in conjunction with the Company’s 
existing share option schemes and other schemes that may apply from time to time.

is responsible for the administration and maintenance of the trust. The number of shares held by the trust is 4,201,504 
(31 December 2016: 4,201,504), all of which are under option to the employees of the Group. As at the statement of financial
