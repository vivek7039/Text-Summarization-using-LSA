The Group provides a comprehensive 
range of merchandise and services 
for customers and their pets. It is the 
combination of our specialist retail offer, 
veterinary practices and grooming 
salons, all within a single pet-focused 
environment, that represents a uniquely 
attractive offer to our customers. 
Retail
Our merchandise offer is provided from 
our retail store network and website. 
Within our stores, well-trained colleagues 
provide detailed advice on areas such  
as pet nutrition and the set-up of home 
aquaria. Investment in our omnichannel 
capabilities provides additional 
convenience for customers. 
Services
We provide veterinary services through 
our first opinion network of Joint Venture 
practices, and our specialist referral 
centres. Our first opinion practices are 
operated mainly under the Vets4Pets 
brand and are situated in stores and  
in standalone locations. Our referral 
centres provide high level, specialist 
services to vets working in our own and 
in other first opinion practices. Grooming 
services are provided primarily from 
salons within our retail stores.

Going from strength to strength  
Growing the number of stores with both 
vet and grooming services is central 
to our strategy
By creating a store with 
products, a vet practice 
and a grooming salon, 
alongside our website with 
additional products that 
can be delivered to home 
or to our stores, we give pet 
owners access to everything 
they need.
A customer who shops online 
or in our stores but does 
not use any services spends 
around £140 a year. Whilst 
a customer who also uses 
our vet and grooming services 
will spend over £180 on 
products, plus an additional 
£200 per year on services. 
This reflects the increased 
loyalty and shopping frequency 
of services customers.

Our aim is to achieve national coverage  
for specialist veterinary referrals
The Group operates four 
specialist veterinary referral 
centres: Dick White Referrals, 
Northwest Veterinary 
Specialists, Anderson 
Moores, and Eye Vet 
Referrals. Our aim is to 
create national coverage 
by expanding our presence 
in this premium segment 
of the veterinary market to 
up to 15 specialist centres.
To manage this growth we 
have implemented a divisional 
structure within the Vet Group, 
creating a new Specialist 
Division alongside the existing 
First Opinion Division which 
comprises the Vets4Pets and 
Companion Care Joint Venture 
veterinary practices.
Although our entry into the 
market for specialist referrals 
was by way of acquisition,  
we are now able to call 
on the experience of the 
founders of some of Europe’s 
most respected veterinary 
referral clinics to advise 
on our growth strategy. We 
expect to achieve our goals 
through a combination of 
greenfield openings and 
further acquisitions.

In a more uncertain  
retail and economic 
environment we are 
confident the Group  
is well placed to meet  
the challenges ahead.”
In a year that has seen the introduction of 
the National Living Wage, the vote for the 
UK to leave the European Union and the 
resulting devaluation of Sterling against 
both the US Dollar and the Euro, I am 
pleased to report another year of progress 
for the Group. While we expect some 
uncertainty ahead as the UK negotiates 
the terms of Brexit, we remain confident  
in the long term prospects for the Group 
based around our strategy to build a 
unique pet-focused offer of products 
and services within our store estate, to 
maximise our investments in omnichannel 
which will bring more of Pets at Home 
to customers more of the time, and to 
develop national coverage of first opinion 
vet practices and specialist referral 
centres within our Vet Group.
Following a strong first half, Merchandise 
sales in the second half were softer than 
anticipated, although online grew strongly 
reflecting the momentum gained from our 
omnichannel investments. Vet services 
again delivered strong growth driven by 
our strategy of providing a quality service 
to clients across both first opinion 
and specialist referral centres. In the 
year as a whole, revenue grew 7.2%
◊
 
to £834.2 million. Like-for-like
†
 growth 
was 1.5%
◊
. The Board proposes an 
ordinary dividend of 7.5p per share.
The combination of our specialist  
retail offer, veterinary practices and  
pet grooming salons, all within a single 
pet-focused environment, represents a 
uniquely attractive offer to our customers 
and, as more of our recent investments  
in vet practices and grooming salons 
mature, will deliver increasingly powerful 
financial results. As the year progressed 
we launched a number of important 
initiatives to bolster our service and  
value propositions. Building on our 
investments that support omnichannel 
shopping we launched a subscription 
platform, initially for flea treatments,  
and Order in Store which allows 
colleagues to serve customers from our 
extended online range via instore iPads 
– our PetPads. Online sales grew by 
53%
◊
. We also launched Switch & Save, 
highlighting the value of our private 
brands in Advanced Nutrition, and we 
will continue to offer better value to our 
customers across our product ranges. 
Our VIP loyalty scheme continues to grow, 
delivering highly targeted information and 
offers to our customers and providing 
us with powerful data on their purchasing 
behaviour.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 The diversification of our veterinary 
business has continued with the 
acquisitions of Eye Vet Referrals and Dick  
White Referrals, bringing the number of 
specialist referral centres in the Group  
to four. Joining Northwest Veterinary 
Specialists and Anderson Moores, The 
Eye Vet is a dedicated ophthalmology 
practice, while Dick White Referrals is one 
of the largest specialist veterinary centres 
in Europe, offering outstanding levels of 
clinical care in state-of-the-art facilities. 
We have identified opportunities to 
expand our network of specialist referral 
centres to give us nationwide coverage 
and to maximise this opportunity we have 
established a new Specialist Division 
alongside our existing First Opinion 
Division in the expanded Vet Group. 
Management 
Following the appointment of Ian Kellett 
as Group Chief Executive in April 2016,  
we appointed Mike Iddon as Group Chief 
Financial Officer in October 2016. Mike 
joined the Group from New Look, where 
he had been the Chief Financial Officer. 
He has a wealth of experience in the  
retail sector having previously held senior 
finance positions at Tesco plc. He 
qualified as a Chartered Accountant 
with Arthur Andersen. As a consequence 
of Mike’s appointment, Mark Adams,  
who had been an excellent Interim  
Chief Financial Officer, left the Group in 
November 2016. I would like to welcome 
Mike to the business and to thank Mark 
for his stewardship as Interim CFO.
We recognise the significant potential  
that exists for the Group, particularly  
in the veterinary sector, and have 
therefore made a number of changes  
to the responsibilities of our Executive 
Management Team to give us better  
focus as we enter the new financial  
year. Sally Hopson, who was CEO of our 
Services Division, will exclusively drive  
the development of our Vet Group. Peter 
Pritchard, CEO of our Retail Division, will 
assume responsibility for Grooming, while 
pet insurance services transfers to Mike 
Iddon, CFO. Louise Stonier will extend  
her remit to cover people in a new role  
as Chief People and Legal Officer. 
Colleagues
It is a shared passion for pets that forms 
the special bond between our business, 
our colleagues and our customers. I would 
again like to thank all our colleagues, in 
every part of the business, for their hard 
work and dedication in a more challenging 
economic environment. 
With the adoption of the National Living 
Wage we made no distinction between 
colleagues based on age alone and we 
have maintained our Earn As You Learn 
approach which rewards retail colleagues 
further as they develop their knowledge  
and specialism. In Grooming we saw our 
first apprentices complete their training  
and emerge as qualified stylists. And 
among our veterinary professionals  
we have launched apprenticeships  
for veterinary nurses, with the first  
cohort beginning their training at  
Dick White Referrals.
Looking forward
The UK pet market has a track record 
of resilience in more difficult economic 
times. While we take nothing for granted, 
the Board believes we have the right 
strategy and a strong and experienced 
team to lead the organisation successfully 
through the more uncertain period ahead. 
Accordingly, we remain confident in the 
outlook for the Group.
Tony DeNunzio
Non-Executive Chairman 
25 May 2017
“ As part of developing a Clinical 
Governance Framework for our 
first opinion practices, it was 
important to me that I spend time 
in our practices and referral 
centres, getting to know clinicians 
in all parts of the business. This 
was crucial to furthering my 
knowledge of their day to day 
operations and helping our Vet 
Group develop a framework  
that ensures our vets maintain 
complete clinical freedom, whilst 
at the same time being able to 
better support them in achieving 
the best clinical standards.”
Tessa Green 
Independent Non-Executive Director
 
Our Non-Executive Directors  
frequently spend time in the business, 
supplementing their knowledge of our 
strategy, operations and colleagues. 
Tessa Green, in her role as Chairman of 
the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
and Pets Before Profit Committees, has 
focused on furthering her knowledge of 
operations that have significance for the 
Group’s ethical, social and environmental 
impacts. During her time with Pets at 
Home, this has included a number of 
visits to our first opinion vet practices and 
specialist referral centres, as the CSR 
Committee worked towards developing  
a Clinical Governance Framework.

Market review
1
The UK pet market has increased its rate 
of growth over the past two years to a CAGR 
of 4.5% and was worth £6.8bn in calendar 
year 2016. This step forward has been 
driven by faster growth in the veterinary, 
insurance and accessories segments. 
The veterinary market grew at a CAGR of 
5.6% over this same period, which is being 
driven by the widening availability of more 
complex procedures and diagnostics, 
supported by increasing numbers of pet 
owners with insurance. In food, strong 
growth in Advanced Nutrition continued 
at a CAGR of 8.9%, balanced with a flat 
grocery food market where volumes 
are falling and pricing remains highly 
competitive. With the accessories market 
CAGR at 1.9%, this led to an overall pet 
products market CAGR of 2.1%.
The transition of the market to online has 
been consistent with our expectations, 
accelerating slightly compared with 
historical rates, reaching 11% of the 
pet market in 2016. 
Over the two year period from 2014 to 
2016 we have taken share across the 
pet market both online and offline. Overall 
we have grown our share of the important 
strategic categories including Advanced 
Nutrition, accessories and veterinary. 
From 2014-2016, our total share of the 
pet products market increased from 
19% to 20% and in the primary opinion 
veterinary market from 9% to 12%. 
Expanding like-for-like growth
Better value for customers
In the Merchandise business our focus 
is on delivering even better value for our 
customers. Value includes price, but also 
innovation, service and advice. The strong 
sales of dog accessories this year are 
continuing proof that our range innovation 
drives a positive customer response. 
And to improve further on our service to 
customers, we are refocusing our Steps 
training programme to ensure more 
colleagues can develop their expertise 
at a faster rate in more specialist areas.
We also understand there is a need to 
provide better pricing to customers. This 
will involve a move away from promotional 
offers and vouchers, and towards a 
simpler, more competitive approach. 
We therefore initiated pricing changes in 
the fourth quarter with the Switch & Save 
campaign, which highlights the value in 
our private label foods, Wainwright’s and 
AVA. The prices on our large bag private 
label dog foods are now 15-25% lower. 
Initial results from the campaign have 
been encouraging and since its launch 
in January 2017 we have seen an average 
50% uplift in the volume of products that 
have seen a price change. We have also 
seen an increase in new shoppers, 
alongside the switching of existing 
customers from branded foods into our 
own labels. In the current financial year 
we have launched price reductions across 
a number of everyday pet essentials and 
are also starting to reposition prices in 
branded foods. 
Whilst it is early days, we are encouraged 
by the improvement in the run rate of

repositioning actions. 
Fast growth and embedded upside 
in our veterinary business
Our Vet Group continues to go from 
strength to strength; transacting more 
than £260m in total customer revenues 
during the financial year. In the first 
Chief Executive’s 
statement

Our Vet Group transacted more than 
£260m 
in total customer revenues during the year
We will roll out 
40–50 
vet practices in the coming year
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 opinion business, mature practices grew 
their customer revenues at 8%
◊
, ahead 
of the market rate of around 5%. We now 
have over 100 mature practices that are 
on average delivering income to the 
Group of more than £160,000 per year. 
Combined with our maturing practices, 
this translated into strong total JV practice 
income of £47.1m, up 24.6%. 
The average age of a practice in our Group is 
less than five years, when maturity is typically 
reached at eight years post opening; and 
having already invested the majority of cost 
required to support their future growth, there 
is an inherent embedded profit upside in the 
current portfolio. 
Our newer specialist referral centres also 
performed well and their integration is 
delivering group benefits through the sharing 
of best practice and leveraging scale.
In the year ahead, to accelerate growth in 
the existing practices, we will increase the 
number of practices with extended opening 
hours, invest further in marketing to 
increase brand awareness and customer 
care plan participation. And we continue 
to explore opportunities in the market that 
will deliver growth to our first opinion and 
referral businesses, whilst retaining a 
disciplined approach to capital allocation. 
Omnichannel capabilities growing 
Our online business performed very well 
during the year, growing revenues at 53%. 
The convenience of our UK wide store 
footprint remains, with almost half the 
revenue of online orders delivered for 
customer pickup in-store. Alongside our 
ongoing improvements in website customer 
experience, there were a number of major 
initiatives launched this year:
Order in-store: our colleagues can now 
place an order for all the products in our 
extended online range from their PetPads. 
This gives store customers easy access 
to even more of our range and has already 
delivered over £2m in revenue since its 
launch at the end of the financial year, 
which we believe is driving incremental 
sales. 
Our first subscription service: ‘Subscribe 
& Save flea treatment’ exclusively for VIP 
members, allows customers to receive 
a single flea treatment through the post 
each month, which acts as a convenient 
reminder to treat their dog or cat. The 
convenience of this plan has proved very 
popular with customers, with subscription 
sales now representing 16% of our total 
licensed medicine revenues. We plan to 
extend subscription with another licensed 
medicine launch in the coming months. 
Having seen such a positive customer 
response to these developments, we 
will continue to invest and improve our 
omnichannel offer and develop our 
subscription platform in the coming year. 
A more personalised approach through VIP
We have seen more successes in the VIP 
club this year, having launched the VIP App, 
which removes the need for customers to 
physically carry the VIP card to swipe and 
build points for their nominated charity. 
We have increased the overall VIP swipe 
rate of the VIP card at tills to 68% of store 
revenues (prior year 64%), and expect the 
rate to be stable going forward.
We are successfully encouraging our 
VIPs to spend more, the longer they are 
members of the VIP club. And we are 
encouraging our VIPs to shop multiple 
brands, with nearly 500,000 members 
purchasing both products and a service, 
a number which has grown by 14% 
compared with the prior year. The benefits 
of multibrand shoppers are very clear; 
a customer who purchases online or in 
our stores, but does not use any services 
spends around £140 a year. Whilst a 
customer who also uses either of our vet 
and grooming services will spend over 
£180 on products, plus an additional 
£200 per year on services. This reflects 
the increased loyalty and shopping 
frequency of services customers. 
Space rollout and footprint development
We delivered our rollout targets for the 
year, having opened 15 new superstores 
(total 434), 50 vet practices (total 438) 
and 50 grooming salons (total 290). 
Paybacks and returns on our new and 
maturing units remain in line with our 
expectations.
In the year ahead, our vet practice and 
grooming salon rollout will continue at a 
similar pace, with openings of 40-50 vet 
practices and 40-50 grooming salons. We 
expect to open around ten superstores, 
lower than in the previous year, as we 
come closer to our UK rollout target of 
500 stores and maintain a disciplined 
approach to approving suitable new sites. 
Supporting margins 
As planned, Group gross margin declined 
by (35) bps
◊
 to 54.2%; driven by the 
dilutive mix impact of newly acquired 
specialist referral centres and increase in 
overall Services participation, which has a 
lower gross margin than the Merchandise 
business. In operating costs, the first year 
of the National Living Wage, our slower 
top line growth and gross margin dilution 
contributed to pre-exceptional EBITDA
†
 
margin declining by 38 bps
◊
 to 15.6%.
In the coming year, we will invest in 
product pricing, and widen our marketing 
campaigns, to drive sales. We will also 
see an increase in cost pressures that 
impact both gross and operating margins, 
including Sterling depreciation, another 
step up in the National Living Wage, and 
the Apprenticeship Levy. 
Introducing our new Group Chief 
Financial Officer: Mike Iddon
Mike joined Pets at Home in October  
2016 as Group Chief Financial Officer.
Mike was the Chief Financial Officer of 
New Look from 2014 until 2016. Prior to 
this, Mike held a number of finance roles at 
Tesco plc over a period of 13 years, with his 
final position as Group Planning, Treasury 
and Tax Director. Before this he held finance 
roles with Kingfisher plc and Whitbread plc. 
He qualified as a Chartered Accountant  
with Arthur Andersen.
 Board of Directors – page 70
In order to mitigate some of these 
pressures, we have already begun to 
implement a comprehensive simplification 
programme, which will deliver operational 
cost savings over the coming year. These 
will be achieved through efficiencies in 
store, a simplification of processes in our 
distribution centre, a reduction in the 
number of products we stock; and energy 
savings from the installation of LED lights 
and energy management systems across 
the store estate. This will mitigate some 
of the overall cost challenges, alongside the 
profit and margin support provided by our 
growing Services business and private label 
products, but overall, we expect to see a 
decline in Group gross margin. This reflects 
the coming year as one of repositioning the 
business, which we are confident is the right 
path for the future success of the Group.
Outlook 
We operate in a resilient market, which is 
forecast to grow at c4.5%
1
 over the next 
five years. Whilst in the near term we are 
repositioning the Merchandise business 
and investing in the customer, we are 
seeing results from our actions and believe 
this will deliver profitable growth benefits in 
future years. We will also continue the fast 
pace of top line and profit growth in our 
veterinary business. We remain a cash 
generative business, with a priority to 
invest in our core capabilities.

Our first opinion business has the highest average 
revenue per practice in the UK vet market. This has 
been achieved by giving our vet partners multiple 
routes to growth, driven by the convenience of 
practice locations and opening hours, our national 
TV campaigns, and practice space extensions, 
which are all driving new client growth.

to purchase our private label foods, Wainwright’s 
and AVA, by highlighting how much customers can 
save. This could be up to £260 per year when 
switching from an equivalent branded food.
The prices on our large bag private label dog foods 
are now 15-25% lower and represent the best value 
Advanced Nutrition in the UK market.

Growing our family of specialists
We expanded our presence further this year in the veterinary 
referrals market, through the acquisitions of Dick White 
Referrals in Cambridgeshire and the Eye Vet in Cheshire. 
Specialist referrals represents the premier tier of veterinary 
medicine, and by acquiring such centres, we gain access 
to an additional area of the vet market. Our future growth 
in this area will come through a combination of acquisition, 
and greenfield development, as we seek to establish a UK 
network of between 10-15 referral centres.
Highlights of 2017 Future plans
Optimised store rollout 
• Opened 15 new Pets at Home superstores in optimal locations
• Total portfolio of 434 superstores
Work towards our UK target of around 500 superstores through carefully 
selected openings in locations that will deliver against our stringent 
investment criteria.
Services rollout 
•  Opened 50 new first opinion veterinary practices bringing 
the total portfolio to 289 practices within stores and 149 
in standalone locations
•  Acquired two specialist veterinary referral centres, bringing 
our total portfolio to four centres
•  Opened 50 new grooming salons, bringing the total portfolio to 
290 grooming salons of which almost all are located within stores 
Work towards our UK targets of 700 veterinary practices and 350 
grooming salons through opening in new stores and standalone 
locations, and also through retrofits into existing stores.
Continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions that are complementary 
to our existing business, particularly in the veterinary market.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30 Sales and revenue
Group revenue grew by 7.2%
◊
 to £834.2m 
(FY16: £777.8m
◊
), with good performance 
in Advanced Nutrition and pet services. 
Like-for-like sales (LFL) grew 1.5%
◊†
, driven 
by veterinary and grooming services, 
omnichannel, and Advanced Nutrition.
Merchandise revenue, which includes 
Food and Accessories, grew by 2.9%
◊
 
to £716.7m (FY16: £696.5m
◊
), with LFL 
sales of 0.8%
◊†
. Whilst this reflects 
an overall slower performance in 
the business, we have also reduced 
Merchandise LFL space by around 0.5% 
during the year through the retrofit of 
services into existing stores. 
Food revenue grew by 3.3%
◊
 to 
£395.1m (FY16: £382.5m
◊
), with strong 
performance in dog Advanced Nutrition 
and natural based treats, reflecting the 
ongoing trend for dog owners to feed a 
higher quality diet. Advanced Nutrition 
revenue grew by 4.1%
◊
 to £179.1m (FY16: 
£172.0m
◊
). Grocery food performance 
was soft, reflective of the overall market 
growth in this declining and highly 
competitive product area, alongside 
weak performance in wild bird food, 
which was tightly correlated with the 
warmer temperatures in the autumn. 
Accessories revenue grew by 2.4%
◊
 to 
£321.6m (FY16: £314.0m
◊
). We saw 
excellent growth across dog accessories 
and an improved performance in Health 
& Hygiene. This was somewhat offset by 
weakness in aquatics accessories, an 
area in the store where space is typically 
reduced following vet practice and 
grooming salon retrofits.
Services revenue grew by 44.5%
◊
 to 
£117.5m (FY16: £81.3m
◊
), with LFL sales 
of 7.9%
◊†
. This reflects the acquisition 
of referral centres and another year 
of excellent growth in our vet practices 
and grooming salons. Growth in our Joint 
Venture (JV) veterinary practices was 
strong, generating total income of £47.1m 
(FY16: £37.8m
◊
), up 24.6%
◊
 compared 
with the prior year. 
Gross margin
Group gross margin declined by 35bps
◊
 
to 54.2% (FY16: 54.5%
◊
), driven primarily 
by the increasing mix of Services with 
the business.
Gross margin within Merchandise was 
57.6%, an expansion of 56 bps
◊
 on the 
prior year (FY16: 57.0%
◊
), where we 
absorbed a negative foreign currency 
impact of £2.2m.
Gross margin within Services grew by 
34 bps
◊
 to 33.3% (FY16: 33.0%
◊
), a very 
good outcome considering the dilutive 
mix impact from the acquisition of referral 
centres and was driven by strong gross 
margin accretion in our core first opinion 
vet business and a decline in low margin 
pet sales.
EBITDA and operating costs
Pre-exceptional EBITDA
†
 of £130.5m 
represented a 4.7%
◊
 increase on the 
previous year (FY16: £124.7m
◊
), with 
a margin of 15.6% (FY16: 16.0%). 
Selling and distribution expenses 
of £296.0m increased slightly as a 
percentage of Group revenue, to 35.5% 
(FY16: 35.3%
◊
). Within this, occupation 
costs (rent, service charges and other 
costs) again declined as a percentage 
of sales as we benefit from the rent and 
rates paid by vet practices within our 
stores, which contributed £10.7m (FY16: 
£9.1m
◊
). Colleague costs of £181.5m 
(FY16: £156.2m
◊
), increased as a 
percentage of sales, primarily due to the 
introduction of the National Living Wage 
at the start of the period, which led 
to additional wage costs of £1.6m.
Pre-exceptional administration expenses 
of £54.9m were 6.6% of revenue (FY16: 
6.4%
◊
), where we are seeing growth in vet 
group and referral centre operating costs, 
alongside our investment in business 
systems. Exceptional administration costs 
of £1.0m are recognised in relation to the 
sale of the Group’s equestrian retailing 
business, Farm Away Limited (see 
paragraph below).
Depreciation and amortisation, which is 
contained within our total operating costs, 
increased to £29.6m (FY16 £24.5m
◊
) 
as a result of the overall increase in, 
and type of, capital investments we make. 
Our increased investment in business 
systems to build our on-line capability 
results in assets that have a shorter 
depreciable life. 
Finance expense
Pre-exceptional net finance expense
†
 
for the year was £4.5m, a reduction from 
the prior year (FY16: £4.8m
◊
) as a result 
of declining leverage. 
Taxation, trading profit & EPS
Pre-exceptional pre tax profit
†
 was 
£96.4m and grew by 1.1%
◊
 compared with 
the prior year (FY16: £95.3m
◊
). Statutory 
pre tax profit was £95.4m and grew 
by 5.8%
◊
 compared with the prior year 
(FY16: £90.2m
◊
).
Underlying total tax expense
†
 for the 
period was £20.1m, a rate of 21% on 
pre-exceptional pre tax profit, and in line 
with our expected tax rate for the full 
financial year. 
Pre-exceptional profit for the period
†
, 
after tax, was £76.3m (FY16: £75.5m
◊
) 
and pre-exceptional basic earnings per 
share
†
 were 15.3 pence, growth of 1.0%
◊
 
compared with the prior year (FY16: 
15.1 pence
◊
).

Working capital 
The underlying cash movement in trading 
working capital
†
 was an inflow of £8.2m, 
with an increase in inventory of £5.0m 
and an decrease in trade receivables of 
£1.7m, offset by an increase of £11.5m 
in payables which reflects our efforts to 
drive a wide range of efficiencies. 
We have also supported our younger first 
opinion veterinary practices with short 
term funding to underpin their growth. 
Such operating loans to Joint Venture 
practices support their day to day working 
capital management, but also enables 
them to support extended hours, 
additional services or capacity extensions. 
This increased the total reported trade 
receivables movement to £8.9m. We 
expect to continue this support to vet 
practices in the coming year to underpin 
the growth of the business.
Cashflow and capital structure
Cash flow generation remains good. 
Free cashflow
†
 after interest, tax and 
before acquisitions was £64.6m (FY16: 
£77.8m
◊
), with a decline in the cash 
conversion rate to 49% (FY16: 62%
◊
) as 
a result of increased capital expenditure 
and cash working capital requirements 
compared with the prior year.
We acquired two veterinary specialist 
referral centres during the period, with 
cash outflows related to acquisitions 
of £14.8m. Dick White Referrals (DWR), 
based in Cambridgeshire, is one of the 
UK’s largest small animal specialist 
referral centres. We acquired a 76% 
ownership stake in DWR for a cash 
consideration of £13.8m and will operate 
the practice as a shared venture model 
through which the founder, Professor 
Dick White, and the key clinicians, will 
retain 24% equity ownership. 
Eye-Vet Referrals (EVR), based in 
Cheshire, is a dedicated ophthalmology 
centre with six veterinary clinicians. EVR 
already provides services to one of our 
referral centres, NorthWest Veterinary 
Specialists, as well as to other primary 
opinion veterinary practices. EVR will also 
operate as a shared venture, with the 
founders retaining 10% equity ownership.
The Group’s leverage ratio at year end 
was 1.2x net debt: pre-exceptional 
EBITDA
†
. This is a slight reduction from 
the FY16 position of 1.3x (FY16 audited 
53 week period), reflecting the cashflow 
requirements of acquisitions in the 
veterinary referrals market and increased 
working capital requirements during 
the year.
Looking forward, our capital structure and 
allocation policy remains as previously 
stated. We remain a cash generative 
business and our priority is to invest 
in areas that will expand the Group and 
deliver appropriate returns – as evidenced 
by our acquisitions in the veterinary 
referrals market. We are comfortable with 
a leverage position of up to 1.5x net debt/
EBITDA
5
 under normal circumstances, 
moving to a maximum of around 1.75x 
in the event suitable investment or 
acquisition opportunities arise. We believe 
this maintains appropriate flexibility for our 
business, operating in a resilient market 
with strong cash generation capabilities. 
And dependent upon our acquisition 
outlook and if we do not foresee 
investment uses, it is our intention 
to return surplus free cashflow to 
shareholders through a combination 
of ordinary and special dividends.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 32 Disposal of Ride-away
On 4 October 2016 the Group disposed 
of its equestrian retailing business, Farm 
Away Limited, which operated under the 
Ride-away brand. Sale proceeds were 
£0.7m, resulting in a loss on disposal 
of £0.7m. Costs of disposal of £0.3m 
are also recognised as an exceptional 
expense within the income statement.
Capital investment
Capital investment was £44.5m (FY16 
53 week period: £41.5m), in line with 
our expectations, of which £5.8m is 
part of an energy savings programme 
to fit LED lighting and smart energy 
management systems in our store estate. 
This investment is part of a one-off £8m 
project, of which the remaining £3m will 
be invested in FY18, in line with our 
previous guidance.
Within the underlying capital investment, 
£11.1m is represented by the retrofit 
of services into our existing store estate, 
(FY16 53 week period £8.0m), where 
we increased both the number of retrofits, 
with more built on mezzanine floors. 
New store capital investment declined 
to £6.4m (FY16 53 week period: £11.5m) 
in line with our reduced rollout during 
the year, and investment in business 
systems also declined to £7.2m (FY16 
53 week period: £10.0m) as we move 
out of the investment phase, and into the 
refreshment phase of our omnichannel 
developments. 
Cash capital expenditure was £40.9m 
(FY16 53 week period: £36.8m).
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final 
dividend of 5.0 pence per share, giving 
a total dividend of 7.5 pence per share 
in respect of the 2017 financial year, 
equal with the prior year. Looking forward 
to the financial year 2018, the Board has 
committed to maintaining the ordinary 
dividend at the same level as the 
prior year.
The final dividend will be proposed by 
the Directors at the 2017 AGM and is 
in addition to the interim dividend of 2.5 
pence per share, paid to shareholders on 
the 6 January 2017. The ex-dividend date 
will be 15 June 2017 and, if approved 
at the Company’s forthcoming AGM, will 
be paid to shareholders on 14 July 2017 
to those shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 16 June 2017.
Foreign exchange outlook 
The Group purchases products from 
Asia to a value of around US$55 million 
each year and our policy is to hedge 
up to 95% of forecast foreign exchange 
transactions on a rolling 12 month basis. 
The movement in hedged contract rates 
for FY17, which were at an average rate 
of 1.47 USD:GBP, created a £2.2m 
adverse cost to the Group. Our hedging 
requirements for FY18 are in place, at an 
average rate of 1.30 USD:GBP, which will 
have a negative impact of around £5m. 
Accounting treatment of veterinary 
specialist referral centre
Three of our four veterinary specialist 
referral centres are structured as a 
shared venture ownership model, where 
Pets at Home maintains a minimum 
75% controlling share, with the remaining 
shares owned by multiple clinician Shared 
Venture Partners (SVPs). This structure 
maintains strong commercial incentives 
for the existing SVPs to grow the 
businesses.
Under this ownership structure, Pets 
at Home has an option to buy the SVPs 
shares in the future, typically from three 
years and onwards post the point of 
acquisition. The potential value uplift in 
these shares is related to stretching profit 
performance targets of the referral centre 
and the accounting treatment of such 
an option is therefore structured as a 
forward contract.
The required accounting treatment of the 
referral centres is full consolidation of the 
income statement, balance sheet and 
cashflow. Within the income statement, 
the discounted future value of the SVPs 
shares is recognised as an expense over 
the period to which the option can be 
exercised, on our best estimate of the 
future value. In the event that the referral 
centres’ long term stretching targets are 
achievable, a non cash charge will be 
recognised as a non-underlying expense 
within operating costs, which could be 
up to £2m in FY18.

Food
Pet food is the largest part of our 
business, generating revenues of 
£395.1m in 2017. This represented 55% 
of our Merchandise revenues. We provide 
a range of diets for dogs, cats, small 
mammals, fish, reptiles and birds.
Our ranges of dog and cat food are 
planned to provide customers with a full 
spectrum of dietary choices to suit their 
pet and their pocket. This stretches from 
grocery brands, which are widely available 
in supermarkets and other outlets, 
through to our comprehensive range of 
Advanced Nutrition diets, which are a more 
considered purchase offering significant 
health benefits to dogs and cats. Advanced 
Nutrition revenues grew at 4.1%
◊
 over the 
year. Pets at Home now has a market 
share of 53% in Advanced Nutrition.
Pets at Home own label and our private 
label brands, such as Wainwright’s and 
AVA, now account for 31% of our total food 
revenues. Private label afford us great 
opportunities to highlight the value of 
Advanced Nutrition diets. In the fourth 
quarter we launched Switch & Save 
to highlight the everyday value of our 
Wainwright’s and AVA diets compared 
to other popular brands in the category. 
◊  FY16 comparative information presented on a 52 week 
basis. For reconciliation to a 53 week statutory basis see 
page 179.
We continue to innovate strongly in this 
segment and this year we introduced Step 
Up to Naturals, a bridging brand to provide 
a first step for customers to improve the 
diet for their pets.
In pet treats we have expanded our range 
to include more natural products, as well 
as items that mirror human food trends 
but are formulated particularly for pets 
such as popcorn and muffins.
Grocery pet food, which is also sold in 
supermarkets and discounters, forms the 
other major segment in the food category. 
Accessories
Accessories account for 45% of our 
Merchandise revenues. In 2017 revenues 
grew 2.4%
◊
 to £321.6 million.
We range products by pet type. These 
include collars and leads, feeding bowls, 
clothing, toys, travel and training products 
for dogs and cats; housing, bedding and 
enrichment for small animals; and health 
and hygiene ranges.
Innovation is critical to growth in this 
category. Progress follows trends that 
mirror those in home furnishing and 
fashion. Our private label brands support 
innovation in this area. Our 3 Peaks brand 
delivers a range of harnesses, collars  
and leads for active dog owners and our 
new Baby Bea brand provides scratchers 
and toys that have been specifically 
designed for kittens, incorporating  
advice from cat behaviourists, to 
support their development. 
Integrating online with stores seamlessly
Our in-store ranges are supported by 
an expanded offer of 11,000 products 
available online. We have developed 
‘Order in Store’ which provides colleagues 
with the opportunity to advise customers 
and, using PetPads, place orders from the 
expanded range while the customer is still 
in the store. We have also developed a 
subscription platform with the option 
to sign up either in-store or online. 
This provides a convenient solution for 
customers to receive a regular delivery 
of products such as preventative flea 
treatments in a timely manner to benefit 
their dogs and cats.

Operating review
Services
Our Services segment comprises first opinion 
and specialist vet practices, grooming salons 
and pet insurance, in addition to sales of pets.
Veterinary practices
Pets at Home operates the largest 
branded network of first opinion veterinary 
practices in the UK, with 438 practices 
operating mainly under the Vets4Pets 
brand name. Two thirds of these practices 
are in Pets at Home stores, with the 
remainder in standalone locations. Having 
entered the market for specialist veterinary 
referrals in 2015/16 with the acquisitions 
of Northwest Veterinary Specialists and 
Anderson Moores, we have subsequently 
acquired Eye Vet and Dick White Referrals, 
expanding our representation significantly.
First Opinion Division
We operate the only large-scale joint 
venture veterinary services business in the 
UK. This model affords individual vets the 
opportunity to partner with us and create 
their own practice operating under our 
brand. Each joint venture is constituted 
as an independent small business. These 
are funded by a small investment into the 
business from the vet and the Pets at 
Home Vet Group to create the joint venture. 
A larger independent bank loan provides 
for the fit out and initial working capital 
requirements. The Group receives a 
percentage of the income of the practice in 
return for the services we provide, including 
finance, marketing and systems support. 
A service charge is also levied on those 
practices located in a Pets at Home store. 
The partner has access to all the profits 
of the business once the loans are repaid. 
They are also entitled to any increase in 
value of the business if it is sold to a new

partner. We retain control over the selection 
of a new partner if the business is sold.
To allow prospective partners to work with 
us before committing to a joint venture 
agreement, we operate a number of 
practices that are wholly owned by us.
Specialist Division
Specialist referral centres are larger and 
more valuable business than first opinion 
practices. Recognising the strength of our 
joint venture model in first opinion, we 
developed a shared ownership model for 
our entry into the specialist referrals 
segment, which not only allows Directors to 
retain a significant interest in the business, 
it also supports future growth and clinical 
development. We are already seeing 
synergies from consolidating services, 
such as pathology, into one of our centres, 
allowing us to build our specialist capability 
to the advantage of the Group as a whole.
With four specialist centres now in the 
Group, we have retained the experience 
of many talented individuals who have 
been instrumental in establishing and 
developing these centres of excellence. 
This is a powerful resource which will be 
invaluable to us as we seek to build our 
presence in the specialist veterinary 
segment through organic growth and 
bolt-on acquisitions. 
Pet grooming
We operate pet grooming salons under 
two brands: The Groom Room, operating 
primarily in Pets at Home Superstores, 
and Barkers, our premium segment dog 
stores where the spa and bath house are 
a major element of our total offer. The 
290 pet grooming salons make The 
Groom Room the largest branded chain  
of pet grooming salons in the UK.
The pet grooming market in the UK is 
highly fragmented. In addition to having 
strong, national brands, our grooming 
operations rely on having highly trained 
colleagues as stylists in every salon, 
delivering a full range of grooming services 
from our ‘Muddy Buddy’, a simple bath 
and brush, through to styling to breed-
standard. Our salons are separated from 
our stores by fully glazed partition walls, 
providing customers with an excellent 
view of our talented colleagues at work.
Pet insurance
During the year we made a significant 
change to our pet insurance offer, forming 
a strategic partnership with market leader 
Petplan. Previously we offered a range of 
Pets at Home branded insurance products 
that were arranged, administered and 
underwritten by a third party. Under the 
new partnership, Pets at Home now 
recommend Petplan insurance to any new 
insurance customers, while existing Pets 
at Home insurance customers will be 
invited to renew onto a new Pets at Home 
product underwritten by Petplan’s parent 
company Allianz Insurance plc.

Strategic report Performance Risks and uncertainties
Key risk
Brand and reputation
Description and impact 
The Group places pet welfare as its 
highest priority and its number one 
value, pets before profit, reflects this. 
It also recognises the need to protect 
its brand and reputation. Failure to do 
so could result in a loss of trust and 
confidence by both customers and 
colleagues. 
Mitigation 
As a retailer of small pets across a large number of stores, the highest 
possible welfare standards must be maintained at all times and we 
have rigorous processes in place to ensure this. This also extends into 
the supply chain with our pet suppliers. We operate a comprehensive 
pet welfare audit process, utilising internal and external resources, 
where all stores receive unannounced visits on a regular basis. This 
helps ensure our high standards are maintained across the chain. 
With our suppliers, we expect the same high standards of welfare and 
all suppliers are visited regularly by vets, third party assessors, our 
field pet team and an animal welfare organisation and are assessed 
against a comprehensive set of welfare and standards criteria. As an 
example of our prioritising of pet welfare, during Easter each year, we 
temporarily halt the sale of rabbits in response to concerns over the 
welfare of rabbits bought at Easter.
The Group also deals with customers’ pets on a daily basis through 
its veterinary practices, Groom Room salons and Support Adoption 
centres, with a consequent risk of the death or injury of pets whilst 
in our care. We have a clear set of operational protocols, with the 
veterinary practices subject to the professional standards mandated 
by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. We also have a highly 
visible field operations team in respect of in-store pets, grooming and 
veterinary practices. Each area has specific colleagues focused on 
ensuring the highest pet welfare standards are maintained. 
We operate a confidential ‘Pet Promise Line’ where colleagues are 
able to raise concerns about pet care directly with our Head of Pets. 
Any calls to this line result in appropriate action to address the 
concerns raised.
Pet welfare across the Group is overseen by the Pets Before Profit 
Committee. This meets regularly to review pet welfare and check that 
appropriate processes are in place to ensure we maintain our high 
welfare standards. 
Outlook 
As we continue to 
increase our size 
and scale, we must 
work to ensure 
that pet welfare 
standards continue 
to be maintained at 
a high level across 
the Group. We will 
continue to monitor 
welfare standards 
closely and take 
appropriate steps 
where required to 
maintain them.

Competition
Description and impact 
The Group competes with a wide 
variety of retailers and vet practices, 
including other pet specialists, 
supermarkets, discounters and vet 
groups. Online competition is also 
a risk, as large well-known internet 
businesses expand into pet products 
and the established pet product sites 
improve and expand their offer. 
Failure to keep abreast of, and 
respond to, developments by our 
competition in the areas of price, 
range, quality and service could have 
an adverse impact on the Group’s 
financial performance and impact 
opportunities for growth. 
Mitigation 
We continue to evolve our proposition through the ongoing addition 
of vets and groomers into our existing store estate whilst continuing 
to innovate with the regular introduction of new and exclusive 
products into our food and accessory ranges. We continue to open 
new stores, vet practices and Groom Rooms. As a specialist retailer, 
the delivery of friendly expertise through our highly engaged/trained 
store colleagues is a key element of our proposition and we continue 
to invest to ensure our service standards are continually improved. 
Further enhancements are being made to the Pets at Home website 
to ensure that it is an optimal experience for customers.
The VIP (Very Important Pet) club was launched in November 2012 
and has been very successful – attracting 3.7m active members at 
financial year-end. This customer and pet database enables more 
targeted marketing, which helps drive up basket values and enables 
us to build a stronger sense of engagement with our customers 
and their pets. 
In January 2017, we launched Switch and Save where customers 
are able to find out if they can save money by switching their dog 
food brand to either Wainwrights or AVA, both of which are Pets at 
Home own label high-nutrition complete dog food. Moving to these 
Pets at Home products will generate savings for the customer over 
other brands. 
We operate a Brand Match process where customers can check their 
spend on branded products at Pets at Home against Tesco.com and 
Jollyes.com and receive a voucher for the difference. We also track 
and respond to competitor pricing movements where appropriate. 
Continuous market research is carried out to review the pet market 
both at home and abroad and understand what our competitors are 
doing worldwide. This helps identify further changes/initiatives that 
need to be implemented to help keep Pets at Home ahead of the 
competition here in the UK and remain a leader in the market.
Outlook 
Vacancy levels for 
existing store space 
have decreased 
leading to more 
competition for 
physical store space. 
There has been 
some increase in the 
number of pure play 
online competitors 
but this is not 
expected to have 
a significant impact 
on our business. 
Competitor pricing 
strategies could 
become more 
competitive.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Key risk
Stores and services expansion
Description and impact 
A key part of the Group’s growth 
strategy is to increase the number 
of stores and to grow its in-store 
and standalone veterinary practices, 
Groom Room salons and Barkers for 
Dogs stores.
If we are unable to deliver the number 
of sites necessary to fulfil the stores 
and services expansion laid out in 
our strategy and maintain our existing 
numbers of sites, our expected 
financial performance could be 
adversely impacted. 
Mitigation 
To open a new store successfully, we have to, in the first instance, 
identify an appropriate location with a store size appropriate to the 
local market and with lease terms that are acceptable. We have the 
ability, with smaller footprint stores, to utilise mezzanine space to 
deploy vet and Groom Room offerings, maximising the opportunity 
to open the majority of stores with a full service proposition. Any 
proposed new store investment has to deliver an appropriate financial 
return after taking into account any financial impact on the existing 
store portfolio. These processes are equally applicable when the 
Group looks to open a Barkers for Dogs store or a standalone 
veterinary practice or grooming salon. However, in common with our 
in-store veterinary practice-opening programme, we also need to 
recruit a joint venture veterinary partner with the ability to fund their 
investment into the joint venture and with the ability to provide the 
personal guarantee to the bank providing the third party financing 
to the joint venture veterinary practice. 
The business maintains new store and new joint venture partner 
pipelines, which identify potential locations and potential partners 
at each stage of our process. This enables the Board to monitor 
progress in delivering the expected number of new stores, veterinary 
practices and Groom Rooms. Certain geographical areas (for example, 
within the M25) require a more innovative approach as space for 
new stores, groom rooms and vet practices is limited. For example, 
we are developing new formats such as small format Groom Rooms 
to address these opportunities. Where existing sites are at risk 
of redevelopment or where leases may not be renewed, specific 
measures are taken to maximise the opportunity for the Group 
including considering purchasing the freehold if appropriate. 
Outlook 
An increased 
proportion of our new 
stores will be located 
on newly developed 
retail parks and 
park extensions. 
Whilst this can 
create greater timing 
uncertainties, we 
do not expect any 
challenges in the 
short term. However, 
new developments 
are very much 
dependant on tenant 
demand and the 
overall economy.

Our people
Description and impact 
As a specialist retailer, retaining 
highly trained and engaged 
colleagues is fundamental to our 
continued success and the delivery 
of our future growth. 
A significant number of colleagues 
in certain areas of our business are 
EU nationals. The Brexit vote in June 
2016 has increased the risks around 
the retention and further recruitment 
of EU nationals.
If we do not retain and train our 
colleagues, it is unlikely that we will 
be able to deliver the outstanding 
customer service, which is a key 
element of our proposition. 
Our growth plans and future success 
are at risk if we do not recruit and 
retain high calibre, talented senior 
management. 
Mitigation 
We continue to invest in training to broaden the skill base of 
colleagues across the business. We also closely monitor colleague 
retention rates and engagement, the latter through our annual ‘We’re 
All Ears’ engagement survey which is followed up by ‘We’re All Action’ 
to ensure the business responds appropriately to opportunities for 
improvement raised by colleagues. We also have a rolling programme 
of listening groups across the business to ensure we are addressing 
issues on an ongoing basis and we are participating in the ‘Great 
Place to Work’ programme. 
Our remuneration policy, as set out on pages 92 to 104, is designed 
to ensure executives of the necessary calibre are attracted and 
retained and that through our Long-Term Incentive Plans and Company 
Share Option Plan, colleagues across the business can share in 
our success. Similarly, we continually review the remuneration and 
benefits packages available to all colleagues to ensure our colleagues 
are appropriately rewarded for the substantial contribution they make 
to our growth and success. Succession plans are in place for key roles 
and the Board and senior management regularly review these.
We continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of the Brexit vote on the 
recruitment and retention of colleagues who are EU nationals in those 
parts of the business most likely to be affected. We operate flexible 
recruitment and retention initiatives across the Group.
Outlook 
The ongoing Brexit 
negotiations may 
well have an impact 
on our employment 
of EU nationals. 
We need to ensure 
that the Group 
continues to be an 
attractive place to 
work, particularly if 
employment levels 
continue to increase 
nationally and there 
is more competition 
in the job market.

Strategic report Performance Risks and uncertainties continued
Key risk
Business systems and information security
Description and impact 
We are aware of the need to keep 
core business systems up to date, 
with the capability to support the 
Group’s growth plans. 
If our investments in both systems 
and infrastructure do not keep pace 
with the growth of the business 
there may be a consequent limitation 
to our ability to trade and expand. 
In addition, the scale of ongoing 
system and infrastructure change 
is significant and this may affect 
our ability to deliver IT services 
to the business.
We hold a significant amount 
of customer data and recognise 
the need to keep this secure. Any 
information security breach could 
adversely affect our reputation 
and the take up of our customer 
loyalty scheme. 
Mitigation 
In recent years, we have made significant upgrades to our business 
critical systems including the implementation of SAP Financials, 
HR and payroll along with SAP HANA and BPC. Our warehouse 
management system was upgraded to JDA last year and our main 
retail website has been enhanced. A single practice management 
system has been implemented across our vet practices.
We continue to monitor the level of activity within the Business 
Systems function and will respond appropriately should IT project 
or service delivery be at risk.
Disaster recovery is a key part of our systems strategy, enabling 
us to continue to trade in the event of a system outage. Disaster 
recovery plans are in place and are regularly rested. The business 
also undertakes regular system penetration testing. 
An information security project is ongoing to ensure that we have 
a good understanding of information security threats and that we 
have appropriate measures in place to mitigate the associated risks. 
Our customer loyalty scheme data is held by a specialist third party 
who has industry standard information security accreditations and 
is regularly audited. Encryption is used to protect the transmission 
of customer data. 
Outlook 
Our systems stability 
and reliability will 
continue to improve 
as upgrades and 
enhancements are 
implemented and 
new systems are 
adopted. 
Information security 
risks are likely to 
continue to increase. 
We monitor this risk 
and will strengthen 
our controls as 
required.

Supply chain/sourcing
Description and impact 
During the financial year, 
approximately £60m of the Group’s 
merchandise cost of goods was 
globally sourced, and therefore we are 
exposed to the risks associated with 
international trade, such as inflation, 
changing regulatory frameworks and 
currency exposure. The impact of 
Brexit on our overseas supply chain 
is unclear but may be significant, 
particularly in view of probable 
changes to the UK’s trading terms 
with the rest of the world. We are also 
exposed to the risks associated with 
the quality and safety of products 
produced globally on behalf of 
the Group, many of which are own 
branded or exclusive private labels.
A failure to manage this risk 
adequately could lead to reputational 
damage, reflected in a lack of 
confidence by customers and 
colleagues in the Group brands.
We have two national distribution 
centres covering the north and south 
of the UK respectively. A disaster 
at one of the DCs may result in a 
significant interruption to the supply 
of stock for a large number of stores 
and in the fulfilment of internet 
orders. 
Mitigation 
Having Pets at Home colleagues on the ground working collaboratively 
with suppliers enables us to monitor closely compliance with 
the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct policy, as well 
as compliance with our Supplier Quality Manual. In addition, an 
independent third party undertakes unannounced visits to further 
monitor compliance with Group policies. During the year we have 
undertaken a Group wide risk assessment to highlight any areas 
where we may be vulnerable to the risk of modern slavery and will 
strengthen our processes in the areas highlighted.
We will monitor Brexit developments and respond proportionately. 
Exposure to foreign currency movements is mitigated through our 
hedging strategy, see the Treasury and financial risk. 
Business continuity plans are in place and tested for the distribution 
centres and plans are in place to mitigate the impact of any disaster 
by servicing all stores from a single distribution centre.
Outlook 
We continue 
to develop our 
quality assurance 
processes and 
to ensure the 
effectiveness of our 
Far East sourcing 
office in mitigating 
our sourcing risks 
in the region.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 Key risk
Liquidity and credit risk
Description and impact 
The business requires adequate 
cash resources to enable it to fund 
its growth plans through its capital 
projects and/or an expansion of the 
Group’s working capital requirement. 
Without adequate cash resources, 
the Group may be unable to 
deliver its growth plans, with a 
consequent impact on future 
financial performance.
Mitigation 
The Group’s finances are continually monitored in the context of its 
growth plans and a re-financing arrangement was made during the 
year. As a result, the Group is confident that it has adequate revolving 
facilities in place, with a broad syndicate of ten banks. 
The Group’s growth plans in respect of joint venture veterinary 
practices is predicated on the availability of finance for new joint 
venture veterinary partners to fund both the capital cost and working 
capital requirement for each new practice opening. The Group has 
two revolving and two non-revolving facilities in place with major high 
street lenders that give us confidence that our medium term growth 
plans are financed adequately.
The Group ensures that all cash surpluses are invested with banks 
that have credit ratings and investment criteria that meet the 
requirements set out in the Group Treasury policy, which has been 
approved by the Board. 
The Group’s key suppliers are exposed to credit risk and as part of 
the Group’s overall risk management programme, the business has 
identified alternative suppliers where appropriate and developed 
contingency plans, particularly in respect of own label and private 
label food products.
Outlook 
We will continue 
to monitor our 
finances and build 
relationships with our 
finance providers. 
We do not anticipate 
any significant 
macroeconomic 
changes in the short 
to medium term 
that may affect this 
risk area although 
the outcome of the 
EU referendum may 
have some bearing.

Treasury and financial risk
Description and impact 
The Group has an exposure to 
exchange rate risk in respect of 
the US dollar that is the principal 
purchase currency for goods sourced 
from the Far East. The Brexit vote in 
June 2016 has increased currency 
pressures and we may see this 
continue for some time as the Brexit 
process takes place. The Group also 
faces risks from changes to interest 
rates and compliance with taxation 
legislation. If we do not adequately 
manage this exposure there could 
be an impact on the Group’s financial 
performance with a consequential 
impact on operational and growth 
plans.
Mitigation 
This exposure to FX fluctuation is managed via forward foreign 
currency contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges. 
The Group has borrowings with floating interest rates linked to 
LIBOR, thereby exposing the Group to fluctuations in LIBOR and 
the consequent impact on interest cost. To manage this risk the 
Group has interest rate swaps in place that fix the interest rate on 
a significant proportion of the Group borrowings. Further details can 
be found on page 153.
All hedging activity is undertaken by the Group Treasury function in 
accordance with the Group Treasury policy that sets out the criteria 
for counterparties with whom the Group can transact and clearly 
states that all hedging activities are undertaken in the context 
of known and forecast cash flows, with speculative transactions 
specifically prohibited. Dedicated tax resource is in place and 
specialist tax advisors are retained to assist in this area.
Outlook 
Ongoing currency 
movements between 
the US dollar and 
GBP may result in 
further exchange 
risk, particularly in 
light of the ongoing 
Brexit process. 
We will continue 
to monitor this and 
adjust our approach 
to hedging where 
necessary.

Regulatory and compliance
Description and impact 
Many of the Group’s activities are 
regulated by legislation and standards 
including, but not limited to, trading, 
advertising, product quality, health 
and safety, pet shop licensing, carbon 
emission reporting, bribery act and 
data protection. Failure to comply 
with these may result in financial 
or reputational damage. 
Mitigation 
We actively monitor compliance with our existing obligations and we 
have internal policies and standards to ensure compliance where 
appropriate. We also provide training for colleagues where required 
and operate a confidential hotline for colleagues to raise concerns 
in confidence. 
Our suppliers commit to adhering to relevant regulations and 
standards as outlined in our Quality Manual. We carry out a rolling 
programme of supplier audits to check for compliance with our 
requirements. 
Outlook 
We welcome the 
Government’s 
recent proposals 
around animal 
establishments

continue to

we would review planned and tactical promotional activity to determine 
whether strengthening this would drive sales.

which affords colleagues a further 
opportunity to provide feedback and 
allows us to benchmark Pets at Home 
against the best in Europe. In 2015 we 
were ranked 15th among larger UK 
companies. In 2016 we improved to 7th 
overall in the UK and were the highest 
placed retailer. In 2017, we were placed 
9th overall in the UK and retained our 
position as the highest placed retailer.
Most of our first opinion veterinary 
practices are separate small business, 
owned mainly in joint ventures with 
partners from the veterinary profession. 
Colleagues in the veterinary practices 
are employed by the Joint Venture 
companies rather than the Group. 
Many of these Joint Venture companies 
also recognise the value of measuring 
colleague engagement and in 2016 we 
introduced a colleague engagement 
survey across our first opinion practices. 
Now in its second year, this survey has 
proved invaluable in helping our partners 
measure colleague engagement in their 
own practice. In FY2017 we generated 
practice-specific responses from 91 
practices and aim to build on this with 
each successive year, helping our 
partners be the employer of choice 
in their community. 
We recognise the value of our 
colleagues’ knowledge if we are to 
provide the best possible advice for 
our customers and their pets. We 
consciously recruit colleagues who 
share our love of pets and, recognising 
the correlation between colleague 
turnover and expertise, we aim to 
maintain a consistently high level  
of engagement with them.
We measure engagement annually by 
inviting every colleague to participate  
in an online survey ‘We’re All Ears’.  
Now in its tenth year, this survey asks 
colleagues to select from a range  
of responses, from ‘strongly agree’  
to ‘strongly disagree’, in answer to 
questions based on our values, vision 
and culture. We aim to maintain the 
measure of overall engagement above 
90%. We also measure the percentage 
of ‘strongly agree’ responses. This was 
78% in 2017 compared to 77% in 2016. 
Our ambition is to increase the level 
of ‘strongly agree’ responses to 80%.
In 2013 we were ranked first in 
the Sunday Times list of Best Big 
Companies to Work For. Having 
reached this level among UK 
companies, we decided it would be 
appropriate to challenge ourselves 
against a broader peer group and 
Being a specialist retailer we 
recognise that our colleagues need 
specialist knowledge if they are 
to engage with our customers and 
provide the service and advice they 
seek. As a result we place great 
emphasis on colleague development. 
At the heart of our training is our Steps 
programme, which we are updating 
from April 2017 to better reflect the 
career aspirations of our colleagues. 
We have amalgamated the two existing 
compulsory steps into a single new 
training programme after which 
colleagues will ‘Step Up’ to Pet 
Colleague. Colleagues can then 
develop their pet specialisms after 
which they will ‘Step Up’ to Pet Expert. 
Colleagues who stretch themselves 
further and develop an in-depth 
knowledge of pets can ‘Step Up’ to Pet 
Specialist once they have completed 
five years’ service.
We operate an Earn As You Learn 
model which rewards colleagues as 
their training progresses and their 
expertise increases. On stepping 
up to Pet Colleague, colleagues will 
receive an increase in their pay of 
25p per hour. For each pet specialism 
they add, up to a maximum of four 
colleagues will receive an additional 
20p per hour on stepping up to Pet 
Expert. Pet Specialists will receive a 
further 20p per hour, bringing the total 
Earn As You Learn addition to £1.25 
an hour.

World-class training Keeping Our Pets People healthy and safe
We are committed to providing a safe 
and healthy environment for all of our 
colleagues, customers and third party 
contractors. We actively encourage 
a positive health and safety Culture 
throughout our stores, practices, 
distribution centres and support 
offices. The safety and wellbeing  
of our colleagues is an important part 
of our colleague engagement levels. 
The Group recognises its responsibility 
for health and safety and we have robust 
control measures in place to minimise 
the risk of incidents. Our Group Chief 
Executive reviews and signs off  
our Health and Safety policy Statement 
every year prior to our annual Health 
and Safety week. 
There have been no Health and Safety 
Enforcement Notices served on the Group.
We continue to benchmark accident 
rates across the Group which also 
includes the accidents which have taken 
place in our joint venture veterinary 
surgeries and specialist referral centres. 
We record all incidents (including 
non-work related injuries) and report  
all accidents in accordance with the 
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrence Regulations 
(RIDDOR). We also classify all incidents 
where we are aware a customer intends 
to go to hospital as RIDDOR reportable, 
which will result in some over reporting 
of RIDDORs. 
During the year, total accidents across  
the Group increased with our store and 
colleague growth. While our colleague 
accident rate increased from 7 .48 to 
9.37 accidents per 1,000 colleagues,  
we saw a reduction in Customer  
accidents from 1.10 to 1.06 per  
100,000 transactions, while the number 
of RIDDOR accidents remained similar  
to previous year in our stores/practices. 
In Distribution, there was a slight 
decrease of 0.04 accidents per 100,000 
hours worked, and a 0.04 decrease in 
RIDDOR accidents for the year. 
Colleagues embarking on a career  
in grooming now have the opportunity 
to follow our apprenticeship training.  
In the past year we have enrolled  
98 colleagues onto grooming 
apprenticeships. From the initial cohort 
of 12 apprentices we have offered ten 
permanent roles as stylists in our 
Groom Room salons. We plan to offer  
a further 75 grooming apprenticeships 
in the year ahead. 
Our veterinary colleagues undergo 
rigorous professional development  
as part of their ongoing professional 
requirements. We are committed to 
ensuring our vets and nurses have 
access to the highest quality training 
and have developed our own Learning 
Academy to support this. In FY2017  
our Learning Academy delivered training 
to 547 colleagues and we will further 
expand this facility each year. We are 
also developing an apprenticeship 
programme to help train more veterinary 
nurses and make nurse training more 
accessible. We are working with a 
number of providers to deliver these 
programmes, including developing a 
Nursing Academy utilising the renowned 
teaching capabilities at our specialist 
referral centre Dick White Referrals.
We continue to promote a “Stay Safe” 
culture of health and safety throughout 
the Group. For the third year running,  
our two distribution centres applied for 
the British Safety Council’s international 
Safety Awards and achieved passes 
demonstrating our commitment to the 
health, safety and wellbeing of our 
colleagues and contractors. All Joint 
Venture practices open for more than  
a year received a health & safety audit 
from our In-house team. Within Retail  
we achieved 100% compliance for our 
internal audits.

 Heart of the Community
Educating the next 
generation of pet owners 
Providing a second chance of 
happiness for less fortunate pets
Over the past year our colleagues have 
supported a number of fundraising 
drives which have benefitted Support 
Adoption For Pets and their local 
partnered organisations. The biggest 
fundraising event of the year is the 
Santa Paws appeal. Through the efforts 
of our colleagues and the generosity of 
our customers, more than £1 million was 
raised this year, enough to provide more 
than two million meals for pets in rescue 
centres around the country. Over the 
year as a whole £3.8m was raised, 
allowing Support Adoption For Pets 
to support 1,000 charities.
We understand that pets add 
immeasurably to our lives and in 
return we believe it is essential that  
a prospective pet owner understands 
the needs of a pet and can provide  
for them fully before taking on  
the long-term responsibility of  
pet ownership.
For children in particular a new pet 
can be particularly thrilling, so to 
make them aware of the responsibility 
that comes with a new pet, we have 
developed a programme of workshop 
events which we call “My Pet Pals”. 
These are free to attend and parents 
can book their children onto one of the 
workshops using our online booking 
platform. Over the course of the year, 
more than 102,000 people registered 
to take part in one of our workshops 
which cover aquatics, small mammals 
and reptiles.
We have also built strong relationships 
with organisations like the Scouting 
Association, where we sponsor the 
Beavers’ Animal Friend and the Cubs’ 
Animal Carer badges, the Girlguiding 
Association, and the RSPB where we 
collaborate on wild bird workshops  
and support the annual Big Garden 
Birdwatch campaign.
We recognise the contribution of  
our colleagues in delivering these 
community-based initiatives and 
reward their achievement through an 
internal programme ‘My Pond League’. 
This year our colleagues delivered a 
message about responsible pet 
ownership to more than 600 groups of 
Scouts, Guides, Brownies and Beavers 
and engaged with 400 schools.
Sadly, through no fault of their own, 
not every pet is able to enjoy a 
permanent loving home. For these 
pets rescue and rehoming centres 
offer a vital second chance of 
happiness. 
In 2006 Pets at Home established 
the charity Support Adoption For Pets 
which provides rehoming centres in our 
stores and funding for organisations 
who rescue and rehome domestic 
pets. The charity has grown to be 
one of the largest in its sector. Our 
colleagues care for pets in the Support 
Adoption For Pets rehoming centres 
in our stores and make sure we apply 
the same diligence to the adoption of 
a pet as we do to the sale of a pet. 
Our stores are encouraged to form 
partnerships with local rescue and 
rehoming centres whereby store teams 
and rescue volunteers work together to 
promote the work of the rescue within 
the community, highlight pets in need 
of new homes and raise valuable funds.

Through our VIP loyalty 
scheme customers 
can generate ‘lifelines’ 
rewards from their purchases. 
Lifelines are donated to animal 
charities nominated by our customers 
which can be used to purchase food 
and accessories from our stores. 
We aim to grow the value of lifelines 
donated in line with our sales growth. 
This year £2 million worth of lifelines 
was donated, bringing the total value  
of lifelines donated to more than  
£6.25 million since the scheme  
was launched. 
Supporting the work of the Dogs Trust 
We continue to provide support to 
the Dogs Trust with donations of 
Wainwrights dog food so that every 
dog rehomed goes to its new home 
with a healthy and nutritious diet. This 
year more than £450,000 worth of 
food was requested by the Dogs Trust. 
Many of our vet practices are  
already embedded within their local 
community, having strong links to 
animal charities and rehoming centres 
in the area. 
In May 2016 we launched ‘Community 
Vet of Choice’ to help our veterinary 
practices become a vital and treasured 
part of their community. We provide 
vets with materials to support their 
engagement with pet owners and with 
local animal organisations. Vets have 
been particularly keen to embrace 
opportunities to help pet owners 
understand issues like firework anxiety 
and suggest appropriate strategies to 
help them and their pets deal with the 
stress fireworks can cause. Firework 
anxiety workshops were run by 176 
practices in the first year. Pet First Aid 
workshops were also popular, with 
60 practices running these workshops. 
Work is underway to encourage further 
participation among our Joint Venture 
partners and to develop additional 
workshops that vets can provide locally.

 Sourcing with Integrity
Creating standards  
in the pet industry
To ensure our operations reflect the  
best and most up-to-date welfare 
standards the pet team maintains  
strong relationships with independent 
experts on animal health, welfare and 
husbandry. To further improve the 
welfare of our pets we have initiated  
a number of changes:
We are consolidating the sale of reptiles 
into 66 stores. This allows us to focus 
our expertise in regional centres and 
provide the best possible advice and 
service to customers considering 
keeping a reptile as a pet. Through our 
investment in BEMS technology (see 
page 56) we can control temperatures 
more accurately for our pets whilst 
delivering overall energy savings. We 
have introduced clear “Do not release 
into the wild” messaging on our fish 
bags and tanks and on the pet 
certificate that accompanies every pet 
sale. And we no longer sell or adopt out 
rabbits as pets over the Easter holiday, 
recognising the addition pressure on 
parents to obtain a pet rabbit at this 
time of year.
The welfare of pets is fundamental to 
our business. So there is nothing more 
important to us than making sure our 
pets have the best start in life and 
find their way to a permanent loving 
home when they leave our care.
We have an expert pet team, headed 
by an experienced vet who is supported 
by three qualified veterinary nurses, and 
specialists in freshwater and marine 
biology, and in pet and reptile welfare. 
A dedicated field team is responsible 
for ensuring we implement the best 
possible standards consistently  
across all our stores and breeders.  
A confidential hotline is in place for 
colleagues to raise any concerns they 
may have directly with our Head of Pets.
We aim to reflect the most up-to-date 
practice in the welfare standards we 
adopt. Our pet information leaflets 
have been written to ensure customers 
are aware of their responsibility, under 
the Animal Welfare Act, to care for their 
animals properly and in particular 
to provide for the five welfare needs. 
Many of these have been produced 
in conjunction with the RSPCA and 
are co-branded to highlight this 
endorsement. Our store audits are also 
based around the five welfare needs.
Advocating the ethical and responsible 
treatment of pets is fundamentally 
important to us, and our passion 
extends to the food and accessories  
we provide for pet owners. 
We are the only UK pet retailer to  
have invested in a dedicated sourcing 
operation in Asia with a team of  
trained technologists who have worked 
systematically to ensure that all of  
our Asian suppliers of Pets at Home 
registered brands and Pets at Home 
branded products, irrespective of 
whether they supply us directly or 
through UK agents, have submitted 
evidence of compliance with our Ethical 
Trading Policy. In addition to our own 
regular interaction, Asian suppliers are 
independently audited by third parties  
to ensure our standards are being 
maintained. These regular ethical audits 
probe in detail the standards we require 
in relation to:
•  Hours of work
• Wages
•  L a bo u r p r ac t i c e s
• Working conditions
• Onsite accommodation
•  Homeworkers and sub-contractors
• Health & safety
• Environmental compliance
• Supply chain management
We also work with our European 
suppliers to establish what audit 
information they hold for their  
factories, ensuring that our  
standards are being maintained.

To be protected 
from pain, injury,

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 54 Creating standards  
in the pet industry
comprised of a cross section of 
veterinary professionals, which has 
made key contributions to a number  
of initiatives. 
For example, we have launched two 
clinical audits to act as clear indicators 
of clinical standards. A post-operative 
complications audit, the most widely 
used audit in veterinary practice, will 
allow comparison with published 
benchmarks, and an intravenous 
catheter utilisation audit, which was 
proposed by our Clinical Advisory Board, 
which will provide information from which 
we can challenge working standards and 
promote best practice. Results will be 
shared with our vet partners through our 
business-wide communication system. 
We will continue to widen our clinical 
audit spectrum over time.
Another important aspect of our clinical 
governance work focuses on responsible 
use of antibiotics. Bacterial resistance  
to antibiotics is a growing problem in 
both human and animal health. Through 
the development and implementation  
of initiatives over a three year timeframe 
we intend to lead the way in the 
responsible use of antibiotics in 
the small animal veterinary sector. 
There are no formal regulations specific 
to pet accessories in the UK so we have 
developed our own testing protocols for 
each product category, and where there 
are legal requirements for products such 
batteries, electrical products and toys, 
the relevant regulations are applied 
to our products. More recently we 
have entered into an agreement with 
a major US pet retailer to collaborate on 
common testing protocols for important 
categories such as dog toys to help 
reduce costs and create better value  
for customers. 
We have a highly experienced team  
of Technical Managers who keep our 
testing protocols and British/European 
Standards under regular review to 
ensure they keep pace with 
developments in our product portfolio. 
They also monitor carefully all product 
feedback provided by customers through 
our dedicated customer services team. 
We are currently undertaking an 
independent review of the extent and 
frequency of testing in our own label 
food ranges. 
During the year we made improvements 
to the range of hamster cages to help 
customers provide better standards of 
pet welfare. Also we eliminated cooked 
pork bones from our range, which now 
features only beef bones. This was 
a result of our detailed analysis of 
complaints which revealed that, whilst 
the number of complaints overall was 
low, pork bones were more likely to 
fragment when chewed. 
Clinical freedom is a central tenet  
of our veterinary business and an 
essential way to ensure the health 
and welfare of the pets in our care  
is always the highest priority for our 
business. We work with more than 
440 Joint Venture partners and 
employ more that 2,500 vets, nurses 
and Veterinary Care Assistants in our 
veterinary practices. 
We have the utmost respect for their 
professional knowledge and expertise 
and we are committed to ensuring they 
have complete clinical freedom when 
making medical and surgical decisions. 
Our vet partners are able to make  
their own decisions about the medical 
products they use and which 
procedures they carry out within  
their practices. 
The concept of clinical governance  
has not yet been widely adopted in the 
veterinary profession, and we recognise 
the opportunity for us to develop a 
framework that will improve quality 
of care, clinical standards and patient 
safety across our veterinary network.  
In our first opinion business we have 
established a Clinical Advisory Board,

Reducing

Minimising water 
consumption
As we reported last year, trials  
of a combined Building Energy 
Management System (BEMS) with 
LED lighting delivered a 35% – 40% 
reduction in the daily energy load 
in the trial stores. 
The rollout to all stores is the biggest 
single project we have undertaken. 
By the end of the year we completed 
a combined BEMS/LED installation in 
250 stores, which involved fitting LED 
lighting right across our sales floors 
and in illuminated display signage.  
We are on track to have converted  
the entire store estate by May 2017 
delivering annual savings of £3m  
in 2017/18.
As part of the new BEMS set-up  
we have installed eight temperature 
sensors across each of our stores, 
which record temperature data every 
30 seconds. This helps control our 
in-store heating and cooling to maintain 
an optimum comfort level for our pets, 
customers and colleagues. Additional 
temperature probes in our quiet  
rooms ensure pets are kept within a 
temperature range that reflects current 
welfare guidelines. This is monitored 
centrally with any variance immediately 
reported and quickly rectified. We are 
also exploring the application of BEMS 
technology to control the temperatures 
in our in-store fish tanks and vivariums.
Reducing energy  
usage
With an expanding business and 
upward pressure on fuel costs there 
are both financial and environmental 
pressures on our logistics operation. 
Since insourcing the dedicated 
transport operations based at our 
distribution centres in Stoke and 
Northampton in 2013, our aim  
has been to maintain consistent 
improvement in fuel efficiency, 
measured by both the number  
of kilometres run per 1,000 cases 
delivered and kilometres per litre of 
fuel used. Investments in tractor units 
that comply with Euro6 emissions 
standards and more aerodynamic 
trailers have helped to reduce CO
2 
emissions and improve the fuel 
efficiency of the fleet. 
Alongside these physical improvements 
we have invested in Microlise, a vehicle 
telemetry system installed across  
our heavy vehicle fleet, to provide 
information about driver efficiency, and 
we support this with a programme of 
driver training to promote more efficient 
and defensive driving techniques.
In April 2017 the water market was 
opened up to competition for the first 
time. We are undertaking a review of 
water consumption across our business 
and the data we collect will be analysed 
in detail before deciding whether to 
tender a Group-wide contract later  
in the year.
We have continued to challenge 
ourselves against our aspiration to 
divert 100% of waste arising from our 
stores, support offices and distribution 
centres, away from landfill. We 
retendered our waste contract in the 
previous year and, under this new 
contract, we have achieved our goal  
of sending zero waste direct to landfill.
The housings for all the pets in our 
stores are cleaned every day of the 
year. Used bedding, wood shavings and 
other waste is collected and returned 
to our distribution centres for recycling. 
We have implemented a sustainable 
packaging policy to ensure that any 
packaging necessary to deliver our 
products to customers in the perfect 
condition we intend is created in the 
most sustainable way we can, 
throughout the packaging life cycle.  
The principles that underpin our policy 
can be summarised as “use a little; 
use the old; use it again and use  
it wisely”. Through these principles  
we aim to reduce packaging volume, 
material weight and optimise volume; 
maximise recycled content and 
post-use recyclability; and minimise 
environmental impact throughout  
our process.

Clear and consistent 
governance framework
Tony DeNunzio 
Non-Executive Chairman We recognise that corporate governance touches all aspects 
of our business, it underpins the management of our risk profile 
and it also affects our colleagues in many different ways.”
Chairman’s introduction
As Chairman, my role is to manage the Board, ensuring it 
operates effectively and contains the right balance of skills, 
diversity and experience to successfully execute the Group’s 
long-term strategy. We recognise that corporate governance 
touches all aspects of our business, it underpins the 
management of our risk profile and it also affects our colleagues 
in many different ways. This has been reflected in the activities 
that we have undertaken throughout the year. 
Key governance activities
In October, we completed our search for a new Group Chief 
Financial Officer and we welcomed Mike Iddon to the business. 
Mike has brought with him a wealth of financial expertise gained 
within established retail and consumer businesses including New 
Look, where he held the role of Chief Financial Officer from 2014 
until 2016 and Tesco plc, where he held a number of finance 
roles over a period of 13 years.
In December, I accepted Brian Carroll’s resignation from the 
Board. Brian was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of Pets 
at Home in 2011 and his contribution and perspectives were 
highly valued by his colleagues. Brian was replaced by Nicolas 
Gheysens, Director, Private Equity at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & 
Co. L.P (KKR). Nicolas is highly experienced and has also been  
a key member of the Board since KKR acquired Pets at Home  
in 2010. Nicolas has also been a Board Observer since 2014. 
Amy Stirling and Paul Coby have also confirmed that they will 
also step down from the Board with effect from the close of  
the annual general meeting on 11th July 2017 in order to  
fulfil commitments in their full time roles.
Paul has been a Director of Pets at Home since 2014 and will  
be replaced by Stanislas Laurent who was appointed on 25 May 
2017. Stan was formerly President and CEO of Photobox and 
COO of AOL Europe. He is currently entrepreneur in residence 
with Highland Capital Partners Europe. Amy has been a Director 
of Pets at Home and Chairman of the Audit Committee since 
2014. Amy will be succeeded by Sharon Flood, Chairman of ST 
Du Pont S.A, the Paris based luxury goods company and Audit 
Chairman at Crest Nicholson plc. Sharon was appointed on 
25 May 2017 and will take on the Chairmanship of the Audit and 
Risk Committee after the close of the annual general meeting 
on 11 July 2017.
Stan and Sharon bring a wealth of experience to the Board. 
Stan’s entrepreneurial background and understanding of the 
digital online space in consumer facing businesses will add 
significant value as we expand our omnichannel capabilities at 
Pets at Home. Sharon has impeccable retail credentials having 
worked with Kingfisher, John Lewis and more recently as 
Chairman of French luxury goods company ST Du Pont, 
and Audit Chair at Crest Nicholson Plc and Network Rail.
Her plc experience and understanding of the retail market will  
contribute greatly to the growth of the business. 
On appointment Stan will also become a member of the Audit 
Committee, Nominations & Governance Committee, CSR 
Committee and Pets Before Profit Committee and Sharon  
will also become a member of the Remuneration Committee  
and the Nominations & Governance Committee as well as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
During the year, we progressed the actions that were highlighted 
from the 2016 external evaluation report which emphasised the 
need to increase the Board’s focus on talent and succession 
planning, supporting Ian Kellett as he continues to strengthen 
the leadership team. This has led to a number of appointments 
at Executive and Senior Operating Board level, further details  
can be found on page 87 of the Nominations & Corporate 
Governance Committee report. The Non-Executive Directors  
also continued to spend time with the leadership teams  
outside of formal meetings to gain a deeper insight into  
key rising talent throughout the organisation. 
As part of our continued commitment to ensuring that our 
governance arrangements reflect the challenges and demands 
of our business, we reviewed our Committee meeting structure 
against our risk profile which resulted in an increase of the 
number of Pets Before Profit Committee meetings to four times 
a year to ensure that we maintain the focus on the Group’s 
number one value, Pets Before Profits. We now require all Board 
members to attend these meetings along with Board Observers. 
We re-launched our Code of Business Conduct during the year so 
that we continue to promote responsible and ethical behaviours 
at all levels of our business and ensure that our colleagues feel 
empowered to and have the confidential means to speak up 
and voice concerns.
Throughout the year, we also consulted with major shareholders 
on both the proposed changes to our remuneration policy as  
well as the performance of the business. Further details of the 
consultations on remuneration and the new policy are in the 
Directors remuneration report on pages 90 to 112.
The following pages set out our governance processes within the 
Group and demonstrate how we are committed to maintaining 
high standards of corporate governance to ensure that the  
Group is managed with integrity and transparency.

The role of the Board
Division of responsibilities
The Company is led and controlled by the 
Board which is collectively responsible for 
the long-term and sustainable performance 
of the Group. The roles of Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive Officer are 
separate and clearly defined, with the 
division of responsibilities set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board. The 
definitions of the roles are published 
on the Group’s website (https:/ /investors.
petsathome.com/investors/shareholder-
information/governance/our-committees).
The Code recommends that, on 
appointment, the chairman of a company 
with a premium listing on the Official List 
should meet the independence criteria 
set out in the Code. Tony DeNunzio joined 
Pets at Home in 2010 and has been 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Group 
since March 2010. Notwithstanding that 
the Board did not consider at the time 
Leadership 
Matters reserved for Board approval 
A formal schedule of matters is reserved to the Board for its approval, which includes 
the matters listed below. The separation of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Group Chief Executive Officer, coupled with the reserved matters described 
below, ensures that no individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.
Role of the Board and delegating duties
Group strategy and risk management
• Agreement of the Group’s strategy;
• Approval of extension of activities into 
new businesses or geographical areas;
• Approval of any decisions to cease

• Review of the Group’s overall 
corporate governance matters.
of listing and continue to believe that 
Tony DeNunzio does not meet the 
independence criteria set out in the  
Code, the Board believes that Tony  
should remain as Non-Executive Chairman  
of the Group since he brings vast retail 
experience and knowledge to the Pets  
at Home team. The Directors consider 
that he exercises his role as Chairman 
independently of management and 
exercises his judgement in the interests  
of all shareholders.
Board composition
Board balance and independence
The Code recommends that at least 
half the board of directors of a UK-
listed company, excluding the chairman, 
should comprise non-executive directors 
determined by the Board to be independent 
in character and judgement and free from 
relationships or circumstances which 
may affect, or could appear to affect, 
the director’s judgement. 
The Board currently consists of five 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, 
one Non-Executive Chairman, one 
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director 
appointed by the Principal Shareholder 
and two Executive Directors. The Directors’ 
biographies are contained on pages 70 
to 71. The Board considers that all of its 
Non-Executive Directors are independent 
in character and judgement and that both 
individually and collectively, the Directors 
have the range of skills, knowledge, 
diversity of experience and dedication 
necessary to lead the Group and also 
contribute significantly to the work of 
the Board together with the requisite 
strategic and commercial experience. 
More than half of the directors excluding 
the Chairman and the Non-Independent 
Non Executive Director are considered to be 
independent in accordance with the Code.
Pets at Home Group Plc

55% 
of the Directors excluding the Chairman and 
the non-Independent Non Executive Director 
are considered to be independent in 
accordance with the Code.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64 a diverse mix of experience, backgrounds, 
skills, knowledge and insight, to further 
strengthen the diversity of gender and 
experience already on the Board. Notably, 
two of the five Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, Tessa Green and Amy Stirling, 
are female together with the Group 
Company Secretary, Louise Stonier, and 
the CEO of the Vet Group, Sally Hopson. 
These appointments were made on merit, 
and not on the basis of gender, the 
appointees being by far the strongest 
candidates for the positions with their 
skill sets and overall experience fitting the 
objective role description approved by the 
Board at the outset of the recruitment 
process. Amy Stirling will be succeeded 
by Sharon Flood as Chairman of the Audit 
and Risk Committee on 11 July 2017.
This policy applies equally to all 
appointments in the Company and the 
board of the Pets at Home Vet Group,  
where Fiona Briault, another female 
board member, is appointed. 
Board meetings and attendance
In this financial year, the Board met 
formally nine times, plus the annual 
strategy meeting. Ad hoc meetings of both 
the Board and Committees were arranged 
to deal with matters between scheduled 
Board meetings as appropriate. Board 
meetings were preceded by Committee 
meetings with the meetings lasting the 
majority of the day in most cases.
Topics for the Board meetings are 
determined at the beginning of the year 
and new items are added to this as and 
when appropriate.
All Directors receive papers in advance 
of Board meetings via an electronic board 
paper system which enables the fast 
dissemination of quality information in a 
safe and secure manner. These include  
a monthly Board report with updates  
from each of the Executive Team and  
the Operating Board, which monitors  
the achievements of the Group’s key 
performance indicators, both financial  
and strategic. Performance against 
budget is reported to the Board monthly 
and any substantial variances are 
explained. Forecasts for each half  
year are revised and reviewed monthly. 
The Group’s Operating Board are also 
invited to present at Board meetings 
so that Non-Executive Directors keep 
abreast of developments in the Group.
The Chairman meets regularly with the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the 
Executive Directors present and this 
practice will continue in the future.  
The Senior Independent Director also 
attended these sessions.
It is important to the Group that all 
Directors understand external views of  
the Group. Throughout the year, regular 
reporting is provided to the Board by the 
Company’s Head of Investor Relations, 
covering broker reports and the output 
of meetings with significant shareholders.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66 Management committees
Details of our management committees 
are set out below:
Investment Committee
The Investment Committee assists  
the Board with the Group’s store and 
veterinary surgery rollout process to 
ensure the Group’s investment process  
is managed effectively and rigorously 
throughout the Group. The Investment 
Committee is chaired by Ian Kellett and  
its other members are Mike Iddon, Sally 
Hopson and Peter Pritchard. A number  
of the Group’s colleagues are entitled  
to attend meetings of the Investment 
Committee as observers including  
the Director of Property, the Group 
Development Director and the Vet  
Group Partner Recruitment, Property  
and People Director.
The Investment Committee meets formally 
at least ten times a year and otherwise 
as may be required. Duties of the 
Investment Committee include reviewing 
and considering all proposals presented 
for new store and standalone surgery 
acquisitions by a Group company; 
approving all material variations to 
proposed new stores and standalone 
surgery acquisitions; periodically reviewing 
proposed changes to the reporting and 
presentation of new store investment 
criteria; reviewing all proposals presented 
for lease renewals and reviewing 
alternative strategies for new store 
investment, formats and geographical 
markets and reporting on such strategies 
to the Board for final approval on the 
terms of any such matter; and reviewing  
all proposals for the dispositions of all  
or part of any of the lease on stores 
including any sub-letting, assignments, 
surrenders or relocations and approving 
or rejecting any such proposals as 
appropriate. Each of the matters approved 
by the Investment Committee is subject 
to the further approval of the Board where 
it falls within the level of expenditure 
requiring full Board approval. The 
Investment Committee formally updates 
the Board at least once a year in addition 
to regular updates on matters approved 
within the monthly Board packs.
Senior Executive and Operating Board
In addition to the Board, the Group has 
both the Executive Management Team 
(‘Executive Team’) as detailed in the 
Governance Report on pages 72 and 73 
and the Operating Board (the ‘Operating 
Board’) for which respective roles are 
clearly defined. The Operating Board 
meets frequently to discuss the following:
• Current trading;
• New developments;
• Operational issues;
• Marketing;
• People; and
• Execution of strategic programs. 
Health and Safety
Health and safety is a key priority for  
the Board and senior management  
and is an item for review and discussion 
at each Board meeting. The Board  
has established a Health & Safety 
Committee that meets at least on a 
quarterly basis and is chaired by the 
Group Chief Finance Officer with the 
agenda led by the Group Head of Health 
and Safety. The committee is attended  
by key individuals in the business that are 
responsible for certain areas of health 
and safety including the veterinary 
business, retail and grooming and the 
committee is tasked with reviewing 
the Group’s overall health and safety 
performance. A health and safety  
policy is in place for the Group which  
is reviewed on a regular basis. 
The distribution centres have their own 
dedicated health and safety manager  
and a separate health and safety 
sub-committee which also meets  
on a regular basis. The veterinary 
business also has a designated health 
and safety manager and two health  
and safety assessors.
Further details of the work of the Health 
& Safety Committee are contained on 
page 49 of our CSR report.
Directors’ conflicts of interest 
The Articles of Association of the 
Company give the Directors the power 
to consider and, if appropriate, authorise 
conflict situations where a Director’s 
declared interest may conflict or does 
conflict with the interests of the Company. 
Procedures are in place at every meeting 
for individual Directors to report and 
record any potential or actual conflicts 
which arise. The register of reported 
conflicts is reviewed by the Board at least 
annually. The Board has complied with 
these procedures during the year. 
One potential conflict of interest was 
reported in the year ended 30 March 
2017 in circumstances where the 
Non-Executive concerned was neither 
directly or indirectly involved in any 
potential dealings between the Group and 
the company concerned. The conflict was 
authorised by the Board with appropriate 
safeguards being put in place.
Whistleblowing Policy 
The Company has a duty to conduct its 
affairs in an open and responsible way. 
We are committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and compliance 
with legislation and appropriate codes  
of practice. By knowing about any wrong 
doing or malpractice at an early stage,  
we stand a good chance of taking the 
necessary steps to stop it. We relaunched 
our whistleblowing policy in FY18. The 
policy is designed to encourage colleagues 
to identify such situations and report 
them without fear of repercussions or 
recriminations provided that they are 
acting in good faith. The policy sets out 
how any concerns may be raised and 
when response can be expected from 
the Company and in what timescales. 
A copy of the Group’s Code of Ethics 
and Business Conduct is published on 
the Group’s website (https:/ /investors.
petsathome.com/investors/shareholder-
information/governance/code-of-ethics-
and-business-conduct). This policy and the 
procedures in place to deal with concerns 
raised under the policy were reviewed by 
the Audit & Risk Committee during 
the year.

Share dealing code
The Company has adopted a share 
dealing code in relation to its shares.  
The share dealing code applies to the 
Company’s Directors, its other PDMRs 
and certain colleague insiders of Group 
companies and they are responsible 
for procuring the compliance of their 
respective connected persons with  
the Company’s share dealing code.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
Process
In 2016, the Company engaged Lintstock 
Limited (“Lintstock”) to undertake an 
independent evaluation of the Board and 
Board Committee performance and to 
identify areas where the performance  
and procedures of the Board might be 
further improved. This year, the Company 
carried out an internal evaluation that 
included the completion of a short form 
online questionnaire that considered 
topics covered in the 2016 evaluation 
under the headings:
•  Board composition expertise 
and dynamics;
• Time management and Board support;
• Competitors and the market;
• The people strategy;
• Values and culture;
• The IT strategy;
• Succession planning; and
• Board Committees.
Outputs of the evaluation
At a dedicated Board session, a report  
of the findings of the evaluation and 
its recommendations were discussed 
and specific actions agreed. Overall, 
the majority of areas have seen an 
improvement in the scoring, however,  
the following have been identified as 
requiring additional focus: 
• succession and talent management;
• visibility and depth of the people strategy;
• presentation and understanding  
of the business systems;
• streamlining of agenda items; and
• refinement of the Board packs.
Beyond the annual evaluation, the 
performance of the Group Chief Executive 
Officer is continuously monitored 
throughout the year by the Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director. 
Internal control and risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness and has 
carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group including 
those that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity as detailed on pages 40 to 43 of 
the Strategic Report. The Board delegates 
to the Executive Team the responsibility 
for designing, operating and monitoring 
these systems. The systems are based  
on a process of identifying, evaluating  
and managing key risks and include the 
risk management processes set out on 
pages 38 to 39 of the Strategic Report  
and page 84 of the Audit & Risk 
Committee Report.
The systems of internal control were in 
place throughout the period and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report. The 
systems of internal control are designed 
to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable and  
not absolute assurance against material 
errors, losses, fraud or breaches of law 
and regulations. A number of internal 
controls operate across the business.  
The key controls the business relied 
upon during the year are set out below:
• The annual Group wide strategic review 
of the business took place in October 
and November 2016 culminating in the 
preparation of a detailed three year 
strategic plan which was reviewed and 
approved by the Board. Following this 
approval, the business carried out its 
annual budget cycle, again culminating 
in formal review and approval by 
the Board on 24 May 2017.
• Management accounts have been 
reviewed at meetings of the Board. 
These reviews covered the comparison 
of actual performance against budget in 
the period end management accounts 
and consideration of outturn for the 
year. The period end accounts are 
prepared by the management accounts 
team and reviewed by the Group Chief  
Financial Officer.
• All capital investments during the year 
have been approved by the Group Chief 
Financial Officer; an authority framework 
is in place which details the approvals 
required for specific levels of capital 
spend including those capital projects 
requiring full Board approval. In line with 
delegation by the Board, the Investment 
Committee, chaired by the Group Chief 
Executive Officer, has reviewed and 
approved investments in respect of the 
acquisition and fit-out of new stores and 
new standalone veterinary practices.
• The business plans for each new 
company acquisition undertaken during 
the year, namely the acquisition of Dick 
White Referrals Limited, have been 
reviewed and approved by the Board 
prior to acquisition following internal 
review and approval.
• There is an internal audit department  
in place that has its scope agreed 
with the Audit & Risk Committee and 
has reported at each Audit & Risk 
Committee throughout the year. All 
internal audit reports are presented 
to the Audit and Risk Committee for 
review and consideration of any material 
findings. Where audit findings have 
been raised, management have agreed 
appropriate actions and details of the 
areas covered in the internal audit 
reports can be found in the Audit & 
Risk Committee report on page 84.
• A clearly articulated delegated authority 
framework in respect of all purchasing 
activity is in place across the Group. 
This is complemented by systemic 
controls including a contract approval 
policy that reflect the agreed authority 
framework and clear segregation of 
duties between relevant functions 
and departments.

Shareholder Relations
The Board’s primary role is to promote the 
success of the Company and the interests 
of shareholders. The Board is accountable 
to shareholders for the performance and 
activities of the Group. 
The Board believes it is important to 
explain business developments and 
financial results to the Company’s 
shareholders and to understand any 
shareholder concerns. We communicate 
with shareholders on a regular basis.
The Board communicates with its 
shareholders in respect of the 
Group’s business activities through 
its Annual Report, yearly and half yearly 
announcements, interim management 
statements and other regular trading 
statements. This information is also 
made publicly available via the 
Company’s website. 
During the year, the Company met 
regularly with analysts and institutional 
investors and such meetings will  
continue. The Group Chief Executive 
Officer and the Group Chief Financial 
Officer have lead responsibility for investor 
relations. They are supported by a 
dedicated Director of Investor Relations 
who, amongst other matters, organises 
presentations for analysts and 
institutional investors and ensures  
that procedures are in place to keep  
the Board regularly informed of such 
investors’ views. 
The Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Group Company 
Secretary consulted extensively with  
major shareholders on the proposed new 
remuneration policy. Further details of the 
consultation are contained on pages 90 
to 91 of the Remuneration Report.
All the Non-Executive Directors are 
available to meet with major shareholders, 
if they wish to raise issues separately 
from the arrangements as described 
above, and during the year, the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director held 
such meetings and reported back to  
the Board.
Pets at Home’s investor website is  
also regularly updated with news and

Research and development
The Strategic Report sets out on page 34, the innovation carried 
out by the Group in relation to product development.
In addition, the Group also funds a number of research  
projects and this year we have continued to co-fund a Doctor  
of Philosophy (“PhD”) at Exeter University which is looking at how 
to reduce the stress suffered by fish when they are transported. 
The PhD is being co-funded with an executive agency called 
CEFAS (Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture 
Science) which is sponsored by DEFRA (Department for 
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) and advises DEFRA, as 
well as other public and private sector customers, on issues

partnership with Mars Fishcare and the University of West 
Scotland, looking at stress caused during transportation  
of fish from overseas breeders.
Colleague involvement
The Group places significant emphasis on colleague engagement 
at all levels. Colleagues are kept informed of issues affecting the 
Group through formal and informal meetings and through the 
Group’s internal written communications. Further information  
on colleague engagement is included in the CSR Report on 
page 48. Details of the Group’s employee share plans are 
contained in the Remuneration Report. 
Colleague diversity and disabled persons
The Group’s policy for colleagues and all applicants for 
employment is to match the capabilities and talents of each 
individual to the appropriate job. We are committed to ensuring 
equality of opportunity in all colleague relations. We aim to 
ensure that no colleague, potential colleague, customer, visitor 
or contractor will receive less favourable treatment on the 
grounds of:
• Sex
• Pregnancy and maternity
• Disability
• Religious beliefs
• Marital status
• Race
• Ethnic origin
• Nationality
• Age
• Sexual orientation or following gender reassignment
• Colour
Applications for employment by disabled persons are given full 
and fair consideration for all vacancies, and are assessed in 
accordance with their particular skills and abilities. The Group 
does all that is practicable to meet its responsibilities towards 
the training and employment of disabled people, and to ensure 
that training, career development and promotion opportunities 
are available to all colleagues.
The Group makes every effort to provide continuity of employment 
where current employees become disabled. Attempts are made 
in every circumstance to provide employment, whether this 
involves adapting the current job role and remaining in the 
same job, or moving to a more appropriate job role.

Governance Report on page 63. 
All Directors will stand for re-election on an annual basis, in line 
with the recommendations of the Code.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions 
given by the Company by special resolution and any relevant 
statutes and regulations, the business of the Company will 
be managed by the Board who may exercise all the powers 
of the Company.
Specific powers relating to the allotment and issuance of 
ordinary shares and the ability of the Company to purchase 
its own securities are also included within the Articles and such 
authorities are submitted for approval by the shareholders at the 
AGM each year. The authorities conferred on the Directors at the 
2016 AGM, held on 14 September 2016, will expire on the date 
of the 2017 AGM. 
Since the date of the 2016 AGM, the Directors have not 
exercised any of their powers to issue, or purchase, ordinary 
shares in the share capital of the Company.
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in and options over ordinary shares in 
the Company are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on page 109.
Since the end of the financial year and the date of this report, 
there have been no changes to such interests.
In line with the requirements of the Companies Act, each Director 
has notified the Company of any situation in which he or she 
has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, 
or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a 
situational conflict). These were considered and approved by the 
Board in accordance with the Articles and each Director informed 
of the authorisation and any terms on which it was given. The 
Board has formal procedures to deal with Directors’ conflicts 
of interest. The Board reviews and, where appropriate, approves 
certain situational conflicts of interest that were reported to 
it by Directors, and a register of those situational conflicts is 
maintained and is reviewed by the Board on an ongoing basis.
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 76 Directors’ indemnities
Each Director of the Company has the benefit of a qualifying 
indemnity, as defined by section 236 of the Companies Act, 
and as permitted by the Articles, as well as prospectus liability 
insurance which provides cover for liabilities incurred by Directors 
in the performance of their duties or powers in connection with 
the issue of the Company’s prospectus dated 28 February 2014 
in relation to the Listing. In addition, all directors and officers 
of Group companies are covered by Directors’ & Officers’ 
liability insurance.
No amount was paid under any of these indemnities or 
insurances during the year other than the applicable 
insurance premiums.
Share capital 
The issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2017 
and 24 May 2017, being the latest practicable date prior to the 
date of this Annual Report comprises 500,000,000 ordinary 
shares of 1 pence each. Further information regarding the 
Company’s issued share capital can be found on page 150 
of the Group’s financial statements.
There have been no movements in the Company’s issued share 
capital in the 2016 reporting period.
Details of employee share schemes are provided in note 23 
to the Group’s financial statements.
Shareholders’ voting rights
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and 
vote at the AGM. On a show of hands at a general meeting every 
member present in person shall have one vote and on a poll, 
every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote 
for every ordinary share held. No shareholder holds ordinary 
shares carrying special rights relating to the control of the 
Company and the Directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of the Company’s shares that may result 
in restrictions on voting rights.
Restrictions on transfer of ordinary shares
The Articles do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of 
ordinary shares in the Company other than the usual restrictions 
applicable where any amount is unpaid on a share. All issued 
share capital of the Company at the date of this Annual Report 
is fully paid. Certain restrictions are also imposed by laws and 
regulations (such as insider trading and marketing requirements 
relating to close periods) and requirements of the LRs whereby 
Directors and certain employees of the Company require Board 
approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
For a period of one year following the date of the Company’s 
Listing, each of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the 
Senior Executives (excluding the Group Company Secretary) 
(each, a “Restricted Shareholder”) agreed, on the terms and 
subject to the conditions of the Underwriting Agreement, not to 
dispose of any of the ordinary shares they hold in the Company 
(the “Initial Lock-Up Period”). Although the Initial Lock-Up Period 
expired on 16 March 2015, each Restricted Shareholder also 
entered into a lock-up deed dated 12 March 2014 with the 
Company. On the terms of each lock-up deed, each Restricted 
Shareholder undertook, for an additional period of 365 days 
(commencing on the termination of the Initial Lock-Up Period), 
not to dispose of more than a specified number of ordinary 
shares in the Company (in each case, approximately 50% of the 
relevant Restricted Shareholder’s holding of ordinary shares). 
The additional lock-up periods expired on 16 March 2016.
All of the above arrangements are subject to certain customary 
exceptions.

Transactions with related parties
The only subsisting material transactions which the Company 
has entered into with related parties are:
• Relationship Agreement: The Relationship Agreement 
was entered into on 28 February 2014 and regulates the 
relationship between KKR My Best Friend Limited (the 
“Principal Shareholder”) and the Company following Listing. 
Subject to a certain minimum shareholding, the Relationship 
Agreement details the rights the Principal Shareholder has 
to representation on the Board and Nomination & Corporate 
Governance Committee; appoint observers to the 
Remuneration, Audit & Risk and the Pets Before Profit/CSR 
Committees and certain anti-dilution rights. The Company has 
also undertaken to cooperate with the Principal Shareholder 
in the event of a sale of the ordinary shares by the Principal 
Shareholder at any time.
• The Relationship Agreement complies with the requirements 
of the LRs, including LR 9.2.2AR(2)(a), which came into effect 
on 16 May 2014, and LR 6.1.4DR.
• In accordance with the requirements of LR 9.8.4(14), the Board 
confirms that the Company has complied with its obligations 
under the Relationship Agreement, including in respect of the 
independence provisions set out therein, at all times since it 
was entered into, including throughout the period under review, 
and, so far as the Company is aware, KKR My Best Friend 
Limited and its associates have complied with the provisions 
of the Relationship Agreement (including the independence 
provisions set out therein), at all times since it was entered 
into, including throughout the period under review. 
• Senior Facilities Agreement: KKR Capital Markets Limited 
(“KCM”), an affiliate of the Principal Shareholder, was entitled 
to receive a syndication agent fee equal to 0.50% of the total 
commitments under the terms of a senior facilities agreement 
dated 18 February 2014 (“Senior Facilities Agreement”) 
entered into in connection with the Listing. 
• Amendment to the Senior Facilities Agreement: On 14 April 
2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered 
into an amendment agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”) 
to the Senior Facilities Agreement. KCM received fees 
of £500,000 (period to 26 March 2015 £nil), relating to 
professional services associated with debt financing following 
the refinancing of the Pets at Home Group in April 2015.
Further details of the Group’s banking facilities are shown in 
note 18 on page 148 of the financial statements. Certain of the 
payments made under the Amendment to the Senior Facilities 
Agreement have been made this financial year.
Amendment of the Articles
The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders in a general meeting, in accordance 
with the Companies Act.
Profits and dividend
The consolidated profit for the year after taxation and excluding 
exceptionals was £75,364,000 (FY16: £72,783,000). The 
results are discussed in greater detail in the financial review 
on pages 30 to 33. 
A final dividend of 5.0 pence per share (FY16: 5.5p per share) 
will be recommended to the Company’s shareholders in respect of 
the 2017 financial year. The final dividend will be proposed by the 
Directors at the AGM on 11 July 2017 in respect of the year ended 
30 March 2017 to add to an interim dividend of 2.5 pence per 
share paid on the 6 January 2017 (FY16: 2.0 pence per share).
The Directors’ proposed final dividend of 5.0 pence per share 
takes the total dividend payable in respect of the 2017 financial 
year to 7.5 pence per share. The ex-dividend date will be 15 June 
2017 and, subject to shareholder approval at the 2017 AGM, the 
final dividend of 5.0 pence per share will be paid to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 16 June 2017.
Compensation for loss of office and change of control
There are no agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or colleagues providing for additional compensation  
for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
The only significant agreements to which the Company is a party 
that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the Company following a takeover bid, and the effect thereof, 
are as follows:
• The Relationship Agreement with the Principal Shareholder 
contains a provision allowing the Principal Shareholder to 
terminate the agreement with immediate effect if any person 
acquires control of the Company (namely holding and/or 
ownership of the beneficial interest in and/or the ability to 
exercise the voting rights applicable to ordinary shares or other 
securities in the Company which confer, in aggregate on the 
holders, whether directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the 
voting rights exercisable at general meetings of the Company) 
or the Company ceases to be Listed.
• The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Amendment 
Agreement contain customary prepayment, cancellation and 
default provisions including, if required by a lender, mandatory 
prepayment of all utilisations provided by that lender upon the 
sale of all or substantially all of the business and assets of the 
Group or a change of control.
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78 Political donations
The Group made no political donations and incurred no political 
expenditure during the year (FY16: nil). It remains the Company’s 
policy not to make political donations or to incur political 
expenditure, however the application of the relevant provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006 is potentially very broad in nature 
and, as last year, the Board is seeking shareholder authority 
to ensure that the Group does not inadvertently breach these 
provisions as a result of the breadth of its business activities, 
although the Board has no intention of using this authority.
Suppliers
The Group understands the importance of maintaining good 
relationships with suppliers and it is Group policy to agree 
appropriate terms and conditions for its transactions with 
suppliers (ranging from standard written terms to individually 
negotiated contracts) and for payment to be made in accordance 
with these terms, provided the supplier has complied with its 
obligations. Average trade creditors of the Group’s UK operations 
for FY17 were 47 days (FY16: 46 days).
Post balance sheet events
On 24 May 2017, Paul Coby, Independent Non-Executive Director 
confirmed that he will step down from the Board with effect from 
the close of the Company’s annual general meeting (AGM) which 
will be held on 11 July 2017. Paul will be succeeded by Stansilas 
Laurent who was appointed on 25 May 2017. Stan was formerly 
President and CEO of Photobox and COO of AOL Europe and 
is currently entrepreneur in residence with Highland Capital 
Partners Europe.
In addition Amy Stirling, Independent Non-Executive Director, 
also confirmed that she will step down from the Board with 
effect from the close of the AGM. Amy has been a Director of 
Pets at Home and Chairman of the Audit Committee since 2014. 
Amy will be succeeded by Sharon Flood who was appointed on 
25 May 2017. Sharon is Chairman of ST Du Pont S.A, the Paris 
based luxury goods company and Audit Chair at Crest Nicholson 
plc and Network Rail. Sharon will take on the Chairmanship of 
the Audit and Risk Committee with effect from the close of the 
AGM on 11 July 2017. 
Both Paul and Amy are standing down from the Board in order 
to fulfil commitments in their full time roles. 
Stan and Sharon bring a wealth of experience to the Board. 
Stan’s entrepreneurial background and understanding of the 
digital online space in consumer facing businesses will add 
significant value as we expand our omnichannel capabilities 
at Pets at Home. Sharon has impeccable retail credentials 
having worked with Kingfisher, John Lewis and more recently 
as Chairman of French luxury goods company ST Du Pont. 
Her plc experience and understanding of the retail market 
will contribute greatly to the growth of the business. 
On appointment Stan will also become a member of the Audit 
Committee, Nominations & Governance Committee, CSR 
Committee and Pets Before Profit Committee and Sharon will 
also become a member of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Nominations & Governance Committee.
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections and facilities 
available, the Directors are satisfied that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for a period 
of twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. Accordingly, the financial statements continue 
to be prepared on a going concern basis. 
Viability statement
The Group has developed a detailed strategic and business 
planning (‘SBP’) process, which comprises a strategic plan 
(‘Plan’) containing financial projections for a number of future 
years and a business plan which forms a detailed near term 
one year plan for the upcoming financial year. The SBP process 
produces standard outputs in respect of the key financial 
performance metrics of the Group which deliver consolidated 
financial plans at both Group level and at a number of levels 
within the Group. The Plan is reviewed each year by the Board as 
part of the strategy review process. Once approved by the Board, 
the Plan is cascaded across the Group and provides the basis 
for setting all detailed financial budgets and strategic actions 
that are subsequently used by the Board to monitor 
performance.
The SBP process covers a three year period. The three year 
plan provides a robust planning tool against which strategic 
decisions can be made. In making their viability assessment, 
the Board has taken into consideration that financing facilities 
are maintained for the duration of the Plan. The Directors have 
considered a combination of risks and uncertainties and the 
mitigating controls operated by the Group as detailed on pages 
38 to 43 that may impact on the Group’s reputation and 
its ability to trade. These risks include issues on pet welfare, 
competitor activity and broader macro-economic risks and their 
impact on the strategic plan on an individual and combined level. 
On this basis and in conjunction with other matters considered 
and reviewed by the Board during the year, the Board has 
reasonable expectations that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three financial years used for their assessment. In making this 
assessment, the Board has assumed that there is no material 
change in the legislative environment in relation to the sale 
of small animals and the practice of veterinary medicine. It is 
recognised that such future assessments are subject to a level 
of uncertainty that increases with time and therefore future 
outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.

Governance Directors’ Report continued
Human rights and modern slavery statement
Pets at Home is the UK’s leading specialist retailer of pets, 
pet related products and services. We run the UK’s largest 
small animal veterinary and grooming businesses through 
our vets and services brands. 
 
Our mission is to be the best pet shop in the world. We therefore 
take great care in operating our business and in selecting our 
business partners and suppliers. The products we sell are 
sourced from a broad range of suppliers, both national and 
international. We are the only UK pet retailer to have a dedicated 
sourcing office in the Far East. From our regional base in 
Hong Kong, which opened in 2012, we have a team of product 
technologists who support our buyers, oversee our suppliers 
and monitor production.
Our suppliers are required to comply with our Ethical Trading 
Policy and we undertake ethical audits which cover: hours 
of work, labour practices, working conditions, onsite 
accommodation, health & safety, environment, supply chain 
management and wages. We also require compliance with the 
Pets at Home Group’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct.
In FY17, we highlighted a number of areas where we wished to 
strengthen our processes to protect against the risk of modern 
slavery, following a group wide risk assessment. These areas 
included: reviewing supplier due diligence and audit processes 
to ensure compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (“Act”), 
updating supplier trading terms and the Code of Business Ethics 
and Conduct in relation to the Act.
During last financial year, we reviewed our procurement 
processes in respect of modern slavery and have included 
appropriate questions in our tender documentation in relation 
to supplier compliance with the Act. In addition, we reviewed our 
audit processes and looked in detail at the questions asked 
during audits and the checks carried out. On review, our audits 
already include checks on working conditions, pay and other 
appropriate areas in sufficient detail to highlight any instances 
of modern slavery.
We have updated our supplier general terms and conditions to 
further drive compliance with the Act. We have included a warranty 
from suppliers requiring compliance with the Act, the right to 
audit in respect of the Act and also the right for Pets at Home 
to terminate in the event of supplier non-compliance with the Act.
In addition, we updated our Code of Business Ethics and 
Conduct to specifically cover the Act.
We consider that training is also key to raising awareness on 
modern slavery and will assist our colleagues and suppliers 
gain a better understanding on the issue of modern slavery and 
requirements set out in the Act. In November 2016, we delivered 
a workshop on this subject to all 45 suppliers attending our Asia 
supplier conference (being an area where we considered 
a greater potential risk of modern slavery being prevalent). 
We have also delivered training to colleagues in our UK 
support office where relevant. 
To ensure we continue to drive compliance with the Act, during 
this financial year we intend to review the previously undertaken 
risk assessment to ensure it remains up to date and will assess 
any new risk areas or actions. We will continue to train 
colleagues and suppliers as appropriate.
Should any instances of non-compliance with the Act arise 
in relation to any of our suppliers then this will be reviewed 
and appropriate action taken. 
Branches outside of the UK
The Company has no branches outside of the UK. 
Auditor
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware. Each 
Director has taken all the steps which they ought to have taken 
as Directors to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information (being information that is needed by the Company’s 
Auditor in connection with preparing its report) and to establish 
that the Company’s Auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418(2) of the Companies Act.
At the AGM on 14 September 2016, KPMG LLP was appointed 
as the Company’s Auditor. During the 2016 financial year, a 
competitive tender process of audit services was completed in 
accordance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) 
Order 2014, made by the Competition & Markets Authority.
A resolution is to be proposed at the 2017 AGM for the 
reappointment of KPMG LLP as the Auditor of the Group.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 80 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and 
the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare the Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial year. 
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group’s financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”) as (adopted by the European Union (EU)) 
and applicable law and they have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements on the same basis. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the parent 
company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. 
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether they have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act. They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other 
irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual

Governance Introduction
I am pleased to present the Audit & Risk Committee’s report for 
the year. Our primary function is to assist the Board in fulfilling 
its responsibilities to protect the interest of the shareholders with 
regard to the integrity of the financial reporting, the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the risk management systems and internal 
controls, the effectiveness of the internal audit function and the 
relationship with the external auditors. 
During the year the Committee met four times with our agenda 
covering financial reporting considerations, progress against 
the internal audit plan and the external audit process. We 
have considered risk regularly throughout the year, reviewing 
updates to the Group risk register, including a review of the risks 
associated with the Group’s recent acquisitions in the specialist 
referral centre market.
In addition to our regular agenda, this year we have considered 
accounting for business combinations and the segmental 
disclosures made by the Group. We have reviewed and updated 
our policy on non-audit fees to respond to emerging legislation 
refining the list of permissible services our external auditor can 
complete and considered the Group’s approach to managing 
data protection and discussed specific risks identified within 
the Vet Group.
Committee membership
The Audit & Risk Committee (“the Committee”) members have 
been selected to provide a wide range of financial and commercial 
experience necessary to fulfil the duties and responsibilities of the 
Committee. Each member of the Committee is an independent 
Non-Executive Director and has, through their other business 
activities, significant experience in financial matters. Further 
details of the Committee members and their experience can 
be found on pages 70 and 71.
The Chairman of the Company’s Board, Executive Management and 
senior managers within the business are invited to attend meetings 
as appropriate to ensure that the Committee maintains a current 
and well-informed view of events within the business, and to 
reinforce a strong risk management culture. The Group Company 
Secretary and Legal Director acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee meets according to the requirements of the 
Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the Committee 
also provide the opportunity for the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors to meet without the Executive Directors present and to 
raise any issues of concern with the internal and external auditors. 
Committee activities
The Committee’s role primarily covers the following areas:
• Financial reporting;
• Ongoing viability;
• Risk management systems;
• Internal controls;
• Internal audit; and
• External audit

What we did in 2017
Reviewed key financial reporting matters and 
considered how these are presented in the Financial 
Statements. 
Reviewed and challenged the Longer Term Viability 
Statement (LTVS) and going concern basis of 
preparation in advance of its approval by the Board. 
As part of this work, the carrying value of the goodwill 
balance has been reviewed. 
We have reviewed and updated the Group’s policy 
on non-audit fees with our external auditor which has 
adopted the provisions of new EU legislation.
What we will do in 2018
Continue to carry out our responsibilities as set out in the 
terms of reference, including monitoring the integrity of the 
Group’s Financial Statements, challenging the judgemental 
areas contained within the Financial Statements and advising 
the Board on whether external reporting is fair, balanced 
and reasonable.
Our focus on the control environment across the Group will 
consider the Vet Group in particular as the business continues 
to grow and mature, to ensure controls continue to meet the 
needs of the growing business. This review will also include 
risk and control within the Specialist Division.
We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function. We will agree an Internal Audit strategy 
for FY18 and beyond, defining ways of working as well as 
specific projects. We expect to review each of the top risks 
in a ‘deep dive’ during the year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 82 Issue Nature of the risk How the risk was addressed by the Committee
Carrying 
value of 
goodwill
The Group holds a significant goodwill balance. There are a 
number of factors that could impact on the future profitability 
of the business (e.g. threat of competition, changes in market 
behaviour, changes in the broader macro-economic 
environment) and there is a risk that the business will not 
meet the required financial performance to support the 
carrying value of the intangible asset.
The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s 
process for testing goodwill for potential impairment and 
ensuring appropriate sensitivity disclosure. This included 
challenging the key assumptions: principally cash flow 
forecasts, growth rates and discount rates. 
The Committee also reviewed KPMG’s work and conclusions 
on this risk and the key assumptions they tested in reaching 
their conclusions.
The Committee is satisfied that there is no impairment to 
the goodwill balance and that there is appropriate disclosure 
in the financial statements. 
See note 12 of the financial statements for details on the 
impairment testing.
Inventory 
valuation
The business carries a wide range of Stock Keeping Units 
(SKUs) and with a variety of expiry dates on most food lines. 
Changes in customer demand may mean that some lines 
cannot be sold, or will be sold below carrying value. Whilst 
provisions are made to reflect this, there is a risk that the 
provisions are inadequate. Management have established 
a detailed range review process to identify action to be 
taken against inventory lines and assessing the required 
inventory provision.
The Committee reviewed management’s judgement in 
assessing the required level of inventory provisioning and 
concluded that the method of estimating the carrying value 
of inventory remains appropriate, and that the level of 
provisioning is appropriate.
The Committee met on four occasions since the end of the last financial year with each meeting having a distinct agenda to reflect 
the annual reporting cycle of the Group. The planner is regularly reviewed and developed to meet the changing needs of the Group.
A summary of the key matters considered at each meeting is as follows:
Financial statement reporting issues 
The Committee considered a number of significant issues in the year, taking into account in all instances the views of the Company’s 
external auditor. The Committee consider the key risks within the Financial Statements to be the carrying value of goodwill and the 
carrying value of inventory.
The Committee considered the following in making their assessment of the reporting in the financial statements.

External audit
KPMG presents their audit plan, risk assessment and audit 
findings to the Committee, identifying their consideration of the 
key audit risks for the year and the scope of their work. These 
reports are discussed throughout the audit cycle. As in the prior 
year, these risks were considered to be the carrying value of 
goodwill and the carrying value of inventory. In their reports 
presented to the Committee at both the half year and full 
year, the auditors considered these risks to be appropriately 
addressed and raised no significant areas of concern in these 
or any other areas of their review.
KPMG also attend the Committee meetings and meet separately, 
without management present, to discuss any issues in detail. 
We are in compliance with The Order and performed a tender 
process which concluded in January 2015. KPMG, who have 
audited the Group since 2000, were reappointed at the AGM 
in September 2016. Nicola Quayle has been the audit partner 
since 2016.
External auditor’s effectiveness
The Committee considered the effectiveness, independence 
and objectivity of the external auditors through the review of 
all reports provided, regular contact and dialogue both during 
Committee meetings and separately without management. We 
conducted an audit effectiveness review through a questionnaire 
to Committee members, management and member of the 
Finance team. This questionnaire expanded on the process in 
the previous year, providing more focused insight into KPMG’s 
effectiveness. The results were discussed with KPMG and 
specific actions were agreed.
Ongoing viability
In considering viability overall, the Committee reviewed 
the Group’s strategic plan with particular focus on the key 
assumptions in relation to revenue and our store and service 
expansion plans. Sensitivities to these key assumptions were 
also reviewed based on the impact of the Group’s key risks, 
individually and conflated, as set out on pages 38 to 43. 
Following a review of the detailed considerations set out 
above by the Committee and the Executive Management, the 
Committee is satisfied that it is appropriate for the Group to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts of the Group and, further, that 
the Longer Term Viability Statement on page 79 is appropriate.
Risk management and internal controls
Risk management and the system of internal control are the 
responsibility of the Board. It ensures that there is a process in 
place to identify, assess and manage significant risks that may 
affect achievement of the Group’s objectives and that the level 
and profile of such risks is acceptable. The Committee provides 
oversight and challenge to the assessment of principal risks 
as set out on page 38. The Group’s key risks and uncertainties 
are set out on pages 40 to 43. 
The Committee explores specific key risks of the Group in 
detail, inviting the management team to discuss the issues and 
mitigations and further proposed actions. During the year, the 
Committee reviewed the Group’s approach to the protection of 
confidential data and considered risks specific to the Vet Group. 
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function has a direct line of report into the 
Committee and is an important part of the assurance processes 
within the business. The Committee reviews and approves the 
Internal Audit plan for the year which is developed to address key 
risks across the business as well as reviewing core governance, 
financial and commercial processes. 
The Head of Internal Audit and Risk has attended each 
Committee meeting, updating on progress against the audit plan 
throughout the year, reporting on any key control weaknesses 
identified and progress against mitigating actions. 
Audit & Risk Committee Report continued
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 84 Auditor independence
Maintaining the objectivity and independence of the external 
auditors is essential. The Committee has taken appropriate 
steps to ensure that the Company’s external auditors are 
independent of the Company and obtained written confirmation 
from them that they comply with guidelines on independence 
issued by the relevant accountancy and auditing bodies. 
Additional non-audit services provided by the auditors may impair 
their independence or give rise to a perception that their 
independence may by impaired. During the year, the policy on 
non-audit fees has been reviewed and updated to align with EU 
Regulation and Statutory Audit Directive to provide further clarity 
over the type of work that is acceptable for the external auditors 
to carry out. The policy sets out the process required for approval 
and a cap to the total non-audit fees for permitted services (at 
70% of the audit fee) – the non-audit fee cap policy has been 
adopted a year earlier than the regulations require (see below).
Following the audit tender process in 2015, we appointed Ernst 
& Young LLP as tax advisors to the Group, while KPMG continue 
to provide tax support services to the Joint Venture partners. 
In applying the new EU Regulation and Statutory Directive, 
consideration has been given to the fee payable to KPMG for 
tax compliance fees for joint venture companies. The work is 
a permitted service as the joint venture tax charges do not form 
part of the consolidated financial statements, however, the fees 
chargeable for those services do count towards the fee cap. 
Accordingly, whilst the EU Regulation and Statutory Directive 
has been adopted early, the tax fees for joint venture companies 
chargeable in the year to March 2017 have been excluded in the 
application of our policy in the current financial year as the work 
was substantially underway prior to publication of the EU Directive.
Audit and non-audit fees paid to KPMG in the year were 
£246,000 and an analysis is presented in note 3 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 134. Non-audit 
fees represent 12% of the audit fee.
Resolutions to re-appoint KPMG as auditors and to authorise the 
Directors to agree their remuneration will be put to shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting that will take place on 11 July 2017 .
 
Financial Reporting Council 
During the year, the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) 
Corporate Review team reviewed our Annual Report and 
Accounts for the year to March 2016. Following their review, the 
Corporate Review team entered into correspondence with the 
Group. All correspondence received and our responses were 
discussed with the Committee and the Group’s external auditors. 
Following the conclusion of the FRC’s review we have taken the 
opportunity to improve the clarity of disclosure in relation to:
•  Investment in veterinary practices, including clearer analysis  
of the investment and loan balances held with our joint venture 
partners and the rental contribution made by our partners 
for space in our stores, specifically in note 15 and 27 to the 
financial statements
•  Accounting for estimates and judgements, including inventory 
provisions, goodwill impairment and onerous lease sensitivity 
analysis and our assessment of judgement in recognising 
income from suppliers, specifically in notes 1.18, 12, 13 
and 20 to the financial statements
•  The description of the factors that make up the goodwill 
recognised as part of a business combination. The enhanced 
disclosure has been applied to the acquisition of Dick White 
Referrals Limited and Eye-Vet Limited during the year ended 
30 March 2017, specifically in note 10 to the financial 
statements
•  Related party disclosures, particularly those related to  
key management personnel, specifically in note 4 to the 
financial statements
The FRC’s Audit Quality Review team carried out a review of the 
audit conducted by KPMG LLP for the year ended 31 March 2016 
specifically in the areas of impairment of goodwill and other 
intangible assets, business combinations, revenue recognition 
– supplier income and inventory. In selecting which aspects of an 
audit to review, the FRC take account of those areas considered 
to be higher risk by the auditors and Audit and Risk Committee, 
their knowledge and experience of audits of similar entities 
and the significance of an area in the context of the financial 
statements. The results of this review were shared with the Audit 
Committee in April 2017 and have been discussed with KPMG, 
the FRC and at the Audit Committee.
Both supplier income and accounting for business combinations  
have been specific areas of focus for the Audit Committee and 
KPMG during 2017, and where for the 2017 audit, additional 
audit procedures have been performed.

Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee Report
Tony DeNunzio 
Chairman of the Nomination & 
Corporate Governance Committee
Introduction
The Committee is a key committee of the Board whose role  
is to keep the composition and structure of the Board and its 
committees under review and has responsibility for nominating 
candidates for appointment as Directors to the Board having 
regards to its structure, size and composition (including the 
skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of its members).
We are also tasked with ensuring that succession plans are in 
place for the Directors, the Executive Management Team and the 
Group’s Operating Board taking into consideration the current 
Board structure, the leadership requirements of the Group and 
the wider commercial and market environment within which the 
Group operates.
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of a 
nomination committee should be Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee 
is chaired by myself, Tony DeNunzio, and its other members are 
Dennis Millard, Paul Coby, Tessa Green, Amy Stirling (each of 
whom is an Independent Non-Executive Director), and Nicolas 
Gheysens. The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee 
meets not less than once a year.
How the Committee discharged its responsibilities in FY17
Board appointments
The search for a Group Chief Financial Officer was concluded 
with the appointment of Mike Iddon in October 2016. Kornferry 
was appointed as advisor to the Committee in the search for 
external candidates and the process was led by myself together 
with the Committee, Amy Stirling, the chair of the Audit & Risk 
Committee, and Ian Kellett, the Group Chief Executive Officer.
Following the search and selection process, Mike Iddon was the 
standout candidate and was appointed as Chief Financial Officer 
on 17 October 2016. 
In December, I accepted Brian Carroll’s resignation from the 
Board. Brian was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of 
Pets at Home in 2011 and had continued as the principal 
shareholder’s appointed Director pursuant to the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement entered into with KKR My Best Friend 
Limited as part of the IPO process in 2014. Brian was replaced 
by Nicolas Gheysens who is a director at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
& Co. L.P (KKR). Nicolas has also been a key member of the 
Board since KKR acquired Pets at Home in 2010. 
Amy Stirling and Paul Coby will also step down from the Board 
with effect from the close of the annual general meeting on 11th 
July 2017 in order to fulfil commitments in their full time roles.
Paul has been a Director of Pets at Home since 2014 and will 
be replaced by Stanislas Laurent who was appointed on 25 May 
2017. Stan was formerly President and CEO of Photobox and 
COO of AOL Europe. He is currently entrepreneur in residence 
with Highland Capital Partners Europe. Amy has been a Director 
of Pets at Home and Chairman of the Audit Committee since 
2014. Amy will be succeeded by Sharon Flood, Chairman of ST 
Du Pont S.A, the Paris based luxury goods company and Audit 
Chairman at Crest Nicholson plc and Network Rail. 
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 86 Sharon was appointed on 25 May 2017, will take on the 
Chairmanship of the Audit and Risk Committee with effect from 
the close of the AGM on 11 July 2017.
Stan and Sharon bring a wealth of experience to the Board. Stan’s 
entrepreneurial background and understanding of the digital online 
space in consumer facing businesses will add significant value as 
we expand our omnichannel capabilities at Pets at Home. Sharon 
has impeccable retail credentials having worked with Kingfisher, 
John Lewis and more recently as Chairman of French luxury goods 
company ST Du Pont. Her plc experience and understanding of the 
retail market will contribute greatly to the growth of the business. 
On appointment Stan will also become a member of the Audit 
Committee, Nominations & Governance Committee, CSR 
Committee and Pets Before Profit Committee and Sharon will 
also become a member of the Remuneration Committee and 
the Nominations & Governance Committee as well as Chairman 
of the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Committee considered and recommended to the Board the 
terms of appointment for Dennis Millard, Tessa Green and Paul 
Moody for a second three-year term subject to annual shareholder 
re-election. It also recommended my re-appointment, again for 
a three-year term subject to annual shareholder re-election. 
Succession planning 
A principal risk to the business is the inability to attract, retain 
and incentivise talented individuals to deliver our strategy. 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing talent, capability 
and succession at the most senior levels of the business, 
however, the Board evaluation carried out in 2016 highlighted the 
Board’s view that there was a lack of time devoted to succession 
planning below the Executive Management Team level and that 
it was important to spend more time focusing on talent 
development and retention.
As a result, there has been an increased focus on the succession 
plans across the wider Group operating team with the Board 
and the Committee considering skills and capability gaps along 
with succession planning immediately below the Executive 
Management Team. Considerable progress has been made in 
identifying gaps in the talent pool in addition to mitigating the risks 
associated with unforeseen events such as key individuals leaving 
the business. Following this review, the Board appointed Louise 
Stonier to the role of Chief People and Legal Officer with effect 
from the new financial year. Louise has been in the business for 
13 years as Group Legal Director and Company Secretary and has 
been a member of the Executive Management Team since 2015.
The role of operations director has also been created with 
responsibility for the retail, logistics and pet operations. 
Following an extensive search, Stuart Livingstone has been 
appointed to the role reporting directly to the Chief Executive 
Officer of Retail, Peter Pritchard. Stuart joined the business in 
April from Screwfix where he was Director of Retail and Trade 
Plus for six years. We also strengthened our Vet Group with the 
appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer – Harvey Ainley, 
who brings a wealth of health services and retail experience. 
These appointments provide organisational strength and 
support our succession planning objectives.
Despite the progress that has been made on succession 
planning, the Board recognises that more work is required 
in order to ensure that a clear development framework is in 
place for identified successors and this will be a focus of the 
Committee for the next financial year.
Board evaluation and effectiveness 
During 2015 and 2016, we appointed Linstock Limited to carry 
out external evaluations on the performance of the Board and its 
Committees. This year, we carried out an internal evaluation that 
included the completion of a short form online questionnaire that 
considered the priority areas highlighted in the 2016 external 
evaluation. The Company Secretary also held discussions with 
each of the Board members. The Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors also met in the absence of the Executive Directors.
The Board considered the output from the review in May 
2017 and concluded that the performance of the Board, its 
committees and individual Directors was effective. Any areas 
for improvement have been agreed by the Board and are 
detailed on page 68 of the Governance Report. 
Diversity
We take into account a variety of factors before recommending any 
new appointment to the Board, including relevant skills to perform 
the role, experience, knowledge, ethnicity and gender. The most 
important priority of the Committee, however, is ensuring that the 
best candidate is selected to join the Board. However, we will 
monitor the Group’s approach to people development to ensure that 
it continues to enable talented individuals, both male and female, 
to enjoy career progression with the Group. Further details on Board 
diversity can be found on pages 64 to 65 of the Governance Report.
Conflicts of interest and independence of the  
Non-Executive Directors
The Board has delegated authority to the Committee to consider, 
and where necessary authorise, any actual or potential conflicts of 
interest arising in respect of the Directors. We considered potential 
conflicts of interest as they arose during the course of the year.
We also support the Board in its annual consideration of the 
Conflicts of Interest Register, which is carried out prior to the 
publication of the Annual Report, and consider the independence 
of the Non-Executive Directors, in the context of the criteria set 
out in the Code. The Board’s view on independence is contained 
on page 62 of the Governance report.
I will be available at the AGM to answer any questions on the 
work of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee.

Corporate Social Responsibility and Pets Before Profit Committee Report
Tessa Green 
Chairman of the Corporate Social 
Responsibility and Pets Before  
Profit Committee
Introduction
Recognising the Group encompasses a broad range of activities 
which are all focused around pets, the Board maintains a regular 
and detailed review of pet welfare in addition to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) more widely. It achieves this by having both 
a CSR Committee and a Pets Before Profit Committee which, 
together, help manage the Group’s most important ethical,  
social and environmental impacts. The committees will review 
compliance with and the development of legislation which will 
affect the sale, veterinary care and grooming of pets and all 
ethical matters in respect of the supply, transportation and  
sale of pets in stores. The committees will also review all other 
elements of the Group’s CSR strategy, including caring for the 
environment, sourcing with integrity and ‘Our Pets People’.
The CSR Committee, which meets twice a year, is chaired 
by Tessa Green and its other members are Tony DeNunzio, 
Dennis Millard and Paul Coby. The Pets Before Profit Committee, 
which meets four times a year, is also chaired by Tessa Green with 
Tony DeNunzio, Dennis Millard and Paul Coby as its members. 
Acknowledging the importance of pets to the Group, all Board 
members are required to attend Pets Before Profit Committee 
meetings, along with Board observers.

Managing our commitments
Being the UK’s leading retailer of pet food, accessories and 
grooming services, and one of the foremost veterinary services 
providers, we have an important role to play in delivering the 
highest possible welfare standards for pets. We also aim to 
make a positive impact on the communities where we operate 
and to reduce our environmental footprint.
A group of senior managers from across the business have specific 
responsibility to ensure the delivery of our CSR commitments and 
to further improve standards of pet welfare. In last year’s report 
we described how we had consulted with key stakeholder groups, 
including customers, colleagues and animal welfare organisations, 
to identify priorities from which we could allocate resources to 
deliver the greatest impact environmentally, socially and financially. 
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88 Reflecting these priorities I am delighted with the progress that 
has been made in the past year:
• We have delivered a major investment programme to upgrade 
store lighting to LED and install Building Energy Management 
technology across our store estate. This is providing significant 
energy savings and improving the store environment for our 
customers, colleagues and pets (see page 56)
• A clinical governance framework, which is designed to improve 
quality of care, clinical standards and patient safety, has been 
developed and implemented across our first opinion veterinary 
practice network (see page 55)
• We rely on highly engaged and motivated colleagues whose 
shared love of pets provides an important bond with our 
customers. We have continued to invest in our colleagues, 
providing them with world-class training and rewarding their 
knowledge and experience through our Earn As You Learn 
policy. Colleague engagement, a key measure for us, has 
remained high this year (see page 48)
• Education and information are essential for customers who 
are considering introducing a new pet to their home. Our 
investment in an online booking platform allows parents to 
register their children in our ‘My Pet Pals’ workshops where our 
highly trained colleagues provide essential information about 
responsible pet ownership. This year more than 102,000 
people registered for one of these workshops (see page 50)
• Our colleagues helped to raise £3.8 million to support the 
rehoming of pets. In the four weeks leading up to Christmas 
2016, they raised a staggering £1,064,064 in conjunction with 
the charity Support Adoption For Pets, to help with this vital 
work (see page 50)
Review of Animal Establishments Licensing
In December 2015 the Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra) issued a consultation on its review of animal 
establishments licensing. As a consequence of our scale we 
have first-hand experience of the variation that exists among 
local authorities when licensing pet shops and of the pressure 
the current system creates by requiring every licence to be 
renewed at the end of the calendar year. We provided a detailed 
response to Defra’s consultation on their proposals for reform, 
many of which we supported. 
We welcome the proposals that Defra have brought forward, 
particularly the introduction of a risk-based approach to the 
length of a licence term, and the introduction of a rolling twelve 
month period instead of the current end of December expiry for 
all licences. We also welcome proposals to enshrine the key 
requirements from the Model Licence Conditions into law which 
we believe will remove much of the variation that exists currently, 
and also the plans to allow licensing by accredited third parties, 
linked to risk based assessments. We believe the steps 
announced by Defra represent a positive step forward for 
animal welfare and are welcomed by Pets at Home.

Paul Moody 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Introduction
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee (Committee), I am 
pleased to present our Directors’ Remuneration Report for FY17.
Remuneration Policy
Much of the Committee’s activity during FY17 has focused on 
reviewing our policy. We have undertaken a thorough and detailed 
review of our existing policy to assess whether it remains appropriate 
and relevant in the context of our strategic plan and business 
goals set against a changing macro-economic environment.
The Committee concluded that the policy remains appropriate  
in respect of salary, annual bonus and benefits provided to 
Executive Directors, and there are no changes proposed in 
respect of these elements. The key area of focus has been on 
redesigning our LTIP, which the Committee considers was not 
delivering the best value for shareholders in its current form.  
We have also amended the pension provision, in line with 
proposed changes to be made to the pension entitlement 
across the Group.
The Committee firmly believes that the remuneration 
arrangements for the senior team should be based on the same 
principles as those for the wider colleague population, which are 
simplicity, alignment and long-term share ownership. In designing 
the new executive remuneration policy, we have taken a “bottom 
up” approach to design long-term incentives for the broader 
organisation that are then applied to our executives. 
Proposed changes
The Committee considered a range of approaches for the 
Group’s LTIPs and sought an early view from investors for a 
significant simplification of our share plans. As a result, the 
Committee is proposing to replace our Co-Investment Plan, 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Company Share Option Plan 
(CSOP) with a new Restricted Stock Plan (RSP). 
• The RSP will be the sole long term incentive arrangement used;
• The maximum award level under the new plan will be reduced 
by 50% from the current maximum PSP and CSOP awards; 
• A total shareholder return (TSR) underpin applies and will be 
measured at the end of year 3;
• Awards will vest in tranches over years three to five,  
(extended from the current three year timescale) if the underpin 
has been satisfied;
• Likewise all of the awards will lapse if the underpin is not satisfied 
at the end of year 3; and
• Awards remain subject to leaver provisions, and malus  
and clawback will apply.
Shareholder engagement
We have consulted extensively with and have received support 
from all of our major shareholders throughout the policy review. 
The majority of shareholders who participated in this process:
• Recognised the level of challenge in designing long term incentive 
plans that are easily understood and valued by colleagues;
• Strongly supported the simplified remuneration structure;
• Welcomed the inclusion of the TSR underpin and the  
extended vesting period;
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 90 • Recognised the level of challenge in providing competitive 
remuneration packages to attract and retain top class talent;
• Appreciated that there would be a reduction in overall quantum 
in return for more certain awards;
• Supported the “bottom up” approach and the colleague 
alignment on share plans that runs through the organisation.
We consulted in particular with shareholders on the performance 
underpin below which it would not be appropriate for awards to pay 
out. Investors’ preference was that the underpin relates to TSR 
rather than a dividend or financial metric. The Committee therefore 
determined to apply an absolute TSR underpin, as follows.
•  Awards under the RSP will vest in full subject to absolute TSR 
being positive over the first three years of the vesting period; 
•  If absolute TSR performance is negative at the end of the three 
year period the awards will lapse in full; and
• For awards made in 2017 absolute TSR performance will be 
calculated by taking the average absolute TSR for the final 
three or six month period of the plan ending on 26 March 2020 
and comparing it with the average absolute TSR for the three or 
six month period ending on 30 March 2017. This ensures that 
the starting point for the underpin calculation occurs prior to 
the recent reduction in share price.
We believe the RSP is right for our business. It provides a 
simpler approach, which offers the ability to build up meaningful 
shareholding over the long term, strengthening alignment, 
increasing retention and delivering a greater incentive for our 
colleagues, including our Executive Directors, given the long 
maturity curve of our investment in space and services.
Remuneration in respect of FY17
Results for FY17
FY17 saw the delivery of a solid performance with profits in line 
with expectations.
• Total income from Joint Venture vet practices up 24.6% to 
£47 .1m; Positive response to the launch of pricing initiatives in 
Advanced Nutrition private labels and everyday pet essentials. 
Pricing initiatives now extending to branded foods;
• Progress in Q4 with Merchandise returning to growth. 
Q4 LFLs: Group 1.2%, Merchandise 0.5% & Services 7.1% 
when adjusted for the impact of Easter;
• New openings in line with targets: 15 superstores, 50 vet 
practices and 50 grooming salons. A further two veterinary 
specialist referral centres acquired;
•  Strong results from omnichannel investment with online 
revenue growth of 53%: launched colleague assisted ‘Order 
in-store’ and a subscription platform with potential for broader 
product application; and
• Total dividend payable of 7.5 pence per share.
We are not, however, immune to the wider macroeconomic 
environment and changes in consumer behaviour. Encouraged 
by the positive customer reaction to our value initiatives, 
we are continuing to reposition our prices across additional 
Merchandise lines and branded foods. 
In FY18, we will also accelerate growth in our vet business, 
invest in marketing and deliver operational cost efficiencies. 
Whilst there will be some short term margin impacts from these 
initiatives, we are confident this is the right path for success 
and will give us a strong platform from which to grow.
Annual bonus
The Committee reviewed the performance of both the business 
and each Executive Director against targets set at the beginning 
of the year for the annual bonus scheme. For FY17 the annual 
bonus continued to be based on EBITDA (75%) and free cash 
flow (25%) measured over the 52 week period. Detailed 
information on the targets can be found on page 106 of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
EBITDA at £130.5m was above the minimum threshold levels  
at which payments against this financial target were triggered  
for the Executive Directors.
As a result, the EBITDA portion of the annual bonus paid out  
at 27.2% of maximum (equal to 20.4% of salary).
The stretching free cash flow targets were not met and so no 
portion of this bonus will be paid. Free cash flow after interest, 
tax and before acquisitions was £64.6m (FY16: £77.8m), with  
a decline in the cash conversion rate to 49% (FY16: 62%) as a 
result of increased capital expenditure and cash working capital 
requirements compared with the prior year.
Further information can be found on page 106 of our Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Share incentive plans
Executive Directors participated in the PSP and the CSOP  
for the first time in FY17. As set out in our Policy in 2014,  
the main Long-Term Incentive Plan for Executive Directors was  
the PSP, although in line with the approach for all our colleague 
participants, we delivered an element of this under the CSOP  
to take advantage of HMRC-approved tax savings. The awards 
were made subject to the following targets, to be measured  
over three financial years (FY17 to FY19):
• 10% of the total award will vest for earnings per share (EPS) 
growth of 5% per annum, rising to 75% for EPS growth of 12.5% 
per annum; and
• 6.25% of the total award will vest for median TSR performance 
against the FTSE 350 UK General Retail Index, rising to 25%  
for upper quartile TSR performance against the Index.
Matching Awards held by the Executive Directors under the 2014 
Co-Investment plan awards vested as to performance in May 
2017. The vested awards become exercisable in tranches, 
subject to continued employment, between May 2017 and  
March 2019. Only part of the EPS portion of the awards will 
vest. Further details are set out on page 106 of the Annual  
Report on Remuneration.

Governance Remuneration review
The Committee gave consideration to the remuneration 
arrangements for Ian Kellett following his appointment to the 
role of Group CEO. There were no changes to his variable pay 
framework or benefit entitlement, however, the Committee 
took the opportunity to reflect the promotion and significantly 
increased scope of his responsibilities at this time by repositioning 
his salary to £475,000 with effect from 4 April 2016.
In October, the Committee recommended to the Board the 
approval of an appropriate CFO remuneration package to the 
Board to achieve the appointment of his successor and the 
Board was delighted to secure Mike Iddon as the Group CFO. 
Details of his package, which is within the approved policy  
limits, can be found on page 104.
FY18 salary review
The Committee has reviewed the salary levels of the Executive 
Directors and has concluded that an increase of 2% will be  
made to the Executive Directors in line with those made to other 
colleagues. All salary increases take effect from 31 March 2017.
Our colleagues
We have always recognised the importance of widespread share 
ownership and it remains an integral part of our culture. This reflects 
the principle that our colleagues are central to the achievement of 
our strategy and we believe that share ownership enhances loyalty 
and engagement. In keeping with this ethos, the Committee 
approved a further grant of a discretionary share award under 
the CSOP to every eligible colleague in the Group in June 2016.
Following on from the successful launch of the Company’s 
Sharesave plan in 2014, the Committee doubled the monthly 
sum that colleagues are permitted to save from £250 to  
£500 for the 2015 plan and this continued at this level  
for the 2016 plan. 
The Committee intends to grant awards to every eligible colleague 
in the Group under the new RSP following its approval at the AGM.
Resolutions
At our AGM on 11 July 2017 we will be asking shareholders 
to pass resolutions to approve:
• Our new Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
• Our Directors’ Remuneration Report which sets out how  
we have applied our existing policy during FY17.
• Our new LTIP in line with the new Directors Remuneration Policy.
I would like to thank the shareholders who took part in the 
consultations on our new Directors Remuneration Policy and we 
hope that all of our shareholders will support these resolutions.
Yours faithfully
Paul Moody
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Our new Directors Remuneration Policy
Strategy
• To align with our programme of Group  
wide simplification.
• To have incentives that are appropriate for 
our business for the next three years as we 
focus on delivering long-term, sustainable 
returns, to investors. 
Culture
• To adopt a ‘bottom-up’ approach

for our colleagues and can be applied 
to our executives.
• To support our ongoing desire to embed 
share ownership across the organisation.
• To assist with succession planning.
Retention
• To simplify and therefore enhance 
perceived value of awards and thereby 
reduce flight risk.
Shareholders
• To deliver better value to shareholders  
for their reward spend by:
 – Improving perceived value;
 – Creating stronger alignment with 
shareholders; and 
 – Increasing focus on long term  
sustainable value creation
In summary, the objectives of our new  
Directors remuneration policy are:

Baseline underpin 
An absolute TSR baseline performance underpin would apply during the first three 
financial years below which no vesting of restricted stock awards would occur.
• Leavers 
The default position remains that leavers would lose their unvested shares awards, 
subject to certain ‘good leaver’ circumstances.
• Change of control  
The default position remains that the Committee will determine whether and to what 
extent unvested awards shall vest, taking into account all relevant factors including 
Company performance, the period of time elapsed since the date of the grant and 
the interests of our shareholders.
• Pension  
Change pension policy to permit contributions up to 15% of base salary to take 
into account the roll out of pension increases across the organisation within the 
next three years. Nevertheless, the pension contributions for the CEO and CFO 
remain unchanged at 9% pa.
Annual bonus
• Pay-out linked to achievement 
of robust and challenging annual 
performance targets.
• Full disclosure of bonus – 
commitment to disclosing all target 
ranges on a retrospective basis at the 
end of the financial year in question.
Underpin
• The absolute TSR underpin 
guarantees baseline performances 
below which awards will not vest.
• Serves as a security mechanism 
to prevent pay-outs for poor 
performance.
Share price
• Share price inherently links pay 
to performance.
• Build up of shareholding and 
long term vesting horizon incentives 
senior colleagues to increase focus 
on long term, sustainable 
performance.
Summary of the 
proposed changes are:

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
Governance Our new Directors Remuneration Policy continued
Rationale for change
We believe that this new, simpler approach is right for 
Pets at Home, for the following reasons:
• Our culture is built on a cohesive team approach and 
widespread shareholding amongst colleagues. We believe  
in having a consistent approach to remuneration rather than 
designing alternative plans for our Executive Directors. As  
an example of the consistency in our approach, the pension 
provision for our executives is in line with that of the wider 
colleague population.
• The current performance share plans, which are based on the 
achievement of EPS and relative TSR targets, are perceived  
by colleagues as overly complex and with limited line of sight 
between performance and reward.
A simpler approach, which offers the ability to build up 
meaningful shareholding over the long term would provide 
stronger alignment, with our focus on delivering long term 
sustainable returns to investors and provide a greater retention 
and incentive effect for our senior employees given the long 
maturity curve of our investment in space and services.
It also aligns with a much wider programme of simplification 
across the Group as a whole, from how we operate our supply 
chain and stores, right through to our Support Offices and has 
the benefit of being based on intrinsic as opposed to extraneous 
performance factors.
As an established FTSE 250 company, we focus on delivering 
long term, sustainable returns to investors. We do not feel that  
a remuneration package that features elevated rewards linked  
to very high stretch targets aligns with our long term approach. 
1. Directors’ Remuneration Policy
a) Policy Report
The following section pages 94 to 104 sets out our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (Policy) for all of the Executive Directors 
and the Non-Executive Directors (as well as any individuals who 
may become Directors whilst this Policy is in effect) for approval 
by shareholders at the Company’s AGM in July 2017. A copy 
of our current policy that was approved by shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM in September 2014 can be found on the 
Group’s website (https:/ /investors.petsathome.com). 
Subject to shareholder approval, the new Policy is intended  
to remain in effect for three years from the 2017 AGM. There 
are four substantive differences between the previous policy 
approved by shareholders in September 2014 and the 
proposed Policy: (i) our current long term incentive plans will 
be replaced with a time-vested restricted stock plan (RSP) with 
a baseline underpin, (ii) the maximum package opportunity for 
variable pay will be reduced from 250% of salary to 175% of 
salary per annum and (iii) there will be an increase in the 
vesting horizon for our new long term incentive plan, so  
that awards vest over three to five years and (iv) the pension 
policy maximum has been increased to permit contributions 
of up to 15% of base salary (in line with the planned roll out 
of pension increases across the organisation within the next 
three years).
No new awards will be made under the Co-Investment Plan, 
PSP or CSOP. For the outstanding PSP and CSOP awards that 
still have performance years to run in 2017, 2018 and 2019, 
performance will be assessed against unchanged targets.
The Policy explains the purpose and principles underlying the 
structure of remuneration packages and how the Policy links 
remuneration to the achievement of sustained high 
performance and long term value creation.
Overall remuneration is structured and set at levels to enable 
us to recruit and retain high calibre colleagues necessary for 
business success whilst ensuring that our reward structure and 
performance measures should be aligned to the strategy and 
be simple to communicate to participants and shareholders.
A significant portion of the package remains performance 
related via the annual bonus plan. Remuneration has been set 
taking into account practice within the FTSE 250 and practice 
at other retail companies.

Base salary 
Purpose and 
link to strategy
The Company provides 
competitive salaries 
suitable to attract and 
retain individuals of the 
right calibre to develop 
and execute the 
business strategy.
Operation
• Base salaries are paid in cash 
and are pensionable.
• Base salaries are reviewed annually, typically 
at the March Remuneration Committee meeting. 
Any changes are usually with effect from the start 
of the next financial year. The Committee takes into 
consideration a number of factors when setting 
salaries, including (but not limited to):
 – Size and scope of the individual’s 
responsibilities;
 – The individual’s skills, experience 
and performance;
 – Typical salary levels for comparable roles 
within appropriate pay comparators including 
practice for retail companies and the broader 
FTSE 250; and
 – Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Maximum opportunity
• Whilst there is no maximum salary level, 
any increases will normally be broadly in line 
with the wider colleague population.
• Higher increases may be made under certain 
circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion. 
For example, this may include:
 – Increase in the scope and/or responsibility 
of the individual’s role; and
 – Development of the individual within the role.
Annual base salaries for the Executive Directors 
are set out on page 104 of this report.

and execute the 
business strategy.
Operation
• The Company provides a range of benefits, 
which may include:
 – a company car (or cash equivalent)
 – life assurance
 – permanent health insurance
 – private medical insurance.
• These benefits are not pensionable.
• Other benefits may be offered from time to time,  
if considered appropriate by the Committee and 
consistent with the Company’s overriding purpose 
for offering such benefits.
The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, 
such as relocation support, expatriate allowances, 
temporary living and transportation expenses, in 
line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice 
for other senior executives.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any 
tax-approved all colleague share plans operated by 
the Company on the same basis as other eligible 
colleagues such as the SAYE scheme (set out 
below on page 97).
Maximum opportunity
• The cost to the Company of providing other benefits 
may vary depending on, for example, market 
practice and the cost of insuring certain benefits.
• The Committee keeps the level of benefit 
provision under regular review.
Details of the current benefit provision for the 
Executive Directors is set out on page 111 of 
this report.

performance 
indicators which 
are critical to 
the delivery of 
our business

Operation
• Delivery will normally be in cash

• Performance measures are set annually 
and pay-out levels are determined by the 
Committee after the year-end, based on 
performance against those targets during 
the relevant financial year.
• Awards are subject to malus and clawback 
provisions where there has been a material 
misstatement of audited results; serious 
financial irregularity; any circumstances 
justifying summary dismissal of a participant 
from his office or employment with any Group 
Company including, but not limited to, 
dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or breach 
of trust; 
any material breach of a participant’s terms

Maximum 
opportunity
The maximum bonus 
opportunity is 100%

Performance measures
• Each year, the Committee 
determines the measures and 
weightings within the following 
parameters:
 – At least 75% of the annual bonus 
will be based on financial 
performance measures; and
 – No more than 25% of the annual 
bonus will be based on 
performance against non-financial 
measures, including for example, 
individual and strategic objectives.
• The Committee ensures that targets 
are appropriately stretching in the 
context of the business plan and 
that there is an appropriate balance 
between incentivising Executive 
Directors to meet financial targets 
for the year and to deliver specific 
non-financial goals. This balance 
allows the Committee to effectively 
reward performance against the key 
elements of our strategy.
• The Company may, in the context 
of the underlying business strategy, 
amend the performance measures 
or targets.

Performance measures
• There are no performance targets

• A baseline performance underpin 
applies, which requires absolute TSR 
performance to be positive over the 
first three years of the vesting period. 
If the underpin is not achieved, the 
awards lapse in full. 
• The plan rules stipulate that the 
Committee may amend the 
performance measures or underpin 
in exceptional circumstances where 
it considers that they are no longer 
appropriate. If this discretion was 
used, we would consult with 
shareholders and the rationale 
would be clearly explained in the 
remuneration report.
Changes
• The Co-Investment 
Plan, PSP and CSOP 
have been replaced 
with a simplified plan 
for awards to be 
made in FY18 
onwards.
• A 50% discount has 
been applied to the 
previous policy 
maximum of 150% 
of base salary per

Governance Legacy matters
The Committee will honour remuneration related commitments 
to former, current and future Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors (including the exercise of any discretions available  
to the Committee in relation to such commitments) where the 
terms were agreed prior to them becoming a Director (provided 
that, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming an Executive Director 
or Non-Executive Director of the Company) and/or where the 
terms were agreed and commitments made in accordance  
with the policy approved by the Company’s shareholders in 
September 2014, and which become due and payable or 
otherwise vest during the period covered by this Policy.
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award  
over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time  
the award is granted. This includes allowing the vesting of 
outstanding awards under the Co-Investment Plan, CSOP  
and PSP, the terms of which are detailed in the previous policy 
that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM 
in September 2014, a copy of which can be found on the  
Group’s website (https:/ /investors.petsathome.com). 
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The Policy for our Executive Directors is designed in line with 
the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin 
remuneration for the wider Company. The Company believes 
in having a consistent approach to remuneration rather than 
designing alternative plans for our Executive Directors.
All our reward arrangements are built around the common 
objectives and principles outlined below:
• Aligned incentives – A meaningful proportion of remuneration 
is based on performance. Individuals are incentivised towards 
consistent financial and non-financial business goals and 
objectives, in addition to appropriate individual goals. 
• Colleagues as shareholders – Our culture is built on a cohesive 
team approach and widespread shareholding amongst 
colleagues which we believe enhances our long term 
sustainable success by promoting stewardship and alignment 
amongst a wide colleague participation group
• Simplification – our Policy aligns with a much wider programme 
of simplification across the Group as a whole, from how we 
operate our supply chain and stores, right through to our 
Support Offices.
Our new Directors Remuneration Policy continued
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 (b) Recruitment policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the 
appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component and which 
remain unchanged from the previous Policy.
Element Policy and operation
Overall • The Committee’s approach when considering the overall 
remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member 
of the Board from an external party is to take account of the 
Executive Director’s remuneration package in their prior role, 
the market positioning of the remuneration package, and 
to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment 
of the individual.
• Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the 
business, in addition to considering the matters detailed 
above for external candidates, the normal policy of the 
Company is that any legacy arrangements would be 
honoured in line with the original terms and conditions.
Fixed 
elements
(Base salary, 
pension and 
other benefits)
• We recognise that salary levels drive other elements 
of the package and would therefore seek to pay a salary 
which is competitive, but no more than necessary to 
secure the individual.
• The Executive Director would be eligible to participate in  
our benefit and pension plans, including coverage under  
all Executive Director and colleague pension and benefit 
programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions 
of such plans, as may be amended by the Company from 
time to time.
• The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including 
relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living 
and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing 
mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short term 
incentives
• The individual will be eligible to participate in the annual 
bonus plan, in accordance with the rules and terms of the 
plan in operation at the time.
• The maximum level of opportunity will be no greater than that 
set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. 100% of base salary).
Long term 
incentives
• The individual will be eligible to participate in the RSP, in 
accordance with the rules and terms of the plan in operation 
at the time. 
• The maximum level of opportunity will be no greater than that 
set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. 75%  
of base salary).
Buy-out awards • The Committee will consider what buy-out awards (if any) 
are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of 
a new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes 
an assessment of the awards which would be forfeited 
on leaving their current employer.
• The Committee will seek to structure any buy-out 
awards such that overall they are no more generous 
in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards 
due to be forfeited.
• In determining the quantum and structure of these 
commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly 
equivalent value and replicate, as far as practicable, 
the timing and performance requirements of the 
awards forfeited.
• Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s 
existing long term incentive plans to the extent possible, 
although awards may also be granted outside of these  
plans if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
• In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made 
in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms.
• If promotion is part way through the year, an additional 
top-up award may be made to bring the Executive 
Director’s opportunity to a level that is appropriate 
in the circumstances.

Governance (c) Service contracts and loss of office arrangements
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. On principle, it is 
the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering payments 
in the event of a loss of office is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for the loss of office, Company 
and individual performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
The key employment terms and conditions of the current Executive Directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, are set out below 
and remain unchanged from the previous policy:
Area Policy and operation
Notice period • The service contract for Ian Kellett provides for a notice 
period of 12 months from the Company and six months 
from the individual 
• The service contract for Mike Iddon provides for a 
notice period from both the Company and the individual 
of six months.
• New Executive Directors will be appointed on service contracts 
that have a notice period of not more than 12 months for both 
the Company and the individual.
• The Committee considers this policy provides an appropriate 
balance between the need to retain the services of key 
individuals for the benefit of the business and the need 
to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event 
of termination.
Contractual 
payments
• Executive Directors’ service contracts allow for termination with 
contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of 
payment in lieu of notice (PILON), at the Company’s discretion. 
Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances 
dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not required 
for their full notice period.
• Neither notice nor PILON will be given in the event of gross 
misconduct.
• Payment in lieu of notice will be limited to base salary 
and contractual benefits for the relevant notice period.
• There is no contractual entitlement to a payment under 
the annual bonus in respect of the notice period. 
• Service contracts allow for mitigation if the individual finds 
alternative employment.
Short-term 
incentives
• The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive  
for any portion of the notice period not served.
• Where an Executive Director leaves office after the end of  
a performance year but before the payment is made, the 
executive will remain eligible for an annual bonus for that 
performance year, subject to the normal assessment of 
performance achieved over the period.
• Where an Executive Director leaves office during a performance 
year, any bonus would be at the Committee’s absolute 
discretion and would take into account performance and  
the time served during the period
• No bonus will be paid in the event of gross misconduct.
Our new Directors Remuneration Policy continued
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100 Area Policy and operation
Long term 
incentives
• The treatment of unvested long term incentive awards 
is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
CIP
• Treatment under the CIP is dependent on the period elapsed 
since the IPO.
a) Within the first 24 months following admission
• Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily 
resigns less than 18 months following the date of admission, 
they will forfeit their Invested Shares and their Matching 
Awards. This period ended on 17 March 2016.
b) Between 24 months and 36 months following admission
• Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily 
resigns between 18 months and 30 months following the date 
of admission (and completes at least two years’ service by 
working his notice period or being put on garden leave, or would 
have done so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested 
Shares and may retain a portion of their Matching Award 
subject to achievement of performance targets measured 
over the first two years of the performance period. This period 
ended on 17 March 2017.
c) On or after 36 months following admission
• Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily 
resigns on or after 30 months following the date of admission 
(and completes at least three years’ service by working his 
notice period or being put on garden leave, or would have done 
so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested Shares 
and, if a good leaver (defined as under the PSP) also their 
vested Matching Award, unless the Committee determines 
otherwise. Matching Awards vest after three, four and five 
years, subject to achievement of performance conditions 
at year three. 
Any participant who is dismissed for reasons of fraud or 
negligence will forfeit their Invested Shares and Matching 
Awards in full.
CSOP, PSP, RSP and SAYE
• Under the CSOP, PSP and RSP, the default position is for both 
vested (to the extent not yet exercised) and unvested awards  
to lapse upon a loss of office event.
• Where an individual is determined to be a “good leaver” 
(which includes for reasons of death, illness, injury, disability, 
retirement, sale or transfer out of the Group or any other reason 
at the discretion of the Committee) the Committee may allow 
vested awards (to the extent not yet exercised) to be retained 
and unvested awards to subsist until the relevant vesting date, 
subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions/financial 
underpin and pro-rated for time served.
• Alternatively, the Committee may, at its discretion, allow 
unvested awards to vest at an earlier date, having regard to  
the achievement of performance conditions/financial underpin 
to that date and the period of time that has passed since the 
date of grant. The Committee may choose to apply no reduction 
in the amount vesting if it is considered appropriate given the 
particular circumstances.
• Under the SAYE, the default position is for unvested awards 
to lapse upon a loss of office event. 
• Where an individual is determined to be a “good leaver” 
in accordance with HMRC regulations (which include for 
reasons of death) unvested awards may vest pro-rata by 
reference to the period of time that has elapsed since the 
date of the grant and up to six months following the leaver 
event (12 months in the case of death).
Change in 
control
• The Committee’s policy is that service contracts should not 
provide for additional compensation on severance as a result 
of a change in control.
• Under the CSOP, the PSP, the Co-Investment Plan and the RSP, 
the Committee will determine whether and to what extent 
awards shall vest, taking into account all relevant factors 
including Company performance, the period of time elapsed 
since the date of grant and the interests of our shareholders.
• Under the SAYE, awards shall vest pro-rata by reference to 
the period of time that has elapsed since the date of grant 
and up to six months following the change of control.
Malus and 
clawback
Annual bonus payments and long term incentive awards (but 
not including SAYE awards) are subject to malus and clawback 
for a period beginning on the date of award and ending two years 
following vesting in the event of:
• a material misstatement of audited results; 
• serious financial irregularity; 
• any circumstances justifying summary dismissal of a 
participant from his office or employment with any Group 
Company including, but not limited to, dishonesty, fraud, 
misrepresentation or breach of trust;  
• any material breach of a participant’s terms and conditions 
of employment; and/or any material violation of Company 
policy, rules of regulation.  
• Malus and clawback will continue to apply to any bonus 
payments or awards retained by Leavers and/or on a Change 
of Control.

Governance External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold an external appointment 
with the prior consent of the Board. Any fees may be retained 
by the individual.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the 
Board, have letters of appointment which set out their duties 
and responsibilities. They do not have service contracts.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below 
and remain unchanged from the previous policy:
Provision Policy
Period • Initially appointed for a period of three years, 
subject to annual review and notice.
• In line with the UK Code, all Directors will seek 
annual re-appointment by shareholders at the AGM.
Appointment 
terms
• Three months’ notice by either the Company 
or the Non-Executive Director.
• Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
of the Board are not entitled to compensation 
on leaving the Board.
Fees • As set out on page 111.
Expiry of 
current term
• See page 76 for details of the expiry of the 
current term of Non-Executive Directors’ letters 
of appointment.
Availability of documentation
Service contracts and letters of appointment for all Directors 
are available for inspection by any person at our registered office 
in Handforth, Cheshire. They will also be available for inspection 
during the 30 minutes prior to the start of our AGM to be held 
in Manchester on 11 July 2017.
(d) Illustration of the remuneration policy
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure 
that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery 
of stretching short term and long term performance targets, 
aligned with the creation of sustainable shareholder value. 
The Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be 
received under different performance outcomes to ensure that 
this is appropriate in the context of the performance delivered 
and the value added for shareholders.
The charts on page 103 provide illustrative values of the 
remuneration package for Executive Directors under three 
assumed performance scenarios under the proposed RSP 
together with a comparison with the previous PSP.
These charts are for illustrative purposes only and actual 
outcomes may differ from those shown.

(e) Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
As per the Committee’s terms of reference, we also review the 
pay and conditions of colleagues at levels below the Executive 
Directors. This includes approving the design of, and determining 
targets for any performance related pay schemes such as the 
bonus scheme operated by the Company and approving the total 
annual payments made under such schemes. The Committee 
is also consulted concerning any major changes in colleague 
benefit and pay structures throughout the Group.
The remuneration package for all colleagues (including the 
Executive Directors) is reviewed on an annual basis and a 
consistent approach is applied at all levels. As part of the annual 
salary and benefits review, the Company takes into account 
industry standards, future legislative framework (including 
the national minimum wage, the national living wage, the 
Apprenticeship levy and the Gender Pay Gap reporting 
requirements) and the financial and economic environment 
of the Group both internally and externally. The annual salary 
and benefits review is presented to the Committee with 
recommendations on remuneration throughout the colleague 
base, including a proposed salary increase to be applied to all 
colleagues’ wages, including the Executive Directors. As such, the 
Committee has regard to this Group-wide annual review process 
when setting its remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
Whilst our colleagues are not directly consulted as part of the 
process of determining pay, the output from colleague surveys, 
including our internal “We’re All Ears” and “Paws4Thought” 
surveys, is considered when carrying out the annual salary  
and benefits review.
A significant number of our colleagues are also shareholders 
and so are able to express their views in the same way as 
other shareholders.
(f) Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has consulted extensively with the 
Company’s largest shareholders on the proposed Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. 
We were pleased that all of our majority shareholders 
were very supportive of our remuneration principles and the 
proposed design. 
We were grateful for the constructive feedback provided 
throughout the process which was taken on board in our final 
proposals. The Committee remains committed to ongoing 
dialogue with the Company’s shareholder base. 
We will continue to monitor shareholder views when evaluating 
and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and we commit to 
consulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes 
to our Policy.
(g) Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set 
out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative 
purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment.

1  Shares were awarded on 17 March 2014 under the Co-Investment Plan. Based on performance in the period March 2014 to March 2017 the performance conditions for these shares were 
measured and the Committee determined that 16.8% of the awards would vest. The vested award become exercisable in equal tranches, subject to continued employment, between May 2017 
and March 2019. Only the value for a third of the tranche has been shown in the figure for FY17 since only a third can be exercised. The value is based on the share price of 198.19p being the 
average share price over the last three months of the performance period being the period from 1 January to 30 March 2017.
2 Mike was appointed on 17 October 2016 and his remuneration has been pro-rated from 17 October 2016 to 30 March 2017 including his annual bonus payment.
3 Mike Iddon did not receive a Co-Investment Plan Award in 2014 as this was prior to his joining the Company.
4  Nick resigned as a Director on 4 April 2016, however, he remained with the Group in an advisory role until 1 July 2016. The remuneration shown for FY17 includes payments up to 1 July 2016.
5 FY16 was a 53 week year and so the total single figure for FY16 contains the additional payment over and above the basic remuneration for the 53rd week.
6  Nick’s total remuneration in FY16 includes the 19.2% of the total Matching Award that he received under the Co-Investment Plan equal to £198,168 as detailed below. 
Base salary – corresponds to the amount received during the relevant financial year.
Benefits – corresponds to the taxable value of benefits received during the relevant financial year and principally includes company 
car (or cash equivalent), life assurance and permanent health insurance.
Pension – corresponds to either the amount contributed to personal pension plans or the cash value of the salary supplement 
received during the relevant financial year. Executive Directors receive a Company pension contribution worth 9% of their salary 
or a cash allowance where the annual allowance has been reached. 
Annual bonus – corresponds to the amount earned in respect of the relevant financial year. Details of how this was calculated 
are set out below.
Long term incentives – corresponds to the amount earned by the Executive Directors in respect of the relevant financial year. 
Details of how this was calculated are set out below.

Governance Annual Bonus
The maximum Annual Bonus opportunity for Executive Directors 
in respect of FY17 was 100% of base salary. 
The targets for the Annual Bonus for the financial year ended 
30 March 2017, and the extent to which they were achieved, 
are as set out below. For FY17, the annual bonus continued 
to be based on EBITDA (75%) and free cash flow (25%) and 
measured over a 52 week period.
The achievement of the EBITDA target is calculated on a 
straight-line basis between Minimum and Maximum EBITDA. 
The Committee considered that the targets were stretching 
and required Executive Directors to deliver performance which 
significantly exceeded business expectations to achieve 
full pay-out.
Performance metric Targets for 2014–2017 Performance against targets
EPS growth (hurdle) • 10% of the total award will vest for earnings per share

Long-term incentives
The following sets out details of the Committee’s determination 
of the performance conditions attaching to the Matching Awards 
granted under the March 2014 Co-Investment Plan for which the 
final year of performance was FY17. Awards become capable 
of exercise in equal one third tranches, subject to continued 
employment, between May 2017 and March 2019. Separate 
performance conditions applied to Early Leavers and these 
are detailed on page 107. 
Annual Report on Remuneration continued
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 106 Early Leavers
Nick Wood tendered his resignation on 4 April 2016 and 
accordingly, in line with the early leaver provisions of the plan 
rules, up to 20% of his total Matching Award under the Co-
Investment Plan was eligible to vest on his leaving date of 1 July 
2016, subject to EPS performance measured up to the end of 
FY16. Specifically, if EPS growth over the period from the FY14 
base year to the end of FY16 (measured over the 52 week 
period) was:
• Below 10% per annum, none of the total 
Matching Award would vest;
• 10% p.a., 10% of the total Matching Award would vest;
• Between 10% p.a. and 17.5% p.a., between 
10% and 20% of the total Matching Award would vest 
(on a straight-line basis); and
• Above 17.5% p.a., 20% of the total Matching Award would vest.
 
Diluted EPS on underlying trading for FY16 was 15.0p based 
on a profit after tax before exceptional items of £75,518,000 
for the 52 week period. As a result, EPS growth over this period 
was 16.9% p.a. and as a result 19.2% of Nick Wood’s Matching 
Award vested on 1 July 2016.
This equated to 83,264 shares with a value of £198,168 based 
on the closing share price of 238p on the point of vesting being 
1 July 2016. The figure has been included in FY16 since the 
performance metrics were measured up to 31 March 2016.

percentage of salary and the value is divided by the closing share 
price the day before the grants, being 259.7p for the award on 
9 June 2016 and 212.8p for the award on 29 November 2016.
The awards were made subject to the satisfaction of the 
following targets measured over a period of three financial 
years (FY17-FY19):
• 10% of the total award will vest for EPS growth of 5% per 
annum, rising to 75% for EPS growth of 12.5% per annum; and
• 6.25% of the total award will vest for median TSR performance 
against the FTSE 350 UK General Retail Index, rising to 25% 
for upper quartile TSR performance against the Index.
The EPS part of the awards lapses if the EPS hurdle is not met.
The TSR part of the award lapses if the TSR hurdle is not met.
In accordance with the Policy, the first £30,000 of the award 
made is under the CSOP with the remainder up to 125% 
of salary being made under the PSP.
(e) Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office were made during 
the financial year.
Leaving arrangements for Nick Wood 
Nick Wood resigned from the Board with effect from 4 April 
2016. To ensure a smooth transition and provide support to 
the new CEO, he remained with the Group in an advisory role 
until 1 July 2016. Nick did not receive a termination payment.
During the period of his notice that he worked full-time, Nick 
received his salary and contractual benefits up to his date of 
termination, being 1 July 2016. He did not receive any further 
salary and contractual benefits for the period of his 12 month 
notice that remained after 1 July 2016 and he did not receive 
any Annual Bonus for FY17.
All payments made to him in respect of FY17 are reported 
in the single figure of remuneration.
Nick’s Matching Award under the Co-Investment Plan was treated 
in line with the early leaver provisions of the plan rules. Under 
these, time pro-rating was applied such that a maximum of 20% 
of Nick’s Matching Award was eligible to vest, subject to the 
satisfaction of the EPS performance targets at the end of FY16. 
As set out on page 107 , performance against these targets as 
at the end of FY16 was such that 19.2% of the total award vested 
on Nick’s leaving the Company’s service. 
(f) Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors during the year.
(g) Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee believes that colleague share ownership is 
an important means to support long term commitment to the 
Company and the alignment of colleague interests with those 
of shareholders.
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of 
200% of base salary, which should be built up over a period of five 
years. A similar policy applies to the Executive Management Team. 
The Committee reviews share ownership levels annually.

3  Nick Wood resigned as an Executive Director on 4 April 2016, however, he continued in the business until 1 July 2016. His payment in FY17 relates to the period from 1 April 2016 to 1 July 2016.
4  Under the early leaver provisions of the plan rules, Nick Wood received 19.2% of his total Matching Award under the Co-Investment Plan, as shown in the single figure table. Given that 
this included time pro rating, with performance against the performance conditions being at 96% of maximum, the latter is shown here and the value of £198,168 of the Matching Awards 
(as calculated under paragraph b above) is included in the single figure of remuneration. 
(i) Percentage change in remuneration of the Group CEO
The table below sets out the increase in total remuneration of the CEO and that of all colleagues:

1  The Committee considers that EBITDA is an important KPI for the Company and provides 
shareholders with additional context as to how the business has performed financially in 
the last two years. The figures for FY16 are based on a 53 week period to 31 March 2016 
and the figures for FY17 are based on a 52 week period to 26 March 2015.
(k) Dilution limits
In accordance with the IA Guidelines, the Company can satisfy 
awards under its colleague share plans with new issue shares 
up to maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten 
year period and within this 10% limit, the Company can only 
issue 5% of its issued share capital to satisfy awards under 
discretionary plans (i.e. the CSOP, PSP and new RSP). 
(l) External appointments
Executive Directors are entitled to accept one external 
appointment outside the Company with the consent of the 
Board. Any fees received may be retained by the Director.
As at the date of this report, neither of the Executive Directors 
held an external appointment for which they receive a fee.
(m) Non-Executive Directors – letters of appointment
A summary of the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment is contained on page 102 of the Policy.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 110 3. Statement of implementation for FY18
This section provides an overview of how the Committee 
is proposing to implement our Policy in FY18.
Base salary
Base salaries were reviewed with effect from 31 March 2017 
and the salaries of the Group CEO and Group CFO were 
increased by 2% which mirrors the increase generally awarded 
to colleagues in the Group.
Executive Director Base salary
Chief Executive Officer £484,500
Chief Financial Officer £346,800
Benefits
The Committee sets benefits in line with the policy set out 
on page 95 of the Appendix. There are no changes proposed 
to the benefit framework in FY18.
Pensions
Despite the change in pension policy to permit contributions up 
to 15% of base salary, there is no increase proposed to salary 
supplement levels for the Executive Directors in FY18. The table 
below shows salary supplements for FY18.
Executive Director % of salary
Ian Kellett 9%
Mike Iddon 9%
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors 
in respect of FY18 will remain at 100% of base salary.
The annual bonus framework will be in line with that presented 
in the policy table on page 96. As highlighted in the Chairman’s 
letter, during the year the Committee reviewed the annual bonus 
framework for FY17, with a view to ensuring that it remains 
appropriate for the business.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate at this time to 
retain the framework that was put in place for FY17, so for FY18 
the annual bonus will continue to be based on EBITDA (75%) and 
free cash flow (25%). The achievement of the EBITDA target for 
the Executive Team will continue to be calculated on a straight-
line basis between minimum and maximum EBITDA.
Although the targets remain commercially sensitive at this time, 
we will provide shareholders with full disclosure of the EBITDA 
and free cash flow targets in next year’s report.
As for FY17, the annual bonus will be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions. This provides the Committee with the 
ability to take back amounts previously paid out for a period 
of up to two years under certain circumstances, including 
misstatement and misconduct.
Long term incentive awards
It is proposed that awards under the RSP will be made in FY18 
at 75% of salary for Executive Directors in line with the new 
Remuneration Policy.
Sharesave
The Company intends to operate the Sharesave scheme again 
for FY18. The maximum monthly savings will be retained at 
£500 per month. Executive Directors are eligible to participate.
Non-Executive Director remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors have been reviewed 
and they will remain at the same level for FY18. The table below 
shows the Non-Executive Director fee structure for FY18:
FY18
Chairman of the Board (all-inclusive fee) £200,000
Basic Non-Executive Director fee £50,000
Board Committee Chairman fee £10,000
Deputy Chairman £20,000
There are no fees paid for membership of Board Committees.
The Remuneration Committee
Shareholder context for the Committee’s activities
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
executive remuneration matters from Willis Towers Watson (WTW). 
WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, 
as such, voluntarily operate under the code of conduct in relation 
to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee 
has reviewed the advice provided by WTW during the year and 
is comfortable that it has been objective and independent. 
Total fees received by WTW in relation to the remuneration 
advice provided to the Committee during FY17 amounted to 
£58,034 based on the required time commitment. 
During FY17 the Committee also received support from Travers 
Smith LLP on the terms of the discretionary and all colleague 
share plans.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from 2016):
The Risk Our response
Carrying value of goodwill 
£979.8m; 2016: £964.9m
Refer to page 83 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 127 
(accounting policy) and page 
143 (financial disclosures).
Forecast based valuation 
Goodwill is a significant item within the 
Group’s balance sheet; the valuation 
of which is sensitive to changes in key 
assumptions. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved 
in forecasting and discounting future cash 
flows, which are the basis of the assessment 
of recoverability, goodwill is one of the key 
judgemental areas within our audit. 
Our procedures included: 
•  Control design: Evaluating the Group’s budgeting procedures 
and methodology upon which the forecasts are based;
•  Our sector experience: Using our own valuation specialist to 
assist us in evaluating the discount rate used by the Group;
•  Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing assumptions and 
methodologies used by the Group to externally derived data as 
well as our own assessment, using knowledge of the company 
and sector, of key inputs such as projected economic growth, 
cost inflation and discount rates; 
•  Sensitivity analysis: Performing break-even analysis to 
understand the sensitivity of the conclusions reached to 
changes in assumptions;
•  Comparing valuations: Comparing the sum of projected cash 
flows and book value to the Group’s market capitalisation 
to assess the reasonableness of those cash flows; and
•  Assessing transparency: Evaluating the adequacy of the 
Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of 
the impairment assessment to changes in key assumptions.
Carrying value of inventory 
£56.4m; 2016: £52.5m
Refer to page 83 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 128 
(accounting policy) and page 
144 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate 
The Group has significant levels of inventory 
and estimates are made in the valuation 
of slow moving and obsolete inventories, 
some of which have a limited shelf life. 
Furthermore there is uncertainty over 
changes in consumer preferences and 
spending patterns, which are primarily driven 
by wider trends in the pet product industry 
as well as seasonality, but which could 
impact the saleability of inventory. 
There is a recoverability risk associated with 
new product launches and the judgement 
required in forecasting demand, including 
the possible change in demand between the 
time the inventory order is placed with the 
supplier and making the product available for 
sale, which can lead to obsolete inventory. 
Given the level of judgement and estimation 
involved carrying value of inventory is 
considered to be a key audit risk.
Our procedures included: 
•  Control design: Evaluating the Group’s controls designed 
to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories; 
•  Our sector experience: Assessing the appropriateness of 
the Group’s inventory provisioning policies based on our 
understanding of the business, the industry and the accuracy 
of previous provisioning estimates; and
•  Tests of detail: Comparing the cost of inventory lines and 
average sales price in the six weeks to 30 March 2017 
to highlight negative margin lines and comparing the value 
to the Group’s calculation for provision at the year-end date.  
A comparison, by product, of inventory levels to sales data 
to assess whether slow moving and obsolete inventories had 
been appropriately identified and provided for by the Group 
based on the provisioning policy.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the Members of Pets at Home Group Plc only 3.  Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £3.75m (2016: £3.5m), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, of which it represents 3.9% (2015: 3.8%). 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £180,000 (2016: £175,000), 
in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We performed audits for group reporting purposes at 3 (2016: 3) of the Group’s 9 (2016: 7) reporting components, and a review 
of financial information, including enquiry, at one more component of a veterinary referrals centre acquired within the year. The latter 
was not individually significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but we performed a review of financial 
information due to the acquisition having been made in the year. 
The level of coverage from audits for group reporting purposes and review of the veterinary specialist referral component are 
illustrated below. 
For the remaining component, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement within these components. 
The audits of components for group reporting purposes were performed by both the group audit team and component auditors 
and the review was performed by component auditors. The group team instructed the component auditors as to the significant areas 
to be covered, which included the relevant risks of material misstatement detailed above, and set out the information required to be 
reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team approved the component materiality range of £2.5m to £3.0m (2016: 
£2.25m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the businesses within the Group. 
Telephone conferences and meetings were held with component auditors that were not physically visited in order to assess the audit 
risk and strategy. At these meetings, the findings reported to the group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work 
required by the group team was then performed by the component auditor.

Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and from reading

• we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5.  We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

6.  We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the Annual Report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that 
they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or
• the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.

1 Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated 
financial statements.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken advantage of the 
exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair 
value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union. New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
1.2 Measurement convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair 
value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale. Non-current 
assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.3 Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Strategic Report. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial 
Officer’s Review. In addition, note 22 to the financial statements includes the Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; 
its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on financial 
covenants. 
The Directors believe the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
1.4 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into 
consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing 
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
Investment in veterinary practices
The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies, which are accounted for as joint venture arrangements. 
The veterinary practices were established under terms that require mutual agreement between the Group and the joint venture partner, and that 
do not give the Group power over decision making to affect its exposure to, or the extent of, the returns from its involvement with the practices 
and therefore are not consolidated in these financial statements. Further, the Group is not entitled to profits, losses, or any surplus on winding 
up or disposal of the veterinary practices, and as such no participatory interest is recognised. 
The investments have been equity accounted for in the Group’s financial statements in accordance with IAS 28.10. As the Group’s shares are 
non-participatory, and therefore the Group does not share in any profits, losses or other distribution of value from the joint venture Company, 
the fair value of the investment on initial recognition does not change, subject to impairment.
The Group’s category of shareholding in the veterinary practices entitle the Group to charge management fees for support services provided. 
For further details see note 15.

1.5 Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation 
that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s 
presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. 
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. 
Functional currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional currency and have been rounded to the nearest 
thousand.
1.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions: 
(a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or Group); and 
(b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation 
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed 
amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the 
legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts in 
relation to those shares. 
1.7 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities
Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items 
such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective 
interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 126
Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent change in fair value 
is recognised in profit or loss.
1.8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being 
hedged (see below).
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable 
forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. 
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses 
that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability 
assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged 
forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the 
above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss 
recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.9 Intra-group financial instruments
Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group are considered to be insurance arrangements and 
accounted for as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that a payment will be required under the guarantee.
1.10 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, 
plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold property – 50 years  
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment – 3-10 years 
Leasehold improvements – the term of the lease
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
1.11 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value 
at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.
Customer lists are amortised on a straight line basis over 10 years.
Software
Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis between two and seven years.

Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
1.12 Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is 
transferred to the Group. 
Acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010
For acquisitions on or after 26 March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
• the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
• the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
• the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, 
it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
are recognised in profit or loss. If contingent consideration is payable and is dependent on future employment, it is recognised as an expense over 
the relevant period as a cost of continuing employment.
A combined put and call option over non-controlling interests is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation 
of goodwill. Subsequent changes to fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Where a combined written put and call option exists over a non-controlling interest, and the conditions of the agreement provide the Group with 
present access to the benefits of the ownership of the non-controlling interest, then the acquisition is deemed to reflect 100% ownership and 
no non-controlling interest is recognised. A liability is recorded for the expected future acquisition of the non-controlling interest, and is recognised 
as part of the fair value of the consideration.
Where the written put and call option has an embedded valuation mechanism to reward and retain key individuals employed by the acquired 
business, who are also non-controlling shareholders, then the expected increase in the financial liability is charged to the Income Statement 
as employment costs evenly over the option period.
On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests and are 
entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate interest in the 
recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at their fair 
value at the acquisition date. 
Acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010 (date of adoption of IFRS)
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRS for first time adopters. In respect of acquisitions prior to 26 March 2010, 
goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.13 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in 
their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are 
based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by which 
non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.
1.14 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the weighted average cost principle and includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, 
less rebates and discounts.
Provision is made against specific inventory lines where market conditions identify an issue in recovering the full cost of that SKU (Stock Keeping 
Unit). The provision focuses on the age of inventory and applies a progressive provision against the gross inventory as the line continues to age. 
Where necessary further specific provision is made against inventory lines, when the ageing of provision is not deemed sufficient to carry the 
inventory at net realisable value.
To the extent that the ageing profile of gross inventory as calculated by this provision methodology results in a material provision, it will be disclosed 
as an estimate that may have an impact on subsequent periods. To the extent this is material, it will be disclosed in note 1.22.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 128
Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued 1.15 Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence 
that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, 
and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired asset continues 
to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease 
in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, and 
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value 
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are 
grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment 
testing, is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGU’s”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, 
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level at which goodwill 
is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
1.16 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have 
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an 
expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
Short term benefits
Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is 
recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments
A number of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries (including Directors) receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based 
payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is determined 
by the share price at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an external valuer based 
on a binomial model. In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price 
of the shares of Pets at Home Group Plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period 
based on the Company’s estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market 
condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
129
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.  
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of  
the modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for 
the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the 
date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the previous 
paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
1.17 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can 
be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by 
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability. 
1.18 Revenue and cost of sales
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts, brand match vouchers, coupons and excluding value 
added tax, sold in the ordinary course of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom. 
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty 
over recovery of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably. 
Revenue is recognised when transactions are completed in store or online.
Sale of goods in store and online
Retail revenue from the sale of goods is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Sale of goods represents 
food and accessories sold in store and online, with revenue recognised at the point of sale for store sales and at point of despatch for online orders. 
Gift vouchers and cards
Revenue from the sale of gift vouchers and cards is recognised at the time the voucher is redeemed.
VIP loyalty scheme
Under the VIP loyalty scheme, points are earned by customers upon the purchase of goods and services. These points can be converted by 
nominated charities into gift cards for redemption against goods and services in store and online. The sales value of the points earned under the 
VIP scheme are treated as deferred income; the sales are only recognised once the points have been redeemed by the charities. The points have 
no value to the customer.
Subscription services
Revenue for subscription services is recognised at the point of despatch of each incremental order. 
Provision of services
Revenue from the provision of services is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Provision of services 
represents veterinary group income, grooming revenue and insurance commissions, with revenue recognised upon provision of the service.
i) Veterinary group income
Veterinary group income represents revenue from the provision of veterinary services and income from the provision of veterinary administrative 
support services. Revenue received for the provision of veterinary services is recognised at the point of provision of the service and is recognised 
net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies 
for administrative support services is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of value added tax. 
ii) Grooming revenue
Grooming revenue is recognised net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers, at the point of provision of the service.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs, promotional income and rebate income received from suppliers, 
including costs to deliver administrative support services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items
Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated financial 
statements, are referred to as exceptional items. These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement category. 
Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 130
Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued Supplier income
A number of different types of supplier income are negotiated with suppliers via the joint business planning process, in connection with the purchase 
of goods for resale, the largest of which being overrider income and promotional income discussed below. The supplier income arrangements 
typically are not co-terminus with the Group’s financial period, instead running alongside the calendar year. Such income is only recognised when 
there is reasonable certainty that the conditions for recognition have been met by the Group, and the income can be measured reliably based on the 
terms of the contract. This income is recognised as a credit within gross margin to cost of sales and, to the extent that the rebate relates to unsold 
stock purchases, as a reduction in the cost of inventory. 
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each 
relevant supplier contract. The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables. 
Given the presence of the joint business plans, historic recoverability of accrued balances, and amounts are typically agreed with suppliers prior 
to recognition, supplier income is not considered to be an area of significant estimation that could impact on the following financial year.
Supplier income comprises:
Overrider income
Overrider income comprises three main elements:
1.  Fixed percentage based income: These relate largely to volumetric rebates based on the joint business plan agreements with suppliers. 
The income accrued is based on the Group’s latest forecast volumes and the latest contract agreed with the supplier. Income is not 
recognised until the Group has reasonable certainty that the joint business agreement will be fulfilled, with the amount of income accrued 
regularly re-assessed and re-measured throughout the contractual period, based on actual performance against the joint business plan. 
2.  Fixed lump sum income: These are typically guaranteed lump sum payments made by the supplier and are not based on volume. Fixed lump 
sum income is usually predicated on confirmation of a supplier contract and typically includes performance conditions upon the Group, such 
as marketing and promotional campaigns. These amounts are recognised periodically when contractual milestones have been met. 
 3.  Growth income: These are tiered volumetric rebates relating to growth targets agreed with the supplier in the joint business planning process. 
These are retrospective rebates based on sales volumes or purchased volumes. Income is recognised to the extent that it is reasonably 
certain that the conditions will be achieved, with such certainty increasing in the latter part of the calendar year.
Promotional income
Promotional income relates to supplier funded rebates specific to promotional activity run in agreement between the Group and our suppliers. 
Rebates are agreed at an individual inventory article level for agreed periods of time and are systemically calculated based on article sales 
information. No estimation is applied in calculating the promotional income receivable.
Supplier income is recognised on an accruals basis, based on the expected entitlement that has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each 
relevant supplier contract. The accrued incentives, rebates and discounts receivable at year end are included within trade and other receivables. 
Given the presence of the joint business plans, historic recoverability of accrued balances, and amounts are agreed with suppliers prior 
to recognition, supplier income is not considered to be an area of significant estimation that could impact on the following financial year.
1.19 Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives 
received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable under the effective interest rate method, incorporating amortisation of loan arrangement fees, 
finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method, unwinding 
of the discount on provisions and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income statement (see foreign currency accounting policy). 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared 
for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, 
and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised 
in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payment is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

Pets at Home Group Plc

Financial statements 1 Accounting policies (continued)
Other payables
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent free periods. Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially 
recognised as a liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met and credited to selling and distribution expenses 
in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from access date. Cash contributions are 
not discounted. 
Rent free periods received from landlords are initially recognised as a liability on the balance sheet, which is then credited to the selling and 
distribution expenses in the consolidated income statement over the life of the lease. The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling and distribution 
expenses on a straight-line basis from property access date to the end of the lease. Rent-free periods are not discounted.
1.20 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that 
it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
1.21 Adopted IFRS not yet applied 
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements. Their adoption is not expected 
to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated:
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts-Not yet endorsed.
• Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations – Amendments to IFRS 11 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 (European Union effective date 
1 January 2016).
• Agriculture: Bearer Plants – Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 41 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements – Amendments to IAS 27 (European Union effective date 1 January 2016). 
• Annual Improvements to IFRSs – 2012-2014 Cycle (EU effective date 1 January 2016).
• Investment entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 (European Union effective date  
1 January 2016). 
• Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 1 (European Union effective date 1 January 2017).
1.22 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. These judgements are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge at the time and the actual results 
may ultimately differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are  
discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit (CGU) and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of CGUs as well as further information 
about the assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
1.23 Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders 
such that the Company is obliged to pay the dividend. Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.

Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued 2 Segmental reporting
The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail outlets, 
specialist vet referral services and the Group’s websites. 
The Group’s Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store portfolio, 
allocate resources and make operational decisions. The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not identify other 
individual segments. To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the 
reportable segment.

Acquisition of Dick White Referrals Limited
On 28 April 2016 the Group acquired 76% of the total share capital of Dick White Referrals Limited in exchange for cash and contingent 
consideration. The remaining share capital of Dick White Referrals Limited is held by non-controlling interests.
A put and call option, written into the Articles of Association, allows the non-controlling shareholders to require sale of their shares to the Group 
at an agreed pricing method linked to future earnings performance at certain points in the future. The Articles also contain provision for the Group 
to buy the non-controlling shares under the same pricing mechanism at certain times.
As a consequence the put and call option has been treated as a forward contract and, as a result, the financial statements are prepared on the 
basis that the Group owns 100% of the total share capital of Dick White Referrals Limited. No non-controlling interest is recognised. The put and call 
option is treated as a forward contract measured at fair value reflecting the Group’s best estimate of future settlement, linked to forecasted future 
earnings performance.

The key assets acquired are the expertise and skills of the surgeons within the business; these represent the assembled workforce which does 
not meet the definition of an intangible asset. The cost of the combination also included a control premium, effectively including amounts in relation 
to the benefits of expected synergies, revenue growth and future market development. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill 
because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.
Consideration has been given to other intangibles that are recognisable under IFRS 3 Business Combinations. No brand name has been recognised 
due to the specialist nature of the services provided meaning that repeat referral is not expected and the company name is not recognisable to the 
general public. No favourable leases or patents were owned by the company at the time of acquisition. A customer list intangible asset of £771,000 
for the on-site laboratory has been identified and recognised separately from goodwill at fair value.
None of the goodwill identified on these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill is deemed to be provisional 
as it is considered that further information could come to light that could affect the fair value of net assets acquired.

Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists Ltd
The put and call liability in relation to the acquisition of Anderson Moores Ltd was overstated by £1,651,000 in the initial acquisition accounting. 
This is considered immaterial but has been corrected in the current year – a decrease in the associated goodwill of £1,651,000 and an equal 
decrease in the liability.

Impairment testing
Cash generating units (‘CGUs’) within the Group are considered to be the body of stores including vets’ practices, specialist referral centres 
and the Group’s websites as disclosed in note 2. The Group is deemed to have one overall group of CGUs as follows:

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements 12 Intangible assets (continued)
The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and the recoverable amount is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations. 
These calculations use a post-tax cash flow projection based on a three year plan approved by the Board. The plan is adjusted to remove the 
contribution from and costs associated with new stores and veterinary practices.
The key assumptions in the business plan are like-for-like sales growth, gross and operating profit margins. The forecast assumptions reflect 
continual innovation and our deep understanding of our customers. The projections are based on all available information and growth rates do 
not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods. A different set of assumptions may be more appropriate in future years depending on changes 
in the macro-economic environment.
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital. The Directors have assumed 
a growth rate projection beyond the three year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the Directors using the above assumptions is greater than 
the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period. The Directors consider that it is not reasonably possible 
for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess. 
A number of sensitivities have been applied to the assumptions in reaching this conclusion including:
• Reduction in growth rate applied beyond forecast period by 160 bps
• Increasing the discount rate by 200 bps
• Decreasing the sales growth assumption in the forecast period by 300 bps in combination with an increase in the discount rate of 20 bps 
and a reduction in the long term growth rate by 50 bps
None of the above would result in an impairment.
Disposal of Farm-Away Ltd. 
During the period the Group disposed of Farm-Away Ltd and its subsidiary Ride–Away (York) Ltd. There has been no allocation of goodwill under IAS 36 
as part of the disposal accounting as the assets of Farm-Away Ltd did not form a CGU against which the carrying value of assets is monitored. 
No partial disposal of goodwill has been recognised as the future cash flows against which the carrying value of assets are measured against are 
not impacted by the disposal of the subsidiary companies.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in ‘cost of sales’ is £315,002,000 (period ended 31 March 2016: £314,064,000).
Inventory expensed to cost of sales includes the cost of the SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit) sold, supplier income, stock wastage and foreign exchange 
variances. The prior year disclosure has been updated to be consistent. 
At 30 March 2017 the inventory provision amounted to £1.9m (31 March 2016: £2.0m). The inventory provision is calculated by reference to the age 
of the stock keeping unit. The provision percentages applied in calculating the provision are as follows:
• Discontinued stock greater than 365 days: 100%
• Current stock greater than 365 days with a use by date: 50%
• Current stock within 180 and 365 days with a use by date: 25%
• Greater than 180 days with no use by date: 25%
In addition, a provision is held to account for store stock losses during the period since which the SKU was last counted. 
The value of inventory against which an ageing provision is held is £4,623,000 (2016: £4,455,000).
In the 52 week period ended 30 March 2017, the value of inventory written off to the income statement amounted to £7.8m (53 week period ended 
31 March 2016: £8.3m).

Loans to joint venture veterinary practices 
Loans to joint venture veterinary practices include £12,054,000 (2016: £8,734,000) loans provided to joint venture veterinary practice companies 
trading under the Companion Care and Vets4Pets brands, in which the Group’s share interest is non-participatory. These loans represent a long term 
investment in the joint venture, supporting their initial set up and working capital, and are held at fair value and classified as an available for sale 
financial asset. Under the terms of the loans provided to veterinary companies trading under the Companion Care and Vets4Pets brands the loans 
attract varying interest rates between 2% and 3%. There is no set date for repayment of the loans due to the Group. The loans are held at fair value. 
The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows associated with the loan including interest cash flows. 
Investments in Joint Ventures
Investments represent £397,000 (2016: £297,000) of the “B” share capital in joint veterinary practice companies. These investments are equity 
accounted for at fair value. The share capital of the veterinary practice companies is split equally into ‘A’ ordinary shares (held by Joint Venture 
Partners) and ‘B’ ordinary shares (held by the Group). Any operational decisions require the agreement of the Joint Venture Partner. 
Under the terms of the agreements the Group, (‘B’ shareholder) is not entitled to any profits, losses or dividends, or any surplus on winding up 
or disposal, although they are entitled to appoint Directors to the Board and carry the same shareholder voting rights as ‘A’ ordinary shareholders. 
The agreements entitle the Group to receive income in relation to support services offered in such areas as clinical development, promotion and 
methods of operation as well as service activities including accountancy, legal and property.
Loans to other related parties
Loans to related parties represent loan balances to joint venture partnership businesses and shared venture partners. These loans are unsecured, 
typically for five to seven years and attract an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.8%. The loans are accounted for as loans and receivables and as such 
are recognised at amortised cost. The loans are typically to support capacity expansion.
The comparative note has been restated to provide clarity to the users of the financial statements by further disaggregating balances.

Senior Finance Bank Loans GBP LIBOR +1.25% 2020 210,000 209,296 202,000 201,091
In April 2015, the Group’s Senior Financing Facilities were amended, with the introduction of a further revolving credit facility (RCF) with a total facility 
amount of £260m. As part of the amendment, £325m of the Group’s term loans under the previous terms of the Senior Financing Facilities were 
repaid via drawings under the Group’s RCF along with cash from the Group’s existing resources. The amended RCF expires in April 2020 and is 
reviewed each period. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on leverage (net debt: EBITDA). Face value represents the principal value 
of the Senior Finance Bank Loans. The bank loan is secured against the various tangible, intangible and monetary assets of the Group (excluding 
investments in joint ventures and hedging agreements).
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being the principal value of the loan net of attributable transaction costs. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at a carrying value, which represents the amortised cost of the loans using 
the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
At 30 March 2017 the Group had a revolving credit facility of £260m with a drawn amount of £210m.

The closed stores provision relates to the rent and rates payable on sublet or vacant stores. A provision is made where the rent receivable on 
the properties is less than the rent payable, or where management consider there to be a risk on the sublet. The timing of the utilisation of these 
provisions is variable dependent upon the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary between 10 and 15 years. Market conditions 
have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where 
necessary.
In estimating the required provision an assumption is made on the average length to provide for. In the event that this assumption was to increase 
by one year, then the provision would increase by £230,000. The provision is discounted at a rate of 7%, being the estimated average implicit lease 
rate. A decrease in this rate of 100 bps would increase the provision by £33,000. 
The Company did not hold any provisions at 30 March 2017 or 31 March 2016.

Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest 
rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management framework
Risk management in respect of financial risk is carried out by the Group Treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board provides 
written principals, through its Group Treasury Policy, for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of 
excess liquidity. 
The main objectives of the Group Treasury function are:
• To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market 
movements
• To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable 
to the Board and shareholders
• To control banking costs and service levels

Market risk
(i) Foreign currency risk
The Group sources a significant level of purchases in foreign currency, in excess of US $50 million each financial year, and monitors its foreign 
currency requirements through short, medium and long term cash flow forecasting. The value of purchases in US dollars continues to increase each 
year and the risk management policy has evolved with this increased risk. 
At 30 March 2017, the Group’s policy is to hedge between 75% and 95% of the forecast foreign exchange transactions on a rolling 10 to 12 month 
basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. The transactions are deemed to be ‘highly probable’ and are 
based on historical knowledge and forecast purchase and sales projections. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows. This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments, except 
for derivatives which are based on notional amounts:

Sensitivity analysis
A 5% weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at the period end date in both years would have increased/(decreased) profit 
or loss or equity by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied 
to risk exposures existing at that date. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.

Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued (ii) Interest rate risk
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings. As at 30 March 2017 the Group had a senior facility with a face value totalling 
£210.0m. The Group’s borrowings as at 30 March 2017 incur interest at a rate of 1.25% plus LIBOR at current leverage, which exposes the Group 
to cash flow interest rate risk. The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 18.
The Pets at Home Group’s policy with regard to interest rate risk is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate 
agreements. The Group has entered into two fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of £152.8m of the senior facility borrowings at the 
balance sheet date at a blended fixed rate of 0.99%. One swap expires on 30 March 2018. The other swap has been taken out over £142.1m of the 
borrowings to cover the year commencing 30 March 2018 at a fixed rate of 0.183%. The hedges are structured to hedge at least 70% of the forecast 
outstanding debt for the next year.

Total financial liabilities 209,296 201,091 209,296 201,091
All borrowings bear a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR. Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed rate of interest. 
Therefore, designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining un-hedged portion is designated 
as variable rate.
Sensitivity analysis 
A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts 
shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing 
at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial instruments 
with variable interest rates, financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate 
element of interest rate swaps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the comparative period.

Credit risk
Financial risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The Group 
ensures that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements hold an acceptable risk rating by independent 
parties. 
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an 
investment. Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 26. The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed 
on an ongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, being the carrying amount of financial assets, is summarised in the table within the fair values section 
below.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the Group’s 
reputation. Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an ‘Event of Default’ and compliance 
certificates are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Fair values of financial instruments
Investments
The fair value of investments are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed 
as not material and the investment is non-participatory.
Trade and other payables and receivables
The fair value of these items are considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed 
as not material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable 
on demand (such as term deposits), then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate 
of interest at the balance sheet date.
Long term and short term borrowings 
The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.
Short term deposits
The fair value of short term deposits is considered to be their carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest 
rate is reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts are calculated by management based on external valuations received 
from the Group’s bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively. 
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration on acquisition of a subsidiary is valued at fair value at the time of acquisition. Any subsequent changes in fair values 
are recognised in profit or loss.
Put and call options over non-controlling interests
Put and call options over non-controlling interests are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included within the valuation of goodwill. 
Subsequent changes to fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

subsidiary undertakings and contingent consideration in relation to acquisitions. The fair values represent the best estimate of amounts payable 
based on future earnings performance discounted to present value.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital, which is deemed to be total equity plus total debt, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through the optimisation of the debt and equity 
balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom on financial covenants. The Group manages its capital structure and makes 
appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development 
of the Group. 
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash, as detailed in note 18.
A key objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the Senior Financing Facilities and 
to maintain a comfortable level of headroom over and above these requirements. 
Management have continued to measure and monitor covenant compliance throughout the period and the Group has complied with the requirements set.
23 Share based payments
At 30 March 2017, the Group has four share award plans all of which are equity settled schemes.
1 The Co-Invest Plan (CIP)
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the Co-Invest Plan (CIP). Matching awards under the CIP (as described in section 1(b) below) were 
made on 17 March 2014 to Executive Directors and the Senior Executives by reference to corresponding investment pledges by those colleagues. 
These matching awards vested over a period of three years subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and once vested as to 
performance, will become exercisable in equal one-third tranches in years three, four and five subject to continued employment with the Group. 
These awards were granted at nil cost.
(a)  Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues were selected to participate in the CIP. 
(b)  Type of awards
Colleagues were invited to participate in the CIP by making an ‘investment’ or ‘pledge’ of their own shares (the “Co-Invest Shares”), which could 
include existing, locked-in shares or new shares acquired with cash, in return for a nil cost-matching award over shares (the “Matching Award”). 
Matching Awards will be granted by reference to a ratio not exceeding one matched share for every Co-Invest Share ‘pledged’. Matching Awards

(d)  Performance, vesting and performance adjustment
The Matching Awards granted on 17 March 2014 vested subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions outlined below. To the extent that 
any future awards are granted, different conditions may apply (in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee).
The performance conditions are as follows: 
• 75% of the Matching Award was subject to the CAGR in the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) over three financial years, namely FY15, 
FY16 and FY17 (together the “Performance Period”) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, ended on 30 March 2017). If the CAGR in the 
Company’s EPS was 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award would vest. If the CAGR in the Company’s EPS was 17.5% or more, then 75% 
of the total Matching Award would vest. Vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points. For the avoidance of doubt, if the CAGR 
in EPS was less than 10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which would vest under this EPS performance 
condition would be nil.
• 25% of the total Matching Award was subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to a comparator group made 
up of a selected group of retail companies over the Performance Period. Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award would occur for median 
performance. Vesting of the maximum 25% of the total Matching Award would occur for upper quartile performance or above. Vesting would 
occur on a straight-line basis between these two points. If the Company’s TSR performance over the Performance Period was below median, 
then the amount of the Matching Award which would vest under this TSR performance condition would be nil.
• To the extent vested as to performance, Matching Awards became exercisable in three equal amounts on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary 
of 17 March 2014, but subject to continued employment with the Group.
2 CSOP
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the CSOP. Part I of the CSOP is tax approved under Schedule 4 to the Income Tax (Earnings and 
Pensions) Act 2003 and provides for the grant of tax approved options. Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. 
The tax approved options under Part I of the CSOP will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to 
continued employment with the Group. These awards will be granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the grant date 
(as agreed with HMRC).
(a)  Eligibility
All colleagues, including the Executive Directors and Senior Executives, are eligible to participate in the CSOP, at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee.
(b)  Grant of options
No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the CSOP. Options under the CSOP will not form part of a colleague’s 
pensionable earnings.
(c)  Vesting and performance
Colleagues who receive options under the CSOP and under the PSP in connection with Admission will be subject to the same performance conditions 
described in Section 1 (d) above in respect of both grants. Colleagues who only receive options under the CSOP in connection with Admission will not 
be subject to performance conditions.
(d)  Exercise price
The price at which an option holder may acquire shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than 
the greater of market value of a share at the time of grant and its nominal value. The exercise price is therefore fixed at grant date.
(e)  Individual limits
No option may be granted to an eligible colleague under Part I of the CSOP which would result in the aggregate exercise prices of shares comprised 
in all outstanding options granted to him/her under Part I, when aggregated with outstanding options held under any other tax approved executive 
share option scheme established by the Company, exceeding the tax approved limit (currently £30,000).
In addition, (both under Part I and II of the CSOP) the aggregate exercise price of shares comprised in options granted to a colleague under the CSOP 
and the PSP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of his/her annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of these limits, market value will be calculated by reference to the market value of the shares on or prior to the relevant date 
of grant as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) and subject to HMRC approval if applicable.
Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. This enables options to be granted under the same terms as Part I of the CSOP but 
without complying with the particular requirements of the legislation applicable to tax approved CSOP Schemes. The provisions of the CSOP that do 
not apply under Part II include the £30,000 limit and the need to seek HMRC approval for the scheme and subsequent amendments (as applicable).

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 162
Notes (forming part of the financial statements) continued 3 PSP
On 25 February 2014 the Company adopted the PSP. Awards under the PSP were made on 17 March 2014 and annually thereafter and will 
be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of this date, subject to continued employment with the Group and the satisfaction 
of performance conditions. These awards were granted at nil cost.
(a)  Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues were selected to participate in the PSP.
(b)  Grant of awards
Awards under the PSP will not form part of a colleague’s pensionable earnings. Awards are not transferable (other than on death) without the consent 
of the Remuneration Committee.
(c)  Exercise price
The price at which a colleague may acquire shares on the exercise or vesting of an award under the PSP shall be determined by the Remuneration 
Committee on the date of grant, and may, if the Remuneration Committee determines, be nil or nominal value only.
(d)  Scheme limits
The number of newly issued shares over which (or in respect of which) awards may be granted under the PSP on any date shall be limited so that: 
(i) the total number of shares issued and issuable in respect of options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other 
discretionary share option scheme of the Company (including the CIP and the CSOP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is 
restricted to 5% of the Company’s issued shares calculated at the relevant time; and (ii) the total number of shares issued and issuable pursuant 
to options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other employee share scheme operated by the Company (including the 
CIP, CSOP, SAYE and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s issued shares calculated 
at the relevant time.
For the purposes of these limits, no account will be taken of options or awards granted before, on or in connection with Admission and no account 
will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting. Shares held in 
treasury will be treated as newly issued shares for the purposes of these limits (as long as this is required by institutional investor guidelines), 
but (for the avoidance of doubt) shares acquired in the market will not.
(e)  Individual limits
The aggregate market value of shares comprised in awards granted to a colleague under the PSP and the CSOP in any financial year shall not exceed 
150% of their annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of awards granted on (or before) Admission, market value for these purposes was calculated by reference to the Offer Price. For the 
purposes of awards granted following Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the market value of the shares 
on the relevant date of grant as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) in its absolute discretion.
(f) Performance
For awards granted on, or in connection with, Admission, the performance conditions are the same as for the CIP outlined in Section 1(d) above.
4 SAYE
On 25 February 2014, the Company adopted the SAYE (which was registered with and self-certified with HMRC on 4 April 2015). The rules of the 
SAYE were adopted pursuant to Schedule 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and provide for the grant of tax approved options. 
In September each year, the Company issues invitations under the rules of the SAYE which provides eligible colleagues with an opportunity to receive 
share options at a 20% discount to the market price. The maximum monthly savings is £500 per month. The Executive Directors have elected 
to participate in the Sharesave, along with 30% of eligible colleagues.
The options were granted in September 2014, September 2015 and October 2016, and in normal circumstances they are not exercisable until 
completion of a three year savings period, beginning on 1 December each year, and will then be exercisable for a period of six months following 
completion of the relevant savings period.
(a)  Eligibility
All colleagues and full-time Directors of the Group, who have been in continuous service for such period of time (not exceeding five years) as may be 
determined by the Board prior to the relevant date of grant of an option and who are liable to UK income tax, are eligible to participate in the SAYE.
Participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the Board (taking account of the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee), to other 
Directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the 
SAYE.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Financial statements 23 Share based payments (continued)
(b)  Issue of invitations
Invitations to participate in the SAYE may be made during each 42 day period from (and including) (i) the date on which any amendment to the SAYE 
is approved or adopted by the Company’s shareholders (ii) the announcement of the Company’s final or interim results for any financial period, (iii) 
the occurrence of an event which the Remuneration Committee considers to be an exceptional event concerning the Group or (iv) changes to the 
legislation affecting tax approved SAYE option schemes coming into effect. If any of the above periods is a ‘close period’ as a result of the 
application of the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Companies (or as a result of the Company’s equivalent internal 
share dealing rules) and the Company is prohibited from issuing invitations and/or granting options as a result, then invitations may be made within 
42 days of the end of the close period.
Invitations may be issued by the trustee of an employee benefit trust. No invitations may be issued or options granted more than ten years after 
the adoption of the SAYE.
(c)  Exercise price
The price at which an option holder may acquire shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than 
the greater of 80% of the market value of a share at the time of grant and its nominal value. 
(d)  Savings contract
Options may be granted by the Board or the trustee of an employee benefit trust. Upon applying for an option, the colleague will be required to enter 
into an approved savings contract with a savings institution nominated by the Company which lasts for three years. The maximum amount which 
an employee is permitted to contribute under SAYE contracts is £500 per month. The Board may set lower savings limits than this for different 
colleagues by reference to objective criteria such as levels of salary or length of service. The minimum contribution is £5 per month (or such greater 
amount as the Board may specify, not to exceed £10). The total exercise price of the shares over which the option is granted may not exceed the 
aggregate of the monthly contributions and bonus payable at the end of the colleague’s related SAYE contract.
(e)  Scheme limits
The number of newly issued shares over which (or in respect of which) options may be granted under the SAYE on any date of grant shall be limited 
so that the total number of shares issued or capable of being issued in any ten year period under all the Company’s employee share schemes 
(including the CIP, CSOP, PSP and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s issued shares 
calculated at the relevant time. Any options or rights to acquire shares granted before, on or in connection with Admission will be excluded from this 
limit, and no account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting.
(f)  Exercisability
Options will normally be exercisable during a period of six months following the allocation of a bonus under the related SAYE contract and will 
normally lapse upon cessation of employment. Earlier exercise is, however, permitted if the colleague dies or leaves employment through injury, 
disability, redundancy or retirement or where a colleague leaves employment of the Group by reason of his employing company ceasing to be a 
member of the Group, or if the undertaking in which he is employed is sold outside the Group. Early exercise will also be permitted in the event 
of a takeover, reconstructions or voluntary winding up of the Company.
Fair value of share awards
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to award. The expected life is the 
average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as three years. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government 
bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
Options are valued using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model for the non-market based (EPS element) performance conditions and a Monte-Carlo 
simulation for the market-based (TSR element) performance conditions.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company which employs 
the option holder ceases to be part of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.

Pets at Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 178 Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority came into effect for all 
communications released on or after 3 July 2016 for issuers of securities on a regulated market. 
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors have adopted various APMs of historical or future financial performance, position or cash flows 
other than those defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 
The Directors measure the performance of the Group based on the following financial measures which are not recognised under EU-adopted IFRS, 
and consider these to be important measures in evaluating the Group’s strategic and financial performance. The Directors believe that these APMs 
assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group. 
APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods, by adjusting for non-underlying items, to aid the user 
in understanding the Group’s performance. 
Consequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes 
and have remained consistent with prior year.
All APMs relate to the current period’s results and comparative periods where provided.
53 week prior year comparison 
The FY17 audited period represents the 52 weeks to 30 March 2017. The audited comparative period represents 53 weeks to 31 March 2016, 
but to better reflect the business’s underlying performance, the more appropriate comparable period is the 52 weeks to 24 March 2016. On this 
basis, all commentary in respect of the comparative period is based on the proforma 52 week period to 24 March 2016 unless otherwise stated. 
In order to calculate the 52 week financials, where applicable, the outcome of the 53rd week has been used as the basis for the adjustment, 
although in some instances, a degree of judgement has been applied in deriving certain income statement costs in relation to the final week. 
The full statutory financials, which compare the current financial year to the 53 week prior year, are detailed starting on page 117.
