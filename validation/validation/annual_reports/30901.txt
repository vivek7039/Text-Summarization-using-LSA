The method we use to deliver our aspiration – to be the best-managed business in our sector – and to deliver our  
strategy is to concentrate on doing four things really well. These are the things we want Serco to be famous for:
Being profitable  
and sustainable
Winning good 
business
Executing 
brilliantly
Being a place 
people are  
proud to work
We try to make sure that everything we do improves our performance against one or more of these objectives, 
and start from a position where we know we can do much better. We can improve the way we bid and manage 
contracts; develop innovative propositions; measure performance; reduce the cost and improve the quality of our 
administrative systems and processes. None of these comes easily or quickly, and we need to steer a tricky course 
between the urgent need to reduce our costs in line with reduced revenues in the short term and investing in 
systems and processes that will produce sustainable benefits in the long term.

05 Strategic Report
I am delighted that we have delivered a 
trading result in line with expectations in 
2017 , as well as over £3bn of order intake 
and a further improvement in employee 
engagement. We have also added further 
skills and diversity to the Board, with strong 
governance being a key focus of the business 
at all levels. Whilst trading conditions are 
currently difficult in several of our markets, 
we have over the last three financial years 
delivered on the plan set out in 2015; having 
already stabilised the business, we have 
been improving our operating efficiency 
through our transformation programme. 
Importantly, as we now look ahead, we 
expect profits to start to grow over the  
next two years.
Serco’s mission is to be a trusted partner of 
governments, providing superb public services that 
transform outcomes and make a positive difference for 
our fellow citizens, whilst delivering attractive returns 
to our shareholders and rewarding careers to our 
employees. Our aspiration is to be the best-managed 
company in our sector, and our method to achieve this 
is through concentrating on doing four things really 
well: winning good business; executing brilliantly; 
being a place people are proud to work; and being 
profitable and sustainable. 2017 has produced tangible 
evidence of performing well against these objectives. 
I am proud of the work we do and of the continued 
progress being made.
Delivering our strategic plan
In 2015, we set out a three-stage plan for Serco: 
Stabilisation, Transformation, Growth. Stabilisation was 
largely completed in 2014 and 2015 with the recruitment 
of a new management team, recapitalising the business 
and delivering the corporate renewal programme. 
Transformation then started in earnest, and will 
continue through 2018 and 2019. In 2018 we expect to 
also start delivering the third phase – Growth.
Three achievements in 2017 underline the progress 
Serco is making. First, we had very strong order intake, 
at £3.4bn. This represents a book-to-bill ratio – the value 
of how much we add to the order book compared to 
how much revenue we are billing our customers – of 
over 100%, the first time this has been achieved since 
2012. The strong order intake, with very large contracts 
won in Health and Justice, underlines the progress we 
have made developing our customer propositions and 
business development skills.
Second, the work we have done transforming the 
business enabled us to meet our target of reducing the 
run-rate of our overheads by over £100m by the end of 
2017. We expect to gain further cost efficiency benefits 
in 2018, notably from merging the UK operations into 
a single entity, as well as further reducing our other 
central support costs.
Thirdly, Serco employs over 50,000 people, including 
those at our joint venture operations, the vast majority 
of whom are responsible for delivering on a daily basis 
critical and sensitive frontline services for Government. 
Our success therefore is dependent on how well we 
select, manage, organise, motivate, develop and engage 
the people who work for Serco. Every year we run a 
detailed ‘Viewpoint’ employee survey to gauge how well 
our colleagues think we are doing, and I am delighted to 
say that, for the fourth successive year, the aggregated 
measure of ‘employee engagement’ improved again in 
2017, with some 31,000 people responding.
You can read more about all of these points in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 32 to 43.
Achieving our financial targets
Our initial guidance for 2017 Underlying Trading 
Profit was between £65m and £70m, with the result of 
£69.8m therefore coming in at the top of that range. 
Supporting this, we achieved our targeted cost 
savings through the delivery of operational efficiency 
improvements. Furthermore, we have continued to 
reduce the burden of loss-making contracts, which is 
also paramount to ensuring sustainable profitability. 
Chairman’s Statement
2017 has seen further progress in implementing 
the strategy presented to shareholders in 2015. 
The transformation of the business continues 
apace and is delivering significant improvements 
in our efficiency and competitiveness.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 06 After exceptional items, net finance costs and tax,  
the profit for the year was £0.1m.
Net Debt at the year-end was £141m, also better than 
our guidance at the start of the year. This equates to 
EBITDA leverage of 1.4x, well within our medium-term 
target range of 1–2x and comfortably below the 3.5x 
debt covenant requirement.
You can read more about the drivers of financial 
performance in the Chief Executive’s Review, with 
further detail provided in the Divisional Reviews on 
pages 44 to 49 and the Finance Review on pages 50  
to 68. 
Targeting further progress
As we look ahead to 2018, we expect Underlying 
Trading Profit to grow to around £80m on revenues of 
£2.8–2.9bn. Since the second half of 2016, we have been 
making progress on increasing our profit margin – a key 
deliverable of successfully implementing our strategy 
– and in 2018 we expect that further margin and profit 
progress will be driven largely by transformation savings.
Looking further ahead, we expect 2019 to be a year of 
further good growth in Underlying Trading Profit, which 
is again likely to be driven by additional transformation 
savings. As we have said previously, the rate of growth 
thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to 
grow revenues. The Strategy Review announced in 
March 2015 set out a long term ambition that the 
business could grow in line with a market which was 
expected to expand at a long term trend rate of 5–7% a 
year and deliver margins of 5–6%. Our margin ambition 
was predicated on three conditions: first, reducing 
costs as a percentage of sales; second, containing 
losses on onerous contracts and converting a number 
of them into profitable contracts on rebid; and, thirdly, 
increasing margins by growing revenues whilst bearing 
down on overheads. We remain broadly on track on 
costs and onerous contracts, but some markets, and 
in particular the UK, are currently challenging and 
therefore growing more slowly than their former trend 
rate. We can and will partly compensate for a weaker 
organic revenue outlook through increased actions 
on the cost base, and our ambitions of 5–7% revenue 
growth and 5–6% margin remain intact, but the timing 
of achieving this will be dependent upon when demand 
reverts to trend in our target markets.
Our Board
Serco’s Board has seen considerable change since I 
became Chairman in July 2015. In considering new 
members of the Board, we have been determined to 
have a mix of backgrounds and experience to ensure 
that we have a balanced, dynamic and effective Board.
During the year, Ralph Crosby and Angie Risley stepped 
down from the Board, both having joined Serco during 
2011. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to both 
Ralph and Angie for the sterling service they have 
given the Company through some very difficult times; 
in particular I would like to thank Angie for her expert 
leadership of the Remuneration Committee. 
I was delighted to welcome three new Non-Executive 
Directors – Lynne Peacock, Ian El-Mokadem and Kirsty 
Bashforth – each of whom bring highly relevant and 
complementary skills. Lynne Peacock has assumed 
Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee. The 
background and experience of each are detailed in the 
Directors’ Report on pages 86 to 87 and details of the 
selection process to the appointments are set out in  
the Nomination Committee Report on page 102.
Ed Casey, our Chief Operating Officer, left Serco at 
the end of 2017 after 12 years of dedicated service 
to the Company. For the last four years, Ed had been 
commuting weekly across the Atlantic, and we quite 
understand his desire to return to the US, where he is 
taking up a senior role with a company in a different 
sector. I would like to express the Board’s appreciation 
for Ed’s significant contribution, particularly in 
supporting the stabilisation phase of our strategy and 
developing our plans for the transformation phase. 
We do not currently intend to seek a replacement 
for Ed as Chief Operating Officer, but will distribute 
his responsibilities amongst members of the Serco’s 
Executive Committee, reflecting the strength of the 
established senior leadership of Serco.
We have continued in 2017 to further develop the 
effectiveness of our governance, operational resilience 
and organisational change processes. Your Board has 
also been actively involved in evaluating individual bids 
containing a particular concentration of risks, as well 
as meeting regularly with management responsible 
for the delivery of the Company’s key operations and 
for the development of new business. Board members 
regularly visit contracts and meet with members of the 
wider management team; in particular, Non-Executives 
participate in our Oxford Saïd Serco Management 
training course, which is attended by around 30 
managers and runs four times a year.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
07 Strategic Report
I am pleased to report that we have fully complied 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code with the exception of conducting an external-led 
Board evaluation, which, considering that our three new 
Non-Executive Directors joined in the second half of 
2017, the Board considered would be more appropriate 
to defer to 2018. As in previous years, the Board 
conducted an internally-led evaluation, as detailed on 
page 92.
The Board believes that strong governance is a vital 
component in the long-term success of the Company; 
further detail on our structures and processes are set 
out in our Corporate Governance Report on pages 86  
to 109, as well as the Committee reports.
Securing our future success 
Your Board is absolutely focused on long-term, 
sustainable shareholder value creation, and doing so by 
promoting the best interests of shareholders alongside 
those of our employees, customers, and the societies 
and communities in which we work. Serco has a clear 
strategy to transform the business and position it for 
long-term success in attractive markets, and is on track 
to achieve this through a highly effective executive 
management team and a committed workforce that 
cares passionately about public service delivery.
We will continue to transform the business and expect 
good profit growth in 2018 and 2019. Beyond, our long-
term ambitions for margins and revenue growth remain 
intact, but the timing of achieving these remains subject 
to seeing improvements in the trading conditions across 
our markets.
The current challenges in some of our markets are 
covered in the following section on Our Business, 
together with the Chief Executive's Review; importantly, 
these also cover the strong progress Serco is already 
making, the opportunities that are expected to arise for 
us, and the long-term effectiveness of the markets that 
remain in place.
I would like to thank all colleagues in the business for 
their efforts in achieving a successful 2017, and for their 
continued support in helping Serco to be a superb 
provider of public services that everyone will be proud 
to be associated with.
Sir Roy Gardner 
Chairman
Chairman’s Statement
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 08 What we do, and how we do it
Serco delivers services to governments and 
other institutions who serve the public or 
protect vital national interests. We focus on 
five sectors: Defence, Justice & Immigration, 
Transport, Health and Citizen Services, 
and deliver them in the UK, Europe, North 
America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. 
Serco’s origin dates back to 1929, when the Radio 
Corporation of America established a UK subsidiary 
providing technical services to cinemas. In the years 
leading up to 1987, the UK subsidiary diversified its 
services to cover facilities management, systems 
engineering and support services. Following a 
management buy-out in 1987, the Company was 
subsequently listed on the London Stock Exchange as 
Serco Group plc. Throughout the eighties and nineties, 
Serco was at the forefront of the emerging outsourcing 
market in the UK, pioneering in areas such as large scale 
transfers of staff and in being the operations contractor 
for new public infrastructure and services.
Serco delivers services to Government through 
people, supported by processes, technology and 
skilled management. Our customers define what 
outcomes or services they need to deliver, and we 
develop new and more effective ways to deliver them. 
We deliver innovative solutions to some of the most 
complex challenges facing governments, bringing our 
experience, capability and scale to deliver the service 
standards, cost efficiencies and policy outcomes 
governments want. In this way we make a positive 
difference to the lives of millions of people around  
the world, and help keep nations safe.
Governments have two basic responsibilities: to develop 
policies, and to ensure that those policies are delivered. 
Some policies can be delivered simply by enacting 
legislation, relying on individuals and corporations to 
deliver the policy themselves by acting in accordance 
with the law, with the police and judiciary acting as 
enforcers of behaviour. An example of this would be a 
policy that required a speed limit of 20 mph near schools, 
which can be enforced by the police in the normal course 
of law enforcement. Other policies require substantial 
specialist workforces to be employed to deliver them. 
One example would be a policy that pending the 
adjudication of their applications, asylum seekers should 
be housed in the community, rather than in detention: 
such a policy requires the government to employ – 
directly or indirectly – the people required to manage 
housing and welfare services. Another example of a 
policy that requires a dedicated workforce to deliver it 
would be air traffic control, which requires highly qualified 
staff to be deployed, often to remote locations.
Public services require people
The delivery of many areas of government policy is 
labour intensive, and the number of people involved in 
the delivery of government services vastly outnumbers 
those involved in developing policy; in some countries, 
government is the largest employer. For example, 
according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
nearly twice as many people (22 million) are employed 
by local, state and federal government as are in 
manufacturing (12 million).
The labour intensive nature of government service 
delivery demands strong management of the processes 
to recruit, organise and oversee the hundreds or 
even thousands of people required to deliver a public 
service. Many public servants are talented managers, 
but all governments find it hard to attract and retain in 
the numbers required to deliver services in the face of 
private sector competition for these skills. Serco helps 
government by being a bridge between the drive, energy 
and innovation of the private sector, and the very specific 
requirements of public services.
Serco has deep expertise: overlaid on our 
private sector techniques, drive and energy is 
a public service ethos that means that we can 
help deliver government services efficiently, 
but in a way that recognises the need for public 
accountability, transparency and trust.
Our Business
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
09 Strategic Report
Public services and delivery by the private sector
Governments have used private contractors to deliver 
public policy, often in very sensitive areas, for centuries. 
In medieval times, fighting wars and tax collection were 
often outsourced, in whole or part, to private enterprise. 
The transportation of prisoners from the UK to Australia, 
which started in 1788 and continued until 1868, was carried 
out entirely by private contractors. Today, in the UK, 
frontline medical services by the National Health Service 
are provided by general practitioners, the vast majority 
of whom are employed by private partnerships and 
companies. Some of the most sensitive and secret defence 
work, such as developing and supporting strategic nuclear 
weapons, is carried out by private companies.
Some services which governments need in order to 
deliver public policy are similar or identical to those 
required in the private sector, and suppliers can happily 
operate in both markets. Running payroll, providing 
telecoms networks and IT centres is not vastly different 
in the public and private sectors. But some government 
services – such as running prisons or providing air 
traffic control – are unique to government and have no 
private sector equivalent. Many government services 
are bought only by government, and providing them 
is a specialist business, quite different from anything 
found in the private sector. However, many of them can 
be run efficiently on behalf of government by private 
companies using techniques, management, technology 
and processes developed in the private sector. 
Unique demands of public service delivery
Providing government services to citizens, funded 
by taxpayers, is different, and in many ways more 
demanding, than providing services to the private sector 
or consumers. Politics, transparency and accountability 
to multiple stakeholders are seen only dimly in the 
private sector, but are writ large in the public sector, and 
need careful management. Serco has deep expertise 
in providing this bridge: overlaid on our private sector 
techniques, drive and energy is a public service ethos 
that means that we can help deliver government services 
efficiently, but in a way that recognises the need for 
public accountability and trust, and the fact that we are 
often looking after some of the most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged in society. 
Serco’s breadth and structure
As well as providing a bridge between the private and 
public sector, Serco also provides the international and 
inter-departmental sharing of ideas and best practice 
which governments often find hard to achieve. New 
approaches for running prisons and reducing youth re-
offending in the UK come from Australia; hospitals we 
manage in the Middle East use processes developed in 
the UK; likewise our Defence business in the Middle East 
serves Australian armed forces. We transfer our insights, 
skills and processes from one sector or region to another, 
so we can anticipate and meet new challenges for 
customers. In our markets we are a rarity: a company that 
offers services covering front, middle, and back office 
requirements across multiple areas of government policy 
delivery, internationally.
We focus our activities in five areas of government 
service: Defence, Justice & Immigration, Transport, 
Health and Citizen Services. Between them, these sectors 
account for a very large proportion of government 
expenditure and employ significant numbers of people  
in service delivery.
We structure ourselves with three types of function: 
Divisions, Group, and Shared Services. All operational 
delivery is executed through four geographic Divisions: 
UK & Europe, the Americas, Asia Pacific and the Middle 
East. Within their domains, Divisions are responsible for 
everything involved in winning and delivering contracts; 
97% of our employees work in these Divisions. A lean 
Group function provides governance, strategy, asset 
allocation, policy-setting and oversight, as well as 
certain specialist consolidation and functional roles in 
Finance, Risk and HR; the Group also manages Centre 
of Excellence (CoEs) which provide focused expertise 
and support to the Divisions, and enable sharing of best 
practice and the development of common propositions 
in areas such as Transport, Justice & Immigration and 
Health. Shared Services provide common functional and 
processing support in areas such as IT, HR and finance to 
the Divisions.
Our Business continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Our Strategy
As managers, our job is to ensure Serco 
delivers value to the people and institutions 
who have an interest in our success: to our 
customers and service-users, by providing 
high-quality, resilient and innovative 
public services; to our shareholders, by 
providing sustainable and growing returns 
on capital; to our lenders, by providing 
them with a solid and secure credit; and to 
our colleagues, by enabling them to have 
interesting and rewarding careers.
We believe that good strategies are simply expressed. 
Our strategy is to be a superb provider of public services, 
by being the best-managed business in our sector. 
We are a B2G (Business to Government) business, 
specialising across five sectors: Defence, Justice & 
Immigration, Transport, Health and Citizen Services.  
We deliver these services in four regions: UK & Europe, 
North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.
The decision to focus on being a B2G business was 
taken in 2014, and was a change from the previous 
strategy which had been to serve both private and 
public sector customers. The strategy was changed as a 
result of the need to recapitalise the business following 
a troubled diversification into private sector outsourcing 
and the realisation that Serco had taken on a number of 
very heavily loss-making contracts. As a result of this the 
management team was changed in 2013 and 2014, and 
over £700m was raised by way of an equity Rights Issue 
in early 2015 and the disposal of non-core businesses 
later in that year. 
Focusing the business on the public sector market 
was, in effect, going back to our roots. For some 20 
years up until 2010, the company had delivered rapid 
growth and very significant value creation by being 
largely focused on the public sector. In recent years 
the public sector market has become more difficult as 
governments struggled with the effects of the financial 
crisis in 2008, slowdowns in military spending, and the 
election of governments committed to reducing public 
expenditure. Furthermore, governments have become 
much more skilled at contracting and focused on risk-
transfer; as a consequence margins and risk-adjusted 
returns earned by many suppliers to government are 
much lower today than they were ten years ago.
However, despite what is now a more mature and 
difficult market than it was around the turn of the 
century, the business of providing services to 
government has attractions. We believe that the market 
will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than 
previously, because of two fundamental truths. First, 
that in many areas of public service provision, private 
companies, properly managed, can deliver services of 
higher quality and lower cost than governments can 
themselves. Second, that governments will continue to 
face huge pressure to deliver more and better public 
services, for less, and that this will lead them to focus 
relentlessly on value for money and the quality of 
service provision. This pressure comes from what we  
call the ‘Four Forces’ comprising:
• The relentless increase, at rates above GDP growth, 
of demand for public services across important areas 
of government. Examples are the pressures on health 
and social care driven by ageing populations, and 
growing prison populations. 
• The need to reduce public debt and expenditure 
deficits.
• Rising expectations of service quality amongst public 
service users.
• The unwillingness of voters and corporate taxpayers 
to countenance tax increases.
The challenge facing governments worldwide can, like 
our strategy, be simply expressed: to deliver more, and 
better, for less.
In all of our markets the degree to which government 
should use private companies to provide public 
services is one debated, sometimes fiercely, and the 
pendulum can swing quite sharply. By way of example, 
the elections in Western Australia in 2017 saw a Labor 
government committed to reducing private sector 
participation replace a Liberal administration which had 
overseen the introduction of private sector companies 
into the prison and healthcare systems; on the other 
side of the country, however, in New South Wales, the 
administration is a sophisticated user of private sector 
services, as is the Federal Government. In the US, the 
Obama administration was notably seen as less ‘private 
sector friendly’, while the new Trump administration is 
considered the reverse. Recently, in the UK, the collapse 
of Carillion has reignited debate, with the two main 
political parties taking sharply divergent views. This 
‘two-way street’ is well established, but on a smaller 
scale, in the commercial outsourcing market, where on 
a daily basis some companies decide to outsource, and 
others decide to insource. 
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
11 Strategic Report
We believe, however, that the long-term pressures to 
deliver value-for-money, increasing demand for services, 
and the need to improve service delivery will ensure that 
the role of the private sector in the delivery of public 
services will remain robust.
There are other factors that make the public sector 
marketplace attractive to us: whilst some niches may be 
disrupted by technology or other exogenous factors, 
we can be very confident that the world will still need 
prisons, will still need to manage immigration, and 
provide healthcare and transport, and that these services 
will be highly people-intensive for decades to come.  
The bank teller or shop assistant may be rightly fearful 
that technology will disintermediate their role, but 
a prison custody officer can sleep soundly in the 
knowledge that his or her skills will be required for  
years to come. 
Risk management is central to our thinking at both a 
strategic and an operational level. In terms of strategy, 
although being a focused and specialist B2G business, 
we think it beneficial, and a competitive advantage, to 
diversify our exposure to individual governments and 
sectors. Governments can be capricious; decision-
making processes regularly come to a halt around 
elections; the attitude to using private companies can 
be volatile; political priorities can change in the blink of 
an eye, switching discretionary resources from defence 
to immigration to healthcare and back again. In this 
environment, being diversified both by sector and 
geography reduces risk and volatility. Most companies 
operating in our market are heavily focused in either a 
particular sector, or within a geography; in our market, 
Serco is a rare beast, operating amongst five sectors 
and four regions. 
But management of risk is only one reason we favour a 
strategy of operating across a number of jurisdictions 
and sectors. Governments across the world face similar 
challenges, and we believe that we can gain competitive 
advantage and deliver value to customers by operating 
internationally. At a detailed operational level, providing 
cleaning and catering services in a hospital is very similar 
in Western Australia and in Abu Dhabi. In terms of 
capability, many of our contracts employ hundreds, and 
some, thousands, of people; so recruitment, training, 
staff rostering and time management are key capabilities 
applicable across all our sectors and geographies. 
The same is true of project and case management; we 
are also able to adopt consistent approaches to key 
operational tools such as Continuous Improvement.
An international footprint also helps us build customer 
interest and confidence. The fact that we are involved 
in running major urban rail infrastructure in the UK and 
Dubai helps us in rail bids in North America; our proven 
track record in reducing recidivism amongst offenders 
in Australia is of interest to authorities in the UK. But, 
more broadly, when governments are considering 
awarding us an important project, the fact that other 
governments trust us to help them manage some of 
their most critical and secret areas of national security 
infrastructure is helpful in building confidence.
Market size
People ask: how large is the market for the private sector 
provision of public services? This is hard to determine 
with precision, as the boundaries of the market are 
fiendishly hard to define. Does the maintenance contract 
for a mainframe computer operated by the government 
fall within the definition of the market? How should we 
treat services provided by government-owned agencies 
operating on an arm’s-length basis? Within Defence, do 
we count supply and support of, say, missile systems, 
or just the types of services we currently (as opposed 
to could) supply? And how do we disentangle the very 
different definitions of, and accounting for, expenditure 
used by the various governments with whom we deal? 
In 2016 we did a lot of work to try and size the market 
in the sectors and geographies we currently operate 
in, which are clearly a subset of the global market. Our 
best guess is that the total annual value of government 
services in our target segments and geographies which 
could be provided by the private sector is around 
£300bn, of which around £100bn is delivered by private 
companies. Rather than concentrate on the absolute 
number, some key conclusions from our work are:
• the market for private sector delivery of government 
services is very large;
• the supply-side is fragmented; as a leading 
international supplier, our market share within our 
existing footprint, at around 3%, is small, although 
it is larger in some specific segments within certain 
sectors; and
• there is significant opportunity for growth, given 
that around two-thirds of the services that could be 
provided by the private sector are currently self-
delivered by government.

Implementing our strategy 
We combine people, processes and technology to deliver superb services. Serco is not a 
consultancy or a technology business; we use process and technology as enabling tools, not 
as products to sell. Furthermore, since processes and technology depend entirely on people, 
it can be simply said that the success of our strategy will depend upon how well we manage, 
organise, motivate, develop and select people. So the answer to ‘how?’ is: ‘by being the 
best-managed business in our sector’. 
Having such an ambition may sound trite, but we believe that it is a worthy and value-creating aspiration, and one 
that we can use to inspire our management teams and customers. In any given circumstances, and whatever the 
slings and arrows of fortune, well-managed businesses do better than poorly-managed businesses, and the best-
managed businesses do best of all. 
We are great believers in succinctness and simplicity. Accordingly, we have managed to fit our strategy and 
performance framework – of what is a very complex and diverse business – into a single graphic that we use 
throughout the business:

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 The purpose of the performance framework is to 
provide a structure which will deliver value to our 
customers, shareholders, and to the people who work 
in the business. We start with our Values. 
Our values
Whilst we use technology and processes, the core of our 
business is people – many thousands of them – delivering 
public services. It is of central importance to our success 
that our colleagues, many of whom are former public 
servants, and our customers, believe that we have values 
appropriate to a company delivering services funded 
by taxpayers to often vulnerable and disadvantaged 
citizens. “Working at the leading edge of technology” 
may be inspiring to people working for IT businesses, but 
they are not reasons why a prison officer makes a cup of 
tea for a suicidal prisoner at two o’clock in the morning; 
why a housing officer leaves the comfort of an office to 
guide a nervous asylum seeker’s child to school on their 
first day; why an engineer crawls into that impossibly 
small space in the foetid bowels of an aircraft-carrier to 
make sure the cable-ties are secured just right so they 
will stay in place in storm or battle. It is because they 
care about their work, they recognise the importance of 
what they do, and they take immense pride in it. Before 
our customers will give us sensitive work, they have to 
trust us. And to win business we have to come up with 
innovative solutions which will enable governments to 
deliver more, and better, for less. This is why our Values  
of Trust, Care, Innovation and Pride are so important.  
We don’t pretend to be saints, or to be holier-than-thou; 
we are not so naïve as to believe that in a workforce of 
over 50,000 people there will not be some uncaring bad 
eggs. But the overwhelming majority of our colleagues 
are decent, hard-working, committed, and want to 
make a positive difference to those they serve. In this, 
we reflect the values of our customers, which they call a 
“public service ethos”, and we call our Values.
Our organising principles
Our organising principles have to reflect the fact that 
many of the things our customers want are mutually 
exclusive: they want excellent and resilient services, 
delivered by highly motivated staff, but they want 
them to be low cost; they want local accountability and 
flexibility, but they also want strong governance and 
risk management. As a management team, we believe 
in the principle of subsidiarity: that decisions should be 
taken by managers who are as close to the customer as 
possible. But we are also conscious of the fact that many 
of our contracts carry with them risks that need careful 
management and supervision. So we describe our 
organising principles with two concepts: 'loose-tight', 
and 'disciplined entrepreneurialism'. Neither of these 
is our own invention; they are based on the work of, 
respectively, Tom Peters and Jim Collins. They describe 
in subtly different ways an approach to management 
which recognises the need for both local management 
autonomy and strong governance. Two quotations from 
their works give a taste of the type of organisation we 
are trying to achieve:
“Loose-Tight… is the co-existence of firm central direction 
and maximum individual autonomy. …Organisations 
that live by the loose-tight principle, are on the one hand 
rigidly controlled, yet at the same time allow (indeed insist 
on), autonomy, entrepreneurship, and innovation from 
their people. " Tom Peters: In Search of Excellence
“Avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy and instead create a 
culture of discipline. When you put two complementary 
forces together – a culture of discipline with an ethic 
of entrepreneurship – you get a magical alchemy of 
superior performance and sustained results.”  
Jim Collins: Good to Great
Our method
The method we use to deliver our aspiration – to be the best-managed business in our sector – and to deliver our  
strategy is to concentrate on doing four things really well. These are the things we want Serco to be famous for:
Being profitable  
and sustainable
Winning good business Executing brilliantly
Being a place people  
are proud to work
We try to make sure that everything we do improves our performance against one or more of these objectives, and 
start from a position where we know we can do much better. We can improve the way we bid and manage contracts; 
develop innovative propositions; measure performance; reduce the cost and improve the quality of our administrative 
systems and processes. None of these comes easily or quickly, and we need to steer a tricky course between the 
urgent need to reduce our costs in line with reduced revenues in the short term and investing in systems and 
processes that will produce sustainable benefits in the long term.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
15 Strategic Report
Our performance framework continued
Our deliverables
The tangible evidence of our success or otherwise will 
be a return to industry rates of growth and margins. In 
recent years our revenues have been shrinking and our 
underlying trading margins are far too low at around 
2–3%. Our challenge, and our opportunity, is to get back 
to long-term industry rates of Revenue growth, which in 
the past were around 5–7%, and Trading Profit margins 
across Serco’s mix of business in the range of 5–6%. In 
the last two years the rate of growth in our markets has 
probably declined as the UK, which is our largest region 
by revenues, having seen reduced expenditure in key 
government departments driven in part by the necessary 
focus on the challenge of Brexit. However, there is no 
reason to believe that the long term future rate of growth 
should be any different from the long term historic rate 
of growth. If this turns out to be correct, and markets 
turn out as expected, we believe that after a period of 
restructuring and transformation, it will be possible to 
increase growth rates and margins towards the historic 
average of our industry and to levels necessary to deliver 
appropriate returns. 
Progress to date
In terms of progress towards our goals, in 2014 we 
identified three distinct phases in the implementation of 
our strategy. The first phase – Stabilisation – recognised 
the urgent need to recapitalise the business and restore 
customer confidence and employee morale following 
the very significant write-downs following the realisation 
that Serco had a number of very heavily loss-making 
contracts. This phase was largely completed in 2014, 
although the fundraising and essential stabilisation of our 
balance sheet did not take place until 2015 after which 
further rebuilding of customer confidence and trust 
could then follow. The Transformation phase gathered 
pace in 2016 and 2017, and in practice will continue 
through into 2018 and 2019, and will be an essential 
underpin as we progressively move into the Growth 
stage. When we launched the plan, it was conceived 
that Growth would refer to both revenues and profit. 
However, more recently, we believe that market rates 
of growth have been declining and certainly for the 
next few years revenues are likely to be flat, but margins 
will increase as we extend our Transformation phase 
and see more growth coming from cost reduction and 
increased efficiency. Nature does not draw lines – she 
smudges them, and the same applies to our strategy 
implementation, where the phases of Stabilisation, 
Transformation and Growth necessarily overlap.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 In terms of progress in the Transformation phase:
• We have successfully strengthened our balance sheet, 
following the Rights Issue completed in April 2015 
and the disposal of our private sector BPO business; 
together these raised over £700m, and our Net Debt: 
EBITDA now stands at 1.4x, with period-end net debt 
reduced from £745m at the end of 2013 to £141m at 
the end of 2017.
• We have made further excellent progress rebuilding 
confidence and trust with our major customers, 
in large part due to greatly improved operational 
performance.
• Portfolio rationalisation has been completed, 
concluding with the disposal of the majority of our 
private sector BPO business at the end of 2015.
• We continue to mitigate the impact of loss-making 
contracts; we have always regarded our Onerous 
Contract Provisions as a portfolio, knowing that the 
actual out-turn on individual contracts would almost 
certainly be different from the original estimates 
made at the end of 2014. Up to the end of 2017, actual 
expenditure against the £447m of Onerous Contract 
Provisions has been very close to the original estimate.
• We continue to strengthen our sector propositions, 
most particularly through the work carried out by our 
CoEs covering Health, Justice & Immigration, and 
Transport. These CoEs have been heavily involved in 
developing propositions to support major bids such 
as Barts Health NHS Trust (won in 2016), and Grafton 
prison in Australia (our largest ever order, worth 
£1.5bn, won in 2017).
• Our order intake has grown very substantially, and 
in 2017 was for the first time since 2012 ahead of our 
revenues, resulting in an increase in our order book, 
which at the end of 2017 stood at £10.7bn.
• We have succeeded in reducing the businesses' 
operating costs; in 2017 they were more than £1bn 
lower than in 2014. The majority of this reduction 
relates to costs removed from contracts which have 
ended and businesses disposed of, but it is certainly 
an achievement to have reduced costs broadly in 
line with revenues. Importantly, our cost reduction 
also includes over £100m removed through our 
programmes to deliver savings by reducing the 
number of management layers, implementing better 
procurement and driving greater efficiency in the 
operation of shared services.
Summary
We believe we have the right strategy for our business, 
and over the last three years we have delivered in each 
year results which have been in line with our plan, which 
is no mean achievement. So far, so good, but the real 
test of the strategy will be our ability to start growing 
again. The market is currently growing at rates below 
historic trend, and we think that the growth we expect to 
achieve in 2018 and 2019 will come more from increasing 
cost efficiency and transformation than from growing 
revenues. It is nevertheless the case that if we can deliver 
the margin growth we are targeting over the coming 
years, this will of itself drive very considerable growth  
in profits.

Key Performance Indicators
We use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor our performance, ensuring  
we have a balance and an appropriate emphasis to both financial and non-financial 
aspects. In recent years, we have also evolved and improved our Management 
Information, including the contract performance monitoring process which tracks  
KPIs specific to each customer operation, our monthly management accounts and  
our Divisional Performance Review (DPR) processes.
Definition
Trading Profit is defined as IFRS Operating Profit adjusted for (i) 
amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition 
and (ii) exceptional items; it includes the impact of discontinued 
operations for consistency with previous disclosures. Consistent with 
IFRS, it includes Serco’s share of profit after interest and tax of its 
joint ventures and associates. Underlying Trading Profit additionally 
excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (principally 
Onerous Contract Provision (OCP) releases or charges), as well as the 
beneficial treatment of depreciation and amortisation of assets held 
for sale in prior years, and other material one-time items as set out in 
the Finance Review.
Relevance to strategy
The level of absolute UTP and the relationship of UTP with revenue – 
i.e. the margin we earn on what our customers pay us – is at the heart 
of our ‘profitable and sustainable’ business objective, as well as being 
an output of ‘winning good business’ and ‘executing brilliantly’. We 
describe on page 16 that the delivery of strategic success, after the 
completion of further transformation, has potential to deliver revenue 
growth of 5–7% and trading margins of 5–6%.
Performance
The outcome was at the top end of our guidance of £65–70m given  
at the start of the year. The reduction on 2016 was driven by the first 
half of that year benefiting from £11m of non-recurring trading items. 
The underlying margin reduced from 2.7% to 2.4%.
Definition
Underlying EPS reflects the Underlying Trading Profit measure after 
deducting pre-exceptional net finance costs (including those for 
discontinued operations) and related tax effects. It takes into account 
any non-controlling interests share of the result for the period, and 
divides the remaining result that is attributable to the equity owners 
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period in accordance with IFRS.
Relevance to strategy
EPS builds on the relevance of UTP , and further reflects the 
achievement of being ‘profitable and sustainable’ by taking into 
account not just our ability to grow revenue and margin but also the 
strength and costs of our financial funding and tax arrangements.  
EPS is therefore a measure of financial return for our shareholders.
Performance
The reduction reflects the UTP performance as described, partially 
offset by incurring lower finance costs; our underlying effective tax 
rate and the number of shares were broadly flat in 2017 versus 2016.
Definition
Free Cash Flow is the net cash flow from operating activities before 
exceptional items in accordance with IFRS and as shown on the face 
of the Group’s Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, adding dividends 
we receive from joint ventures and associates, and deducting net 
interest paid and net capital expenditure on tangible and intangible 
asset purchases.
Relevance to strategy
FCF is a further reflection on how ‘sustainable’ our profits are, as well 
as the sustainability of the overall business, by showing a measure 
of how much of our effort turns into cash to reinvest back into the 
business or to deploy in other ways. Furthermore, ‘winning good 
business’ should reflect that which generates appropriate cash returns, 
and ‘executing brilliantly’ should include appropriate management of 
our working capital cash flow cycles.
Performance
Cash generated from UTP was largely offset by the outflows related to 
loss-making contracts subject to OCPs. These cash outflows lessened 
in 2017 versus 2016, as reflected in the lower rate of OCP utilisation. 
The working capital outflow was also lower at £9m, which included 
£8m of reduction in the utilisation of the Group’s receivables financing 
facility, resulting in zero utilisation by the end of 2017.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 Definition
ROIC is calculated as UTP for the period divided by the invested 
capital balance. Invested capital represents the assets and liabilities 
considered to be deployed in delivering the trading performance of 
the business. Invested capital assets are: goodwill and other intangible 
assets; property, plant and equipment; interests in joint ventures 
and associates; trade and other receivables; inventories; and assets 
classified as held for sale. Invested capital liabilities are trade and 
other payables (current and non-current) and liabilities classified as 
held for sale. For 2014, invested capital is calculated using the closing 
balance sheet position, given the impact of the Contract & Balance 
Sheet Review during that year; for all other years it is calculated as a 
two-point average of the opening and closing balance sheet positions.
Relevance to strategy
ROIC measures how efficiently the Group uses its capital to generate 
returns from its assets. To be a sufficiently ‘profitable and sustainable’ 
business, a return must be achieved that is appropriately above a 
cost of capital hurdle reflective of the typical returns required by our 
weighting of the use of equity and debt capital.
Definition
Major incidents are classed as fatalities, fractures, amputations, 
dislocations, loss of sight, chemical and hot metal burns, electrical 
burns, unconsciousness caused by asphyxia or exposure to a 
harmful substance, and acute illness resulting from substance 
inhalation or ingestion. 
Relevance to strategy
Delivering excellent service to our customers, and therefore ‘executing 
brilliantly’, requires us to operate in the safest way possible. Safety 
also has a direct bearing on the commitment and engagement of our 
people, which is central to achieving ‘a place people are proud to work’.
Performance
There were 29 major incidents reported in 2017 . This resulted in a 
frequency rate of 0.30 per 1m hours worked which is 11% up on 2016 
and exceeds our target which was set at 0.23. This indicator has been 
impacted by increasing numbers of physical assaults and particularly 
serious physical assaults within our Justice & Immigration business.  
This and the range of initiatives being implemented to address the 
situation are covered in the Corporate Responsibility Report.
Definition
We partner with Aon Hewitt to run Viewpoint, our global employee 
engagement survey. This covers all employees, excluding our joint 
ventures, and focuses on three key areas: whether people say positive 
things about working at Serco (‘say’), people’s intention to stay with 
Serco (‘stay’) and their intention to give discretionary effort (‘strive’). 
Our engagement score shows how many employees exhibit strong 
levels of all three of these areas when we survey. 
Relevance to strategy
Employee engagement reflects ‘a place people are proud to work’, 
which is crucial to delivering outstanding customer service and 
achieving our strategic aims.
Performance
2017’s Viewpoint survey, which is based on some 31,000 employees 
responding, showed a fourth successive year of improvement in 
our global score. The score is now at the highest level since we 
started measuring it in 2011. The Viewpoint results are cascaded to 
the organisation each year and we have a global plan of activity in 
place to sustain and drive further employee engagement, led by our 
Executive Committee. 
Definition
The estimated aggregate value at the end of the reporting period of 
new bid opportunities with estimated Annual Contract Value (ACV) 
of at least £10m and which we expect to bid and to be adjudicated 
within a rolling 24-month timeframe. The Total Contract Value (TCV) 
of individual opportunities is capped at £1bn. The value of re-bid and 
extension opportunities is specifically excluded so as to measure only 
‘new’ growth opportunities. Also excluded is the potential value of 
framework agreements, prevalent in the US in particular where there 
are numerous arrangements classed as ‘IDIQ’ – Indefinite Delivery/
Indefinite Quantity.
Relevance to strategy
The pipeline provides the key potential for ‘winning good business’ and 
therefore is a major input to being ‘profitable and sustainable’. The size 
of the pipeline and our win-rate conversion of the bids within it will also 
ultimately be at the heart of successfully achieving a shift further into the 
third and final stage of our strategy implementation – the ‘Grow’ stage.
Performance
As anticipated, the pipeline was noticeably lower given the number of 
unusually large opportunities that moved through the pipeline over 
the course of 2017 but also reflecting challenging market conditions 
in terms of the lower level of new opportunities being added. The 
reduction included winning new business, which is reflected in the 
order intake (the value of all signed contracts) being strong at £3.4bn

Performance
The reduction in ROIC reflects both the lower UTP as described, 
as well as slightly higher invested capital largely resulting from the 
normalisation of average working capital balances. We expect an 
improvement in ROIC to be driven by the development in profit 
margin when we successfully complete the ‘Transform’ stage and 
make progress with the ‘Grow’ phase of our strategy.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk management approach
We are faced with a number of challenges and risks due 
to the diverse services we provide around the world. We 
have to respond to the changing political environment 
which in some cases has unknown consequences. 
Brexit is just one example, where today there are few 
conclusions as to the real impacts, both negative and 
positive, on our economic landscape in the UK, Europe 
and the wider global economy. 
We manage risks through our risk management 
policy, standards, and risk management lifecycle 
processes. The risk management lifecycle includes 
six key processes that aim to manage the key risks to 
our operations. This enables us to have a consistent 
approach to identifying, analysing, monitoring 
and reporting risks and a mechanism for providing 
assurance that the risk mitigation in place is effective. 
These align to the guidance contained within the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and form part of 
the Serco Management System (SMS). The SMS is a 
set of requirements and procedures that define how 
we operate and how we behave. This system seeks 
to ensure that we identify, review and report risks 
at all levels of our business, reflecting the nature 
of the activities being undertaken at that level, the 
business and operational risks and the level of control 
considered necessary to protect our interests and  
those of our stakeholders.
Management oversight and risk appetite
We have a systematic approach to our risk oversight, 
with nominated people tasked to ensure that the 
risk management framework is understood and 
implemented, together with reporting requirements. 
This allows for a robust reporting structure, both top 
down and bottom up, with a current focus on better 
aligning the Business and Divisional risks to our 
principal risks, and vice versa.
The Group Risk Committee (initiated in 2016, as a 
focused committee that previously was covered as part 
of the responsibilities of the Corporate Responsibility 
and Risk Committee) is now fully embedded, reporting 
quarterly to the Board, and this has improved our 
management oversight on the principal risks  
(see pages 93 to 95 for the detailed Corporate 
Governance Report). ‘Deep Dives’ into a number of 
principal risks are carried out during the year, together 
with a review of the operating environment  
to determine any changes to our ‘Top 10’ risks. 
Each of our risks have an appetite statement to 
determine the nature and amount of risk that the 
Group is willing to accept as well as informing our 
decision-making as to the level of resource that should 
be expended to mitigate the principal risks. These 
statements are aligned to our Values, Code of Conduct 
and other ethical requirements to support and drive 
the right risk culture within the Group. 
Principal risks
Our Executive Committee reviews the principal risks 
facing the Group to ensure they remain current, taking 
into consideration the various Divisional risk registers 
and any emerging risks that would threaten the 
execution of Serco’s strategy, business model,  
future performance, solvency and liquidity. 
The resulting principal risks have been reviewed 
and endorsed by the Risk Committee. Each risk is 
classified as strategic, financial, operational, people, 
hazard, legal and compliance. They are described 
on the following pages, together with the relevant 
strategic business objectives, key risk drivers, the 
Group-wide material controls which have been put in 
place to mitigate the principal risks, and the mitigation 
priorities going forward to improve the effectiveness 
of the controls. 
The risks are considered over a three-year timeframe 
which is the same time period that has been used in 
the Viability Statement (see pages 30 and 31). The 
Viability Statement takes into account the principal 
risks in its assessment.

RISK PLANNING 
• Assigning responsibility for 
risk management implementation, 
planning the approach and 
capturing this information in a Risk 
Management Plan (RMP)
RISK MITIGATION 
• Identifying controls that will 
reduce material risks to a target risk 
rating aligned with our risk appetite, 
and implementing cost-effective 
mitigation and contingency 
actions that improve the 
effectiveness of controls
RISK 
MONITORING
•• Monitoring mitigation 
actions and their impact (so as 
to improve the effectiveness of 
controls and improve the residual 
risk rating)
•• Monitoring changes to our 
business and the external 
environment, to ensure we 
have sight of and respond 
appropriately to 
emerging risks
RISK ANALYSIS
• Assessing the level 
of inherent and residual risk 
exposure, based on an assessment 
of the probability of an identified 
risk materialising, and the impact 
if it does, using a standard risk 
scoring system, taking into 
account effectiveness of 
current controls
RISK REPORTING
• Reporting of the status of 
material risks up through the 
management chain to the next 
organisational level, to provide 
assurance that business risks are 
being appropriately managed and 
controls in place are effective
RISK IDENTIFICATION
• Identifying risks associated 
with achievement of our business 
objectives. Includes potential risks 
from external factors arising from 
the environment within which we 
operate, and internal risks arising 
from the nature of our business

STRATEGIC RISKS
Failure to grow profitably 
Failure to win material bids or renew material contracts profitably, or a lack of opportunities in our chosen markets, will restrict  
growth and may have an adverse impact on Serco’s long-term financial viability.
Our business is linked to changes in the economy, fiscal and monetary policy, political stability and leadership, budget priorities,  
and the perception and attitude of governments and the wider public to outsourcing, which could result in decisions not to outsource 
services or lead to delays in placing work.
Failure to manage our reputation  
Failure to manage our reputation will mean that customers will be less likely to give us new business or renew existing business. It will also 
impact our ability to attract and retain high-quality people.
Key risk drivers: 
Lack of opportunities in chosen markets – some 
market sectors may not have a favourable policy of 
private sector provision of public services, reducing 
pipeline opportunities.
External factors reducing the pipeline of 
opportunities – political and policy changes in 
our markets (such as changes in federal or state 
governments, or decisions such as Brexit) may make 
it more difficult for us to win in some geographies, or 
result in fewer opportunities.
Failure to be competitive – lack of appropriate 
references and value proposition for the markets in 
which we compete, may put us at a disadvantage to 
our competitors.
Inability to meet customer and solution 
requirements during design, implementation and 
delivery – executing our bids in an unsatisfactory 
manner by not understanding the strategic needs of 
the customer, mispricing bids, developing inefficient 
or non-innovative solutions, and misunderstanding 
risks, may prevent us from achieving our growth 
ambitions.
Ineffective business development – poor 
account management, market shaping, proposition 
development and visibility of pipeline opportunities 
will affect our ability to set targets for growth, 
understand business wins and drive process 
improvements.
Failure to obtain or capitalise on benefits from 
our Transformation Programme – (see ‘Failure to 
deliver expected benefits from Transformation’).
Key risk drivers: 
Failure to clearly define what Serco stands for and 
how we wish to be seen – may result in inconsistent 
communication and misunderstanding by our key 
stakeholders.
Not understanding our customers’ and 
stakeholders’ expectations – may result in a failure 
to recognise changes in our business environment or 
our customers’ priorities.
Failure to manage incidents appropriately – 
may result in us not responding in a collaborative 
approach with our customers, or not communicating 
in an open and ethical manner to key stakeholders. 
Material controls:
• Serco Group Strategy focusing on 
specific markets and geographies 
with the greatest growth potential.
• Serco Operating Model.
• Investment Committee.
• Serco Management System (SMS).

• Pipeline and Business Development 
spend reviews to ensure efficient 
deployment of resources.
• Divisional Performance Reporting 
(DPR) process.
• Annual Performance Reviews, Talent

processes.
Mitigation priorities:
• Review pipeline opportunities 
to ensure all market activity is 
accurately captured.

and SME resources to ensure our 
propositions remain competitive.
• Streamline and standardise the 
Business Development processes.
• Refinement of BLRT process to 
ensure lessons learnt and price-to-
win competitive analysis are formally 
embedded in the solution process.
• Continued focus on account 
management for major re-bids 
to ensure existing clients are 
experiencing good service from 
Serco and fully understand the value 
and quality of our services.
• Continuation of efficiency 
improvements to Group and

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 22 FINANCIAL RISKS
Failure to deliver expected benefits from Transformation  
If components of the Transformation Programme do not deliver the anticipated benefits, then we will not achieve the efficiency savings 
needed to become a sufficiently profitable and growing business.
Financial control failure 
Financial control failure may result in: an inability to accurately report timely financial results and meet contractual financial reporting 
obligations; a heightened risk of error and fraud; poor quality data leading to poor business decisions; an inability to forecast accurately; 
the failure to create a suitable capital structure; and an inability to make critical financial transactions; therefore, leading to financial 
instability, potential business losses and negative reputational impact. 
Key risk drivers: 
Non-delivery of required benefits – we fail 
to achieve the expected benefits due to poor 
programme management and/or solution design.
Severe disruption to the business – we fail to 
coordinate and prioritise the various programme 
objectives due to poor integration across activities 
and inadequate programme management, and we 
negatively impact on ‘Business As Usual’ activities.
Watering down of value/ambition of Group 
Operating model – due to a sum of compromises 
across the organisation and the possible 
misalignment across the Divisions.
Failure of the businesses to understand the 
imperative to change – due to ineffective 
communication from the leadership teams.
Failure to comply with new operating model – due 
to ineffective enforcement of the model and changes 
not embedded into the business.
Failure to communicate the change and impact of 
the change to clients – potentially causing opposing 
short-term drivers.
Key risk drivers: 
Not setting the right tone from the top – without 
which, we may fail to embed the finance policy, 
processes and controls. 
Poor financial processes – if processes are poorly 
designed, then inaccuracies and fraud may occur.
Inadequate financial controls within the business 
– if controls are inadequate we may fail to provide 
adequate protection from sabotage of systems, fraud 
and error. 
Impact of Transformation Programme activities 
– programme activities may lead to poor change 
control or an unstable financial control environment 
due to an increased workload on the finance 
community.
Failure of Finance Transformation Programme 
– we do not transform the finance processes and 
controls, and fail to deliver expected benefits.
Material controls:
• Serco Operating Model objectives.
• Group Transformation Programme 
Management Office (PMO) and 
Programme Governance Boards.
• Programme risk management 
process.
• Stakeholder engagement and 
communication plans.
• Serco Management System (SMS).
• Divisional Performance Reporting 
(DPR) process.
• Benefits management process.
• Embedding benefits within 
Divisional budgets.
Mitigation priorities:
• Development of programme benefit 
cards to facilitate measurement of 
anticipated benefits.
• Full alignment of Group, Divisions 
and Business Units to Operating 
Model.
• Refine DPR to capture transformation 
delivery and performance.
Material controls:

Mitigation priorities:
• Continued delivery of finance 
transformation programme.
• Complete knowledge transfer 
process within the UK.
• Embedding new forecasting tool, 
policies and practices.
• Continuous improvement of 
reporting processes as a result of 
better data capture.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties continued
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Major information security breach  
A major information security breach resulting in the loss or compromise of sensitive information (including personal or customer) or wilful 
damage resulting in the loss of service, causing significant reputational damage, financial penalties and loss of customer confidence.
Due to the nature of the services we provide, our technology and operational systems will be subject to threats from both internal  
and external breaches. We implement effective controls proportionate to the level of sensitivity of the information we are protecting, 
and where 'things go wrong', we act swiftly to minimise the impact of any breach and carry out remedial actions to prevent further 
breaches immediately.
Contract non-compliance, non-performance or misreporting 
Failure to deliver contractual requirements or failure to meet and report against agreed service performance levels accurately may lead  
to significant financial penalties, legal notices, onerous contract provisions, or ultimately early termination of contracts.
If the misreporting is deliberate, it may constitute fraud, and the Group may be subject to litigation, inquiries or investigations that could 
divert management time and resources, and result in penalties, sanctions, variation or revocation of permissions and authorisations, 
suspension or debarment from doing business with government customers.
Key risk drivers: 
Non-compliant systems – if our systems are non-
compliant with regulatory requirements for sensitive 
information, we are susceptible to breaches and 
penalties.
Non-compliance with policies and standards 
– if staff do not comply with Serco policies and 
standards, then they may accidentally release 
sensitive information to third parties.
Vulnerability of systems and information – if we 
do not identify sensitive information and protect 
and test the vulnerability of our systems, then we are 
potentially exposed to a breach.
Unauthorised use of systems – if we do not 
implement effective personnel vetting and access 
restriction processes and controls, then unauthorised 
use of our systems may occur.
Inadequate incident monitoring and response –  
if we do not monitor our systems and remediate and 
repel attacks, then we may fail to minimise the impact 
of any breach.
Key risk drivers: 
Poor leadership and culture – if our leaders do not 
align with our Values, and staff feel under pressure 
to meet challenging operational targets and/or 
performance indicators, then deliberate misreporting 
may occur.
Lack of process and controls – poorly documented 
or poorly communicated processes may lead to 
deliberate or unintentional misreporting or contract 
non-compliance.
Ineffective assurance and human error – 
insufficient oversight and assurance of contract 
performance, could lead to contract non-compliance, 
non-performance or a misreporting of performance.
Poor understanding of contract obligations –  
may result in staff failing to acknowledge and act on 
obligations or a failure to provide adequate resources 
to deliver against contractual obligations.
Poor systems/IT – unreliable or incorrectly 
configured systems may result in late or incorrect 
data produced.
Material controls:
• Enterprise Architecture Boards and 
Solution Review meetings.
• Serco Management System (SMS).
• IT security infrastructure, process 
and controls.
• Privilege User Management (PUM)

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 24 PEOPLE RISKS
Failure of business critical partner, sub-contractor or supplier 
As a result of the failure of a business critical partner, sub-contractor or supplier
1
 to deliver and/or perform to the required standard, 
Serco may be unable to meet its customer obligations or perform critical business operations which could result in a financial, 
operational or reputational impact.
1  A partner, sub-contractor or supplier on whom Serco depends to deliver customer critical services or perform critical Serco business operations and 
therefore ability to earn revenue.
Failure to act with integrity 
Being found to have engaged in a significant corrupt or dishonest act (bribery, fraud, misreporting, cheating, and lying) leads to customers 
being reluctant to do business with such organisations. Such behaviour might arise through the actions of rogue employees or as a result 
of pressures individuals feel they are being placed under (culture). Such acts might lead to the loss of existing business; restrictions on our 
ability to bid or win new business; our ability to attract high-quality people or partners; and an adverse impact on shareholder, investor 
and financial institutions' confidence in Serco.
Key risk drivers: 
Ineffective procurement and supply chain 
governance – no Group functional owner for 
procurement resulting in inconsistencies in 
implementation of standards, potential non-
compliance to those standards and lack of 
consequence management for non-compliance. 
Identification of significant suppliers – a failure 
to identify who are our critical suppliers may result 
in lack of focused oversight, and understanding of 
the impacts on Serco should they fail to deliver our 
customer critical service.
Limited oversight – resulting in poor sourcing, 
contracting and monitoring of business critical 
partners, sub-contractors and suppliers as well as 
the potential for engaging in ineffective or onerous 
contracts with suppliers or sub-contractors.
Lack of resilience in the supply chain – exposing 
us to potential service provision or financial losses 
should they have ineffective Business Continuity and 
Disaster Recovery plans.
Key risk drivers: 
Failure to communicate – if we do not define and 
communicate our Values and expected standards 
adequately, our staff and third parties will fail to 
understand these, which may result in inappropriate 
leadership actions and low engagement with  
our Values.
Our ways of working do not align with our  
Values – staff or third parties being unaware of 
and/or not reflecting our Values may result in poor 
decision-making, unacceptable business conduct, 
and unethical or illegal behaviour bringing our 
operations into disrepute.
Direct or indirect contribution to human rights 
abuse – staff either directly or indirectly contributing 
to human rights (including slavery and forced labour) 
abuses may result in a breach of laws/regulations.

HAZARD RISKS
Catastrophic incident 
An incident or accident as a result of Serco’s actions or failure to effectively respond to an event that results in multiple fatalities,  
severe property/asset damage/loss or very serious long term environmental damage.
Key risk drivers: 
Lack of capability and experience – if our chosen 
market sectors are not aligned to our capability and 
experience, then a failure to operate optimally may 
result in a serious event.
Lack of safety cultural alignment – a safety culture 
which does not reflect our Values and fails to engage 
our staff and work safely may result in a serious event.
Ineffective or inadequate policies, standards and 
procedures – if procedures/systems are not aligned 
with industry standard or customer expectations, an 
unacceptable level of safety management may occur. 
Insufficient safety management oversight – 
devolved compliance of regulations to sector-specific 
SMEs without appropriate safety management 
oversight may result in safety management systems 
which are not fit for purpose.
Factors resulting in unsafe conditions – a lack 
of identification and assessment of risks, sudden 
equipment failure or inadequate security may result in 
poor mitigation of and/or response to a serious event.
Inadequate response to a catastrophic event – if 
our contingency plans do not provide an adequate 
response to an event then escalation of an event or 
prolonged disruption may occur.
Material controls:
• Serco Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE) Strategy.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26 LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS
Material legal and regulatory compliance failure 
Serco is subject to numerous laws and regulations as a result of the complexity and breadth of the sectors and jurisdictions in which 
it operates. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may cause significant loss and damage to the Group including exposure to 
regulatory prosecution and fines, reputational damage and the potential loss of licences and authorisations, all of which may prejudice 
the prospects for future bids and the retention of existing business. Defending legal proceedings may be costly and may also divert 
management attention away from running the business for a prolonged period. Uninsured losses or financial penalties resulting from 
any current or threatened legal actions may also have a material adverse effect on the Group.
Key risk drivers: 
Lack of governance and oversight – may result in 
a failure to identify potential or actual breaches to 
legal requirements and result in a failure to respond 
appropriately, or weaken our ability to confirm 
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
Failure to comply with the SMS and contractual 
obligations – may result in compliance failures 
for Group-wide material legal and regulatory 
requirements.
Failure to identify and respond to material 
changes in legal and regulatory requirements – 
may result in key subject matter experts within the 
business not remaining up to date and we then fail to 
comply with material legal and regulatory obligations.
Lack of awareness by employees of the legal 
and regulatory requirements placed upon them 
– may result in lack of identification and subsequent 
compliance to requirements.
Inadequate provision of systems and tools – 
may result in ineffective methods to support the 
management of legal and regulatory compliance.
Material controls:
• Automated alerts on material legal 
and regulatory obligations and 
changes. 
• Investment Committee process and 
governance. 
• Third party due diligence.
• Serco Management System (SMS).
• Legal Tracker case management

SFO investigation
We remain under investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO). We are cooperating fully with the SFO's 
investigation but it is not possible to predict the outcome. No conclusion has yet been reached. However, in the 
event that the SFO decides to charge, the range of possible adverse outcomes is any one or a combination of 
the following: 
• that the SFO prosecutes the individuals and/or the Serco Group companies involved, who may defend the action 
successfully or be convicted. This may result in significant financial penalties, an impact on existing contracts and 
Serco being subject to a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with UK Government entities; or
• that the SFO and the relevant Serco entities enter into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) – which may 
result in significant financial penalties and a period of discretionary debarment from future contracts with UK 
Government entities. Such debarment would be discretionary in the sense that a contracting authority may 
consider it not to be relevant to a given bid or re-bid, or that Serco has provided sufficient evidence that it 
has addressed any issues identified in a DPA, or be limited in time under the terms of the Public Contract 
Regulations 2015.
Upon any such conviction or DPA, the amount of additional work given to the Group may be reduced, and the 
Group may be subject to enhanced scrutiny with respect to its other contracts and further actions beyond those 
implemented under the Corporate Renewal Programme may need to be taken. 
If the Group faces any criminal convictions, debarment consequences or enters into a DPA, any such outcome 
could result in significant fines and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s ability to contract with the UK 
Government and on its reputation, which would, in turn, materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, 
operations and prospects.
In addition, a criminal conviction of a Serco entity or of one or more of the Group’s current or former employees 
would in certain circumstances allow the Ministry of Justice to re-open the £64.3m settlement agreed and paid in 
2013 in respect of certain issues arising under the Electronic Monitoring Contract. In those limited circumstances, 
the UK Government may seek additional payments from Serco.
We will continue to cooperate with the SFO's investigation.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 28 Material changes to principal risks
Failure of business critical partners, sub-contractor or supplier
Following the 2017 November Group Risk Committee meeting, this new risk was proposed and accepted by the 
Board. We have a fundamental business dependence on critical partners, sub-contractors and suppliers, as a result 
of which, the failure of any of these to deliver and/or perform to the required standard, may result in our inability to 
meet customer obligations or to perform critical business operations. 
(See detail on this risk within the Principal Risk description page 25).
Contract non-compliance, non-performance or misreporting
Previously we reported misreporting of performance and contract non-compliance as separate risks. Both of 
these areas have had a significant focus over the last few years and the positive impacts of these are being seen 
(our Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) demonstrate that our residual risk is decreasing in both areas). This is due to our 
improvements in contract assurance, the increased coverage of our contractual management systems, together 
with the roll out of our operational excellence programmes as well as a better understanding of our contractual  
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and reporting requirements. Given the overlap of the controls in place for both 
these risks, we have determined that they can be combined into a single risk on the Group Risk Register.
Failure to build reputation or act with integrity
This risk has been separated into two discrete risks: failure to manage reputation, and; failure to act with integrity. 
This enables greater ownership and focus given the distinct control sets and mitigation plans. By demerging 
the risks, we are able to assign separate Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Executive Sponsors with the correct 
expertise to take ownership of the risk and develop and implement separate mitigation plans, thereby supporting 
the achievement of our target risk rating.
Failure to attract and retain key resources and skills fit for the future
During 2016/2017, we focused on our Serco leadership model, functional talent boards, succession planning, market 
competitive reward packages, talent pool capability and a number of other initiatives. These initiatives, together 
with existing controls, were considered sufficient to reduce the risk to the extent that it no longer forms part of our 
principal risks. 
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
29 Strategic Report
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code published by  
the Financial Reporting Council in April 2016, the Directors have assessed the prospects  
of the Group over the three-year period to 31 December 2020. 
The Directors believe that a three-year period is 
appropriate since it reflects the fact that:
–  The Group has limited visibility of contract bidding 
opportunities beyond three years.
–  Approximately 50% (2016: 40%) of the current year 
revenue relates to contracts where the contract 
term potentially comes to an end within three years.
–  The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the 
European Union in March 2019 could potentially 
delay timeframes for public service outsourcing 
whilst politicians and civil servants focus on the 
timetable for Brexit and any potential transition 
arrangement.
–  There is also significant political uncertainty in a 
number of our other markets.
The strategic plan set out in March 2015 significantly 
changed the direction of the Group as was necessary 
given its recent history as explained in previous 
shareholder communications and the onerous 
contracts which exist. The Group prepares a five-year 
business plan each year to establish whether it is on 
target to achieve its medium term goals. However, the 
financials for the last two years of this period are largely 
extrapolations of key assumptions as there is insufficient 
certainty, as discussed above, for conclusions to be 
drawn on the future prospects of the Group and for 
sensitivities and mitigation strategies to be overlaid. 
Therefore, whilst the strategic plan continues to be 
developed, it remains a goal for the Group and is a not 
a forecast based on known assumptions and a proven 
track record of performance; this makes assessing the 
longer term viability a challenge. 
Good progress has been made on the five-year plan 
however the ability of the Group to harvest fully 
the benefits of the transformation are still largely 
unproven. Management has previously highlighted the 
dependence on the external market and its ability to 
win new contracts whilst reducing its cost base. Market 
rates of growth have been declining in recent years and 
for the next few years revenues are likely to be flat, but 
margins are expected to increase as the Transformation 
phase is extended and growth comes from cost 
reduction and increased efficiency. The Directors 
expect this to deliver the target margin increases which 
has been set although achieving this will take longer.
The Board and the Group Risk Committee continue to 
monitor the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten the execution of its strategy, 
business model, future performance, solvency and 
liquidity. Management and mitigations of those 
principal risks have been taken into consideration  
when considering the future viability of the Group.  
The Group’s principal risk review, as set out on  
pages 22 to 27, considers the impact of these principal 
risks and the mitigating controls that are in place. 
In assessing the prospects of the Group over the 
three-year period, the Directors have also considered 
the Group’s current financial position as well as its 
financial projections in the context of the Group’s debt 
facilities and associated covenants. These financial 
projections are based on a bottom up Budget exercise 
for 2018 and 2019 which has been approved by the 
Board, and an extrapolation to 2020 using higher level 
assumptions based on local market growth rates and 
identified opportunities. 
The Group’s covenant net debt balance at 31 December 
2017 is £179m. The Group’s base projections indicate 
that debt facilities and projected headroom are 
adequate to support the Group over the next three 
years. In testing the headroom available under the key 
sensitives modelled, the Directors have assumed that 
the Group refinances the portion of the RCF maturing in 
April 2020 under similar terms. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30 The Group’s financial plan has been stress-tested 
against key sensitivities which could materialise as 
a result of the crystallisation of one or many of the 
Group’s principal risks, the objective being that the 
future viability of the Group is tested against severe 
but plausible scenarios. The sensitivities tested include 
a reduction in the win rates for rebids, extensions and 
the pipeline of new opportunities, a delay in delivering 
margin improvements and a potential penalty arising 
from risks such as contract non-compliance, major 
information security breach or a material legal and 
regulatory compliance failure. The ability for the Group 
to absorb these sensitivities within its exiting finance 
arrangements drove the assumptions below which the 
Directors felt appropriate to disclose in making this 
viability statement.
It is unlikely, but not impossible, that the crystallisation 
of a single risk would test the future viability of the 
Group; however, unsurprisingly, and as with many 
companies, it is possible to construct scenarios where 
either multiple occurrences of the same risk, or single 
occurrences of different significant risks, could put 
pressure on the Group’s ability to meet its financial 
covenants. At this point, the Group would look to 
address the issue by exploring a range of options 
including, amongst others, a temporary or permanent 
renegotiation of the financial covenants, disposals of 
parts of the Group’s operations to reduce net debt 
and/or raising additional capital in the form of equity, 
subordinated debt or other such instruments. 
Subject to these risks and on the basis of the 
analysis undertaken, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment. In doing 
so, it is recognised that such future assessments are 
subject to a level of uncertainty that increases further 
out in time and, therefore, future outcomes cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty. The Directors 
have made the following key assumptions in connection 
with this assessment:
–  There is no significant unexpected contract attrition 
of existing work that becomes due for extension or 
rebid over the next three years;
–  There is no significant reduction in scale of existing 
contract operations or future bid pipeline as a 
result of customer policy or other changes;
–  There is no significant deterioration in new bid win 
rates from those anticipated;
–  The Group is able to complete the execution of 
its strategy, including further transformation in 
2018 and 2019, and making progress to revenue 
growth and further margin improvement from 2019 
onwards; and
–  The Group is not subject to any material penalties 
or direct and indirect costs and/or losses arising 
from the current SFO investigation.

Chief Executive's Review
With profits at the top end of the expectations 
we set out some 15 months ago, net debt 
lower than we expected, fully funded pension 
schemes, and strong order intake, we delivered 
a solid performance in 2017 in a difficult market. 
Most importantly, we expect profits to grow 
in both 2018 and 2019. We understand that 
getting to this point has been a long haul 
for investors, and that there is still a long, 
and probably bumpy, road ahead before we 
are producing acceptable returns. But we 
are now moving forward, not backward.
The benefits of our international footprint have never 
been more evident as the UK market for public service 
outsourcing is afflicted by well-publicised traumas. This 
environment may produce opportunities for suppliers 
with strong track records of delivery, and Serco also 
has the advantage of choice as to where we allocate 
resources and effort between different markets. 
Therefore, as well as ensuring that we support our UK 
customers, and respond appropriately to opportunities 
as they arise, we will also be investing in our businesses in 
North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
The challenges facing governments around the world 
remain unchanged. Ageing populations are driving 
demand for more and better public services; almost 
all governments spend more than they receive in tax; 
citizens have ever-higher expectations of the quality of 
public services. In this environment, governments are 
likely to want to use all means at their disposal to deliver 
value for money and high quality public services, which 
should mean a strong continuing role for the private 
sector as a provider of innovation, investment and 
operational management.
Highlights
• Reported Revenue
(1)
 down 2%, comprising a 6% 
organic decline from net contract attrition, partially 
offset by a 4% currency benefit.
• Order intake up 36% at £3.4bn (2016: £2.5bn), includes 
Grafton prison in Australia which is the Group’s 
largest ever contract win, and over 30 other contract 
awards worth more than £10m each across the UK, 
Europe, America and the Middle East; book-to-bill 
ratio of over 100% for the first time since 2012; closing 
order book increased to £10.7bn, up from £9.9bn a 
year earlier.
• Underlying Trading Profit
(2)
 was at the top end of 
our guidance given at the start of the year; run-rate 
throughout 2017 has been approximately 10% ahead 
of that achieved in H2 2016.
• Operating costs reduced in proportion to the scale 
of revenue reduction; further shared services and 
overhead savings of around £20m achieved, taking 
total overhead savings over the last three years to 
over £100m.
• Reported result includes a £16m net charge of Contract 
& Balance Sheet Review adjustments, compared 
to a net release of £14m in 2016; cumulatively over 
the last three years, we are tracking 3% better than 
the Contract & Balance Sheet Review charges taken 
in 2014. Closing balance sheet Onerous Contract 
Provision (OCP) liability now stands at £168m, down 
from £220m in 2016 and £447m in 2014.
• Pre-exceptional tax costs were £14m (2016: £16m),  
and net exceptional costs were significantly lower at 
£25m (2016: £68m).
• Free Cash Flow
(4)
 outflow improved by £26m to 
(£6.7m), which includes (£8m) of outflow as we 
reduced our working capital facility utilisation to zero 
by the end of 2017. Net Debt at £141m (2016: £109m) 
was some £9m below our guidance range at the start 
of the year, and Net Debt : EBITDA leverage of 1.4x 
remains well within our medium term target of 1–2x.
• Pension schemes fully funded and in a surplus on an 
accounting basis; around half of our pension liabilities 
are now fully underwritten by bulk annuity purchases, 
further reducing pension scheme residual risks.
• Pipeline of larger new bid opportunities reduced to 
£4.4bn, as a number of unusually large opportunities 
moved through the pipeline during 2017; £3bn of the 
pipeline are opportunities added over the course 
of 2017.

Net Debt £141.1m £109.3m
Notes to summary table of financial results:
(1)  Revenue is as defined under current IFRS (before adoption of IFRS15), which excludes Serco’s share of revenue of its joint ventures and associates. Revenue 
including that from discontinued operations (£nil in 2017 and £36.8m in 2016) is shown for consistency with previous disclosures. Reported Revenue excludes 
revenue from discontinued operations. Organic revenue growth is the change at constant currency after adjusting to exclude the impact of relevant 
acquisitions or disposals. Change at constant currency is calculated by translating non-Sterling values for the year ended 31 December 2017 into Sterling at 
the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016.
(2)  Trading Profit is defined as IFRS Operating Profit adjusted for (i) amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition and (ii) exceptional items; 
it includes the impact of discontinued operations in 2016. Consistent with IFRS, it includes Serco’s share of profit after interest and tax of its joint ventures 
and associates. Underlying Trading Profit additionally excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (principally Onerous Contract Provision (OCP) 
releases or charges), as well as the beneficial treatment of depreciation and amortisation of assets held for sale during 2016, and other material one-time 
items such as the pension scheme settlement in the first half of 2016 related to the profit on early exit from a UK local authority contract that occurred in the 
second half of 2015. A reconciliation of Underlying Trading Profit to Trading Profit and Reported Operating Profit is as follows:
Year ended 31 December £m 2017 2016 
Underlying Trading Profit 69.8 82.1
Include: non-underlying items  
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (15.8) 14.2
Assets held for sale depreciation and amortisation – 0.5
Other one-time items – 3.5
Trading Profit 54.0 100.3
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition (4.4) (5.1)
Operating Profit Before Exceptional Items (continuing and discontinued operations) 49.6 95.2
Exclude: Operating Loss Before Exceptional Items from discontinued operations
(5)
– 3.3
Reported Operating Profit Before Exceptional Items (continuing operations only) 49.6 98.5
Operating Exceptional Items (continuing operations only) (19.6) (56.3)
Reported Operating Profit (after exceptional items; continuing operations only) 30.0 42.2
(3) Underlying EPS reflects the Underlying Trading Profit measure after deducting pre-exceptional net finance costs and related tax effects.
(4)  Free Cash Flow is the net cash flow from operating activities before exceptional items as shown on the face of the Group’s Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, adding dividends we receive from joint ventures and associates, and deducting net interest paid and net capital expenditure on tangible and 
intangible asset purchases.
(5)  The Global Services division, representing private sector BPO operations, was classified as a discontinued operation in 2015 and 2016. Disposal of the 
offshore business was largely completed in December 2015, with the disposals of two remaining much smaller elements completed in March 2016 and 
December 2016. The residual UK onshore private sector BPO operations were sold or exited in 2016 with the exception of one business, consisting of a single 
contract, which completed in July 2017. Total revenues for the remaining operations were £5.4m and the loss before exceptional items was £0.6m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017, and therefore the results have been included in continuing operations in 2017 on the grounds of materiality.
Reconciliations and further detail of financial performance are included in the Finance Review on pages 50 to 68. This includes full definitions and explanations 
of the purpose and usefulness of each non-IFRS Alternative Performance Measure (APM) used by the Group. The consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes are on pages 151 to 227.
• Acquisition of BTP Systems completed for 
$20m, bringing deep skills in defence satellite 
communication and radar engineering technical 
services, together with a pipeline of $200m.
• We have signed a revised agreement with the Special 
Managers and Provisional Liquidators of Carillion 
plc, and while it is subject to requisite third party 
consents, we continue to work with all relevant parties 
to acquire the portfolio of selected UK health facilities 
management contracts.
• IFRS15 estimated restatement to 2017 not anticipated 
to be significant; decrease revenue by £3m and 
Underlying Trading Profit by £0.3m.
• Guidance for 2018 unchanged: we expect revenues 
to be £2.8–2.9bn, broadly flat in constant currency, 
and Underlying Trading Profit to grow to around 
£80m, driven largely by transformation savings. We 
expect 2019 to see further good growth in Underlying 
Trading Profit.

33 Strategic Report
Chief Executive's Review continued
Summary of financial performance 
Revenue and Trading Profit
Reported Revenue declined 2% to £2,954m (2016: 
£3,011m); this measure excludes Serco’s share of revenue 
from joint ventures and associates of £357m (2016: £481m); 
also excluded in the prior year is revenue of £37m from 
discontinued operations, which reflected the residual 
run-off of the private sector BPO division. Net currency 
movements provided a £122m benefit or a 4% increase. 
At constant currency and adjusting for minor effects of 
relevant acquisitions and disposals, the organic revenue 
decline was £188m or 6%; around a third of the organic 
element of the decline relates to no longer recognising 
as revenue the value of goods purchased on behalf of 
customers following changes to two health procurement 
services contracts in the UK; the balance of the decline 
relates to the ending or transfer of contracts such as those 
for the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory 
(DSTL), Armidale Class Patrol Boats (ACPB) for the Royal 
Australian Navy, Virginia Department of Transportation 
(VDOT), US Army transition assistance (SFLTAP) and 
Western Australia Court Security and Custodial Services 
(WACSCS). These and the effect of other smaller contract 
attrition were only partially offset by growth elsewhere 
including that from the phased start of new services 
during the year at Barts Health NHS Trust, University 
Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and Skills 
Support for the Workforce (SSW).
Underlying Trading Profit was £69.8m (2016: £82.1m), a 
decline of £12.3m or, excluding the £6.5m net currency 
benefit, a decline of £18.8m. The reduction was driven 
by the first half of 2016 benefiting from £11m of non-
recurring trading items, which included: the previous 
higher shareholding and therefore larger share of the 
profits of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE); 
the final settlement arrangements on the transfer of the 
Northern Rail franchise; the conclusion of the VDOT and 
SFLTAP operations; and a spike in activity on a defence 
logistics contract in the Middle East. In addition, as well 
as the attrition impact from profitable contracts coming 
to an end, some of the new contracts added revenue 
growth in 2017 but were at reduced profitability due to 
their initial transition and transformation stages.
In the second half of 2016 our Underlying Trading 
Profit was £31.5m, which was a period that did not 
benefit from the non-recurring trading items that were 
a feature of the first half of 2016, and was a period 
that had broadly comparable average currency rates 
to 2017. Profits in both the first and second half 2017 
were £35m, and therefore we have delivered a run-
rate approximately 10% ahead of that achieved in the 
second half of 2016.
Within our performance for the year, we delivered 
our target of £20m of cost savings from efficiencies in 
central support functions and overheads. Cumulatively 
over the last three years, over £100m of cost has been 
removed through our programmes to deliver savings 
by reducing the number of management layers, 
implementing better procurement and driving greater 
efficiency in the operation of shared services. These 
savings have been central to our efforts to reduce the 
scale of Serco’s cost base in proportion to the scale 
of the revenue reduction incurred through the loss of 
contracts and the disposals undertaken.
Trading Profit was £54.0m (2016: £100.3m), with three 
categories of adjusting items which are within Trading 
Profit, but excluded from our measure of Underlying 
Trading Profit. First, there was a £15.8m net charge 
(2016: net release of £14.2m) within Trading Profit arising 
from the review of Onerous Contract Provisions (OCPs) 
and other Contract & Balance Sheet Review items; the 
OCP adjustments comprised gross charges totalling 
£62m (2016: £56m), partially offset by gross releases 
totalling £43m (2016: £66m). By far the most significant 
charge (£47m) related to the future revenue and cost 
assumptions of operating the Caledonian Sleepers 
contract, though across other OCPs in the UK & Europe 
division there was a net release of £16m and in AsPac 
a net release of £11m. Notwithstanding this year’s net 
charge, it is worth noting that cumulatively over the last 
three years, the net improvement to Trading Profit from 
OCPs and other Contract & Balance Sheet Review items 
is £19m; we are therefore tracking 3% better than the 
original charge taken through Trading Profit in 2014. A 
detailed review of provisions and Contract & Balance 
Sheet Review items is included in the Finance Review on 
pages 50 to 68. The second area that we exclude from 
Underlying Trading Profit is other material one-time 
items; in 2016 we therefore excluded from Underlying 
Trading Profit a £3.5m beneficial pension settlement 
negotiated as part of the early termination of the 
Thurrock contract. Third, and again only related to 2016, 
we excluded the beneficial impact of £0.2m related 
to depreciation and amortisation treatment of assets 
classified as held for sale during 2016.
As with prior years, both Trading Profit and Underlying 
Trading Profit benefited from losses on previously-
identified onerous contracts being neutralised by the 
utilisation of OCPs; the £69m utilised in 2017 was both 
better than our expectations of around £80m, and lower 
than the £84m utilised in 2016. The closing balance of 
OCPs now stands at £168m, compared to £220m a year 
earlier and the initial charge of £447m taken at the end 
of 2014. We expect of the remaining £168m provision 
approximately £70m will be utilised in 2018.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34 Financing and pensions, tax and exceptional costs
Pre-exceptional net finance costs were £11.6m (2016: 
£12.6m); while average net debt of £184m was £65m 
higher than the prior year, the increased cost of 
financing this was more than offset by other small 
movements. Cash net interest paid was £17.0m 
(2016: £19.0m).
Within net finance costs is a net credit of £3.8m (2016: 
£4.7m) related to the strong funding position of Serco’s 
pension schemes. This net credit is lower than the 
prior year following the purchase in June 2017 by the 
Trustees of the Serco Pension and Life Assurance 
Scheme (SPLAS) of a bulk annuity from an insurer, 
which, for a significant proportion of scheme members, 
has the effect of fully removing longevity, investment 
and accounting risks. Assets of the pension scheme 
have been transferred to the insurer to purchase the 
annuity, resulting in a reduction in the IAS19 net balance 
sheet asset. The gross liability remains recognised 
on our balance sheet, but there is now an equal and 
opposite insurance asset reflecting the perfect hedge 
established by the transaction.
Including the effect of the transaction, the overall 
pension scheme accounting surplus, before tax, was 
£26m at 31 December 2017 on a scheme gross asset 
base of £1,385m. As described below, the transaction 
resulted in an exceptional non-cash tax charge of 
£16.1m reflecting a deferred tax adjustment related to 
the pension asset movements. Further details of Serco’s 
pension funding and the bulk annuity purchase are 
described more fully in the Finance Review.
Tax and exceptional costs
The underlying effective tax cost was £20.6m (2016: 
£24.4m), representing an underlying effective rate of 
35% (2016: 35%) based upon £58.2m (2016: £69.5m) 
of Underlying Trading Profit less pre-exceptional net 
finance costs. The rate is higher than the UK statutory 
rate of corporation tax as there was no deferred tax 
credit taken against UK losses incurred in the year, and 
because it reflects the tax charges at locally prevailing 
rates in the international divisions which tend to be 
higher than the UK’s rate; these two factors are partially 
offset by the proportion of Serco’s profit before tax 
generated by consolidating our share of joint venture 
and associate earnings which have already been taxed. 
The Underlying effective rate was lower than our initial 
guidance of approximately 50% due to a beneficial 
mix of profitability earned for the year, and due to a 
one-off effect of UK tax legislation enactment being 
recognised as an exceptional tax cost rather than within 
the underlying measure.
Tax on non-underlying items was a net credit of £6.6m 
(2016: credit of £8.5m). The principal driver of this has 
been a credit to reflect recognising a UK deferred tax 
asset of £11.1m based upon the improved outlook of 
future profitability; there is now UK deferred tax asset 
totalling £17.4m recognised on the balance sheet; there 
is a further estimated £160m deferred tax asset in the UK 
that is currently unrecognised and therefore contingent 
upon further improvement in the outlook. Total pre-
exceptional tax costs were therefore £14.0m (2016: 
£15.9m). Exceptional tax costs were £5.0m (2016: credit 
of £3.1m). The principal drivers of this were one-time 
non-cash deferred tax adjustments as follows: a charge 
of £16.1m related to the pension asset movements on 
the bulk annuity purchase; a charge of £3.7m related to 
the change in UK tax legislation regarding the speed of 
utilising tax losses and hence our deferred tax assets; 
and a £12.5m credit reflecting the reduction in the US 
deferred tax liability following the fall in future expected 
US rates primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts & 
Jobs Act in December 2017.
Total tax costs were therefore £19.0m (2016: £12.8m). 
Cash net tax paid was £11.4m (2016: £5.6m). As previously 
described, although we expect our cash tax to be 
reasonably predictable in future periods, our effective 
tax rates are likely to be volatile until we are able to show 
sufficient profitability in our UK business to be able to 
recognise on our balance sheet all of the UK tax asset 
arising from losses in 2014 and 2015 principally as a result 
of the Contract & Balance Sheet Review. Our guidance of 
the underlying effective tax rate for 2018 is however for 
a modest reduction towards 30%, reflecting our forecast 
mix of profitability and the net effect of US tax reform, 
and for it to continue to reduce further over the longer 
term assuming further improvement in profits.
The Group incurred operating exceptional costs of 
£19.6m (2016: £56.3m), mainly comprising £28.6m 
of restructuring programme costs related to the 
Transformation stage of our strategy, including 
redundancy charges, asset impairments and other 
incremental costs; these were partially offset by a non-
cash credit of £10.3m related to the previous transfer 
of employees from the Serco defined pension scheme 
back to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme 
(PCSPS). Together with exceptional tax costs of £5.0m 
(2016: credit of £3.1m) and exceptional items related 
to discontinued operations were £nil (2016: £14.6m); 
total net exceptional costs were therefore £24.6m 
(2016: £67.8m).

Chief Executive's Review continued
Reported result for the year
The reported result for the year, as presented at the 
bottom of the Group’s Consolidated Income Statement 
on page 158, was a profit of £0.1m (2016: loss of £1.1m). 
This reflects: Trading Profit of £54.0m (2016: £100.3m); 
amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on 
acquisition of £4.4m (2016: £5.1m); pre-exceptional net 
finance costs of £11.6m (2016: £12.6m); a non-cash fair 
value gain of £0.7m (2016: £nil) relating to increasing our 
ownership in a joint venture; pre-exceptional tax costs 
of £14.0m (2016: £15.9m); and total net exceptional costs 
of £24.6m (2016: £67.8m).
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Underlying EPS, which reflects the Underlying Trading 
Profit measure after deducting pre-exceptional finance 
costs and related tax effects, was 3.42p (2016: 4.13p). 
The reduction reflects the lower Underlying Trading 
Profit, partially offset by lower net finance costs; the 
weighted average number of shares in issue was broadly 
unchanged at 1,089.7m (2016: 1,088.3m). Reported EPS, 
which includes the impact of the other non-underlying 
items and lower tax and exceptional costs, was a loss 
per share of 0.02p (2016: loss per share of 0.11p).
Cash Flow and Net Debt
Free Cash Flow was negative £7m (2016: negative 
£33m). Cash generated from Underlying Trading Profit 
was largely offset by the outflows related to loss-
making contracts subject to OCPs. These cash outflows 
lessened versus the prior year, as reflected in the lower 
rate of OCP utilisation. There was a working capital 
outflow of £9m (2016: outflow of £24m), which included 
£8m (2016: £22m) of reduction in the utilisation of the 
Group’s receivables financing facility; at 31 December 
2017 there was £nil utilisation of the £30m facility, 
whereas £8m was utilised a year earlier.
Closing net debt at 31 December 2017 increased to 
£141m (2016: £109m); the increase includes the Free Cash 
outflow, together with a £33m cash outflow related to 
exceptional items. There was a beneficial gross currency 
translation effect on net debt of £17m, predominantly 
reflecting the Group’s US Private Placement debt, 
however this was partially offset by a £3m adverse 
movement on hedging instruments. The closing net debt 
compares to a daily average of £184m (2016: £119m) and a 
peak net debt of £243m (2016: £183m).
At the closing balance sheet date, our leverage for debt 
covenant purposes was 1.4x EBITDA (2016: 0.7x), which 
compares with the covenant requirement to be less than 
3.5x and remains well within our medium term target 
range of 1–2x.
Dividends
The Board is not recommending the payment of a 
dividend in respect of the 2017 financial year. The 
Board’s appraisal of the appropriateness of dividend 
payments takes into account the Group’s underlying 
earnings, cash flows and financial leverage, together 
with the requirement to maintain an appropriate level 
of dividend cover and the prevailing market outlook. 
Although the Board is committed to resuming dividend 
payments as soon as it believes it prudent to do so, 
in assessing whether we should resume dividend 
payments in respect of 2017, we have been mindful 
of the fact there has been a reduction in earnings, a 
free cash outflow and an increase in net debt. In these 
circumstances, the Board believes that it would not be 
prudent to resume dividend payments at the current 
juncture. For 2018, our guidance is for an improvement 
in Underlying Trading Profit, but we anticipate a  
further modest Free Cash outflow and expect net  
debt to still increase, largely as a result of cash outflows 
related to exceptional restructuring costs and taking 
opportunities for value-enhancing infill acquisitions.  
The Board will continue to keep the dividend policy 
under close consideration as we progress with 
transforming the Group and implementing our strategy.
The Revenue and Trading Profit performances are 
described further in the Divisional Reviews. More 
detailed analysis of earnings, cash flow, financing 
and related matters are described further in the 
Finance Review.
Summary of operating performance  
and strategy implementation
Delivering a financial performance for 2017 at the 
top end of our expectations has been accompanied 
by strong operational delivery and further progress 
on implementing our strategy and transformation. 
Within our operating framework, we insist that all our 
management initiatives fit into one or more of four 
categories: winning good business, executing brilliantly, 
making Serco a place people are proud to work, and 
delivering profitability and sustainability.
Problematic contracts continue to reduce in number and 
financial impact versus where we started three years ago, 
and relationships with customers in each of our markets 
are also fundamentally improved. Where we have exited 
contracts during the year, we have done so with pride 
and excellence, mindful of the military adage that you 
judge a battalion as much by how it leaves its barracks, as 
by how it arrives. Where we have started new operations, 
which have involved the transition and recruitment of 
several thousand employees, again I am pleased with the 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 36 skill of our operational managers. Where we are making 
losses on contracts, we are resolute in still delivering 
what is required of us to appropriately serve our 
customers and service users; and while doing so, working 
to improve the financial performance of individual 
contracts. Three years on, it is reassuring to note how 
accurate was our initial estimation of the total level of 
onerous provisions required.
Similarly, delivering cost savings at the same time as 
investing in and improving the business is challenging, 
but this has also been paramount to ongoing 
transformation. We achieved our savings target for 
2017, and the cumulative reduction of over £100m from 
efficiencies in central support functions and overheads 
is equivalent to approximately 24% over the last three 
years. Our guidance, as set out in more detail below, 
includes that we expect Underlying Trading Profit to 
grow over the next two years, and this will be driven 
largely by further transformation savings. Over that 
period, we are in particular looking to transform our 
IT systems, capabilities and structures. This means 
not only reducing their cost, but also improving their 
performance and security. We are implementing 
further operating model changes to deliver greater 
efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation; there 
will also be increased contribution to savings from the 
transformation of the finance function and centralising 
expertise for reporting, forecasting, planning and 
analysis with a third party provider, and seeking 
additional rationalisation of disparate procurement 
spend across the Group.
Our ongoing transformation of the business involves 
further strengthening of our sector propositions, 
building differentiated capability, and capturing 
business development opportunities to enhance our 
pipeline and order book. As previously reported, we 
are using Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for Group-wide 
propositions and capabilities in our core markets, which 
are improving the sharing of skills, best practice and 
intellectual property across Serco. 
Whilst demand across our markets has not been as 
strong as we anticipated at the time we announced 
our strategy in 2015, the availability of value-adding 
acquisitions, be they of companies or of contracts, 
presents an opportunity to increase our scale and 
capabilities which was not foreseen in 2015. In our 
US defence business, the acquisition of BTP Systems 
for $20m adds deep skills in satellite communication 
and radar engineering technical services, which 
complements our existing service offering, and also 
brings with it a pipeline of new opportunities of $200m. 
In December 2017, we also signed a Business Purchase 
Agreement to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health 
facilities management contracts from Carillion plc, and 
have subsequently signed a revised agreement with the 
Special Managers and Provisional Liquidators of Carillion; 
whilst it is subject to requisite third party consents, we 
continue to work with all relevant parties to give effect to 
achieving the transfer of the contracts. If it is executed as 
envisaged, this transaction would significantly increase 
the scale of our equivalent Health business, and would 
add around £1bn to our order book.
Serco employs (including our joint venture operations) 
over 50,000 people, the vast majority delivering services 
to customers. Motivating and engaging employees is 
absolutely central to our business, and will be a key 
determinant of demonstrating we have successfully 
implemented our strategy. The latest results of our 
global employee survey, managed independently 
by Aon Hewitt, and with some 31,000 responses, 
showed a fourth successive year of improvement in 
the aggregated measure of ‘employee engagement’. 
During 2017, we also delivered many other elements 
to build capabilities and support our ambition to be 
the best-managed business in our sector. Some 200 
out of 300 senior managers have completed our highly 
tailored Oxford Saïd Serco Management course. We 
have rolled out Continuous Improvement training to all 
managers and embedded it as part of onboarding new 
staff, and over 1,400 employees are now trained to more 
advanced levels. And we have further invested in our 
Contract Management tools such as apps that monitor 
contractual obligations and report in real time, our 
Learning Management System for tracking training and 
qualifications, and our Serco Management System which 
covers all aspects of a contract’s lifecycle, processes 
and compliance requirements.
Contract awards, order book, rebids and pipeline
Contract awards
The Group signed contracts with a total value of 
£3.4bn during the year (2016: £2.5bn), which was 
another year of strong performance. This is the largest 
order intake since 2012, and represents a book-to-
bill ratio of approximately 115%. There were over 30 
contract awards worth more than £10m each, and 
the large value of new business won resulted in this 
being approximately 70% of the total value signed, 
with the balance represented by the value of secured 
extensions or rebids of existing work; the latter was also 
an abnormally small balance by virtue of there being a 
relatively small amount of contracts coming up for rebid 
or extension during 2017.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
37 Strategic Report
The largest new contract signed in the year was to 
operate the New Grafton Correctional Centre (NGCC) 
in New South Wales, which, when completed, will be the 
largest correctional facility in Australia; the estimated 
total contract value to Serco over a 20-year term is 
approximately AUD2.6bn (equivalent to approximately 
£1.5bn). The second largest new contract was with 
University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation  
Trust to transform catering and cleaning, with an 
estimated value of £125m over the ten-year term. 
The third largest was in the Americas division to deliver 
US Army base modernisation services and in particular 
IT support, valued at a total of $140m for the five-year 
base period and five one-year option periods, with 
the fourth also in the US to provide three Navy Fleet 
Readiness Centers with supply chain management 
services for hazardous materials, valued at a total of 
$101m for the base period and four one-year option 
periods. Smaller new bids won included environmental 
services for Rushmoor Borough Council, contact 
services support in Australia for the Department of 
Human Services, facilities management to a financial 
services company in Abu Dhabi, safety service patrol 
for the Texas Department of Transportation, and 
numerous US Navy ship and shore defence equipment 
modernisation task orders.
Of rebids and extensions secured, the largest was 
for NHS Forth Valley to continue providing facilities 
management services for a further seven years, followed 
by the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) for a 
further ten years. Others of note included contact 
services for Hertfordshire County Council, specialist 
scientific and engineering support for the European 
Space Agency, facilities management at the Cleveland 
Clinic in Abu Dhabi, fleet services for Louisville 
Gas & Electric Company, air navigation services in 
Bahrain and Iraq, environmental services for various 
London boroughs, traffic camera support in the 
Australian state of Victoria, and support to passenger 
information services for the Western Australia Public 
Transport Authority.
Win rates by volume were over 50% for new bids and 
over 90% for rebids and extensions. Win rate by value 
was around 25% for new work, with the benefit from the 
sheer scale of the Grafton win being offset by the loss 
of the other big opportunities in Middle East rail and 
UK immigration escorting; the win rate by value was 
approximately 90% for securing existing work.
Order book
The Group’s order book now stands at an estimated 
£10.7bn, up by £0.8bn versus a year earlier. There is 
£2.4bn of revenue secured in the order book for 2018, 
equivalent to around 85% visibility of our £2.9bn revenue 
guidance at current exchange rates. The secured order 
book is £1.6bn for 2019 and £1.2bn for 2020.
Rebids
Through to the end of 2020, across the Group there 
are around 60 contracts in our order book with annual 
revenue of over £5m where an extension or rebid will 
be required, representing current annual revenue of 
approximately £1.4bn in aggregate or approaching  
half of the Group’s 2018 £2.9bn revenue guidance.  
This proportion of revenue that requires securing at 
some point over the next three years is not unusual 
given our average contract length of around seven years 
(or approximately ten years on average on a revenue-
weighted basis, as larger contracts typically have longer 
terms). Contracts that could potentially end at some 
point by the end of 2018 have aggregate annual revenue 
of around £500m, with the higher amount versus recent 
years driven in particular by the US Affordable Care Act 
contract becoming due for full rebid this year, and with 
the next largest being Northern Isles Ferries. In 2019, it 
increases to around £700m, with Australian immigration 
services, the Dubai Metro, one of our US Navy 
installation contracts and COMPASS all due for rebid 
or potential extension. In 2020, it is around £200m, with 
PECS the only particularly large contract anticipated to 
become due in that year.
Pipeline
Our pipeline is tightly defined as new bid 
opportunities with estimated Annual Contract Value 
(ACV) of at least £10m and which we expect to bid 
and to be adjudicated within a rolling 24-month 
timeframe. The Total Contract Value (TCV) of individual 
opportunities is capped at £1bn. The definition does 
not include rebids and extension opportunities, and 
on average over the last five years, more than half 
of our order intake has come from opportunities 
outside the reported pipeline. It is a relatively small 
proportion of the total universe of opportunities, 
many of which either have annual revenues less than 
£10m, or are likely to be decided beyond the next 24 
months, or are rebids and extensions. It should also be 
remembered that in the Americas division in particular, 
we have numerous arrangements which are classed 
as ‘IDIQ’ – Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity – 
which are essentially framework agreements under 
which the customer issues task orders one at a time; 
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 whilst the ultimate value of such an agreement may 
be very large and run over many years, a value is only 
recorded in our order book as individual task orders 
are contracted, and few of them would appear in the 
pipeline as they tend to be individually less than £10m 
and contracted on short lead times.
Following several years of decline, at the start of 
2015 the pipeline stood at around £5bn and began 
to grow again, increasing to £6.5bn at the start of 
2016, and stood at £8.4bn at the start of 2017. During 
the year, around £7bn has come out of the pipeline, 
predominantly due to: wins, such as Grafton prison 
(which was capped in the pipeline at £1bn) and 
Southampton NHS Foundation Trust; losses, such as 
those in Middle East rail, UK immigration escorting 
and a US Navy systems support opportunity; as well 
as due to a small number of other opportunities being 
removed such as immigration services in the US. A 
number of new opportunities have now matured to the 
stage where they meet our pipeline definition, adding in 
aggregate around £3bn over the course of the year. As 
a result, the pipeline currently stands at £4.4bn, which 
consists of around 25 bids that have an ACV averaging 
approximately £30m and a contract length averaging 
around six years.
In the services industry in which Serco operates, 
pipelines are often lumpy, as individual opportunities 
can be very large, and when they come in and out 
of the pipeline they can have a material effect on 
reported values. In 2017, a number of unusually large 
bids travelled through the pipeline, and, as anticipated, 
immediately replacing these has been challenging in 
the prevailing market conditions. A lower pipeline is 
not a matter of undue concern: growing our pipeline 
should not be expected to be a smooth progression 
given the effects of the timing and scale of individual 
awards, and we expect profit growth in the next two 
years to be driven by transformation savings. However, 
progress beyond the next two years will require seeing 
improvements in the trading conditions across our 
markets which will need to be first evidenced by a 
pipeline that is growing once again.
Key opportunities in the pipeline are described further 
in the Divisional Reviews.
Risks associated with Serco’s trading environment
Last year, we reported on the risks around our trading 
environment, and focused on the possible impact of 
Brexit, instability in the Middle East, and lack of clarity 
in the US following the election of President Trump.
None of these risks has markedly reduced in the last 
twelve months: in terms of Brexit, our business directly 
serving European bodies which accounts for around 5% 
of Serco’s revenue is unlikely to be greatly affected, as it 
is served by EU-resident companies. We believe Brexit 
may have an impact on labour cost and availability 
in the UK if EU citizens cannot come to UK to work in 
essential frontline service roles. The greatest impact 
for us is that UK Central Government is largely focused 
upon the overwhelming need to manage Brexit, which 
has been described by the Head of the Civil Service 
as the greatest peacetime challenge ever faced by the 
Civil Service, and it is clear that their priority is going 
to be focused in this direction for several years to 
come. However, in the medium term the repatriation of 
swathes of regulatory functions may lead to important 
opportunities, and many of our largest customers – 
most notably the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of 
Justice and the Home Office – still have pressing needs 
to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
In the US, it is clear that the Affordable Care Act or 
‘Obamacare’, and associated contracts such as ours 
providing eligibility processing services to those 
seeking health insurance, will continue in some form, 
although the promised expansion in Defence spending 
is yet to be seen. Disappointingly, there are few signs 
of resolution in the dispute between Qatar and other 
states in the Middle East.
However, since last year’s report, in addition to the 
risks set out above, the UK public sector outsourcing 
market has in recent months been thrown into turmoil 
as the result of the collapse of Carillion, and the 
crystallisation on some contracts of very significant risks 
which government had transferred to suppliers. This has 
reignited the debate about the wisdom of government 
outsourcing to private companies the delivery of public 
services, and we suspect that this will become a theme 
in the next General Election. There is a very real risk that 
this will make the UK Government more than normally 
cautious in dealing with its suppliers. On the other hand, 
it may make them more inclined to deal with suppliers 
who have established a track record for strong delivery, 
prudent accounting and who have a robust balance 
sheet. The possible consequences of these events are 
examined in more detail under ‘Industry Backdrop and 
Concluding Thoughts’, below.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
39 Strategic Report
Guidance and outlook
Our guidance for 2018 and outlook beyond is 
unchanged from that initially provided in our update  
on 13 December 2017.
For 2018, we expect that Underlying Trading 
Profit will grow to around £80m, on revenues of 
£2.8–2.9bn (i.e. broadly flat organic revenue growth 
on a constant currency basis). We therefore expect 
some improvement in margins, driven largely by 
transformation savings. Our guidance reflects latest 
currency rates, which now imply greater pressure from 
adverse currency impacts estimated at £5–6m for profit 
and £100–120m for revenue when compared to  
the average rates for 2017.
As we have noted before in regard to our previous 
guidance, we reiterate that the range of potential 
outcomes is significantly wider than that implied by 
our budget’s central case, both to the upside and 
downside; this reflects Serco’s relatively low margins 
and the sensitivity of our profits to even small changes 
in revenues and costs, as well as movements in currency. 
Furthermore, and as described in more detail in the 
Divisional Reviews, the outcome of new bids in our 
pipeline and in our progress securing extensions or 
rebids including that for the Affordable Care Act in the 
US, could have a material impact on our business both 
in 2018 and more so the following year.
The 2018 financial year will be the first to be reported 
under the new IFRS15 accounting standard. As previously 
disclosed and reflective of the prudent accounting 
practices adopted in recent years by Serco, we do not 
anticipate the impact to be significant – as set out in  
Note 2 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements, 
the estimated restatement to 2017 is to decrease revenue 
by £3m and Underlying Trading Profit by £0.3m. IFRS15 
will be potentially of more relevance to the Group in 
relation to the accounting for new contracts rather 
than those already in place at the time of adopting the 
new standard. The changes brought about by IFRS15 
on previous percentage of completion accounting is 
expected to have little impact on Serco as this form of 
accounting has never been of particular relevance to 
Serco. However, if Serco enters into future contracts 
that have significant transition phases, this could result 
in a greater proportion of revenue and profit being 
recognised later on in the life of the contract than 
under previous accounting. The UK Defence Fire & Risk 
Management Organisation (DFRMO) contract, which  
we are currently bidding, is one such.
We anticipate a further small Free Cash outflow. 
After the cash outflow on exceptional costs, and the 
acquisition consideration for BTP Systems, we anticipate 
closing accounting net debt to increase to £200–250m, 
equivalent to leverage for covenant purposes in the 
range of 1.5–2x EBITDA.
As noted in our previous announcement regarding the 
potential acquisition of health facilities management 
contracts formerly operated by Carillion plc, the effect 
of this transaction is not included in any of our guidance 
at this stage.
Looking further ahead, we expect 2019 to be a year of 
further good growth in Underlying Trading Profit, which 
is again likely to be driven by additional transformation 
savings. The rate of growth thereafter will be more 
dependent on our ability to grow revenues. The 
Strategy Review announced in March 2015 set out a 
long term ambition that the business could grow in line 
with a market which was expected to expand at a long 
term trend rate of 5–7% a year and deliver margins of 
5–6%. Our margin ambition was predicated on three 
conditions: first, reducing costs as a percentage of sales; 
second, containing losses on onerous contracts and 
converting a number of them into profitable contracts 
on rebid; and, thirdly, increasing margins by growing 
revenues whilst bearing down on overheads. We remain 
broadly on track on costs and onerous contracts, but 
some markets, and in particular the UK, are currently 
growing more slowly than their former trend rate. We 
can and will partly compensate for a weaker organic 
revenue outlook through increased actions on the cost 
base, and our long term ambitions of 5–7% revenue 
growth and 5–6% margin remain intact, but the timing 
of achieving this will be dependent upon when demand 
reverts to historic levels in our target markets.
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Industry backdrop and concluding thoughts
“No plan ever survives first contact with the enemy” 
was a phrase first coined by the military strategist 
Helmuth von Moltke in the 19th century. So far, Serco’s 
three-stage plan (Stabilise – Transform – Grow), which 
we conceived in late 2014, has survived contact with 
the flow of events surprisingly well. After a period of 
decline, our profits have started to grow again; we have 
re-established our reputation for operational delivery; 
we have kept our promises to our customers; our 
portfolio of onerous contracts is running off in line with 
the expectations we set in 2014; we have had a strong 
year of order intake in 2017; and we are taking steps to 
improve margins to take us to more normal levels, even 
if weak demand will probably mean it will take us longer 
to get there. We are not yet able to resume dividend 
payments, but our pension schemes are fully funded 
and our balance sheet is robust.
Into this generally positive scene of Serco’s own 
progress has intruded a traumatic event in the form 
of the collapse of one of the UK’s largest suppliers of 
public services, Carillion. Quite apart from the usual 
miseries associated with the bankruptcy of a major 
company, it has put at risk the supply of a number of 
sensitive public service contracts and caused the UK 
Government distraction and expense. Not unnaturally, 
this has reignited the already-glowing embers of 
the debate about the desirability of allowing private 
companies to deliver public services. This cuts to the 
heart of what we do; the UK is Serco’s home market,  
and accounts for around half of our revenue, and 
understanding recent developments is high on the 
agenda of many investors.
It must be stressed that the UK Government successfully 
buys some £200bn of goods and services from private 
companies and charities each year. There are over 
one million people employed by the private sector 
delivering services to Government, and the vast majority 
of this work is delivered to a high standard. Huge 
benefits have been delivered by private companies 
and charities providing public services which are both 
efficient and innovative. Nevertheless, the collapse 
of Carillion stands as a reminder that since 2010 a 
significant number of businesses supplying Government 
services in the UK have suffered very large losses,  
Serco included, and that all is not right in the market  
for Government services in the UK.
How has this situation arisen? In one sense, this is 
the market at work, with a tendency for the balance 
of advantage to move between buyers and sellers in 
accordance with supply and demand. In the ’90’s and 
’00’s, Government was keen to enlist the support of 
private sector companies to improve the efficiency 
and productivity of public services, and many new 
opportunities came to market; the Government was 
feeling its way and trying to develop new contracting 
structures such as Private Finance Initiatives which  
had never been tested before, and was sometimes 
outrun by more sophisticated and canny suppliers, 
who were double-digit revenue growth a year with 
strong margins, cash flows and returns on capital.  
As is the way of markets, this strong growth attracted 
new competitors, many from abroad or from other 
sectors. As is also the way of markets, the flow of  
milk and honey did not last indefinitely.
Around 2010, the balance of power in the market began 
to turn. Government introduced austerity and sought 
to reduce expenditure, the supply of new work slowed, 
just as new competitors entered the market. At the 
same time, Government started to hire poachers and 
made them its gamekeepers, and in recent years has 
improved its commercial and contracting capabilities 
beyond all recognition. Feeling compelled to deliver the 
growth they had promised, suppliers competed fiercely 
for a reducing pool of new business; prices fell, and 
a newly-savvy Government discovered it had anxious 
suppliers prepared to accept risks and contract terms 
which in normal conditions they would not have agreed 
to. Sophisticated buying techniques were imported 
from the private sector; contracts for sensitive public 
services such as caring for asylum seekers were awarded 
to the lowest bidder by online auction. As margins fell, 
suppliers shrank their capital employed and increased 
their debt; some made assumptions in their accounting 
which had the effect of pulling forward reported profits; 
some used opaque financing facilities and extended the 
payment terms to their suppliers to make their reported 
cash flow more nearly match the stretched profits. At 
the same time, falling interest rates and increasing 
longevity sent pension deficits soaring. So in a matter 
of a few years, a sector which previously had delivered 
healthy returns and supported well-capitalised balance 
sheets became under-capitalised, over-leveraged, and 
operationally and financially fragile. Given the amount 
of contractual risk suppliers were carrying, that fragility 
was going to show itself sooner or later.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
41 Strategic Report
Serco was the first major UK public services supplier to 
reveal the consequences of carrying those risks. In 2014, 
we had to take £447m of onerous contract provisions 
to reflect the cost of contractual commitments we 
had made, and in total some £1.3bn of provisions and 
write-downs were required. Fortunately, our banks 
and shareholders backed our decision to stand by our 
commitments to our customers, and we raised some 
£700m of equity and a further £250m from disposals 
to make our balance sheet robust. Since then, few 
suppliers in the sector have escaped unscathed, but 
Carillion is the first major bankruptcy.
Does this matter? Over 12,000 companies go into 
insolvency in a year in the UK, so why should Carillion 
be of such concern? The reason is that the nature of 
public services contracts are that they often involve the 
delivery of services of national importance that need 
to operate 24 hours a day. Hospitals cannot operate 
without cleaners and caterers; courts cannot operate 
without prisoner transport; defence bases cannot 
operate without air traffic control. The security of supply 
of these contracts is a matter of national importance 
and a proper concern of Government.
How did we get into this position? The answer is: 
nobody is blameless. Company managers and directors 
should have remembered the adage that “no deal 
is better than a bad deal”; and that over-optimistic 
accounting judgements, or flattering reported cash 
flow, will always be found out in the end; and that 
pension deficits were not a temporary aberration but a 
liability that needed to be addressed. And for its part, 
Government has used its position as a monopoly buyer 
to push companies, large and small, into accepting 
contractual terms and risks that they could not 
conceivably manage or hedge. Sooner or later, some 
of those risks were bound to crystallise, and when they 
did, suppliers delivering vital public services would be 
mortally wounded and even become functionally or 
formally insolvent, which would not be in the interests  
of either taxpayers or service users.
Where will the market go next? Clearly, both 
Government and suppliers should take time to consider 
carefully the implications of recent events. Suppliers 
will likely become much more wary; there will be fewer 
new entrants; existing players may shift the balance 
of their attention towards other markets, if they can. 
The UK Government runs the risk of being offered less 
choice and innovation, less competition and higher risk 
premiums. And efforts to encourage small and medium 
sized suppliers into the market are likely to be set back, 
as they see what has happened to some of the large and 
strong companies who supply Government.
In the short term, the situation may offer opportunities 
to companies such as Serco which have already 
re-financed their balance sheets and focused 
on developing the strength and depth of their 
management. But this is no time for schadenfreude. 
Serco’s interest lies in seeing the market restored 
to health as soon as possible, where suppliers have 
the confidence to invest in bringing innovation and 
efficiency to help Government rise to the challenges 
of providing what it so badly needs, which is more 
public services, of higher quality, at lower cost. And 
Government needs to feel confident that it has a choice 
of strong suppliers, who it can trust to deliver and stand 
by their promises, and who have balance sheets robust 
enough to sustain them through the lumps and bumps 
inherent in the delivery of large and complex contracts.
We believe that recent events present an opportunity 
for both Government and its suppliers to work together 
to construct a new approach to the provision of public 
services which will avoid the problems of the past. 
There is broad consensus that public service provision 
should be a mixed economy of the state, not-for-profit 
organisations, and the private sector; and also that the 
provision of public services should not be completely 
exposed to the harshest rough-and-tumble, boom-
and-bust cycle of a totally free market where the 
relative powers of either buyer or seller may become 
unbalanced. Few people believe that the delivery 
of public services should always be a monopoly of 
employees of the state. The question is a practical one 
of how to make the procurement of public services, 
whether delivered by the state itself, by not-for-profits, 
or private companies, work better.
Serco will be contributing energetically to this 
discussion, and we will be proposing four principles 
which we suggest should govern relations between 
Government and its suppliers, be they public bodies, 
not-for-profit organisations or private sector companies.
• We should strengthen transparency in public 
contracting. This means that for large contracts 
for public services, which are not commoditised, 
which do not impinge on National Security, and 
which do not include significant amounts of 
intellectual property, the presumption should be 
in favour of open-book accounting, in which the 
Cabinet Office and National Audit Office can see 
the suppliers’ accounts of major contracts, whether 
they be performed by public or private operators. 
There should also be far greater transparency of 
operational performance: except in exceptional 
circumstances, suppliers, be they private or 
Government-owned, should be required to publish 
Chief Executive's Review continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 every six months their performance against key 
operational indicators, so they are held accountable 
for the delivery of their promises to the taxpayers 
who are paying for them and the users who they 
are serving. And we believe that there should be a 
formal, rigorous and transparent decision-making 
process by which Government decides what 
mechanism it should use, be it in-house or by a  
third party, to deliver a given project or policy.  
We call this the “Transparency Principle”.
• Both suppliers and the Government should have 
the right, on payment of an agreed break fee, to 
exit a contract at pre-determined intervals. We call 
this the “Orderly Exit Principle”. The purpose of this 
is to give both Government and supplier the ability to 
exit contracts which are not working out as intended. 
For instance, if the supplier is making greater than 
expected profits, or Government policy changes, 
or performance is unsatisfactory but still within the 
bounds of the contract, the Government should 
be able, on payment of a break fee, to re-compete 
or take back in-house the contract; and likewise 
if the supplier was making unexpected losses, or 
changes in regulation had made it impossible to 
deliver the contract as intended, the supplier can 
exit the contract on payment of a fee which would 
compensate the Government for the cost of re-
tendering. This would, for both Government and 
supplier, significantly reduce the risk of being stuck 
together in unhappy marriages.
• Suppliers of sensitive contracts should be obliged 
to lodge with Government a “living will”, being 
a set of arrangements to facilitate the transfer of a 
contract back to Government or to another supplier 
if required. This would significantly reduce the 
operational risk to Government of supplier failure. 
This is the “Security of Supply Principle”.
• Government and suppliers should agree to abide 
by a mutually-agreed code of conduct, which 
would set out expected standards of behaviour from 
Government and its contractors. This would involve 
the Government agreeing not to impose punitive or 
unfair terms and conditions or transfer unmanageable 
state risk; and suppliers would agree to maintain 
certain metrics of financial stability; pay their sub-
contractors in a timely fashion; and adequately fund 
their pensions. We think it would be important to 
have a process of independent arbitration built into 
the code of conduct to ensure that there is some 
avenue of redress and calling to account those 
who do not abide by the code. We call this the 
“Fairness Principle”.
It is vital to the well-being of any country that public 
services are delivered to high standards and offer 
value for money, and for the most part, in the UK, 
private and third-sector providers have done a 
good job of doing this. The UK has hundreds of 
new hospitals and schools, built and maintained 
to high standards; thousands of contracts have 
delivered innovation, improved services and lowered 
costs, along with far higher degrees of visibility of 
operational performance than is commonly available 
from public sector delivery. And as the UK advances 
towards Brexit, it is clear that there will be the need 
for a whole lot more Government as we “take back 
control”. With this in mind, we believe that there is 
an urgent need to re-think the relationship between 
the UK Government and its suppliers. We believe an 
approach based on the Four Principles above would 
serve to restore trust and common sense in the market; 
remove the risk of excessive profits or losses; and 
encourage a more vibrant and competitive market for 
Government services, one in which Serco would be an 
enthusiastic participant.

Divisional Reviews
Serco’s operations are reported as four regional divisions: UK & Europe (UK&E); the Americas; the Asia Pacific region 
(AsPac); and the Middle East. The Global Services division previously consisted of Serco’s private sector BPO operations, 
which for statutory reporting purposes were classified in 2016 as discontinued operations following the previously 
announced strategic exit from this market and the subsequent disposals. Serco presents alternative measures to 
include the Revenue and Trading Profit of these discontinued operations in prior periods for consistency with previous 
disclosures. Reflecting statutory reporting requirements, Serco’s share of revenue from its joint ventures and associates 
is not included in revenue, while Serco’s share of joint ventures and associates’ profit after interest and tax is included in 
Underlying Trading Profit. As previously disclosed and for consistency with guidance, Serco’s Underlying Trading Profit 
measure excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (principally OCP releases or charges), and the benefit in 
2016 from not depreciating and amortising assets held for sale, and other one-time items such as those in 2016 related to 
the early exit from the Thurrock contract.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44 UK & Europe
Serco’s UK & Europe division supports public 
service delivery and outcomes across all five of the 
Group’s chosen sectors: our Justice & Immigration 
business provides a wide range of services to support 
safeguarding society and reducing reoffending, from 
secure accommodation management through to 
housing and welfare services for asylum seekers; in 
Defence, we are trusted to deliver critical support 
services and operate sensitive facilities; we operate 
complex public Transport systems and services; our 
Health business provides primarily non-clinical support 
services to hospitals; and the Citizen Services business 
provides environmental and leisure services, as well 
as a wide range of other front, middle and back-office 
services to support public sector customers in the 
UK or European institutions. Serco’s operations in the 
UK represent approximately 40% of total Revenue 
for the Group, and those across the rest of Europe 
approximately 5%.
Serco announced in September 2017 that it would 
merge its UK and European operating divisions to 
create a single, integrated business, Serco UK & 
Europe. This combined the two previous divisions 
– UK Central Government and UK & Europe Local & 
Regional Government – and will simplify and improve 
the efficiencies and capabilities of our operations 
in the region, in particular as we continue to drive 
transformation benefits across the Group as a whole. 
Kevin Craven, previously Chief Executive of UK Central 
Government became the Chief Executive of Serco UK & 
Europe. Kevin joined Serco in September 2014, prior to 
which he was CEO of Balfour Beatty Services, leading a 
business with 16,000 employees and revenues of over 
£1.6bn, covering sectors such as facilities management, 
rail, highways and utilities. Before joining Balfour Beatty, 
he was the Managing Director for Healthcare, Education 
& Defence at Aramark, and the Managing Director of 
Transport & Travel for Sodexo.
Revenue for 2017 was £1,334.7m (2016: £1,375.1m), a 
decline of 3%; reported revenue excludes that from 
our joint venture and associate holdings which are 
predominantly the operations of AWE, Merseyrail and 
previously Northern Rail, with these representing the 
vast majority of the Group’s activity in joint ventures and 
associates. At constant currency, the decline in revenue 
was 4%. Drivers of the reduction included: in our Health 
business, we ceased to recognise as revenue the value 
of goods purchased on our customers’ behalf following 
changes to two procurement services contracts; in our 
Defence business, the phased transfer back during 2016 
of services that Serco had previously been providing 
to the Defence Science & Technology Laboratory 
(DSTL) and for Defence Business Services (DBS); we 
also saw reduced volumes in our Child Maintenance 
Group operations, and the ending or reduced scale of 
various other BPO and IT support services contracts. 
These revenue reductions were partially offset from 
growth elsewhere, namely the start of hospital facility 
management services for Barts Health NHS Trust and 
University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation 
Trust, as well as some growth in our European agency 
operations and from the new Skills Support for the 
Workforce (SSW) contracts.
Underlying Trading Profit was £35.1m (2016: £45.7m), 
representing an implied margin of 2.6% (2016: 3.3%). 
Trading Profit includes the profit contribution (from 
which tax and interest have already been deducted) of 
joint ventures and associates; if the £350m (2016: £474m) 
proportional share of revenue from joint ventures and 
associates was also included and if the £7.0m (2016: 
£7.4m) share of interest and tax cost was excluded, 
the overall divisional margin would have been 2.5% 
(2016: 2.9%). The joint venture and associate profit 
contribution of £26.6m (2016: £31.3m) was £4.7m lower, 
reflecting the end of the Northern Rail franchise in 
March 2016 and the lower shareholding of AWE from 
September 2016. The reduction in Underlying Trading 
Profit also included the impact of other contract 
attrition and in-contract reductions, and the lower 
profitability from new contracts in their initial transition 
and transformation stages. The non-repeat of certain 
costs and impairments that occurred in 2016 and the 
progress made on cost efficiencies in 2017 only partially 
offset these areas of profit reduction. Within Underlying 
Trading Profit there was £55m of OCP utilisation (2016: 
£60m), which served to offset the Division’s loss-making 
operations, principally COMPASS UK asylum seeker 
support services, the Caledonian Sleeper, Future 
Provision of Marine Services (FPMS), Lincolnshire 
Country Council, and the Prisoner Escort & Custody 
Services (PECS) contracts.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
45 Strategic Report
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments resulted 
in a £30.6m net charge, driven by updating the 
assumptions regarding operational and maintenance 
costs of running the Caledonian Sleepers contract, 
partially offset by a net £16m of releases across other 
contracts. The Caledonian Sleepers charge of £47m 
reflects a sharp increase in the estimated costs related 
to the delayed introduction and operation of the new 
sleeper service. We will be examining every option 
for reducing operating costs; the position under the 
contract is expected to improve over time, as the terms 
of the Franchise Agreement provide a mechanism that 
requires Transport Scotland to bear 50% of contract 
losses from 1 April 2020. In addition, from 1 April 2022, 
we have the right to seek adjustments to the financial 
terms of the Franchise Agreement that would result 
either in a small positive profit margin for Serco from 
that date, or allow us to exit the contract. A detailed 
review of provisions and Contract & Balance Sheet 
Review items is included in the Finance Review on pages 
50 to 68. After these adjustments, Trading Profit was 
£4.5m (2016: £84.5m, reflecting £35.3m net release for 
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments and a 
£3.5m one-time profit arising from a pension  
scheme settlement).
The UK & Europe division represented around £0.7bn of 
the Group’s aggregate total value of signed contracts 
during 2017. The largest award was a new contract 
to transform catering and cleaning for University 
Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, with an 
estimated value of £125m over the ten-year term. Other 
new work included adding patient transport services 
to our relationship with Barts Health NHS Trust, and 
environmental services to Rushmoor Borough Council. 
Of large new bids where we were unsuccessful, these 
included immigration escorting for the Home Office 
and the regional MOD contracts for Technical Support 
Services Provision to the UK's Royal Air Force.
The largest rebid or extension that was due during the 
year was for our provision of facilities management 
services at NHS Forth Valley, where we successfully 
secured these for a further seven years. Others secured 
included contact services for Hertfordshire County 
Council, specialist scientific and engineering support 
for the European Space Agency, our helicopter aircrew 
training for the MOD and a number of other defence 
support services contracts, parking services for the 
West London Alliance, environmental services for 
Wandsworth Council, and citizen services support 
to customers including Invest Northern Ireland, the 
Department of Health and the Skills Funding Agency.
Of existing work where an extension or rebid will be 
required at some point before the end of 2020, there 
are 30 contracts with annual revenue of over £5m 
within the UK & Europe division; in aggregate, these 
represent approximately a third of the current level of 
annual revenue for the division. The largest of these 
are the Northern Isles Ferries operations that are 
expected to be extended from April 2018 to the end of 
2019; the COMPASS contract is also due in 2019, along 
with a large European agency contract; and in 2020, 
PECS is now assumed to be rebid if a final extension 
option is not exercised by the customer, as well as 
that year our Anglia Support Partnership healthcare 
shared services operations. The Glasgow ACCESS 
operations transferred by the end of 2017, therefore 
representing known attrition of approximately 4% of 
divisional revenue.
Our pipeline of new bid opportunities has been 
significantly reduced following the removal of wins such 
the Barts and Southampton NHS contracts, as well 
as from losses such as immigration escorting for the 
Home Office. The Defence Fire & Risk Management 
Organisation (DFRMO) tender is still ongoing, as is that 
for an immigration removal centre. We have partially 
reloaded the pipeline with some other smaller tenders for 
various defence support, hospital facilities management 
and environmental services. For the successor to the 
COMPASS arrangements, we are also including in our 
new bid pipeline the incremental opportunity beyond  
the regions where we currently operate.
Americas
Our Americas division accounts for approximately 23% 
of Serco’s overall revenue, and provides professional, 
technology and management services focused on 
Defence, Transport, and Citizen Services. The US 
Federal Government, including the military, civilian 
agencies and the national intelligence community, are 
our largest customers. We also provide services to 
the Canadian Government and to some US state and 
municipal governments.
Revenue for 2017 was £688.0m (2016: £691.4m), a modest 
reduction in reported currency. In US dollars, the main 
currency for operations of the division, revenue was 
equivalent to approximately US$890m (2016: US$940m). 
The strengthening of local currencies against Sterling 
increased revenue by £42m or 7%; the organic change 
at constant currency was therefore a decline of 7%. The 
decline was driven by the end of the contracts during 
2016 for the Virginia Department of Transportation 
(VDOT) and for US Army transition assistance (SFLTAP). 
Divisional Reviews continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46 These and other smaller reductions were partially offset 
by growth in our support of advanced anti-terrorism 
systems for ships and infrastructure at US Navy ports  
and federal facilities, and some increases elsewhere in 
the volume of workload or task orders.
Underlying Trading Profit was £36.4m (2016: £43.0m), 
representing a margin of 5.3% (2016: 6.2%). While there 
was a £2.4m favourable currency movement, there 
was the impact of the first half of 2016 benefiting from 
the longer running of the VDOT and SFLTAP contracts 
which were only partially offset by cost efficiencies 
in 2017. Within Underlying Trading Profit there was 
£5m (2016: £9m) of OCP utilisation, which reflects the 
offset of losses on the Ontario Driver Examination 
Services contract.
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments resulted 
in a £3.4m net release. After these adjustments, 
Trading Profit was £39.8m (2016: £6.4m, reflecting 
£36.6m net charge for Contract & Balance Sheet 
Review adjustments).
Americas represented around £0.8bn of the Group’s 
aggregate total value of signed contracts during the 
year. The largest new award was for US Army base 
modernisation services and in particular IT support, 
valued at a total of $140m for the five-year base 
period and five one-year option periods. The second 
largest was to provide supply chain management 
services for hazardous materials at three US Navy Fleet 
Readiness Centers, valued at a total of $101m for the 
base period and four one-year options. Smaller new 
awards included safety service patrol for the Texas 
Department of Transportation, and numerous US Navy 
ship and shore defence equipment modernisation task 
orders. Of rebids and extensions secured, the largest 
was for the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) 
for a further ten years, albeit the new contract is for 
a reduced volume of work; others secured included 
fleet services for Louisville Gas & Electric Company, 
parking meter management in San Francisco and 
support services for the US Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board and the US Government 
Accountability Office. Serco was unsuccessful in a 
large new bid opportunity to be prime contractor for 
US Navy systems support, but has potential for a share 
of work through sub-contract relationships; there were 
no other major new pipeline decisions or large rebids 
or extensions due during the year.
Of existing work where an extension or rebid will be 
required at some point before the end of 2020, there are 
12 contracts with annual revenue of over £5m within the 
Americas division; in aggregate, these represent around 
50% of the current level of annual revenue for the 
division; this high proportion reflects that our contract 
supporting the US Affordable Care Act (ACA), which 
currently accounts for around 30% of divisional revenue, 
requires securing a rebid from 30 June 2018; the Global 
Installation Contract covering areas of our defence ship 
modernisation work is due for rebid in 2019, while our 
support to the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) 
Contract Tower (FCT) Program will become due for 
rebid once again in 2020.
Our pipeline of major new bid opportunities due for 
decision within the next 24 months includes further 
important opportunities to provide various support 
functions to the US Navy. A defence opportunity to 
support US Air Force radar systems as well as various 
other defence support bids were added during the year, 
as were other tenders for transport operations and fleet 
support and Citizen Services records management. 
Opportunities for immigration services were removed 
from the pipeline due to delays in tender processes.
Future profitability will as usual be shaped by the 
outcomes of the major new bid opportunities in the 
region, but in particular by the rebid outcome due by  
30 June 2018 and the future scale of operation of the 
ACA contract and its absorption of overhead costs.
Serco was pleased to announce in June 2017 that 
David J. Dacquino would become Chief Executive 
Officer of the Americas division, with Dan Allen having 
informed the business back in February of his intention 
to retire. Dave Dacquino joined Serco in 2015 to lead the 
Americas’ Defence business, bringing deep knowledge 
and experience from across the defence, aeronautics, 
logistics and technical services industries.

AsPac
Operations in the Asia Pacific division include Justice, 
Immigration, Defence, Health, Transport and Citizen 
Services in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. 
Serco’s operations in Australia are by far the largest 
element of the division; the country represents 
approximately 19% of total Revenue for the Group.
Revenue for 2017 was £579.0m (2016: £619.7m), a decline 
of 7%. In Australian dollars, the main currency for 
operations of the division, revenue for the year was 
equivalent to approximately A$980m (2016: A$1,140m). 
The movements in local currencies against Sterling 
increased revenue by £48m or 7%; the acquisition 
of the other 50% of a small defence services joint 
venture added 1% to revenue; the organic change at 
constant currency was therefore a decline of 15%. This 
reduction was driven by the end of the Armidale Class 
Patrol Boats (ACPB), Western Australia Court Security 
& Custodial Services (WACSCS) and Mount Eden 
contracts, together with some smaller reductions from 
other contracts ending or reducing in scope; there was 
some growth in Citizen Services contact and processing 
support which partially offset this attrition.
Underlying Trading Profit was £23.7m (2016: £24.9m), 
representing a margin of 4.1% (2016: 4.0%). While there 
was a favourable currency movement of £2.1m, the net 
of other movements reflected contract attrition and 
other margin pressures with only partial offset from 
progress on cost efficiencies and growth from new 
work. Within Underlying Trading Profit there was  
£9m of OCP utilisation (2016: £12m).
Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments resulted 
in a £11.4m net release, the largest element of which 
was a further OCP release on ACPB reflecting revised 
assumptions of the residual liability after the contract 
transferred to a new operator during the year. The ACPB 
contract was the largest of the OCP contracts, and is 
the first of the major OCP contracts to come to an end. 
After these adjustments, Trading Profit was £35.1m 
(2016: £34.2m, reflecting £9.3m net release for Contract 
& Balance Sheet Review adjustments).
AsPac represented around £1.8bn of the Group’s 
aggregate total value of signed contracts during 
the year. By far the largest element of this was 
approximately £1.5bn for the 20-year contract valued at 
A$2.6bn for the operation of New Grafton Correctional 
Centre (NGCC) which is expected to commence in 
2020; NGCC will be the largest correctional centre in 
Australia, consisting of a total of 1,700 beds in three 
individual security categories, and draws upon Serco’s 
experience of managing correctional facilities in the UK, 
New Zealand and elsewhere in Australia, which includes 
Australia’s current largest facility, Acacia Prison. Other 
smaller new wins included contact services support 
in Australia for the Department of Human Services. 
Extensions and rebids awarded in the year included 
traffic camera support in the Victoria, and passenger 
and integrated transport information services for 
transport authorities in Western Australia and New 
South Wales. There were no other larger rebids or  
major new bid pipeline decisions made in the year.
Of existing work where an extension or rebid will be 
required at some point before the end of 2020, there 
are 10 contracts with annual revenue of over £5m within 
the AsPac division; in aggregate, these represent just 
over half of the current level of annual revenue for the 
division; this high proportion reflects that the Australia 
onshore immigration services contract requires rebid  
or extension at the end of 2019, with this accounting  
for over 30% of current divisional revenue.
Our pipeline of major new bid opportunities due 
for decision within the next 24 months includes 
some further (but far smaller than Grafton) Justice 
& Immigration opportunities, as well as in Defence 
support services. We will look to build the pipeline 
further in these sectors as well as Citizen Services, 
Transport and Health.
Middle East
Operations in the Middle East division include 
Transport, Defence, Health and Citizen Services,  
with the region accounting for approximately 12%  
of the Group’s total revenue.
Revenue for 2017 was £351.9m (2016: £324.8m), an 
increase of 8%. The strengthening of local currencies 
against Sterling provided growth of £21m or 6%; the 
organic change at constant currency was therefore 
growth of 2%. Growth came from new contracts for 
facilities management at Dubai Airport and for a 
financial services company in Abu Dhabi, though these 
were partially offset by reductions related to the Dubai 
Air Navigation Services and Staff College training 
for the Qatar Armed Forces contracts, as well as a 
small number of other operations reducing in scope 
or volume including the Middle East Logistics & Base 
Support (MELABS) contract that supports the Australian 
Defence Force in the region.
Divisional Reviews continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48 Underlying Trading Profit was £16.2m (2016: £16.6m), 
representing a margin of 4.6% (2016: 5.1%). While there 
was a £1.2m favourable currency movement, there 
was an overall reduction in profitability due in large 
part to the non-repeat of the higher defence logistics 
volumes experienced in the first half of 2016, together 
with the impact of other contract scope reductions and 
attrition. There are no OCP contracts in the division 
and therefore no OCP utilisation within Underlying 
Trading Profit.
There were no Contract & Balance Sheet Review 
adjustments in the year, therefore Trading Profit was 
also £16.2m (2016: £18.8m, reflecting £2.2m net release 
for Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments).
The Middle East represented around £0.1bn of the 
Group’s aggregate total value of signed contracts 
during the year. Amongst smaller contract awards 
were new wins to provide facilities management in 
Abu Dhabi and defence training support in Qatar. 
Serco was unsuccessful however in pursuing the very 
large tenders for light rail and tram operations in the 
region. Extensions to existing work included facilities 
management for Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, and air 
navigation services and training in Bahrain and Iraq; 
there were no other large rebid or extension decisions 
due in the year.
Of existing work where an extension or rebid will be 
required at some point before the end of 2020, there are 
13 contracts with annual revenue of over £5m within the 
Middle East division; in aggregate, these represent well 
over half of the current level of annual revenue for the 
division. There is a high proportion of work to secure in 
2019, when the Dubai Metro, MELABS and Cleveland 
Clinic Abu Dhabi contracts each require extending or 
rebidding; by 2020, our Dubai Air Navigation Services 
will also become due for further extension or rebid.
Our pipeline of major new bid opportunities in the 
region has reduced very significantly following the 
outcome of the light rail and tram bids. There are some 
other smaller opportunities in transport and defence 
support services, and effort is ongoing to rebuild a 
stronger pipeline.
Corporate costs
Corporate costs relate to typical central function 
costs of running the Group, including executive, 
governance and support functions such as HR, finance 
and IT. Where appropriate, these costs are stated after 
allocation of recharges to operating divisions. The 
costs of Group-wide programmes and initiatives are 
also incurred centrally.
Benefiting from actions to deliver savings and improve 
efficiencies of our central functions, corporate costs in 
2017 reduced to £41.6m (2016: £43.5m).
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
49 Strategic Report
Finance Review
Underlying Trading Profit of £69.8m was at the top end of 
our guidance given at the start of the year; it was £12m lower 
than 2016, driven by the first half of 2016 benefiting from 
non-recurring trading items, and by net contract attrition. 
Revenue from continuing and discontinued operations was 
£94m lower at £2,954m. Closing Net Debt of £141m was better 
than expected and represents a year-on-year increase of £32m, 
driven by the outflows related to loss-making contracts.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 50 Change regarding the classification of cost items within  
cost of sales and administrative expenses
The Group has undergone a programme of work on its financial 
data structures to appropriately allocate and charge costs to the 
relevant divisions and between cost of sales and administrative 
expenses. As a result of the activities performed in this area, the 
Group’s classification of cost items in the income statement has 
changed. The prior year’s results have been restated to reflect 
the cost items identified which should have been reallocated 
in 2016. This resulted in increasing administrative expenses by 
£43.0m and decreasing cost of sales by the same amount. The 
change in policy has no impact on operating profit, any other item 
below this on the income statement, or any of the Group’s key 
performance measures.
Cost of sales are considered to be the costs of operating 
contracts. This includes the unavoidable costs of servicing 
contracts and all costs that a contract would incur purely on its 
own without a parent company, regardless of how those services 
are delivered within the wider Group, such as IT or Human 
Resource management services provided centrally. 
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)  
and other related definitions 
Overview
APMs used by the Group are reviewed below to provide a 
definition and reconciliation from each non-IFRS APM to its  
IFRS equivalent, and to explain the purpose and usefulness  
of each APM.
In general, APMs are presented externally to meet investors’ 
requirements for further clarity and transparency of the Group’s 
financial performance. The APMs are also used internally in 
the management of our business performance, budgeting and 
forecasting, and for determining Directors’ remuneration and 
that of other management throughout the business.
APMs are non-IFRS measures. Where additional revenue is being 
included in an APM, this reflects revenues presented elsewhere 
within the reported financial information, except where 
amounts are recalculated to reflect constant currency. Where 
items of profits or costs are being excluded in an APM, these 
are included elsewhere in our reported financial information 
as they represent actual profits or costs of the Group, except 
where amounts are recalculated to reflect constant currency. 
As a result, APMs allow investors and other readers to review 
different kinds of revenue, profits and costs and should not be 
used in isolation. Other commentary within the Strategic Report, 
including the other sections of this Finance Review, as well as 
the Consolidated Financial Statements and their accompanying 
notes, should be referred to in order to fully appreciate all the 
factors that affect our business. We strongly encourage readers 
not to rely on any single financial measure, but to carefully review 
our reporting in its entirety.
The methodology applied to calculating the APMs has not 
changed during the year for any measure.

Alternative revenue measures
Reported revenue at constant currency
Reported revenue, as shown on the Group’s 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 158, 
reflects revenue translated at the average exchange 
rates. In order to provide a comparable movement 
on the previous year’s results, reported revenue is 
recalculated by translating non-Sterling values for the 
year to 31 December 2017 into Sterling at the average 
exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016. 
All revenue in 2017 arose from continuing activities. 
For the year ended 31 December
2017 
£m
Reported revenue at constant currency 2,832.0 
Foreign exchange differences 121.6
Reported revenue at reported currency 2,953.6
Organic Revenue at constant currency
Reported revenue may include revenue generated 
by businesses acquired during a particular year and/
or generated by businesses sold during a particular 
year up to the date of disposal. In order to provide a 
comparable movement which ignores the effect of both 
acquisitions and disposals on the previous year’s results, 
Organic Revenue at constant currency is recalculated 
by excluding the impact of any relevant acquisitions 
or disposals. 
For the year ended 31 December 2017, an adjustment 
was required for the disposal of the remaining element 
of the UK private sector BPO business, consisting of a 
single contract, sold on 3 July 2017. This business was 
previously reported within discontinued operations 
but included as continuing in 2017 as it does not have 
a material impact on the Group’s results. The Group 
disposed of Service Glasgow LLP on 1 December 2017, 
which also consisted of a single contract. However, this 
disposal arose as a result of normal contract attrition 
rather than as a result of the disposal of a wider 
business and hence this is not excluded for the  
Organic Revenue calculation. 
The only acquisition excluded for the calculation of 
Organic Revenue in the year relates to the acquisition 
of 50% of the issued share capital of Serco Sodexo 
Defence Services Pty Ltd, resulting in full control being 
obtained. Serco Sodexo Defence Services Pty Ltd was 
previously a 50% owned joint venture accounted for on 
an equity accounting basis and therefore no revenues 
had previously been recorded in the Group’s results.
Organic Revenue growth is calculated by comparing 
the current year Organic Revenue at constant currency 
exchange rates with the prior year Organic Revenue at 
reported currency exchange rates.

Revenue from continuing and discontinued operations
Reported revenue, as shown on the Group’s 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 158, reflects 
only that from continuing operations, with the post 
tax result of discontinued operations consolidated 
as a single line at the bottom of the Consolidated 
Income Statement. The alternative measure includes 
discontinued operations for the benefit of consistency 
with previously reported results and to reflect the 
overall change in scale of the Group’s operations.  
The alternative measure allows the performance of the 
discontinued operations themselves, and their impact 
on the Group as a whole, to be evaluated on measures 
other than just the post tax result. No operations 
were classified as discontinued in 2017 as there was a 
single remaining business as at 1 January 2017 which 
generated insignificant revenue and profit up to the 
date of disposal of 3 July 2017. Discontinued operations 
in the prior year reflect the former Global Services 
division which consisted of the Group’s private sector 
BPO operations.

ventures and associates, with Serco’s share of profits 
in joint ventures and associates (net of interest and

Statement. The alternative measure includes the share 
of joint ventures and associates for the benefit of

evaluating Serco’s presence in market sectors such as 
Defence and Transport. The alternative measure allows

Underlying Trading Profit (UTP)
The Group uses an alternative measure, Underlying 
Trading Profit, to make adjustments for unusual items 
that occur within Trading Profit and remove the impact of 
historical issues. UTP therefore provides a measure of the 
underlying performance of the business in the current 
year. For 2016 there were four items excluded from UTP , 
only two of which required adjustment in 2017.
Charges and releases on all Onerous Contract 
Provisions (OCPs) are excluded in the current and prior 
years. OCPs reflect the future multiple year cost of 
delivering onerous contracts and do not reflect only 
the current cost of operating the contract in the latest 
individual year. It should be noted that, as for operating 
profit, UTP benefits from OCP utilisation of £69.3m in 
2017 (2016: £84.2m) which neutralises the in-year losses 
on previously identified onerous contracts, therefore it 
is only charges or releases of OCPs that are adjusted for.
Revisions to accounting estimates and judgements 
which arose during the 2014 Contract & Balance Sheet 
Review are separately reported where the impact of an 
individual item is material. Only one such item was noted 
in 2017, relating to a release of a provision made during 
the Contract & Balance Sheet Review which has been 
released following a change in the Group’s obligations. 
Both OCP adjustments and other Contract & Balance 
Sheet Review adjustments are identified and separated 
from the APM in order to give clarity of the underlying 
performance of the Group and to separately disclose 
the progress made on these items.
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
53 Strategic Report
Underlying Trading Profit (UTP) continued
The benefit of depreciation and amortisation charges 
not being taken in the Group accounts in relation to 
assets held for sale were excluded in the prior year. Such 
charges were being taken in the subsidiary accounts to 
reflect the reduction in value of the underlying assets, 
and we consider it relevant to show the effect this would 
have on the Group performance measure. No assets 
are included as held for sale in 2017 and therefore no 
adjustment is required in 2017.
Finally, any other significant items that have a one-time 
financial impact are excluded, which for 2016 related to 
the one-time pension settlement associated with the 
early exit of a UK local authority contract in 2015. This 
item was distinct from exceptional items in that it arose 
from normal contract exit conditions. No such material 
one-time items occurred in 2017.
Underlying trading margin is calculated as UTP divided 
by revenue from continuing and discontinued operations.
The non-underlying column in the summary income 
statement on page 50 includes the tax impact of the 
above items and tax items that, in themselves, are 
considered to be non-underlying. Further detail of such 
items is provided in the tax section below.
Trading Profit
The Group uses Trading Profit as an alternative 
measure to operating profit, as shown on the Group’s 
Consolidated Income Statement on page 158, by 
making three adjustments. Trading Profit is a metric 
used to determine the performance and remuneration 
of the Executive Directors. 
First, Trading Profit excludes exceptional items, being 
those considered material and outside of the normal 
operating practice of the Group to be suitable of 
separate presentation and detailed explanation. 
Second, amortisation and impairment of intangibles 
arising on acquisitions are excluded, because these 
charges are based on judgements about the value and 
economic life of assets that, in the case of items such 
as customer relationships, would not be capitalised in 
normal operating practice. 
Third, the Trading Profit of discontinued operations 
is included as this benefits from consistency with 
previously reported results, reflects the overall change 
in scale of the Group’s operations and takes account 
of the performance of the discontinued operations 
themselves. This allows their impact on the Group as a 
whole to be evaluated on measures other than just the 
post tax result. There were no discontinued operations 
in 2017.
UTP at constant currency 
UTP disclosed above has been translated at the average 
foreign exchange rates for the year. In order to provide 
a comparable movement on the previous year’s results, 
UTP is recalculated by translating non-Sterling values for 
the year to 31 December 2017 into Sterling at the average 
exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016.

Alternative cash flow and Net Debt measures
Free Cash Flow (FCF)
We present an alternative measure for cash flow to 
reflect net cash inflow from operating activities before 
exceptional items, which is the measure shown on 
the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 162. 
This IFRS measure is adjusted to include dividends 
we receive from joint ventures and associates and 
deducting net interest paid and net capital expenditure 
on tangible and intangible asset purchases. FCF is 
considered relevant to reflect the cash performance of 
business operations after meeting usual obligations of 
financing and tax. It is therefore a measure that is before 
all other remaining cash flows, being those related to 
exceptional items, acquisitions and disposals, other 
equity-related and debt-related funding movements, 
and foreign exchange impacts on financing and 
investing activities. FCF is therefore a measure to  
assess the cash flow generated by the business and  
aids consistency for comparison to historical results. 
FCF is a metric used to determine the performance  
and remuneration of the Executive Directors.

UTP cash conversion
FCF as defined above, includes interest and tax 
cash flows. In order to calculate an appropriate cash 
conversion metric equivalent to UTP, Trading Cash Flow 
is derived from FCF by excluding tax and interest items. 
UTP cash conversion therefore provides a measure of 
the efficiency of the business in terms of converting 
profit into cash before taking account of the impact of 
interest, tax and exceptional items. As Trading Cash 
Flow was an outflow in 2016, a conversion percentage  
of UTP is not presented.

Revenue
Reported Revenue declined by 2% in the year to 
£2,953.6m (2016: £3,011.0m), a 6% reduction in  
constant currency. 
No revenue arose in 2017 from operations classified as 
discontinued, with total revenues for the year ended 
31 December 2016 from continuing and discontinued 
operations being £3,047.8m. 
Commentary on the revenue performance of the Group 
is provided in the Chief Executive’s Review and the 
Divisional Reviews sections.
Trading Profit 
Trading Profit for the year was £54.0m (2016: £100.3m). 
Trading Profit for the year ended 31 December 2016 
included a loss on discontinued operations of £3.3m. 
Commentary on the trading performance of the Group 
is provided in the Chief Executive’s Review and the 
Divisional Reviews sections.
Underlying Trading Profit 
UTP was £69.8m (2016: £82.1m), down 15%. At constant 
currency, UTP was £18.8m lower than 2016 at £63.3m, 
with a movement of £4.6m relating to the results of 
discontinued operations in 2016.
Commentary on the underlying performance of the 
Group is provided in the Chief Executive’s Review and 
the Divisional Reviews sections.
Excluded from UTP were net charges from OCPs 
of £19.0m (2016: net releases of £9.6m) following 
the annual reassessment undertaken as part of the 
budgeting process. Also excluded from UTP were 
net releases of £3.2m (2016: net releases of £4.6m) 
relating to other provisions and accruals for items 
identified during the 2014 Contract & Balance Sheet 
Review. UTP also excluded the benefit arising from 
the non-depreciation and amortisation of assets 
classified as held for sale in 2016 of £0.5m; there 
were no such assets in 2017. Other one-time items of 
£3.5m excluded from UTP in 2016 related to a pension 
scheme settlement arising from the early exit of a UK 
Local Authority contract in 2015; there were no such 
adjustments necessary for one-time items in 2017.
The cumulative to date improvement to Trading 
Profit as a result of OCP charges and releases and 
adjustments to items identified during the 2014 
Contract & Balance Sheet Review is £19.3m (2016: 
£35.1m). This represents 3% of the 2014 total charge 
to Trading Profit arising from the Contract & Balance 
Sheet Review.
The tax impact of items in UTP and other non-
underlying tax items is discussed in the tax section  
of this Finance Review.
Discontinued operations
The Global Services division, representing private 
sector BPO operations, was classified as a discontinued 
operation in 2015 and 2016. Disposal of the offshore 
BPO business was largely completed in December 
2015, with the disposals of two much smaller remaining 
elements completed in March 2016 and December 2016. 
The residual UK onshore private sector BPO operations 
were sold or exited in 2016 with the exception of one 
business, consisting of a single contract, the disposal 
of which completed in July 2017. Total revenues for 
the remaining operations were £5.4m and the loss 
before exceptional items was £0.6m for the year 
ended 31 December 2017, therefore the results have 
been included in continuing operations in 2017 on the 
grounds of materiality.

Joint ventures and associates-share of results
In 2017, the most significant joint ventures and 
associates in terms of scale of operations were AWE 
Management Limited, and Merseyrail Services Holding 
Company Limited, with dividends received of £17.1m 
(2016: £19.6m) and £7.3m (2016: £7.3m) respectively. 
Total revenues generated by these businesses were 
£951.8m (2016: £968.1m) and £155.7m (2016: £150.3m) 
respectively. From September 2016, there was a 
change in the AWE Management Limited shareholding 
structure, with the Group's shareholding reducing from 
33.3% to 24.5% by way of a return of shares.
While the revenues and individual line items are not

Other exceptional operating items
The annual impairment testing of CGUs in 2017 has identified no impairment of goodwill.
The Group is incurring costs in relation to restructuring programmes resulting from the Strategy Review. These 
costs include redundancy payments, provisions, external advisory fees and other incremental costs, including 
in 2017 £2.8m of intangible asset impairment (2016: £nil). Due to the nature and scale of the impact of the 
transformation phase of the Strategy Review, the incremental costs associated with this programme are considered 
to be exceptional. Costs associated with the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review must 
meet the following criteria: that they are directly linked to the implementation of the Strategy Review; they are 
incremental costs as a result of the activity; and they are non-business as usual costs. In 2017, a charge of £28.6m 
(2016: £17.2m) arose in relation to the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review. The Strategy 
Review is discussed in more detail in the Strategic Report on page 11. Non-exceptional restructuring charges are 
incurred by the business as part of normal operational activity, which in the year totalled £11.1m (2016: £6.7m) and 
were included within operating profit before exceptional items. We expect restructuring costs of approximately 
£35m to be incurred in 2018 which will be treated as exceptional.
There were exceptional costs totalling £0.4m (2016: £0.1m) associated with the UK Government reviews and the 
programme of Corporate Renewal. These costs have historically been treated as exceptional and consistent 
treatment is applied in 2017.

Finance Review continued
Other exceptional operating items continued
There were releases of provisions of £0.4m (2016: £0.6m) 
which were previously charged through exceptional 
items in relation to the exit of the UK frontline clinical 
health contracts.
An exceptional charge of £10.7m arose in 2016 in 
respect of the bulk transfer of a number of employees 
that are being transferred from the Serco Pension 
and Life Assurance Scheme (SPLAS) to the Principal 
Civil Service Pension Scheme. This transfer was legally 
agreed in December 2016 at which point all obligations 
of SPLAS to pay retirement benefits for these individuals 
were eliminated and as a result, a settlement charge 
of £10.7m arose, for which a provision was made. 
In 2017 a new agreement was reached with the UK 
Government to transfer out the scheme members on 
an individual basis and the 2016 legal and commercial 
arrangements were cancelled by consent of all parties. 
As a result of the changes, the impact of the transfer 
was treated as an experience gain adjustment through 
other comprehensive income and the majority of the 
provision made in 2016 was reversed, resulting in a 
£10.3m credit to exceptional items in 2017. 
In 2016 a review of a joint venture’s cash flow projections 
led to the impairment of certain equity interests and 
associated receivables balances, totalling £13.9m. 
The impairment was outside of the normal course of 
business and of a significant value, and was therefore 
considered to be an exceptional item. In the year ended 
31 December 2017 payments of £4.5m were received 
against the impaired loan. The likelihood of further cash 
receipts against the receivables remains uncertain. 
As a result of contracts coming to the end of their 
natural lives and no significant new contracts being 
awarded by the customer, the remaining customer 
relationship intangible assets of the DMS Maritime 
Pty Limited business acquired in 2012 were impaired, 
totalling £6.1m.
Exceptional tax
Exceptional tax for the year was a tax charge of £5.0m 
(2016: £3.1m credit), comprising a £2.3m credit on 
exceptional items within operating profit and a £7 .3m 
charge in respect of other exceptional tax items.
Exceptional costs of £19.6m only gave rise to a credit of 
£2.3m, as the majority of these costs were incurred in the 
UK where they only impact our unrecognised deferred 
tax in relation to losses.
The other exceptional tax items relate to two matters, the 
first is the impact on tax of the pension buy-in disclosed 
in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements 
which led to a £95.0m reduction in the IFRS valuation 
of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and 
consequently a deferred tax charge to the income 
statement of £16.1m. Movements in the valuation of 
the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and the 
associated deferred tax impact are reported in the 
Statement of Comprehensive Income (SOCI) and do not 
flow through the income statement, therefore do not 
impact profit before tax or the tax charge. However, the 
net amount of deferred tax recognised in the balance 
sheet relates to both the pension accounting and other 
timing differences, such as recoverable losses. As the 
net deferred tax balance sheet position is at the level 
supported by future profit forecasts, the decrease in 
the deferred tax liability associated with the pension 
scheme (with the benefit reported in the SOCI) leads to 
a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax asset to 
match the future profit forecasts. Such a reduction in the 
deferred tax asset therefore leads to a charge to tax in 
the income statement.
The second element is a credit of £8.8m related to 
legislative changes in the UK and the US which have 
impacted the value of deferred tax held on the balance 
sheet. There is a reduction in the deferred tax liability 
that is held in connection with our US operations 
of £12.5m, as future US tax liabilities are expected 
to crystallise at lower US tax rates. The fall in future 
expected US rates is primarily due to the enactment 
of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in December 2017 which 
reduces the corporate income tax rate in the US from 
35% to 21% effective from 1 January 2018. In addition, 
there was a change in UK tax law in 2017. This UK 
change will reduce the quantum of loss brought forward 
that can be used to offset taxable profits arising in a 
year, and will also enable losses carried forward in one 
company to be used to offset profits in another. The 
combined impact of these UK law changes results in a 
tax charge of £3.7m.
Pre-exceptional finance costs and investment revenue
Investment revenue of £7 .6m (2016: £9.3m) includes 
interest accruing on net retirement benefit assets of 
£3.8m (2016: £4.7m), interest earned on deposits and other 
receivables of £2.6m (2016: £3.6m) and the movement in 
discounting of other receivables of £1.2m (2016: £1.0m).
Finance costs of £19.2m (2016: £21.9m) includes interest 
incurred on the USPP loans and the Revolving Credit 
Facility of £14.0m (2016: £15.6m), facility fees and other 
charges of £3.0m (2016: £3.5m), interest payable on finance 
leases of £1.3m (2016: £1.6m), the movement in discount on 
provisions of £1.3m (2016: £2.4m) and a credit for foreign 
exchange on financing activities of £0.4m (2016: £1.2m).
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 60 Other gains
On 24 August 2017 the Group acquired 50% of the issued 
share capital of Serco Sodexo Defence Services Pty Ltd 
for £1.6m, obtaining full control. Serco Sodexo Defence 
Services Pty Ltd was previously a 50% owned joint venture 
accounted for on an equity accounting basis. As a result 
of the increase in ownership from 50% to 100%, the Group 
fair valued the existing 50% shareholding and the resulting 
uplift in value of £0.7m was recorded in Other gains, 
outside of operating results.
Tax
Tax charge
Underlying tax
In 2017 we recognised a tax charge of £20.6m on 
underlying trading profits after finance cost. The effective 
tax rate in 2017 (35.4%) is at a similar level to 2016 (35.2%).
Pre-exceptional tax
We recognised a tax charge of £14.0m (2016: £15.8m)  
on pre-exceptional profits which includes £20.6m 
underlying tax, £1.6m tax impact of amortisation on 
intangibles arising on acquisition and £5.0m credit on 
non-underlying items. The £5.0m credit consists of the 
tax impact of non-underlying items together with tax 
items that are in themselves considered to be  
non-underlying, specifically:
• As noted above with regards to exceptional tax, 
movements in the valuation of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes leads to a corresponding 
adjustment to the deferred tax asset to match the 
future profit forecasts. Such a change in the deferred 
tax asset impacts tax in the income statement. 
Where deferred tax charges or releases are the result 
of movements in the pension scheme valuations 
rather than trading activity, these are excluded from 
the calculation of tax on underlying profit and the 
underlying effective tax rate, with the prior periods 
being restated to reflect this. These amounted to 
£1.9m for 2017 (2016: £nil).
• During the current period we have recognised an 
additional £11.1m of deferred tax asset in relation to 
UK losses to reflect the improved forecast profits of 
our UK operations. This credit nets against the charge 
(£3.7m) taken to exceptional tax and described below, 
which relates to the UK law change in 2017 to give a 
net increase in UK deferred tax assets of £7.4m. 
• The tax on non-underlying items during the period 
totalled a credit of £4.2m reflecting the impact of 
current or future tax deductions available.
The tax rate on profits before exceptional items on 
continuing operations, at 36.2% is higher than the UK 
standard corporation tax rate of 19.25%. This is due 
to the upward impact of higher rates of tax on profits 
arising on our international operations, together with 
the absence of any deferred tax credit for current year 
losses incurred in the UK. This is only partially offset 
by the downward impact of our joint ventures whose 
post-tax results are included in our pre-tax profit 
and additional deferred tax assets that have been 
recognised in relation to historic UK losses. Our tax 
charge in future years will continue to be materially 
impacted by our accounting for UK deferred taxes. To 
the extent that future UK tax losses are incurred and are 
not recognised, our effective tax rate will be higher than 
prevailing standard corporation tax rates. When our UK 
business returns to sustainable profitability our existing 
UK tax losses will be recognised or utilised, and the 
effective rate will be reduced.
The enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in the US has 
not impacted our pre-exceptional tax charge during 
2017 with the impact on our valuation of deferred tax 
shown as an exceptional item and explained further 
above. In the medium term, the new law is expected 
to have only a marginal impact on our tax liability in 
the US. This is because although we will benefit from 
the fall in tax rate, our US business bears interest cost, 
associated with historic funding put in place to acquire 
US businesses, an element of which will not lead to tax 
deductions in the medium term.

Exceptional items section above.

A £17.4m UK tax asset has been recognised at

unrecognised UK deferred tax assets of an additional 
£160m which are contingent on further improvement in 
the UK profit forecast.

Taxes paid
Net corporation tax of £15.3m was paid during the year, 
relating primarily to our operations in AsPac (£5.5m), 
Europe (£3.2m), Middle East (£1.5m) and Americas 
(£5.1m). The Group's UK operations have transferred 
tax losses to its profitable joint ventures and associates 
giving a cash tax inflow in the UK of £4.4m. In addition 
there were small cash tax refunds where we have 
overpaid tax in previous periods. This results in an overall 
tax paid figure in our cash flow statement of £11.4m. 
The amount of tax paid (£11.4m) differs from the tax 
charge in the period (£19.0m) mainly due to the effect 
of future expected cash tax outflows for which a charge 
has been taken in the current period and the impact of 
the time lag on receipts of cash from joint ventures and 
associates for losses transferred to them.
Further detail of taxes that have been paid during the 
year is shown below.
Total tax contribution
Our tax strategy of paying the appropriate amount of 
tax as determined by local legislation in the countries in 
which we operate, means that we pay a variety of taxes 
across the globe. In order to increase the transparency 
of our tax profile, we have shown below the cash taxes 
that we have paid across our regional markets.
In total during 2017, Serco globally contributed  
£578m of tax to government in the jurisdictions in 
which we operate.

Corporation tax, which is the only cost to be separately 
disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements, 
is only one element of our tax contribution. For every 
£1 of corporate tax paid directly by the Group (tax 
borne), we bear a further £8.20 in other business taxes. 
The largest proportion of these is in connection with 
employing our people.
In addition, for every £1 of tax that we bear, we 
collect £3.10 on behalf of national governments (taxes 
collected). This amount is directly impacted by the 
people that we employ and the sales that we make.
Dividends
The Board is not recommending the payment of a 
dividend in respect of the 2017 financial year. The 
Board’s appraisal of the appropriateness of dividend 
payments takes into account the Group’s underlying 
earnings, cash flows and financial leverage, together 
with the requirement to maintain an appropriate level 
of dividend cover and the prevailing market outlook. 
Although the Board is committed to resuming dividend 
payments as soon as it believes it prudent to do so, 
in assessing whether we should resume dividend 
payments in respect of 2017, we have been mindful of 
the fact there has been a reduction in earnings, a free 
cash outflow and an increase in Net Debt. In these 
circumstances, the Board believes that it would not be 
prudent to resume dividend payments at the current 
juncture. For 2018, our guidance is for an improvement 
in Underlying Trading Profit, but we expect Net Debt 
to still increase, largely as a result of cash outflows 
related to exceptional restructuring costs and taking 
opportunities for value-enhancing infill acquisitions.  
The Board will continue to keep the dividend policy 
under close consideration as we progress with 
transforming the Group and implementing our strategy.
Share count and EPS 
The weighted average number of shares for EPS 
purposes was 1,089.7m for the year ended 31 December 
2017 (2016: 1,088.3m). EPS before exceptional items 
from both continuing and discontinued operations was 
2.24p per share (2016: 6.12p); including the impact of 
exceptional items, EPS was a loss of 0.02p (2016: 0.11p). 
Underlying EPS was 3.42p per share (2016: 4.13p).
Cash flows 
The UTP of £69.8m (2016: £82.1m) converts into a 
trading cash inflow of £21.9m (2016: outflow of £8.0m). 
The negative conversion in 2016 was primarily due to 
the adverse working capital movement of £23.7m and 
the cash outflows arising on the utilisation of contract 
provisions of £84.2m. In 2017, the working capital outflow 
is £9.0m and the OCP utilisation is £69.3m.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 62 The table below shows the operating profit and FCF 
reconciled to movements in Net Debt. FCF for the 
year was an outflow of £6.7m compared to an outflow 
of £33.0m in 2016. The improvement in FCF is largely 
as a result of a reduction in operating profit before 
exceptional items on continuing and discontinued 
operations from £95.2m in 2016 to £49.6m in 2017, 
which is more than offset by an improvement in the 
net movement in non-exceptional provisions from a 
reduction in 2016 of £118.4m to a reduction in 2017 of 
£46.4m. The movement in non-exceptional provisions is 
partly due to the reduction in total provision utilisation 
from £123.4m in 2016 to £82.2m in 2017. 
The movement in Net Debt is an increase of £31.8m 
in 2017, a reconciliation of which is provided at the 
bottom of the following table. The movement includes 
a net outflow of £5.6m arising on the acquisition and 
disposal of subsidiaries, primarily relating to the cash 
held by Service Glasgow LLP, an entity disposed of 
in the year. In 2016 a net cash inflow of £19.2m arose 
primarily as a result of the disposal of the private sector 
BPO business. The movement in Net Debt for 2017 also

Treasury operations and risk management
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of 
financial risks that include liquidity, the effects of 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest 
rates and credit risk. The Group has a centralised 
treasury function whose principal role is to ensure that 
adequate liquidity is available to meet the Group’s 
funding requirements as they arise and that the financial 
risk arising from the Group’s underlying operations is 
effectively identified and managed.
Treasury operations are conducted in accordance 
with policies and procedures approved by the Board 
and are reviewed annually. Financial instruments are 
only executed for hedging purposes and speculation 
is not permitted. A monthly report is provided to 
senior management outlining performance against the 
Treasury Policy and the treasury function is subject to 
periodic internal audit review.
Liquidity and funding
As at 31 December 2017, the Group had committed 
funding of £741m (2016: £770m), comprising £261m of 
private placement notes and a £480m revolving credit 
facility with a syndicate of banks, which was undrawn. In 
addition, the Group had a receivables financing facility 
of £30.0m which was unutilised at the year-end (2016: 
utilisation of £7.7m).
Following the further small disposals relating to the 
private sector BPO business, the Group was required to 
offer two thirds of the net disposal proceeds to the debt 
holders in prepayment. As a result of this process, £3.7m 
($4.9m) of private placement notes were repaid at par on 
29 June 2017.
Interest rate risk
Given the nature of the Group’s business, we have a 
preference for fixed rate debt to reduce the volatility 
of net finance costs. Our Treasury Policy requires us to 
maintain a minimum proportion of fixed rate debt as a 
proportion of overall Net Debt and for this proportion 
to increase as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense 
falls. As at 31 December 2017, more than 100% of the 
Group’s Net Debt was at fixed rates. Interest on the 
revolving credit facility is at floating rate, however it  
was undrawn.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group is subject to currency exposure on the 
translation to Sterling of its net investments in overseas 
subsidiaries. The Group manages this risk where 
appropriate, by borrowing in the same currency as those 
investments. Group borrowings are predominantly 
denominated in Sterling and US Dollar. The Group 
manages its currency flows to minimise foreign 
exchange risk arising on transactions denominated in 
foreign currencies and uses forward contracts where 
appropriate to hedge net currency flows.
Credit risk
Cash deposits and in-the-money financial instruments 
give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from 
counterparties. The Group manages this risk by 
adhering to counterparty exposure limits based on 
external credit ratings of the relevant counterparty.
Debt covenants
The principal financial covenant ratios are consistent 
across the private placement loan notes, receivables 
financing facility and revolving credit facility, with a 
maximum Consolidated Total Net Borrowings (CTNB) 
to covenant EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum covenant 
EBITDA to net finance costs of 3.0 times, tested semi-
annually. A reconciliation of the basis of calculation is 
set out in the table opposite.

Net assets 307.2 398.8
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66 At 31 December 2017 the balance sheet had net assets  
of £307.2m, a movement of £91.6m from the closing  
net asset position of £398.8m as at 31 December 2016. 
The decrease in net assets is mainly due to the  
following movements:
• A decrease in the net retirement benefit assets of 
Group funded defined benefit pension schemes of 
£106.4m. In June 2017, the Trustees of the Group’s 
primary defined benefit pension scheme entered into 
a bulk annuity purchase whereby an insurer will fund 
future benefit payments to the relevant members. 
The liability to pay the members remains with the 
pension scheme which continues to include the 
relevant pension liabilities, but an insurance asset 
is held which is an equal and opposite amount to 
the liability. This removes the risk of longevity and 
investment movements for this portion of the scheme 
on a funding basis, and also removes the accounting 
risk of movements in underlying assumptions on the 
liabilities. The transaction resulted in a significant 
reduction in the surplus of the pension scheme  
under IFRS accounting convention, but resulted in  
a reduction in the deficit that is actuarially assessed  
for funding purposes of approximately £12m. As at 
31 December 2017 the estimated actuarial deficit  
of this scheme was £33.7m (2016: £42.6m).
• A decrease in provisions of £61.7m. Further details  
on provision movements is provided below.
• The combined position of trade and other current 
assets and trade and other current liabilities increased 
by £29.5m and Net Debt increased by £31.8m. Further 
details of these movements are provided in the cash 
flow and Net Debt sections above.
• A decrease in goodwill of £26.6m, caused by 
movements in foreign exchange rates.
Provisions
The total of current and non-current provisions has 
decreased by £61.7m since 31 December 2016. The 
movement is due to a decrease in onerous contract 
provisions of £52.0m, an increase in employee-related 
provisions of £10.6m, a decrease in property provisions 
of £0.9m and a reduction in other provisions of £19.4m. 
The £10.6m increase in employee-related provisions is 
partly due to the ongoing Strategy Review restructuring 
programme and partly relating to obligations arising 
at the end of certain contracts. The decrease in other 
provisions is primarily due to the release of £10.3m of 
exceptional provisions relating to pensions, with the 
remaining movement comprised of contract settlements 
and releases for potential claims. 
 
Movements in contract provisions since the 
31 December 2016 balance sheet date, are as follows:

At 31 December 2017 168.2
The balance of OCPs at 31 December 2017 was 
£168.2m (2016: £220.2m). OCP balances are subject to 
ongoing review and a full bottom-up assessment of the 
forecasts that form the basis of the OCPs is conducted 
as part of the annual budgeting process. The net non-
exceptional charge to OCPs was £19.0m in 2017 and 
utilisation was £69.3m. 
In 2017, additional charges have been made in respect 
of future losses on a number of onerous contracts 
totalling £62.0m. This increase related to revisions to 
existing OCPs of £61.5m and a new provision raised on 
one contract totalling £0.5m. The new contract has been 
operating for a number of years and is expected to be 
terminated in 2018. 
Included within additional charges made to existing 
OCPs is £47.0m relating to the Caledonian Sleepers 
contract. This increase is partly due to revised 
assumptions for the higher costs of running the 
contract and the impact from delays in the delivery 
of new trains, which includes the higher cost of the 
running old trains for longer, associated penalties and 
the forecast benefit of revenue growth from the new 
trains being pushed back. In addition we have revised 
our revenue forecast for the contract based on the 2017 
performance, where even a modest reduction in annual 
revenue can have a significant impact on a multi-year 
OCP. There continue to be a number of assumptions 
underpinning the provision that have a range of 
potential outcomes, including the train manufacturer 
delivering the new trains to the latest timetable and 
volume and pricing increases driven by the improved 
passenger service from the new trains. The position 
under the contract is expected to improve over time, 
as the terms of the Franchise Agreement provide a 
mechanism that requires Transport Scotland to bear 
50% of contract losses from 1 April 2020. 
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report
67 Strategic Report
Finance Review continued
In addition, from 1 April 2022, we have the right to seek 
adjustments to the financial terms of the Franchise 
Agreement that would result either in a small positive 
profit margin for Serco from that date, or allow us to  
exit the contract.
In addition to the Caledonian Sleepers contract, there 
have been net OCP releases of £16.4m in UK & Europe 
and £11.4m in AsPac. 
Acquisitions
On 26 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of 
the issued share capital of BTP Systems, LLC, for 
consideration of US Dollar $20.5m in cash. Further 
details on this post year-end transaction are provided  
in Note 40 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The Group signed a revised Business Purchase 
Agreement (BPA) on 13 February 2018 with the Special 
Managers and Provisional Liquidators acting on behalf 
of the relevant Carillion plc subsidiaries to acquire a 
portfolio of selected UK health facilities management 
contracts. The portfolio has annual revenues of 
approximately £90m and a weighted average remaining 
term of 14 years. Upon the receipt by the Special 
Managers and Provisional Liquidators of the requisite 
third party consents, each individual contract will be 
transferred to Serco on a cash-free, debt-free basis, 
with the consideration to be paid in instalments and to 
be satisfied using Serco’s existing financing facilities. 
If all the contracts are transferred to Serco under the 
revised BPA process, the total consideration payable 
would be £29.7m. The consideration payable is lower 
than the amount of £47.7m announced on 13 December 
2017 in respect of substantially the same contracts that 
were subject to the initial BPA signed with Carillion 
plc at that date. The change in consideration reflects 
the Group’s re-evaluation of potential liabilities, 
indemnities, warranties and the additional working 
capital investment required as a result of Carillion’s 
liquidation. The financial effects of this transaction 
have not been recognised at 31 December 2017. As 
consents are required for each individual contract to 
be transferred and therefore acquired, at the time the 
financial statements were authorised for issue, no legal 
transfer or control of assets had taken place and so no 
disclosures have been made in respect of the assets 
and liabilities being acquired. The fair values of the 
assets and liabilities will be determined at the date 
when contracts are acquired. It is also not yet possible 
to provide detailed information about each class of 
acquired receivables and any contingent liabilities in 
respect of the acquired contracts.
As noted in the overview of performance above, the 
Group obtained full control of Serco Sodexo Defence 
Services Pty Ltd by acquiring the remaining 50% of 
issued share capital for £1.6m.
IFRS15
The Group has undertaken a robust assessment 
to determine the impact of IFRS15 on the opening 
balance sheet at 1 January 2017 and for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The impact on opening retained 
earnings will be a reduction of £32.8m and the impact 
on the opening OCP balance will be a reduction of 
£21.7m. Underlying Trading Profit will decrease by £0.3m 
and, as a result of a lower OCP release, Trading Profit 
will decrease by £8.7m for the year ended 31 December 
2017. This low adjustment is reflective of the prudent 
accounting practices adopted by the Group following 
the Contract & Balance Sheet Review undertaken in 
2014 and the repeat nature of the services provided. 
Further detail on the adjustment is provided in Note 2  
of the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 68 Corporate Responsibility
We deliver services to governments, serve the public and help to protect  
national interests. As a provider of public services we are committed to  
operate with a public service ethos and recognise our responsibilities.
Our commitment to corporate responsibility recognises 
evolving political and economic landscapes, public 
expectations, our broader impact as a company and 
how all of these align to the outcomes our customers 
seek to achieve. 
In 2015/2016, we refreshed our Group strategy, clarified 
our purpose and established the new Corporate 
Responsibility Committee of the Board. In 2017, we have 
continued the refresh of our corporate responsibility 
agenda through development of a new corporate 
responsibility framework, to better reflect our strategy 
and the manner in which we conduct our business.
A good deal of care has been taken in the formulation 
of the framework and the elements addressed within. 
We have structured it around our key stakeholders – 
underpinned by our Values, purpose and public service 
ethos – focusing in particular on how we work to add 
sustainable value whilst delivering their requirements 
with accountability and transparency.
The framework defines our principal areas of 
responsibility and will help to guide future practice 
and behaviour whilst facilitating measurement of our 
performance, supporting us in our efforts to: 
• set exemplary standards in public service delivery;
• execute brilliantly to deliver our stakeholders’ 
expectations; 
• meet or exceed the outcomes our customers seek  
to achieve;
• uphold relevant laws and regulatory requirements;
• honour our relationships with our internal and 
external stakeholders; and
• manage our impact on the environment and the 
economies and communities in which we operate.
It will form a foundation for enhancing how we conduct 
our business for years to come.
We have begun to embed the framework in our 
approach. We will continue to focus on this in 
2018 as well as examining stakeholder priorities 
and expectations across our principal areas of 
responsibility in greater detail. We will also explore 
opportunities for richer corporate responsibility 
performance measurement.
For now, we share here a summary of our approach to 
managing corporate responsibility – of how we have 
delivered our public services and lived the principles 
recognised within the framework – along with our 
progress and performance in 2017.
We have continued to build momentum in long-term 
objectives for sustainable improvement – consolidating 
progress and maintaining our key strategies. At the 
same time, however, we recognise enduring challenges 
that, whilst not exclusive to Serco, are high priority 
issues for our business and customers.
For example:
• we continue seeking to safeguard our people and 
service beneficiaries whilst ensuring that we learn and 
move forward meaningfully from every experience; this 
includes building our health and safety influence across 
the broader context of our operations and – where 
applicable – confronting developing trends in violence 
and aggression with care and innovation; and
• we continue striving to strengthen gender balance at 
all levels of our organisation, which includes creating 
the conditions and catalysts for a more diverse and 
inclusive talent pipeline. 
Examples of specific activities feature in this report.
We cannot claim to have met our expectations of 
progress in all areas, particularly where shifting climates, 
pressures and other causal factors remain beyond our 
control, but we firmly believe we can do better, and will 
continue our resistance of complacency and relentless 
pursuit of improvement.

the year, is available on our website: www.serco.com

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 70 Our corporate responsibility governance
The Serco plc Board has ultimate responsibility for the 
Group's business strategy, including CR, and for setting 
the Group’s culture, Values and ethical standards. 
We have a Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) 
of the Board, chaired by Mike Clasper, the Senior 
Independent Director and Non-Executive Director, 
which has oversight of our approach to CR and focuses 
in four areas: health and safety, people, ethics and our 
CR framework.
Our Serco Management System
The Serco Management System (SMS) is our 
management framework, describing how we do 
business. It defines the rules governing how we operate, 
behave and deliver our strategy, including all areas 
covered by our CR framework.
At the heart of the SMS are 16 Group policy statements 
and 23 Group standards. Group policies are signed by 
the Group Chief Executive and approved by the plc 
Board. They define our strategic commitments and 
apply across the Group. 
Group standards reflect our Values and define the 
minimum standards we must achieve, focussing on 
mandatory requirements applicable across the Group. 
Group, Country, Divisional and Local operating 
procedures build on these foundations within the SMS, 
providing direction on how to achieve mandatory 
requirements and comply with relevant laws and 
regulations in the countries where we operate. 
Operating procedures are sensitive to local customs, 
traditions and cultures.
Employee and manager responsibilities regarding 
SMS compliance are clearly defined and all employees 
complete appropriate SMS, Code of Conduct and 
Values training on joining Serco and periodically during 
their time with Serco.
In 2017, a new Privacy policy statement and new Group 
Standards for Insurance, Human Rights and Information 
and Data Privacy were published and the Insider 
Information and Share Dealing Standard was replaced 
with a more detailed Group Standard Operating 
Procedure and Share Dealing Code.
Our Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct helps us to drive continuous  
and consistent responsibility and behaviours across our 
organisation. Based on our Values it forms part of the 
SMS, clearly and concisely defining our expectations of 
operational and behavioural compliance. Everyone who 
works for and on behalf of Serco is expected to know, 
use and live our Code.
In 2017, we have updated our Code. Key changes 
include reflecting our position regarding human rights, 
in particular human trafficking and slavery, and adding 
detail on the importance of personal security. We have 
also added a behaviours section, aligned to our Values, 
enabling employees, people managers and leaders to 
better understand expected behaviours.
Our Values
Our culture is based on a set of four values – Trust, 
Care, Innovation and Pride – that shape our individual 
behaviours and hence the way the Company behaves. 
They help to ensure we are all working from a commonly 
understood base that can be consistently applied 
across our organisation.
In 2017, we have continued to embed our refreshed 
Values in our ways of working and the business 
consciousness. Our Divisions have driven the Values 
through local and regional initiatives, while from a 
Group perspective, the Values are being incorporated 
into the SMS, our Code of Conduct and all existing 
channels, publications and resources. For example:
• Our annual employee engagement survey, 
Viewpoint, and our premier programme of employee 
recognition, the Pulse Awards, are now aligned to 
our Values, enabling us to measure values-based 
engagement and celebrate values-based behaviour.
• Our Values are now integrated into our Code of 
Conduct, Leadership Model and annual Performance 
and Development Review process, enabling us to 
clearly define our expectations of values-based 
behaviour and ensure they are met.
Alongside our ‘Speak Up’ whistleblowing process, 
these elements also enable us to regularly assess 
and reinforce our culture. Our Viewpoint Culture 
Index comprises engagement levels for each of the 
four Values and provides insight into our culture as 
defined by our Values and perceived by our people. 
Culture Index results inform annual engagement  
action planning.

Behaving with integrity and treating people  
with respect
(See also: Fair competition page 75;  
Responsible relationships page 76).
Across all our regions, we aim to meet the high moral 
and ethical standards we have set ourselves, within 
the bounds of expected individual and corporate 
behaviour, with regard for relevant laws and regulatory 
requirements, with sensitivity to local cultures, and with 
the utmost respect for human rights.
We have zero tolerance for any form of corrupt 
behaviour or activity that breaks any law relating to 
human rights, either directly or indirectly, anywhere in 
the world. We recognise our obligations under the UK 
Modern Slavery Act 2015, publish an annual Modern 
Slavery Statement on www.serco.com and do not 
engage in any form of human trafficking or use forced, 
bonded, illegal or child labour, nor knowingly work  
with anyone who does.
We use international human rights standards as a 
framework to assess, monitor, mitigate and remedy 
any actual or potential adverse human rights impacts 
(AHRIs) that may affect our business.
In 2017, we have refreshed our human rights assessment 
and decision tree process, strengthening its coverage 
of slavery and human trafficking; published a new Group 
Standard for human rights; and refreshed our mandated 
ethics and compliance training with a new suite of 
courses ready for 2018, including modern slavery.
We have also improved our Speak Up (whistleblowing) 
programme by implementing an enhanced case 
management system, provided as before by an 
independent third party, to make the system more 
accessible and easier to use; updated our online gifts 
and hospitality register to enable approval as well as 
registration of items, helping ensure compliance with 
the UK Bribery Act; and undertaken further reviews of 
adequate procedures for Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
(ABC) in our Divisions, completing UK & Europe, Middle 
East and AsPac. Additionally, in the UK we piloted 
an ABC assessment tool to review contracts against 
required adequate procedures.
Our CR in action
We celebrated ‘Zero Harm Week’ across our Divisions 
in October in support of our Group objective to 
improve health and safety engagement by promoting 
a culture of health, safety and wellbeing.
In the UK, we have won several Royal Society for the 
Prevention of Accidents Gold Awards in 2017, including 
at RAF Fylingdales and Forth Valley Royal Hospital.
We have driven continuous improvement in health and 
safety across our businesses, including new tools and 
training in Serco Americas to reduce risks and improve 
safety management in air traffic control and naval 
engineering, and new tools in Serco AsPac to improve 
roadside welfare safeguards for our road safety 
camera operators.
Safe and healthy operations
Our vision is zero harm. Wherever we work, we are 
committed to the promotion of wellbeing and the 
prevention of injury and ill health.
We strive to promote a 'just' health and safety culture 
based on active and caring leadership and mutual 
trust, innovation and pride; actively encourage input 
from employees and others to build sustainable 
solutions; identify and assess the health and safety 
hazards, impacts and risks that arise from our activities 
and services, investigating incidents and monitoring 
performance and systems; and regularly review, learn 
and identify opportunities for continual improvement.
In 2017, we reviewed our Group policy and strengthened 
supporting Group Standards with the definition 
of safety critical risks, whilst embedding Incident 
Management and Reporting standards to raise visibility 
of and improve consistency in related activities. We 
have launched a significant review of safety-related risks 
in support of the Group principal risk, ‘catastrophic 
incident’. We have continued to build our health 
and safety influence across the broader context of 
our operations, for example in Transport, where 
our experiences have intensified our resolve to help 
improve road safety in the UAE – not just for our people 
but for all UAE citizens – and strengthen our aviation 
safety oversight and sharing of best practice – not just 
regionally but internationally through a global aviation 
safety forum. We also conducted a UK pilot of the 
Health and Safety Laboratory (HSL) 'Safety Climate'  
tool to evaluate and benchmark our safety culture.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72 Inclusive workplace
Our business thrives because of our talented and diverse 
workforce, which we seek out, nurture and empower.  
We recognise, however, that we must continually 
challenge ourselves to ensure diversity and inclusion  
are embedded in our culture and ways of working.
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) is prioritised in both our 
People Policy and Strategy. We strive to promote equality 
of opportunity and create an inclusive and enabling 
environment in which all our people are treated fairly and 
with respect, dignity and zero tolerance for any form of 
discrimination. We prioritise proactive management and 
regular analysis of our workforce diversity, seeking to 
attract, develop and retain employees from the broadest 
possible talent pool.
Our approach to D&I recognises that achievement of 
our overall goals needs to take account of business 
maturity, regional variations and local legislation. 
Implementation of our strategy therefore takes place  
at three levels:
• Group sets policy and the broad framework to ensure 
consistency of approach, as well as providing clarity 
on key areas of focus.
• Each Division maintains a D&I strategy aligned to the 
overall Group framework with priorities appropriate 
to their geographies, sectors, employee base and 
local legislation. Progress is reported through normal 
business review and governance frameworks.
• A further level of focus is appropriate for some 
Business Units or contracts within a Division, e.g. 
in businesses of a particular size, in particular 
geographies, or according to local customer 
specifications.
Following the launch of our refreshed approach to 
D&I in Q4 2016, we have been establishing regular 
monitoring and reporting of progress and delivery of 
targets at each level (Group/Division/Business Unit or 
Contract), whilst continuing our work towards achieving 
a minimum of 25% females in leadership roles by 2020, 
focusing in particular on improving gender balance in 
senior recruitment and our talent pipeline.
We have also established D&I as a standing agenda 
item for our Quarterly Talent Reviews (attended by 
the Group Human Resources Director (HRD) and 
Divisional Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and HRDs), 
ensuring relevant actions are delivered and risks 
managed; incorporated D&I demographics into our 
employee engagement survey, as appropriate by 
Division, expanding options for gender identity, sexual 
orientation and disability; developed and launched an

In the UK, we have joined the Stonewall Diversity 
Champion programme and launched a network for

initiative; and our Serco Inspiring Women network 
has partnered with Everywoman, the world's largest

women in business.
In Americas, our Women at Serco Americas network

In the UK, we have completed preparations for 
reporting pay gap information annually from April 2018, 
as required by the Equality Act 2010. We are committed 
to ensuring that all our employees are treated fairly, with 
dignity, and with an equality of opportunity throughout 
their careers with Serco. Measuring, understanding 
and reporting our Gender Pay Gap is a welcome and 
important step in this journey.
We have undertaken extensive analysis of what is 
behind our current median gender pay gap of 12.9% so 
that we can identify real opportunities to reduce this. 
This figure reflects the average paid to men and women 
across our UK businesses. It is not a comparison of pay 
rates for men and women doing work of equal value. 
The primary cause of the gender pay gap within Serco 
is the demography of our UK employee population, in 
which we currently have an imbalance in the number 
of men and women at the various levels within the 
organisational structure. We have fewer women than 
men in more senior positions and typically people 
in more senior positions receive the highest pay and 
bonus pay. This impacts the hourly pay and the bonus 
pay figures. 
Complementing our strategic D&I focus on leadership 
gender, our analysis shows that an equal gender 
distribution at our manager level and above would 
reduce the overall pay gap to well below UK averages.

California and Virginia to engage in therapy respite.
In Grafton, New South Wales, we have partnered with 
the national charity Midnight Basketball Australia to 
help provide for the welfare of young people from the 
local community.
Contributing to communities
Through our business operations we contribute to local 
employment, small-medium enterprises, communities 
and economies. Beyond this, we encourage, facilitate, 
and proactively drive community initiatives and 
charitable giving both from colleagues and from the 
Serco Foundation.
We strive to work closely with communities to make a 
positive difference and partner with local governments 
in order to best contribute to local economies; employ 
people from our local communities where possible; 
encourage and participate in charitable activity 
that aligns with our Values; and ensure small firms, 
voluntary and community organisations, and social 
enterprises are actively encouraged to be members  
of Serco’s supply chain.
In 2017, we enabled and facilitated efforts in 
fundraising and support for local communities across 
our businesses through our Divisional sponsorship 
programmes as well as other partnering with local 
governments, social enterprises and charity; continued 
to prioritise recruitment from local communities 
where appropriate; and continued seeking to expand 
and enrich the diversity of our supplier base through 
engagement with small and medium-sized suppliers 
across our businesses. We have also been preparing 
to relaunch the independent Serco Foundation with a 
new strategy centred on deploying funds to charitable 
partners focused on innovation to improve public 
service outcomes for citizens.

of Wolverhampton.
Employee engagement and development
We are committed to fostering professional 
development and positive working environments that 
enable our people to be highly engaged, capable, 
passionate about public service, and motivated to 
achieve personal success.
We regularly review and strive to improve levels of 
employee engagement and performance, including the 
development of their skills to meet current and future 
business needs and addressing any behaviour identified 
as negatively impacting engagement. We provide 
relevant training and development where necessary to 
enable individuals to perform their duties within role.
In 2017, we have achieved improvements in overall 
employee engagement whilst incrementally 
strengthening priority engagement drivers identified 
by our 2016 results (connection to Serco, taking action 
on employee feedback, recognition and resources). 
We have sustained momentum in building leadership 
engagement whilst also focussing on our people 
managers, prioritising contract managers; rolled our 
‘Engagement Insights’ tool out beyond our leadership 
population, enabling immediate feedback and support 
for all employees completing our survey online; and 
launched a Steering Committee to improve engagement 
across our Group Functions and Corporate Shared 
Services, chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer.
We have continued working to enhance and embed 
our core development programmes, including our 
Management Programme, designed in partnership 
with Oxford Saïd Business School to develop a cadre

strategy. A further 118 of our global management 
population have completed the programme in 2017, 
bringing the cumulative total to 208.

We have conducted a range of local and central 
environmental initiatives across our businesses,

programme and renovating/re-using offices and 
furniture across contracts in Serco Americas.
Protecting the environment
We are committed to limiting the impact our operations 
have on the environment through more sustainable 
business practice.
We strive to promote a commitment to the environment 
based on active and caring leadership and mutual trust, 
innovation and pride; actively encourage input from 
employees and others to build sustainable solutions; 
identify and assess the environmental hazards, impacts 
and risks that arise from our activities and services, 
investigating incidents and monitoring performance 
and systems; and regularly review, learn and identify 
opportunities for continual improvement.
We work to minimise adverse environmental impact 
through the implementation of environmental 
management systems that are proportional to each 
contract, aligned to customer specification and 
contractual requirements, and underpinned by our 
Group Standard Operating Procedure for Health,  
Safety and the Environment.
The SMS sets out how we will deliver our environmental 
commitment, aligned to the ISO14001:2015 standard 
on environmental management. Across more than 
two thirds of our business, we work on our customers’ 
premises and are not in direct control of environmental 
impacts. In such cases we work collaboratively with our 
customers on environmental issues.
Where we have control, activities are managed locally, 
covering a wide range of initiatives focused on reducing 
our carbon emissions intensity, improving energy and 
fuel efficiency, improving our waste management 
processes and promoting biodiversity.
In 2017 we benchmarked our approach to climate 
change via the globally-recognised annual Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) climate change questionnaire, 
achieving a score of B (of all participating companies 
23.3% scored A, 24.4% scored B and 52.3% scored C or 
D, while within our sector 22% scored A, 21.6% scored B 
and 56.4% scored C or D). We have also undertaken an 
initial Scope 3 carbon emissions assessment to identify 
priority areas in our indirect carbon emissions and 
investigated the Science Based Target methodology to 
inform future carbon target setting.
Fair competition
We compete legally, fairly and ethically, making sure 
we promote competition in business, protect our 
customers’ interests and avoid situations that may,  
or may appear to, create a conflict of interest.
We strive to ensure we do not abuse any dominant 
market position we have, obtain competitive intelligence 
through improper means, or enter into any agreements, 
arrangements or concerted business practices which 
appreciably prevent, restrict or distort competition. We 
are committed to engaging with competitors and trade 
associations with appropriate caution.
In 2017, we have reviewed and refreshed training for 
managers, and developed a conflicts of interest register 
with approvals and action workflows. These will be 
launched across the business in 2018.

We are helping to drive improved supplier behaviour 
around human rights in the Middle East through

We have continued seeking to expand and enrich the 
diversity of our supplier base through engagement 
with small and medium-sized suppliers across 
our businesses, including joining Supply Nation 
in Australia to improve our access to Indigenous 
businesses, and maintaining our Supplier Network 
Portal in the US to improve our access to small and 
minority-owned businesses.
In the UK, we engaged a small cross-section of  
our key suppliers in a trial to test and refine our new  
SRM supplier relationship management solution, 
selecting participants from a range of categories 
and lengths of relationship with Serco and working 
closely with them to baseline relationships, establish 
consistent governance and identify opportunities  
for improvement.
Responsible relationships
We build honest, respectful and transparent 
relationships with customers, partners and suppliers 
who share our ethical standards and who follow 
regulatory compliance.
We seek to work only with customers, partners 
and suppliers who respect our Values and meet 
our standards of business conduct and ethics. We 
complete legal, ethical and human rights due diligence 
on proposed key third parties and conduct ongoing 
monitoring throughout the lifetime of the relationship; 
conduct robust needs analysis and establish a clear 
management structure for all third party arrangements 
considered necessary to meet contract requirements, 
(including joint ventures, strategic partnerships or 
consortium arrangements); apply robust supplier 
sourcing and selection criteria; and monitor supplier 
performance to inform relationship management and 
identify opportunities for improvement.
In 2017, we continued embedding our newly enhanced 
third party due diligence processes and commenced 
ongoing monitoring; refreshed our Supplier Code of 
Conduct and updated components in our supplier 
governance to meet modern slavery and human 
trafficking requirements, including the strengthening 
of contract terms; and engaged Anti-Slavery 
International to help us better understand related  
risks in our supply chain.
We have also worked to improve management of risk 
across our supply chain in our UK & Europe, Middle 
East and AsPac Divisions by implementing enhanced 
supplier onboarding (incorporating latest ABC and 
ethical due diligence requirements) and piloting a new 
supplier relationship management (SRM) programme 
in the UK, developed to deliver ongoing performance 
and innovation improvements with key suppliers.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 76 Quality service delivery
We draw on our international best practice, cross-sector 
experience and our ability to innovate in order to help 
governments raise standards of public service.
Providing reliable and high quality products and 
services that meet customer and service user needs 
is important to us. To the best of our abilities, aligned 
to helping customers achieve value for money, we 
seek to deliver services that are as high quality 
as possible and subject to appropriate focus on 
continuous improvement.
We work closely with our customers, striving to 
anticipate, understand and meet their needs and 
expectations; deploy quality systems that deliver 
excellent service usability for service recipients; invest in 
public service research and development and innovate 
quickly and proactively, testing new ways of doing 
things and improving continuously throughout the 
lifetime of our contracts; develop scalable, customisable 
solutions; and transfer best practice and experience 
internationally and cross-sector.
In 2017, we have further developed our CoEs in Justice 
& Immigration, Healthcare and Transport to build 
differentiated capabilities, strengthen our sector 
propositions and maximise the benefits of our cross-
regional experience; and planned the re-launch of 
the Serco Institute, which will be deployed to provide

Duty of care
At the heart of the design and delivery of our services, 
we place the health, safety and wellbeing of our service 
users and citizens.
We strive to prioritise, protect and promote the health, 
safety and wellbeing of the recipients of our services, 
whether they are those for whom we are directly 
responsible, such as individuals in our prisons or 
travelling on our transport, or those who are the direct 
beneficiaries of our services, such as patients in the 
hospitals that we clean. We design and deliver services 
in ways that focus on the needs and experiences of 
service users as well as service-related outcomes; and 
work to ensure that service users are treated at all times 
with consideration, courtesy, compassion and respect, 
and that every provision and interaction exemplifies our 
value of Care.
Specific duty of care objectives are defined, managed 
and delivered at contract level, monitored by relevant 
business units. More broadly, our commitment to 
duty of care informs Divisional and sector-specific 
business strategies, overseen by Divisional Executive 
Management Teams and/or our sector Centres of 
Excellence (CoEs).
It is also a defining factor for activity across our CR 
framework, for example: improving our Speak Up 
system makes it easier for employees to report potential 
risks to service users, while improving the engagement 
levels of service user-facing employees contributes to  
a better service experience for service users.

Social outcomes
We aim to enhance social outcomes by designing  
and delivering frontline public services that make 
a real difference to people’s lives.
We believe that the provision of public services 
around the world – for us, for our customers and for 
society – requires commitment to a social as well as a 
commercial contract. We strive to maintain our public 
service ethos and aspiration to do the best for citizens, 
not only for our customers. Aligned to our ambition 
for quality service delivery, we design citizen-centred 
public service solutions whilst maintaining a focus on 
delivering particularly complex and transformational 
services that are critical to the functioning of society.
In 2017, we have continued to enable the achievement 
of enhanced social outcomes through consistent, well-
managed and continuously improving frontline services. 
For example: 
• Justice: We have helped to safeguard society and 
reduce reoffending through the provision of prison 
management, police support and prisoner escorting 
services.
• Immigration: We have helped to protect borders and 
manage immigration through the provision of border 
control, detention centre and asylum seeker housing 
and welfare services.
• Citizen Services: We have contributed to local 
community wellbeing through the provision of leisure 
facilities and waste management services.
• Health: We have helped to enhance patient 
experiences and maintain safer environments 
in hospitals through the provision of facilities 
management services.
• Defence: We have contributed to the protection 
of national and international security through the 
provision of critical support services to defence 
organisations.
• Transport: We have helped to facilitate national 
travel, enabling local and regional economies and 
societies to function through the provision of air,  
sea, road and rail services.

Shareholder returns
We focus on creating long-term, sustainable value – 
protecting the interests of our owners alongside those 
of our employees, customers and communities in which 
we operate.
We believe that in a free market system, and in 
the long-term, the preservation and growth of the 
business and the maximisation of shareholder value 
automatically coincide, even if there is some short-term 
divergence. Delivering sustainable, profitable growth is 
therefore central to appropriate delivery of shareholder 
returns, and our performance framework is structured 
accordingly. We will realise this by executing our 
strategy to achieve our purpose of becoming a trusted 
partner of governments, delivering superb public 
services, that transform outcomes and make a positive 
difference for our fellow citizens.
For 2017, we have delivered Underlying Trading Profit at 
the top end of the guidance we gave at the start of the 
year, and we expect profits to grow strongly over the 
next two years. Beyond 2019, our long-term ambitions 
for margins and revenue growth – as originally 
expressed with our Strategy Review announced in 
2015 – remain intact, but the timing of achieving these 
continues to be subject to seeing improvements in the 
trading conditions across our markets. In the meantime 
we continue to deliver against our plans and make good 
progress against our strategy.

Value for public money
Along with quality of delivery, we aspire to greater 
efficiency in public services and in enabling 
governments to deliver better for less.
We are committed to enabling governments to achieve 
the best value for money for the public services we 
deliver. To deliver efficiency to our customers, we 
strive to manage our business with commercial rigour; 
innovate at both the contract and corporate level; fully 
utilise our economies of scale and our international, 
transferable expertise; and drive a cost-effective  
supply chain.
In 2017, we have renewed our focus on innovation 
through our CoEs and made significant progress 
towards ensuring that our operating costs are as 
efficient as possible, including work undertaken on  
our operating model and overhead costs, from which 
we expect to realise benefits in forthcoming years.  
The decision to merge our two UK-based Divisions

We support informed risk-taking that promotes 
business growth and success whilst recognising 
the risks associated with key decisions, and embed 
systematic, structured and timely risk management in

clarity. We are therefore committed to open and regular 
engagement with our shareholders.
We strive to maintain open, meaningful dialogue with  
all our shareholders, and use a variety of communication 
means to update investors on performance and gain 
insight into shareholder views, including ensuring that 
Board members and the wider senior management 
team are available to address shareholder questions 
and views at our Annual General Meeting. We seek 
to provide meaningful insight into our results and 
prospects; have management information systems 
that enable efficient and effective internal and external 
reporting; and base our approach to executive 
remuneration on a clear rationale in which the alignment 
of interests are recognisable and understandable.
In 2017, we delivered our annual schedule of external 
reporting and shareholder engagement, including 
additional trading and contract news updates to ensure 
transparency of performance and around 200 meetings

Notes:
The performance analysis is based on data reported as at 21 February 2018. Additional data may arise after this date. Where this occurs, numbers will  
be corrected in the following year’s table.
All data excludes JVs and historical BPO data to enable a like-for-like comparison. Our private sector offshore BPO business was sold in December 2015.
Current workforce KPI levels are in line with benchmark targets for the geographies and markets in which we operate, however we continue to try to improve them. 
Annual targets are managed at local and regional levels.
1.  Historical Viewpoint Index data has been adjusted to reflect modifications to Index calculation methodology in 2017. An index comprises one or more related 
questions that cover a specific area of analysis. Scores are generated based on the % of survey respondents who ‘agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ to all questions 
within an Index.
2.  Where anonymous cases provide insufficient information, we are unable to investigate.
3.   We have maintained a healthy overall engagement profile and leadership engagement has remained stable while we have focused on improving employee 
and people manager engagement. 
4.  Inclusive workplace and age figures are representative only of employees for whom relevant data is available.
5. Reduction reflects improvements in data availability resulting from new D&I strategy and focus on developing clear and robust data.
6.  Slight adjustment in rate due to late capture of incidents on reporting system.
7.  Data includes incidents of spitting/potting as serious assaults in line with UK reporting requirements. When these are excluded the comparable rate is 0.88,  
a 5% improvement on 2016.
8.  Relates to an incident in 2011.
9.  Dubai Metro: February 2017 (500,000AED) public hazard relating to escalator maintenance by a sub-contractor – fine paid by sub-contractor and revised work 
instructions implemented; August 2017 (100,000AED) unsafe lifting operations relating to glass movement in station – revised work instructions implemented.

10.  Our reporting year for greenhouse gas emissions is one quarter behind our financial year, namely 1 Oct 2016 to 30 Sept 2017. We quantify and report to  
ISO 14064-1 2012, using an operational control approach to defining our organisational boundary. The classification of reporting boundaries is set out in 
detail in our Basis of Reporting document, available on our website, www.serco.com. We report all material emission sources for which we consider ourselves 
responsible and have set our materiality threshold at 5%.
11.  Sale of our private sector offshore BPO business (10,630,000 kgCO

12.  Increased proportionally due to electricity reductions.
13.  Expanded scope of measurement in 2017, market based measurement uses conversion factors from suppliers where available and is a metric asked for  
in the CDP submission.
14.  Expanded scope of measurement in 2017, includes air, rail, private car, hire car and hotel stays.
15.  New scoring mechanism introduced in 2015.
16.  2017 numbers reflect implementation of new third party due diligence screening. All current and legacy suppliers and customers have been processed  
in 2017 – a total of 35,850 organisations.
17. An additional 6,634 organisations were disqualified because they are no longer used by Serco or there is a gap of two years or more in the relationship.

Directors’ Report

Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 
31 December 2017. The Board believes that good 
governance is key to the long-term success of the 
Group and is committed to achieving high standards  
of governance. 
As in previous years, we report against the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC'). During 2017, 
we have fully complied with the provisions of the 
Code, with the exception of provision B.6.2 concerning 
external evaluation of the Board. 
Effectiveness
In 2016, we committed to undertake an external 
evaluation of the Board and its Committees during 2017. 
In the latter half of 2017, we appointed three new Non-
Executive Directors and, in view of this, the Board agreed 
to defer its external evaluation until 2018 to provide 
opportunity for our new Board members to settle into 
their new roles. This year, the Board conducted an 
internal Board evaluation with support from the Group 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, taking into 
account the recommendations from the 2016 review  
and changes in the Code. A summary of the findings  
are set out on page 92.
Changes in the Board
The Board continued to review Board composition 
and succession planning with assistance from the 
Nomination Committee. In July 2017, Ralph Crosby 
stepped down from the Board. A considered selection 
process to appoint a successor to Ralph was undertaken 
and led to the appointment of both Lynne Peacock and 
Ian El-Mokadem in July. 
In addition, Angie Risley notified the Board of her 
intention to step down with effect from 15 September. 
Angie joined the Board in April 2011 and in May 
2012 was appointed as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. I would like to thank both Ralph and Angie 
for their valuable contributions since joining the Board 
in 2011.
Upon Angie’s departure, Lynne succeeded Angie as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee owing to her 
extensive experience of chairing other Remuneration 
Committees elsewhere. Following a further selection 
process, Kirsty Bashforth joined the Board. Details of 
the selection process in respect of all the new Non-
Executive Director appointments are contained in the 
Nomination Committee Report on page 102. Each 
of the new Non-Executive Directors bring valuable 
experience and relevant skills to the Board.
Ed Casey, our Chief Operating Officer, retired from 
the Board at the end of December following 12 years 
of service at Serco. I would like to reiterate my sincere 
thanks to Ed for his contribution to Serco and wish 
him every success in the future. Following detailed 
discussion, the Board agreed there would be no need 
to find a successor for Ed and instead his role and 
responsibilities would be best achieved and delivered 
between Rupert, Angus and the other members of the 
Executive Committee.
Contract site visits
The most recent additions to our Board have visited a 
number of our contract sites as part of their induction 
programme and have enjoyed the opportunity to 
witness the excellent day-to-day service provided by 
our contract teams. The visits have given our newest 
Board members a deeper level of understanding of the 
risks and opportunities faced by our contract teams on 
a daily basis, together with the Group-wide challenges 
regarding the scale and variety of our operations.  
A number of our existing Non-Executive Directors  
have also visited our contract sites during the year.
Corporate Governance Report
Chairman’s Governance Overview
This report sets out how Serco is governed 
and the key activities of the Board of Directors 
in promoting effective governance during 
2017. Further information on how the Company 
complied with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code during 2017 is set out on pages 108 
and 109. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 88 Diversity
Further to our commitment to improve gender diversity 
at the Board, I am pleased to report that we have 
increased female representation on our Board from 22% 
to 30% in 2017. At the same time, through the work of 
the Nomination Committee, the Board reviewed and 
updated its Board Diversity Policy, taking into account 
the guidance of the Hampton-Alexander Review 
and the Parker Review along with any other factors, 
objectives and target dates. The Board is equally 
committed to ensuring the development of gender and 
ethnic diversity amongst Serco’s senior management 
population and to that end will annually review its 
recommendations on gender and ethnic diversity for 
senior management roles.
Corporate Responsibility Framework
The Board has continued to refresh and strengthen 
Serco’s corporate responsibility agenda through 
development of a new corporate responsibility 
framework – forming a foundation for how we conduct 
our business whilst ensuring its relevance to our 
strategy and governance. The new framework clearly 
defines our principal areas of responsibility – structured 
around our Values, purpose and key stakeholders – and 
will help to guide action and behaviour whilst facilitating 
measurement of our performance. For further 
information, please refer to our corporate responsibility 
update on page 69.
Shareholder engagement
The Board continued to engage in an open and 
meaningful way with its shareholders during the course 
of 2017. In particular, since her appointment as Chair 
of the Remuneration Committee, Lynne Peacock has 
met with each of our major shareholders, together with 
a number of advisory bodies and other institutional 
shareholders, to discuss our approach to Directors’ 
Remuneration and the new policy we have proposed to 
shareholders from 2018 onwards, set out on pages 115 
to 128. In addition, I attend the results announcements 
in the City and meet many of our stakeholders. I hope 
shareholders will take the opportunity to meet with 
Board members at the 2018 AGM.

Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Board evaluation
An external evaluation of the Board and its Committees 
was due to take place in 2017 however, as stated 
on page 88, the Board determined that, due to the 
number of new Non-Executive Directors appointed in 
the latter half of 2017, it would be sensible to allow the 
new Directors time to settle into their new roles before 
arranging an external evaluation.
The 2017 Board evaluation process was conducted 
internally, led by the Chairman and facilitated by the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
A comprehensive questionnaire evaluating the 
performance of the Board and each of its Committees 
was completed by all Directors. The evaluation covered a 
number of areas including: Board structure, Committees 
and their operation; induction and development; 
interaction with the business; and risk management and 
internal control. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors, 
led by the Senior Independent Director, together with 
views from the Executive Directors, conducted the 
performance evaluation of the Chairman who was  
found to be stewarding the Board effectively.
Following completion of the evaluation, the Board 
discussed the outcome of the questionnaire in detail. 
The results of the evaluation concluded that, overall, 
good progress had been achieved in most areas 
identified in previous evaluations and that the Board, 
together with its Committees, had continued to work 
effectively. However, the Board identified the following 
areas of improvement to be considered in 2018:
• Provide new members of the Board with additional 
background briefings ahead of discussions on 
strategy at Board meetings;
• Arrange more discussion at Board meetings in relation 
to medium and long term measures to be achieved 
from the Group's strategy and to improve the content 
of discussions focused on strategy and growth;
• Further discussion surrounding Executive succession 
plans (in particular the role of the Chief Executive) and 
ensuring the Board and its Committees continue to 
work effectively following the departure of the Chief 
Operating Officer;
• Review how the Board engage with shareholders; and,
• The Chairman, with the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary, to re-evaluate the Board 
training agenda. 
In advance of the scheduled external evaluation of the 
Board in 2018, a number of options and priorities will 
be considered to support continued transparency and 
best practice.
Appointment, induction and training
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that an 
appropriate induction is given to new Board members. 
The induction programme is specifically tailored to the 
needs of the incoming Director and includes circulation of 
the Board policies and procedures, meetings with senior 
management and contract site visits. During 2017 , the 
Directors received advice and training on the following:
• Regulatory developments and changes to the  
UK Listing Rules and Corporate Governance;
• Training on inside information, including the  
Market Abuse Regulations (MAR) 2016;
• Anti-bribery and corruption;
• Money laundering;
• Crisis management; and,
• Update on new accounting standards  
i.e. IFRS 9, 15 and 16.
External Directorships
The Company has adopted a policy which allows  
the Executive Directors to accept directorships of  
other quoted companies provided that they have 
obtained the prior permission of the Chairman.  
In accordance with the Code, no Executive Director 
would be permitted to take on more than one Non-
Executive Directorship in a FTSE 100 company or  
the Chairmanship of such a company. 
During the year, Angus Cockburn held the position  
of Non-Executive Director of GKN plc and was 
appointed as Senior Independent Director of  
GKN plc with effect from 20 February 2018. 
Conflicts of interest
Every Director has a duty to avoid a conflict between 
their personal interests and those of the Company. 
The provisions of Section 175 of the Companies Act 
2006 and the Company's Articles of Association 
permit the Board to authorise situations identified by 
a Director in which he or she has, or may have, a direct 
or indirect interest that conflicts, or may conflict, with 
the interests of the Company. The Board continues 
to undertake regular reviews of the outside positions 
and interests or arrangements with third parties held 
by each Director and, were appropriate, to authorise 
those situational conflicts following consideration. 
Notwithstanding the above, each Director is aware 
of their duty to notify the Board should there be 
any material change to their positions or interests 
during the year. Directors do not participate in Board 
discussions or decisions which relate to any matter in 
which they have, or may have, a conflict of interest.

Dear Shareholder
The Board continues to attach great importance to 
improving risk management across the Group. The 
Committee's aim in 2017 was to challenge Serco’s 
capabilities for assessing and managing risk. In 
particular, it has sought to understand and test 
the extent to which the formal Risk Management 
Framework ('RMF') has been effectively embedded 
throughout the Group. To that end, it has received 
and discussed presentations from each geographical 
division describing how, in practice, they are 
implementing the RMF and has sought to understand 
how the Group’s principal risks are mapped to the 
risks that are being actively managed at divisional 
level. The Committee has also given in-depth 
consideration to the Group’s principal risks focusing 
in particular on the effectiveness of mitigating actions 
and how any gap between the current risk status and 
the Group’s risk appetite is being managed. 
Following a comprehensive review of the Group's 
principal risks by the Executive Committee, the 
Committee considered and agreed the Executive 
Committee’s proposals to:
• Include a new risk 'failure of business critical 
partners, suppliers and sub-contractors';
• Separate 'failure to build reputation or act with 
integrity' into two discrete risks;
• Combine the risk of 'contract non-compliance and 
non-performance' with the risk of 'misreporting of 
performance'; and
• Remove 'failure to attract and retain key resources 
and skills fit for the future' as a principal risk.  
This reflects the success of mitigation actions in  
this area. 
The Committee is taking a continuing interest 
in the Group’s ongoing review of its exposure to 
catastrophic risks and relevant mitigations.
In 2018, the Committee will continue to oversee the 
Group's efforts to upgrade its risk management 
capabilities and the way the RMF has been 
embedded at divisional level. In its regular review  
of principal risks, it intends to pay particular  
attention to monitoring progress in constructing  
and implementing effective risk mitigation plans.
I will be present at the 2018 AGM to answer any 
questions from shareholders on this report and  
the activities of the Committee.

Committee’s responsibilities
The Committee advises the Board on the Group’s 
overall risk appetite, tolerance and strategy, taking 
account of the current and prospective macroeconomic 
and financial environments. The key responsibilities of 
the Committee are:
• Overseeing the effectiveness of the Group's risk 
management framework, including the assessment 
of the principal risks facing the Group and the action 
being taken by management to mitigate risks that are 
outside the Group's risk appetite;
• Challenging and advising the Board on the current 
risk exposures of the Group and future risk strategy, 
and reviewing regular risk management reports 
from management which enable the Committee 
to consider the process for risk identification and 
management;
• Assessing how key Group risks are controlled and 
monitored by management;
• In conjunction with the Audit Committee, reviewing 
the Group’s overall risk assessment processes that 
inform the Board’s decision-making, ensuring both 
qualitative and quantitative metrics are used; and
• Reviewing the Group’s capability to identify and 
manage emerging risks, in conjunction with the other 
Board Committees as appropriate.
The Terms of Reference were reviewed and amended 
this year, materially to reflect the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the ICSA Guidance 
Note for Risk Committees (the 'ICSA Guidance Note'). 
The Terms of Reference for the Committee can be 
found on our corporate website, www.serco.com
Membership and attendees
The Committee consists solely of independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Board considers that each 
member of the Committee is independent within the 
definition set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’). Details of Committee membership 
and attendance at meetings are provided on page 93. 
Biographical details for each member of the Committee 
are provided on pages 86 and 87. The Committee 
met on four occasions during the year. All Committee 
meetings are held in advance of Board meetings, with 
the Committee Chair updating the Board directly on the 
outcomes of each meeting. Meetings of the Committee 
were attended by the Chairman of the Board, the 
Chief Operating Officer, the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary and the Group Risk and 
Compliance Director.
Activities of the Committee during 2017
During the year the Committee’s key activities included:
• Receiving updates regarding the Group’s principal 
risks, detailing key changes and trends, and 
emerging risks; 
• Undertaking, as planned, an in-depth review of the 
following risks: failure to grow profitably, failure to 
attract and retain key resources and skills fit for the 
future, major information security breach, contract 
non-compliance and non-performance, and material 
legal and regulatory compliance failure;
• Reviewing and refining the definition of a catastrophic 
risk event to ensure the right level of understanding 
of this risk and assign appropriate focus on risk 
mitigation activities;
• Receiving presentations, as planned, from members 
of the Serco UK Central Government, Serco Middle 
East and Serco Asia Pacific Executive teams on their 
Divisional Risk Management process. These included 
a review on a safety critical event from Serco Middle 
East, failure/perceived failure of a critical national 
service from Serco UK Central Government and the 
underperformance of contracts due to sub-contractor 
management failures from Serco Asia Pacific; and
• On-going challenge and support of the Group 
Risk and Compliance Director in his work plan for 
improving, enhancing and embedding the risk 
management framework.
Performance review
The Group Risk Committee’s performance was assessed 
as part of the Board’s annual effectiveness review. 
Following that review, the Committee concluded that 
the Committee worked effectively with some areas 
of improvement in relation to its remit and allowing 
time for the Committee to report its deliberations to 
the Board.
2018 priorities and focus
During 2018, the Committee will continue with a  
focus on undertaking detailed deep-dive reviews 
into other Group principal risks and meeting with the 
Divisional teams. Attention will be on the progression  
of mitigation actions and their effectiveness to drive  
the Risk Management agenda.
We will continue the development of our Risk 
Management Model, with a focus on refinements to 
our Key Risk Indicators, Corporate Risk Management 
Tool and the supporting policies and standards 
and reporting.
Corporate Governance Report
Group Risk Committee Report continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 94 Serco’s approach to managing business risks and internal control
Serco has an internal control framework which 
includes financial, operational, compliance and 
risk management controls. These are designed to 
manage and minimise risks that would adversely 
affect services to our customers and to safeguard 
shareholders’ investments, our assets, our people  
and our reputation (collectively ‘business risks’). 
Internal controls and key processes are defined within 
the Serco Management System (SMS) together with 
clear definitions of those individuals responsible 
for ensuring compliance. To provide management 
assurance that these controls are effective, a 'three 
lines of defence' compliance model has been 
implemented to test business compliance. The 
Group's Compliance Assurance Programme defines 
and reports on second line of defence compliance 
activity and the Internal Audit Programme defines and 
reports on Internal Audit activity which forms part of 
the third line of defence.
First line of defence – We seek to minimise the 
probability and impact of business risks through 
the consistent implementation of the SMS, seeking 
to ensure that appropriate processes and controls 
are in place, and that appropriately trained staff 
seek to ensure that customer, legal and regulatory 
requirements are being adhered to, and if not, that 
adequate plans are in place to mitigate. In 2017 we 
completed the annual SMS self-assessment process 
for the third time to enable Contract Managers and 
other Leaders across the Group to self-assess their 
compliance with SMS requirements. Self-assessment 
recipients are now working to address any gaps 
identified, through the completion of action plans. 
While SMS controls are designed to mitigate and 
minimise business risks, these risks cannot be 
completely eliminated. Consequently, while SMS 
controls can provide reasonable assurance against  
misstatement or loss, this cannot be absolute.
Roles and responsibilities – Functions, Divisions, 
Business Units and Contracts within the Group are 
responsible for identifying and managing risks in line 
with SMS policy and standards and for implementing 
associated controls.
Second line of defence – A Group Compliance 
Assurance Programme has been implemented which 
seeks to ensure that a consistent approach is applied 
across the Group in assuring compliance with key 
controls. There is a centrally mandated minimum 
requirement for each Division to include in their 
Compliance Assurance Plans, in order to address 
principal risks, which include a minimum sample of 
completed SMS self-assessments to be validated.
Roles and responsibilities – The Group Risk and 
Compliance Function is responsible for managing the 
SMS and for the development and implementation 
of policies and standards associated with Risk 
Management and Compliance Assurance. The 
Function is the custodian of the Group's Risk Register 
and provides risk management oversight, assurance 
and challenge. It is also custodian of the Group 
Compliance Assurance Programme, again providing 
oversight, assurance and challenge to ensure the 
Programme is risk-based and that material controls, 
mitigating the Group principal risks, are being 
effectively implemented.
Third line of defence – Together with external audits 
undertaken across the Group, Internal Audit provides 
an independent assessment of the design and 
operating effectiveness of the Group's governance, 
risk management and control frameworks that are 
in place to manage risk. The Internal Audit team 
carries out an annual programme of risk-based audits 
reporting findings to the Audit Committee. The audit 
programme is approved by the Audit Committee and 
is continually revised throughout the year to ensure it 
remains focused on appropriate areas. The in-house 
Internal Audit team uses PwC as a co-sourced resource 
where appropriate. 
Roles and responsibilities – The Group Head of 
Internal Audit reports functionally to the Chair of the 
Audit Committee and is responsible for the delivery 
of the Internal Audit programme, ensuring that it is 
risk-based and aligned with the overall strategy of  
the Group.
The first and second line of defence is reviewed and 
challenged by the Executive Committee (and the 
Board), which undertake a review of the Group Risk 
Register and review individual risks as required. 
The third line of defence is fully independent, 
with review and challenge carried out by the Audit 
Committee. The Board has overall responsibility 
for risk management and internal control (and 
is supported in these duties by the Group Risk 
Committee) and formally reviews the findings 
of the overall Internal Audit programme, via the 
Audit Committee.
The Board confirms that there has been a focus on the 
three lines of defence for the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the 2017 Annual Report 
and Accounts.

Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Committee’s report for 
the year ended 31 December 2017 following my first 
full financial year as Chairman of the Committee. 
The Audit Committee has a fundamental role to 
play in reviewing, monitoring and challenging the 
effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting 
and internal control processes. Details of the work 
carried out by the Committee and in addressing 
significant issues are reported to the Board as a 
matter of course and are described in this report.
In 2017, the Committee has continued to focus 
on the critical accounting judgements (especially 
Onerous Contract Provisions (OCPs), tax and 
pensions), the Finance Transformation programme, 
financial controls, the use of Alternative Performance 
Measures (APMs) and the reporting of exceptional 
items. In 2018, the Committee will continue to 
focus on the critical accounting judgements made 
(including OCPs) and financial controls, support 
the implementation of the Finance Transformation 
programme and will review the impact of new 
accounting standards, most notably IFRS 15 and  
IFRS 16.
I will be present at the 2018 AGM to answer any 
questions from shareholders on this report and  
the activities of the Committee.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 96 Performance review
The Audit Committee’s performance was assessed 
as part of the Board’s annual effectiveness review. 
In terms of enhancement to the Committee's overall 
effectiveness, it was felt that the Committee worked 
effectively but should reflect further on annual training 
needs and continue to visit contracts to help improve 
business understanding. 
Activities of the Committee during the year
The Committee has an annual forward agenda developed 
from its Terms of Reference with standing items 
considered at each meeting in addition to any specific 
matters arising and topical business or financial items on 
which the Committee has chosen to focus. The work of the 
Committee in 2017 principally fell into three main areas:
Accounting, tax and financial reporting
• Reviewing the integrity of the half-year and annual 
financial statements and the associated significant 
financial reporting judgements and disclosures;
• Considering the liquidity risk and the basis for 
preparing the half-year and annual financial statements 
on a going concern basis, and reviewing the related 
disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts;
• Considering the provisions of the Code regarding 
going concern and viability statements and reviewing 
emerging practice and investor comment;
• Reviewing updates on accounting matters and new 
accounting standards, including the new accounting 
standards on financial instruments (IFRS 9), revenue

information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy;
 – the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and 
procedures designed to ensure that the Annual 
Report and Accounts complies with all relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements; and
 – the process designed to ensure the External 
Auditor is aware of all ‘relevant audit information’, 
as required by Sections 418 and 419 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Internal controls

Financial controls and significant financial 
judgements
The Group aims to have a strong and well monitored 
control environment that minimises financial risk and, as 
part of the Committee’s responsibilities, it reviews the 
effectiveness of systems for internal financial control 
and financial reporting. Where relevant, the Committee 
also works with the Group Risk Committee to consider 
financial risk management.
Financial control risk is monitored through one of the 
Group's Principal Risks, 'financial control failure'. The 
Committee has reviewed this risk during 2017 and has 
focused in particular on:
• The impact of the Group’s ongoing Finance 
Transformation programme, with briefings received 
at every Committee meeting on the progress of 
the project;
• Updates to the risk mapping framework to document 
key financial control risks being managed by the 
Divisions and Business Units and the assurance 
activity undertaken to mitigate those risks;
• Reviews of the controls and judgements on the 
Group’s balance sheet; and
• Management’s review of the adequacy of the Group 
Finance function's first and second lines of defence.
Following review and challenge, the Committee 
believes that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, 
the financial control framework and the monitoring of 
this framework has worked effectively during the year, 
and that in cases of non-compliance, the Group has not 
been exposed to critical, severe or significant risk. The 
Committee was also encouraged to note that where 
weaknesses in the financial control framework were 
identified they continued to be addressed.
During the year, the Financial Reporting Council ('FRC') 
wrote to the Company in relation to the thematic 
review of Alternative Performance Measures provided 
in the Company’s annual report for the year ended 31 
December 2016. No major financial reporting changes 
were identified however, some clarified descriptions and 
explanations have been included within the 2017 Annual 
Report and Accounts to provide greater transparency in 
relation to exceptional items, in particular the treatment 
and disclosure of restructuring costs.
The FRC’s review only covered the specific disclosures 
relating to this thematic review and provides no 
assurance that the report and accounts are correct in 
all material respects; the FRC’s role is not to verify the 
information provided but to consider compliance with 
reporting requirements.

Issue and Significance How the Committee addressed this Comments and Conclusion
Contract performance, including Onerous Contract Provisions (OCPs)
As part of the 2014 Strategy Review, 
the Contract & Balance Sheet Review 
led to the establishment of material 
OCPs.
The Committee has regularly reviewed and challenged 
Management’s assumptions and main areas of 
judgement in relation to the performance of the 
Group's key contracts.
The Audit Committee gives particular focus to material 
OCP positions and, with the support of the External 
Auditor, agreed that, while accounting for OCPs 
remained an area of judgement, the view formed by 
Management regarding each individual material OCP 
and the aggregate view was considered reasonable. 
As part of their review, the Committee also considered 
how the assessment of OCPs reflected other key 
judgements made by Management in respect of asset 
impairments, deferred tax asset recognition and 
future liquidity and viability.
The Committee agreed with 
Management and the External Auditor 
that the overall level of provision was 
appropriate when taking into account 
the range of possible outcomes.
The Committee also concluded that the 
assumptions and judgements made by 
Management in the calculation of OCPs 
were consistent with those prepared 
by Management for forecasting future 
profitability and cash flows.
Finance Transformation Programme
Management has developed and 
commenced implementation of the 
Group’s Finance Transformation 
programme. The new finance 
operating model relies on a 
new provider of finance function 
outsourcing and greater leveraging 
of centres of excellence using an 
outsourced finance model.
The Committee was briefed on the new finance 
operating model prior to implementation and has 
been updated on performance against the plan 
through the course of the year.
Through its oversight of the Finance Transaction 
programme the Committee considered the potential 
risks associated with the new finance operating model 
and challenged Management on the processes put in 
place to mitigate those risks.
The Committee concluded that the 
new finance operating model was 
appropriate and progress was in line 
with expectations.
The Committee were satisfied that 
Management has taken sufficient steps 
to mitigate the risks associated with the 
Finance Transformation programme.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98 Issue and Significance How the Committee addressed this Comments and Conclusion
Use of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
The Group’s performance measures 
continue to include some metrics 
which are not defined or specified 
under IFRS. In particular, following its 
introduction in 2015, Management 
continued to use Underlying Trading 
Profit, as a key measure to review 
current performance against the 
prior year by removing the impact 
of adjustments to OCPs, material 
charges and releases of other items 
identified during the 2014 Contract & 
Balance Sheet Review, together with 
other significant non-trading items.
The Committee considered whether the 
performance measures used by Management 
provided a meaningful insight into the results of  
the Company for its shareholders.
The Committee reviewed the treatment of items 
considered as being exceptional and requiring 
separate disclosure.
The Committee also reviewed the proposed 
disclosure of APMs in both the 2017 Half and Full 
Year results and the 2017 Annual Report ahead of 
their approval by the Board.
The Committee agreed with Management 
that Underlying Trading Profit continued to 
be a reasonable basis for the comparison of 
the performance of the business.
The Committee also continued to support 
the judgements made by Management 
regarding the items considered as being 
exceptional and requiring separate 
disclosure. The Committee concluded 
that, in relation to the Half and Full Year 
2017 results and the 2017 Annual Report, 
clear and meaningful descriptions had 
been provided for the APMs used. It 
was also concluded that the relationship 
between these measures and the statutory 
IFRS measures was clearly explained and 
supported the considered understanding  
of the financial statements.
The Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2018
During the year, Management 
performed an impact assessment 
of the two new accounting 
standards required to be adopted 
with effect from 1 January 2018. 
The new accounting standards 
are IFRS 9 regarding Financial 
instruments and IFRS 15 regarding 
Revenue from contracts with 
customers.
Neither accounting standard 
is expected by Management 
to fundamentally change the 
presentation of the Group’s 
previously published Financial 
Statements, but a detailed 
exercise was performed in order 
to arrive at this conclusion.
The Committee challenged the approach 
taken by Management and reviewed in detail 
with Management and the External Auditor 
the expected impact of the new accounting 
standards.
Due to the significance of IFRS 15 the Committee 
members took part in an IFRS 15 education 
session held with the External Auditors and 
senior members of the Group Finance team.
The Committee were satisfied with the 
approach taken by Management and with 
the results of the impact assessment.
The impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is 
disclosed within Note 2 of the Financial 
Statements.
Goodwill Impairment
A key area of judgement made 
by Management in recent years 
has been in the assessment of 
the holding value of goodwill. In 
2014, 2015 and 2016 Management 
proposed impairment charges 
and core to the assessment of the 
value of goodwill is Management’s 
estimate of future cash flows. 
This estimate is dependent on 
circumstances both within and 
outside of their control, and discount 
rates that are adjusted to reflect the 
risks specific to individual assets.  
No impairment of goodwill has  
been identified in 2017.
The methodology and the results of the 
impairment testing were presented to the 
Committee and were subject to scrutiny and 
review. The Committee placed particular focus on 
changes in discount rates applied and ensuring 
that the underlying cash flows are consistent with 
the Board-approved forecasts.
The Committee also reviewed the disclosures 
included in the financial statements to ensure that 
they provide an appropriate level of information 
to users.
The Committee were satisfied that the 
assumptions underlying the impairments 
made in the year were appropriate.
Following review of the disclosures in 
the financial statements, the Committee 
concluded that the disclosures were 
transparent, appropriate and in 
compliance with financial reporting 
requirements.

Issue and Significance How the Committee addressed this Comments and Conclusion
Defined Benefit Pension Schemes
The Group’s defined benefit pension 
scheme obligations are an area of 
Management focus, in particular 
regarding the identification of 
obligations arising from customer 
contracts and the calculation 
of financial impact of any such 
liabilities.
The Committee considered both the process 
undertaken by Management to finalise the 
assumptions for the main schemes, and how these 
assumptions benchmark against the market. 
Advice was taken from independent actuaries on 
the appropriateness of the assumptions used.
Following review, the Committee 
concluded that the process followed was 
appropriate and the resulting conclusions 
reached and calculations performed were 
appropriately balanced.
Viability Statement
During the course of 2017, the Committee, along with 
the Board, has received general guidance from the 
FRC on preparing annual reports for the 2017/2018 
reporting season, including suggestions regarding 
viability statements. The Committee has reviewed the 
2017 Viability Statement in light of these comments and 
have addressed more specifically the justification of the 
time period over which the statement is based and the 
sensitivity and scenario testing performed.
The Viability Statement is set out on page 30.
Independent assurance
The Group's Independent assurance structure is formed 
of Internal Audit and External Audit.
Internal Audit
Internal Audit acts as a "third line of defence" providing 
independent assurance to the Board, Audit Committee 
and management, and in particular:
• Provides objective, independent assurance and 
advice to management and the Audit Committee 
on the design and operating effectiveness of the 
governance and internal control processes in place to 
identify and manage business risks;
• Delivers an annual programme of risk-based internal 
audits, reporting findings and recommendations 
for management actions to improve governance, 
risk management and controls to each Audit 
Committee; and
• Reviews the annual Internal Audit programme 
regularly throughout the year to ensure it remains 
focused on key risks, recommending changes to the 
Audit Committee for their approval.
Internal Audit gives particular regard to the ongoing 
evaluation of the efficacy of the Group’s financial 
controls and reporting processes. Internal Audit is 
headed by the Group Head of Internal Audit who 
reports functionally to the Chair of the Audit Committee 
ensuring independence is maintained. Internal Audit 
work with a co-sourced partner, PwC, to supplement 
and enhance in-house skills and resources where 
required. During 2017, Internal Audit has delivered a 
full programme of audits making recommendations to 
management for improvements to risk, governance and 
controls. Reports have been discussed with the parts 
of business they relate to and management actions 
agreed have been tracked for progress. Key themes 
and management action progress have been included 
in regular written updates to the Audit Committee. 
Internal audits may focus on individual contracts, 
processes, functions or risk themes.
The 2018 Internal Audit programme will continue to 
focus on the key risks across the business including 
key risks around the Group's Finance Transformation 
programme as it progresses.
External Auditor
The Audit Committee manages the relationship with 
the Company’s External Auditor on behalf of the 
Board. As a result of an external competitive tender 
process, KPMG LLP were appointed by the Board as the 
Company’s external auditor for the 2016/2017 audit, the 
appointment being approved by shareholders at the 
2017 AGM, and have served as the Company’s auditor 
for one year. Since appointment, Stephen Wardell has 
served as audit engagement partner. In 2017, Stephen 
informed the Committee of his intention to retire from 
KPMG LLP and John Luke will replace him as the new 
audit partner in 2018. In accordance with the Audit 
Practices Board Ethical Standard 3, the Company 
will continue the practice of the rotation of the audit 
engagement partner at least every five years, and all 
other partners and senior management will be required 
to rotate at least every seven years.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 100 The Audit Committee keep the assessment of the 
need to tender the auditor under ongoing review 
and the Company confirms that it complied with the 
provisions of the Competition & Markets Authority’s 
2014 Order on mandatory use of competitive tender 
processes and Audit Committee responsibilities. 
The Committee evaluates the effectiveness of the 
external audit annually, using feedback obtained from 
management associated with audits undertaken in 
Group Finance and in the Divisions and by assessing 
the performance of the External Auditor against a 
range of criteria including calibre of the audit team, 
knowledge of the Group, and the quality of planning, 
review, testing, feedback and reporting. The feedback 
received was reviewed by management and reported 
to the Committee. After taking these reports into 
consideration, the Committee concluded that the 
auditor demonstrated appropriate qualifications and 
expertise and remained independent of the Company, 
and that the audit process was effective.
The Committee also reviewed External Auditor's 
engagement letter and determined the remuneration 
of the External Auditor in accordance with the authority 
given to it by shareholders. The Committee considered 
the External Auditor's remuneration to be appropriate.
It is proposed that KPMG LLP be re-appointed as 
External Auditor of the Company at the next AGM in 
May 2018 and, if so appointed, that they will hold office 
until the conclusion of the next general meeting of the 
Company at which accounts are laid. Further details are 
set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting which 
is available on our corporate website www.serco.com
The Independent Auditor’s report to shareholders is set 
out on pages 152 to 157.
Non-audit fees
The Committee believes that non-audit work may 
only be undertaken by the External Auditor in limited 
circumstances. The Committee monitors the non-audit 
fees. For the financial year ended 31 December 2017, 
the non-audit fees paid to KPMG LLP were £0.1m (2016: 
£1.3m, £0.5m of which arose prior to appointment). 
The majority of the fees related to either tax advisory, 
compliance services or other investigation-related 
matters. £36k of fees related to advisory services which 
had been engaged prior to KPMG LLP’s appointment 
as auditors. An analysis of fees paid in respect of 
audit and non-audit services provided by the external 
auditor for the past two years is disclosed on page 190. 
The Committee regularly reviews the nature of non-
audit work performed by the External Auditor and the 
volume of that work. Focus is given to ensuring that 
engagement for non-audit services does not (i) create a 
conflict of interest; (ii) place the auditor in a position to 
audit their own work; (iii) result in the auditor acting as a 
manager or employee; or (iv) put the auditor in the role 
of advocate for the Company.
Having undertaken a review of the non-audit services 
provided during the year, the Committee is satisfied 
that these services were provided efficiently by  
the External Auditor as a result of their existing 
knowledge of the business and did not prejudice  
their independence or objectivity.

Dear Shareholder
This year has been a busy year for the Corporate 
Responsibility Committee as we sought to align our 
Corporate Responsibility Framework (CRF) with the 
Group strategy and maintain engagement with the 
business to better understand some specific areas of 
safety and ethical risks.
During 2017, Serco’s CRF has been redefined to 
better reflect the Group’s strategy, what matters to 
us and the manner in which we conduct our business. 
The CRF defines our key corporate responsibility 
principles, reflects our inherent attitudes, guides our 
future behaviours and facilitates the measurement 
of our performance. The CRF is structured around 
Serco's key stakeholder groups and has at its core 
Our Values of Trust, Care, Innovation, and Pride 
which are central to everything we do. Agreeing 
the CRF is a significant step forward in providing 
clarity in regards to corporate responsibility and its 
alignment to corporate strategy and will be the focus 
of future activities of the Committee.
Alongside this, the Committee has engaged with 
and received detailed briefings from Divisional 
CEOs on specific areas around safety and ethical 
risks. This included: the challenges faced by the 
Justice & Immigration business in regard to physical 
assaults and a range of positive initiatives being 
implemented by the business; Saudi Railways 
operations (with safety of the first passenger trains 
being a priority); the Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
toolkit trial in the UK; and, employee engagement 
around our Values following refinements to the 
culture index in our employee engagement survey, 
Viewpoint. During 2018, the Committee will continue 
to engage the business in all of these areas.
Finally, the year also witnessed a change in the 
membership of the Committee with the appointment 
of Ian El-Mokadem and Kirsty Bashforth. I would like 
to thank Angie Risley, who stepped down when she 
left the Board, for her valued contribution over a 
number of years.

in which updates are provided to the Board following 
Committee meetings. 
2018 priorities and focus
During 2018, the Committee will continue to focus 
on the embedding of the refreshed Corporate

The Board is responsible to Serco’s 
shareholders for promoting the long-term 
success of the Company and the operation 
of effective governance arrangements. It 
oversees and agrees the Group’s strategy and 
ensures that necessary resources are available, 
and that the appropriate risk management 
controls, processes and culture are in place to

knowledge in particular areas. A number of 
the Non-Executive Directors also undertook 
a programme of individual contract visits and 
Divisional management meetings to support 
familiarity with the Group’s operations, and visit 
reports were shared with all Board members. 
B.5 Information and support
The Directors have full access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary and may 
obtain independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense if they believe it may be 
required in the furtherance of their duties. 
The Company Secretary is responsible to the 
Board on a number of issues and full details  
on the Company Secretary’s responsibilities  
are published on our corporate website  
www.serco.com. The appointment and removal 
of the Company Secretary is a matter for the 
Board as a whole. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the 
Company Secretary, ensures that all Board 
members receive timely, accurate and effective 
information.
B.6 Evaluation
In 2017, performance evaluations of the Board, 
its Committees and individual Directors were 
carried out internally. Further details of the 
evaluation can be found on page 92. 
Following the evaluation, the Directors 
concluded that the Board and its Committees 
operated effectively and that each Director 
contributes effectively and demonstrates 
commitment to their role.
External evaluation last took place in early 2015 
and it is the Board’s intention to carry out an 
externally facilitated evaluation in 2018. 
B.7 Election/Re-election 
Each Director is subject to election at the first 
AGM following their appointment, and re-
election at each subsequent AGM. Accordingly 
Lynne Peacock, Ian El-Mokadem and Kirsty 
Bashforth will stand for election at the 2018 
AGM. The Directors unanimously recommend 
the election/re-election of all Board members 
at the 2018 AGM. Full biographical details for all 
Directors can be found on pages 86 and 87.
For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company has complied fully with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code with the exception of provision B.6.2. A copy of the Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk
The notes below are intended to assist with the evaluation of the Group’s compliance during 2017 and 
forms part of the Corporate Governance Report as a whole.
B.1 Composition of the Board 
As at the date of this report, there are six Non-
Executive Directors, in addition to the Chairman 
and two Executive Directors on the Board. 
During the year as part of the Board’s internal 
evaluation process, the Board reviewed 
the overall balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of Board and 
Committee members and their diversity, 
including gender. 
The Board considers all of its Non-Executive 
Directors to be independent and free of any 
business relationships that could compromise 
the exercise of independent and objective 
judgement. In accordance with the Code, 
the Board undertakes an annual review of the 
independence of its Non-Executive Directors.
B.2 Appointments to the Board
Lynne Peacock and Ian El-Mokadem were 
appointed as Non-Executive Directors on 
1 July 2017. Kirsty Bashforth was appointed as 
a Non-Executive Director on 15 September 
2017. The appointment was led by the 
Nomination Committee, who recommended 
all three appointments to the Board. Further 
details regarding the appointment process 
are available in the report of the Nomination 
Committee on page 102.
B.3 Commitment
The time commitment of Non-Executive 
Directors is defined on appointment and 
regularly evaluated. The Board is satisfied 
that the current external commitments of its 
Chairman, Senior Independent and other Non-
Executive Directors do not conflict with their 
duties and time commitments as Directors of 
the Company. It is the Company’s policy to allow 
each Executive Director to accept one non-
executive directorship of another company.

Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholders
As the new Chair of the Remuneration Committee and 
on behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present my first 
Directors’ Remuneration Report for Serco Group plc 
for 2017. 
This report has been drafted in compliance with 
the disclosure requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the requirements of the UKLA 
Listing Rules. This report also complies with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. 
Context to the Committee’s decisions in the year
Since 2014 the business has been through a major 
transformation, with the setting of a new business 
strategy, a Rights Issue, disposal of several businesses, 
rationalisation of the portfolio and mitigation of loss 
making contracts. It is now a much stronger business, 
with a solid balance sheet and a restored reputation 
with customers. 
Our overall remuneration framework has a number of 
specific objectives. It is designed to focus on value 
creation and share ownership to align the high calibre 
executives who were appointed in 2014, with the 
completion of the transformation and the delivery of 
the outcomes committed to shareholders. There are 
multiple considerations in the design of the overall 
framework. First and foremost is to ensure long 
term shareholder value creation and the Group’s 
performance relative to sector peers. Second, is the 
balance of short-term and long-term incentives. Third, 
is the recognition of the Group performance and the 
individual’s specific contribution to this, as well as the 
level of reward available to employees in the wider 
Group. Fourth, is to consider the precise numerical 
results through the lenses of both what management 
have contributed to what has been achieved and to 
the way this has been done, specifically ensuring the 
individuals embody the Serco Values of Trust, Care, 
Innovation and Pride in the way they do business. 
Report on Directors’ remuneration
Remuneration linked to transformation for growth
Our revised remuneration policy aligns directors’ reward with business  
performance and delivery of our strategic priorities.
Summary of key decisions for 2017
• Confirmation of 2017 vesting of the 2014 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) elements which 
vested at nil as neither the EPS nor the relative TSR 
minimum performance requirements were met.
• Determination of vesting of Recruitment Awards 
granted to the CEO and CFO on joining Serco. The 
relative TSR elements did not vest as the minimum 
performance was not achieved. The Committee 
assessed each Director’s performance against their 
Strategic Objectives and determined that, in each 
case, that element of the award should vest in full.
• Assessment of performance for the 2017 Annual 
Bonus. It was determined that the CEO should 
receive a bonus of 75.0% of maximum, the CFO a 
bonus of 75.3% of maximum, and the COO a bonus 
of 73.8% of maximum.
• Assessment of performance for the 2015 Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP) and 2015 PSP Awards with 
performance periods ending in FY17 and vesting  
in 2018.
• Determination of awards granted in April 2017 under 
the PSP and DBP Matching Share Awards granted in 
May 2017.
• Determination of nil salary increase for the CEO and 
CFO in 2018.
• Completion of a further review of Directors’ 
Remuneration in conjunction with major shareholders.
• Determination of arrangements in connection with 
the cessation of employment of the COO from 
31 December 2017. It was agreed that a bonus for 
2017 would be paid on the normal date but that all 
unvested share awards would lapse in full.

In 2017 the Executive Team delivered a trading result in line with expectations, as well as over £3bn of order intake 
and a further improvement in employee engagement. The transformation of the business continues at pace and 
significant improvements have been delivered in efficiency and competitiveness. There was unanimous support 
for the decision to make awards to reflect the contribution that each member of the executive team has made to 
strengthening the business and position it for success.
Rationale for the 2018 remuneration policy requiring approval at the 2018 AGM
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders overwhelmingly 
supported the renewal of the current policy for a single 
year with a view to the Remuneration Committee 
undertaking a further review of policy during 2017.  
This allowed the new policy presented here to be 
aligned to the requirements of the third phase of 
our strategy implementation which begins in 2018. 
In undertaking the review the Committee took into 
consideration what was appropriate for the business 
as we move into the ‘enabling growth’ phase of 
the business transformation, as well as considering 
feedback from investors, best practice and market 
practice, and the key principles of good corporate 
governance. Our aim was to ensure remuneration 
remains aligned with our key corporate goals and 
shareholders’ expectations, and that it motivates 
and compensates senior management fairly for their 
contribution to the business.
As a result of the review, and following consultation with 
our major shareholders, the Committee has made a 
number of changes to the remuneration framework.
The removal of the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) Share 
Matching Plan and revisions to the suite of performance 
conditions for PSP awards will:
• more closely align executive remuneration with 
that for sector peers by significantly reducing the 
overall quantum for variable pay (from 500% to 375% 
maximum opportunity for the CEO, with a similar 
reduction for the CFO);
• deliver a reduction of 20% in total maximum pay 
opportunity for the CEO and 19% for the CFO; 
• strengthen alignment with the business strategy 
through the balance of short and long term reward 
and the choice of performance measures; and
• simplify our remuneration arrangements to one long-
term incentive plan.
This reduction in maximum earnings opportunity is being 
made against the context of the fourth consecutive year 
of no change to base pay for the CEO or CFO. With 
the COO role not being replaced and the additional 
responsibility being taken on at Executive Director level 
by the CEO and CFO, the overall result is a significant 
reduction in total cost of Executive Director pay. Serco is 
fortunate to have not only a high calibre Executive team 
but also one which understands the context in which we 
operate and therefore support the changes.  
PSP awards to be granted from 2018 onwards will 
maintain the emphasis on the achievement of financial 
metrics but permit up to 25% of the PSP to be linked 
to key non-financial, strategic, KPIs that are clearly 
aligned to our strategy and are crucial to the delivery of 
sustainable growth. These KPIs will represent core areas 
where achievement can be tested and evidence-based. 
For 2018, the first year of operation, the Committee 
has concluded that a weighting of 15% for strategic 
measures and 85% for financial measures is appropriate. 
A higher weighting of up to 25% may apply in future 
years of operation. 
The introduction of mandatory three year deferral into 
shares of all bonus earned above 100% of salary (with 
no matched opportunity) further reinforces the link 
between reward and sustained long-term performance. 
In line with the policy approved at the 2017 AGM, under 
the 2018 remuneration policy all elements of variable 
pay are subject to clawback provisions.

Concluding comments
On behalf of my colleagues on the Committee, we appreciate the input we have received from shareholders and 
representatives of institutional investors, whose comments have shaped the refresh of our Policy. The Committee 
believe that the recommended changes will ensure our arrangements are appropriate given the context in which 
Serco operates as a trusted partner of government; that our highly effective executive management team are 
rewarded for completing the transformation and are incentivised to move forward to restoring growth, margins  
and returns of the business.

Rationale for the 2018 remuneration policy requiring approval at the 2018 AGM continued
Finally, to ensure continued good governance of remuneration, we will introduce further “best practice” measures, 
including the reduction of maximum pension contributions to 20% of salary for new Executive Directors.
Much thought was given to the balance of focus on short and long term delivery which are equally important to 
the Group’s future success. A small increase in maximum opportunity under the short term incentive, combined 
with the introduction with mandatory deferral into shares for a further three years of any bonus earned over 100% 
of salary, strengthens the link between reward and achieving critical targets in the short term whilst maintaining a 
focus on longer term, sustainable, growth.

The simplified pay structure
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 112 The Remuneration Committee 
The role of the Committee is to determine and recommend to the Board a fair and responsible remuneration 
framework for ensuring that the executive management team are rewarded and incentivised appropriately for their 
contribution to Group performance. The Committee’s primary focus is to ensure a clear link between reward and 
performance. This means ensuring that the policy, structure and levels of remuneration for Executive Directors 
reinforce the strategic aims of the business and are appropriate given the market context in which Serco operates. 
The Committee’s composition, responsibilities and operation comply with the principles of good governance as set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, with the Listing Rules and with the Companies Act 2006. The Terms of 
Reference of the Committee, a copy of which can be found on the Group’s website at www.serco.com/about/the-
board-and-governance, are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain appropriate. The Committee conducted 
an annual assessment of its own performance in accordance with the annual effectiveness review of the Board. 
Following that review, the Committee concluded that it is fully effective in respect of its Executive and Chairman 
Remuneration duties with consideration being given as to how it may widen the scope to include a greater 
understanding of employee benefits and to further collate employee views around pay and benefits at Serco.
Members of the Committee and attendees
All members of the Committee are independent. Non-Executive Directors of the Group are initially appointed for a 
three-year term, and that appointment may be terminated on three months’ written notice.

Advisers to the Remuneration Committee

• advice on the review of the Remuneration Policy;
• support in reviewing the Directors' Remuneration Report;
• informing the Committee on market practice and governance issues; and
• assistance with general and technical reward queries.
The advisers attended each meeting of the Remuneration Committee. Consulting services have also been provided 
to the Group by PwC in relation to the 2017 Policy Review and pay and benefits data.
Fees paid to PwC as advisers to the Committee during the year totalled £69,100. Fees are charged on an hourly  
rate basis.

The Committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from PwC each year. It is 
satisfied that PwC is providing robust and professional advice. In the course of its deliberations, the Committee 
considers the views of the Chief Executive on the remuneration and performance of the other members of the 
Executive Committee.

over the performance period.
For 2018, the remaining 15% will be based on Strategic Objectives. Performance 
targets for the awards granted in 2018 will be based on improvements in order book 
and employee engagement, which are critical to delivering the business strategy over 
the next three years. For 2018, the first year of operation of strategic objectives within 
the PSP, the Committee has concluded that a weighting of 15% for strategic measures 
and 85% for financial measures is an appropriate balance.

Notes: 
1  The Committee deems the specific details of the performance measures and targets to be commercially sensitive as they are intrinsically linked to 
the forward-looking strategic plans of the business. Full disclosure will be provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which final 
performance is assessed provided these details are no longer considered sensitive.
2  The Committee sets the performance targets in respect of the PSP immediately prior to the grant of the award and therefore these are not yet determined. 
Details of the performance targets will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year in which the awards are made to the extent that they 
are not deemed commercially sensitive at that time. Full retrospective disclosure will be made of any details that are withheld once this information is no 
longer deemed commercially sensitive by the Committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
For approval at the 2018 Annual General Meeting
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy) will take legal effect from the conclusion of the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM.
As set out in the Chair’s Letter, as we move into the ‘enabling growth’ phase of the business transformation 
the Committee has undertaken a complete review of Directors’ remuneration with a view to ensuring that the 
Remuneration Policy is aligned to the strategic requirements of the business going forward. The Remuneration 
Policy review also sought to simplify the overall remuneration of Directors’ and to address concerns from some 
shareholders in connection with the long term incentive arrangements in particular. 
In the tables and narrative below, we have set out details of each element that may comprise the remuneration 
package of a Director, what the opportunity is under that element, and how each element supports the business 
and aligns the interests of the Directors‘ with the wider stakeholders, including shareholders, in the Company.
The approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy as approved at the 2017 AGM is displayed on the Company’s website, 
in the investor area.
The provisions in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy as approved at the AGM in 2017 that relate to the Deferred 
Bonus Plan will continue to apply to all awards made under this plan prior to the approval of the new Policy at the 
AGM in 2018.
Remuneration Policy
Serco’s Remuneration Policy supports the achievement of the Group’s long-term strategic objectives. Serco’s 
approach to executive remuneration is designed to:
• Support Serco’s long-term future growth, strategy and values;
• Align the financial interests of executives and shareholders;
• Provide market-competitive reward opportunities for performance in line with expectations and deliver 
significant financial rewards for sustained out-performance;
• Enable Serco to recruit and retain the best executives with the required skills and experience in all our  
chosen markets; and
• Be based on a clear rationale which participants, shareholders and other stakeholders are able to understand  
and support.
We approach Executive Directors’ remuneration on a total reward basis to provide the Remuneration Committee with 
a view of total remuneration rather than just the competitiveness of the individual elements. Analysis is conducted by 
looking at each of the different elements of remuneration (including salary, annual bonus, performance share plan and 
pension) in this context. This ensures that in applying the Remuneration Policy executive pay is sufficient to achieve 
the goals of the Remuneration Policy without paying more than is necessary. The balance of fixed to variable pay also 
ensures that significant reward is only delivered for exceptional performance. 
This remuneration framework is echoed throughout the organisation with the approach to pay for the wider 
workforce reflecting these core principles.
Remuneration Report continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 118 Features of the 2018 Remuneration Policy 
The remuneration package for Executive Directors continues to consist of base salary, annual bonus, a long-
term share-based incentive, pension and other benefits. The Group’s policy remains to ensure that a significant 
proportion of the package is related to performance, with the relevant performance measures aligned to the core 
requirements of the Group’s forward-looking strategy. As set out in the Chair’s Letter, changes have been made 
to ensure alignment with the Group’s strategy as we enter the enabling growth phase of the transformation; to 
address areas of concern and deviations to current accepted remuneration practice; and to ensure the new policy 
is fit for the future success of the business. A summary of the changes to the 2017 Policy (as approved at the 2017 
AGM) is set out below:
Element in 2017  
Executive Directors’ Policy Changes made for 2018
Base Salary No change but we have restated the purpose and operation of this element  
for clarity.
Benefits No change.
Annual Bonus Changes made to the maximum opportunity under this element and to introduce 
the compulsory deferral into shares of bonus earned over 100% of salary:
CEO – increased from 150% of salary to 175% 
CFO – increased from 130% of salary to 155% of salary
The performance framework has been restated for clarity.
Deferred Bonus Plan This element is no longer part of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors. 
This results in a reduction in the total variable pay opportunity of 125% of salary 
for the CEO (with a similar reduction for the CFO). The provisions of this element 
will continue to apply to Executive Directors‘ in respect of awards granted under 
this plan prior to approval of the 2018 Policy only (the last of which is anticipated 
to vest in May 2021).
Performance  
Share Plan
Formally rebalance the performance measures and introduction of Strategic 
Objectives to the suite of performance measures enabling a more holistic 
approach to ensuring reward is fully aligned to Company performance. Awards 
granted in 2018 will vest based on 85% equally weighted between TSR, EPS, 
ROIC and 15% on Strategic Objectives. The operation and other aspects of the 
performance framework have been restated for clarity.
Pension Reduction in the maximum opportunity for new Executive Directors' from a 
maximum of 30% of salary to 20% of salary) and clarification of the operation  
of this element.
Shareholding guideline No change.

For the avoidance of doubt it is intended that the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy will apply in its entirety to all 
payments made to Directors’ from the date of shareholder approval.
The following table sets out the proposed Executive Director Remuneration Policy to apply for three years following 
shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM. The 2018 Policy for Non-Executive Directors‘ can be found on page 128 and the 
table set out on page 124 provides further information of how pay policies are set for the broader employee population.
How the element supports 
our strategic objectives Operation Opportunity
Performance 
framework
Base Salary
To recognise an individual’s 
experience, responsibility 
and performance of the role, 
and by providing the basis for 
a competitive remuneration 
package; to help recruit 
and retain executives of the 
necessary calibre to execute 
Serco’s strategic objectives.
Pay levels are designed to attract and 
retain experienced, skilled executives 
reflecting the skills and role of  
the individual.
Base salaries are set by 
reference to: 
• the relevant experience and time in 
role of the individual;
• individual performance;
• compensation of similarly situated 
executives of companies in an 
appropriate peer group; and
• the wider economic environment.
In some circumstances an executive 
may start on a lower salary than would 
be competitive in the market, with a 
phased increase applying depending on 
performance in role and individual ability.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually 
and any changes are usually effective 
from 1 April. Salary reviews take account 
of the individual’s performance and 
contribution to the Company during  
the year.
Whilst there is no prescribed, 
formulaic maximum, over the 
policy period, base salaries for 
Executive Directors will be set 
at an appropriate level within 
the peer group and will normally 
increase at no more than the 
greater of inflation and salary 
increases made to the general 
workforce in the jurisdiction the 
Executive Director is based in.
Higher increases may be made 
in exceptional circumstances. 
Such cases would include 
where there has been a 
significant change in role size or 
complexity which has resulted 
in the salary falling below a 
market competitive level given 
the enhanced responsibilities of 
the role.
Review takes 
account of individual 
performance and 
contribution to the 
Company during 
the year.
Benefits
To provide a competitive  
level of benefits.
A range of benefits may be provided to 
Executive Directors. These include, but 
are not limited to, company car or car 
allowance, private medical insurance, 
permanent healthcare insurance, life 
cover, annual allowance for independent 
financial advice, and voluntary health 
checks every two years.
Relocation benefits will be provided 
in a manner that reflects individual 
circumstances and Serco’s relocation 
benefits policy. For example, relocation 
benefits could include temporary 
accommodation for the executive 
and dependents, education costs for 
dependents and tax equalisation.
Benefits are reviewed annually against 
market practice and are designed to be 
competitive.
The maximum opportunity for 
benefits is defined by the nature 
of the benefits and the cost of 
providing them. As the cost of 
providing such benefits varies 
based on market rates and 
other factors, there is no formal 
maximum monetary value.

Annual Bonus
Incentivise Executives 
to achieve specific, 
predetermined goals that 
are aligned to the business 
strategy during a one-year 
period. 
Compulsory deferral into 
shares increases alignment 
of the short term incentive 
with shareholders.
Reward ongoing stewardship 
and contribution to core 
values.
The Committee sets objectives 
and their weightings at the start 
of each performance year. The 
annual performance measures and 
objectives are determined with 
reference to the Group’s overall 
strategy and annual business plan 
and priorities for the year. At the 
end of the performance year the 
bonus result is determined by the 
Committee based on performance 
against the objectives and targets 
set.
Annual bonuses are paid after the 
end of the financial year to which they 
relate. There is compulsory deferral 
into shares vesting after three years 
of any bonus earned over 100% of 
salary. The Committee has discretion 
to permit a dividend equivalent to 
accrue during the vesting period. 
Dividend equivalents are delivered to 
participants in the form of additional 
shares or cash to the extent that the 
award vests.
Awards made to Executive Directors 
are subject to malus and clawback 
provisions. Further details are given 
below.
Maximum bonus 
opportunity is 175% 
of salary for CEO 
and 155% of salary 
for other Directors. 
This represents 
the maximum 
bonus payable for 
exceptional/“stretch” 
performance.
Performance is assessed annually. 
Both financial and non-financial 
measures are used, with a weighting 
of no less than 70% financial. 
Financial measures are based on 
the Company’s Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) for the year such as 
Trade Profit, Cash Flow and Revenue 
and take into consideration analyst 
consensus and the Company’s 
forecasts. Non-financial measures 
are based on personal performance 
against key strategic objectives for 
that year. 
Given the direct link of the 
performance measures and targets 
to the Group’s strategic plan, the 
details of these are deemed by the 
Committee to be commercially 
sensitive and therefore are not 
disclosed in advance to shareholders. 
However, the Committee commits 
to full retrospective disclosure of 
the performance measures, targets 
and achievement of those targets 
following the end of the performance 
period and to the extent that this 
information is no longer commercially 
sensitive in respect of the non-
financial strategic objectives.
Awards for on-target performance are 
50% of the maximum opportunity. At 
minimum (threshold) performance the 
award that may be received is 0% of 
the maximum opportunity.
All bonus payments are ultimately 
at the discretion of the Committee, 
taking into consideration the 
Director’s personal contribution 
to business performance over 
the relevant year and leadership 
behaviours demonstrated in making 
that contribution.
Performance conditions do not apply 
to the deferred element.

strategic objectives Operation Opportunity Performance framework
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Recognises achievement 
against the longer term 
objectives linked to 
the Group’s strategy 
and aligns incentives 
with shareholder value 
creation.
Awards under the PSP are 
usually made in the form 
of nominal cost options or 
conditional share awards, 
but may also take the 
form of nil-cost options or 
market value share options. 
Awards are normally 
granted on an annual basis. 
However, the Committee 
will consider awards under 
the PSP twice a year.
Awards will be subject to 
performance conditions.
Awards are typically 
settled in Ordinary Shares 
however, at the discretion 
of the Board awards may 
be converted to a cash 
equivalent based on the 
value of the shares at the 
vesting date (in cases 
where due to local law it 
is not possible to deliver 
shares), or subject to  
net settlement.
The Committee has 
discretion to permit a 
dividend equivalent 
to accrue during the 
vesting period. Dividend 
equivalents are delivered 
to participants in the form 
of additional shares or 
cash to the extent that the 
award vests.
Shares are subject to a 
two year post vesting 
holding period. During 
this time the shares must 
be retained but are not 
subject to forfeiture 
provisions. Shares may 
be sold in order to satisfy 
tax or other liabilities as a 
result of the vesting of the 
award. 
Awards made to Executive 
Directors are subject 
to malus and clawback 
provisions. Further details 
are given below.
Maximum 
annual award 
of up to 200% 
of base salary 
for the CEO 
and 175% 
for other 
Directors.
Performance measures and weightings will be set by the 
Committee at the start of the three year performance period 
on the basis of the Group’s strategic plan. At least 75% of 
the vesting of the LTIP is dependent on two or more financial 
performance conditions chosen from:
• EPS
• TSR
• ROIC
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to introduce 
additional financial measures aligned to the Group’s strategy.
In addition, up to 25% of the LTIP vesting maybe based on 
the achievement of strategic measures. The Remuneration 
Committee has discretion to restrict the vesting against the 
non-financial element if, on assessment of the Company’s 
performance as a whole including the financial performance, the 
formulaic outcome of the non-financial measures is not reflective 
of this.
• EPS for these purposes is EPS before exceptionals and is an 
important measure of shareholder value which can also be 
influenced by executive decision-making. EPS targets are set 
in reference to analyst forecasts and Group business plans. 
The Committee takes care to ensure that specific EPS targets 
are suitably stretching.
• Relative TSR reflects our performance relative to other 
companies in which investors could choose to invest. Relative 
TSR performance is measured against the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 as at the date of grant. As Serco is a constituent 
of the FTSE 250 it is felt that comparisons to the TSR 
performance of other companies in this index provides a 
good measure of the relative performance of Serco.
• Maintaining an attractive return on capital is core to our 
business strategy therefore ROIC is included in the suite of 
financial measures for the PSP . Pre-tax ROIC targets are set in 
reference to analyst forecasts for cash flow and trade profit, 
and Group business plans, and are inclusive of joint ventures 
to more closely align management with shareholders.
• Strategic Objectives must be measurable and capable of 
objective assessment. Strategic Objectives will be aligned to 
the achievement of key milestones in the implementation of 
the Group’s strategy. The specific Strategic Objectives will be 
disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration following 
the grant of an award but, due to the direct link of the 
performance measures and targets to the Group’s strategic 
plan, the details of these are deemed by the Committee to 
be commercially sensitive and therefore are not disclosed in 
advance to shareholders. However, the Committee commits 
to full retrospective disclosure of the performance measures, 
targets and achievement of those targets following the end 
of the relevant performance period and to the extent that 
this information is no longer commercially sensitive.
25% of the award vests for threshold performance rising on a 
straight-line basis to full vesting for maximum performance. 
The Committee (with input from the Audit and Group Risk 
Committees as appropriate) considers Serco’s underlying 
performance and external market reference points as well as 
performance against the specific targets set in determining the 
overall outcome of the PSP .

Shareholding Guideline
To support long-term 
commitment to the 
Company and the alignment 
of employee interests with 
those of shareholders.
The Committee reviews the shareholding 
guideline with the Policy review to ensure 
the guidelines remain in line with market  
and best practice.
Unvested awards that are subject to 
performance conditions are not taken 
into account in determining an Executive 
Director’s shareholding for these purposes. 
Share price is measured as at end of the 
relevant financial year. 
Executives are required to retain in shares 
50% of the net value of any performance 
shares vesting or options exercised until  
they satisfy the shareholding guideline.
The shareholding guidelines are 
200% of salary for the CEO, and 
150% of salary for other Executive 
Directors.
The Committee has the discretion to 
increase the shareholding guideline 
of the Executive Directors.
None
Malus and clawback
Malus and clawback provisions apply to awards under the annual bonus and PSP. Under the Policy, the Committee, 
at its discretion, may reduce or cancel (malus) or recover some or all of awards granted to Executive Directors in 
certain circumstances. Under the malus provisions the Committee may reduce or prevent vesting of an unvested 
Deferred Bonus or PSP award in circumstances including but not limited to: material misstatement of the Group’s 
audited financial results; material or misleading results announcement prior to vesting; or a clear and material 
contravention of the Company’s ethics and values on the part of the participant or a team member, team, business 
area or profit centre for which the participant is responsible. 
In the most serious of these circumstances the Committee may also invoke the clawback provisions against vested 
awards under the PSP and annual bonus. The clawback must be implemented within five years of the grant of the 
relevant PSP award, and within two years in respect of bonus awards paid in cash, and five years from the grant date 
for the portion of the bonus delivered in shares.
Use of discretion
The Committee will operate the annual bonus plan and PSP according to their respective rules, as approved  
by shareholders, and in accordance with the Listing Rules, where applicable. The Committee retains discretion, 
consistent with market practice, in a number of areas with regard to the operation and administration of  
these plans.
Directors’ Report
123
Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Use of discretion continued
These include, but are not limited to:
• the participants;
• the timing of grant of an award;
• the vehicle of an award;
• the size of an award;
• the determination of vesting or bonus payment;
• discretion required when dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the Group;
• determination of the treatment of leavers based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment chosen;
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate restructuring events and special 
dividends); and
• the annual review of performance measures and weighting, and determining the performance measures for the 
awards granted from year to year.
In relation to the PSP and annual bonus plan, the Committee retains the ability, in exceptional circumstances, to 
change performance measures, targets and/or the relative weighting of performance measures part-way through 
a performance period if there is a significant event (such as a major transaction or, in the case of the bonus only, 
a transition in role) which causes the Committee to believe the original performance conditions are no longer 
appropriate. In exercising this discretion the Committee will determine that the original conditions are no longer 
appropriate and the amendment is required so that the conditions achieve their original purpose and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy. Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee also has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest, to 
ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriate and reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Remuneration Policy described here applies specifically to Executive Directors of the Group. The Committee 
believes that the structure of management reward at Serco should be linked to Serco’s strategy and performance. 
The table below explains how this philosophy has been cascaded below Executive Directors to achieve alignment 
with the remuneration strategy across the organisation.
Element Difference in Remuneration Policy for other employees
Base salary • The same principles and considerations that are applied to Executive 
Directors are, as far as possible, applied to all employees.
Benefits • Serco has provisions for market-aligned benefits for all employees.
Pension • The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes and defined 
contribution schemes. Individuals who exceed certain pension tax  
allowances may be offered cash allowances in lieu of pension benefits.
Annual bonus • Approximately 1,300 employees, including members of the Global 
Leadership Team, are eligible for a bonus award under Serco Bonus Plan.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) • Annual awards under the PSP are made to approximately 370 employees  
in the Global Leadership Team.
Although the Committee does not consult directly with employees on the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the 
Committee does consider the general base salary increase, remuneration arrangements and employment conditions 
for the broader employee population when determining the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors.
Remuneration Report continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 124 Consideration of shareholder views
As set out in the Chair’s letter, we have consulted with our largest shareholders and received support and 
helpful comments which have been taken into consideration in shaping the future policy presented to you here. 
The Committee believe it is important to continue to maintain effective channels of communication with our 
shareholders. The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and these views have been influential 
in shaping our policy and practice. 
Approach to recruitment remuneration
Our overarching remuneration principles continue to apply in recruiting new hires or promotions to the Board – that 
is that we seek to offer a package that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate while aiming to pay no more than 
is necessary. We take into account that, as a global business, Serco operates in diverse markets and geographies 
and many of its competitors for talent are outside the UK. 
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee aligns the remuneration package on recruitment with the 
above Remuneration Policy incorporating all elements as set out above.
Base salary is set by the Committee taking into account all factors it considers relevant, including the Executive’s 
experience and calibre, current total remuneration, levels of remuneration for companies in the Committee’s 
chosen peer group, and the remuneration required to attract the best candidate for Serco. The Committee will 
seek to ensure that the arrangement is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without paying 
more than is necessary. New promotes or recruits to the Board may on occasion have their salaries set below the 
targeted policy level while they become established in their role. In such cases, salary increases may be higher than 
inflation or the general UK workforce increase until the targeted market positioning is achieved. 
The recruitment policy also includes the additional provision of benefits in kind, pensions and other allowances, 
such as relocation, education and tax equalisation in line with Serco policies as may be required in order to achieve 
a successful recruitment. The policy for recruitment also includes benefits that are either not significant in value or 
are required by legislation. Any new Executive Director would be offered either a pension contribution and/or a 
pension allowance equal to up to 20% of base salary.
As summarised below, the Remuneration Policy provides for a maximum combined total incentive under bonus and 
PSP of 375% of salary in any one year. 
Element of remuneration Maximum percentage of salary
Maximum variable pay: 375%
Normally comprising:
• Annual bonus
• PSP
175%
200%
Note: 
1 Maximum percentage of salary for annual bonus and PSP excludes compensation for awards forfeited.
This is the maximum level of incentives excluding any to compensate for entitlements forfeited that will apply 
to new recruits. Different performance conditions may apply for new recruits from those set out in the Policy, 
depending on the particular circumstances at the time (which could, for example, include the appointment of an 
interim Executive Director).
Where it is necessary to compensate a candidate for entitlements and/or unvested long term incentive awards from 
an existing employer that are forfeited, the Committee will seek to match the quantum, structure and timeframe 
of the award with that of the awards forfeited. In determining the form and quantum of replacement awards, the 
Committee will consider whether existing awards are still subject to performance requirements, and the extent to 
which those are likely to be met, with the aim of providing an opportunity of broadly equivalent value. The principle  
will be to seek to replace awards that remain significantly at risk for performance at the candidate’s current 
employer with awards subject to performance at Serco, and to seek to make any other replacement awards in 
the form of Serco shares, subject to appropriate vesting or holding requirements. Any compensation for awards 
forfeited is not taken into account in determining the maximum incentive award level.
Directors’ Report

Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Approach to recruitment remuneration continued
Where a new Executive Director is an internal promotion, the Committee has discretion to allow the new Executive 
Director to continue to benefit from existing awards granted, or benefit entitlements (such as pension), that were in 
place prior to appointment to the Board.
The policy on the recruitment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the same remuneration elements as for 
the existing Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee will include in future Annual Reports on Remuneration details of the implementation of the 
recruitment policy in respect of any such recruitment to the Board.
Service contracts and loss of office payments
The policy for service contracts for new Directors is shown in the table below. Under this policy the Committee may 
at any time, with the agreement of a Director, alter aspects of their existing contracts so that they are in line with 
the policy for new Directors. 
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office. Service contracts outline the 
components of remuneration paid to the individual but do not prescribe how remuneration levels may be 
adjusted from year to year. 
The date of appointment for each Director is shown in the table on page 129.
Provision for  
Executive Directors Detailed terms
Notice period • 12 months’ notice from the Company
• 12 months’ notice from the Director
Termination payment • Payment in lieu of notice comprising:
 – Base salary
 – Pension allowance
 – Selected benefits
• All of the above would be paid in instalments in accordance with the Director’s 
contractual payment schedule, subject to an obligation on the part of the 
Director to mitigate his loss. Payments will either reduce or cease completely,  
in the event that the Director gains new employment/remuneration. 
• In the event of a compromise or severance agreement, the Committee may 
make payments it considers reasonable in settlement of potential legal claims. 
It may include in such payments reasonable reimbursement of professional fees 
incurred by the Director in connection with such agreements and reasonable 
payments in respect of restrictive undertakings.
• The Committee may agree that if a Director steps down from the Board then 
for a transitional period, notice (including payment in lieu of notice) would 
continue to be based on the equivalent of up to twelve months’ based on their 
rate of salary and benefits while a Director, payable in instalments and subject 
to mitigation.
• The reimbursement of repatriation costs or fees for professional or outplacement 
advice may also be included in the termination package, as deemed reasonable 
by the Committee.

Treatment of annual  
bonus on termination
• No payment unless employed on date of payment of bonus except for ‘good 
leavers’: defined as death, disability, redundancy and other circumstances at  
the Committee’s discretion.
• ‘Good leavers’ are entitled to a bonus pro-rated to the period of service during 
the year, subject to the outcome of the performance metrics and paid at the 
usual time unless in exceptional circumstances (e.g. in the case of death of the 
Executive) when the Committee determines to make the payment early.
• The Committee has discretion to reduce the entitlement of a ‘good leaver’  
in line with performance and the circumstances of the termination.
• For new Executive Directors unvested deferred bonus share awards will lapse on 
cessation of employment except for ‘good leavers’. ‘Bad leaver’ provisions will not 
apply to the existing Executive Directors in respect of unvested deferred bonus 
share awards on cessation of employment except in the event of termination 
relating to misstatement of results, misconduct or poor performance.
Treatment of unvested 
awards granted under  
the PSP
1
• All awards lapse except for ‘good leavers’: ill-health, injury or disability, death, 
redundancy, retirement, change of control (as defined in the plan rules) and other 
circumstances at the Committee’s discretion (to the extent that they allow ‘good 
leaver’ treatment for particular awards).
• For ‘good leavers’ vesting is pro-rated on a time basis and is dependent on 
the achieved performance over the performance period. Awards vest on the 
normal vesting date except in the case of the death of the participant when the 
Committee may accelerated the vesting to the date of death.
• The Committee has the discretion to vary the level of vesting to reflect the 
individual performance, and may, depending on the circumstances of the 
departure, allow some awards to vest while lapsing others.
Change of control • Where the Director leaves the Company following a change of control, whether  
or not he is dismissed or he elects to leave on notice, he will be entitled to receive 
a payment equivalent to up to one year’s remuneration.
• Bonuses may be paid on a pro-rata basis measured on performance up to the  
date of change of control.
• Unvested PSP awards and unvested share awards in respect of deferred annual 
bonus vest pro-rata for time and performance up to the date of change of control. 
For existing Executive Directors the unvested share awards in respect of deferred 
annual bonus will vest without time pro-rating.
Exercise of discretion • Intended only to be used to prevent an outcome that is not consistent with 
performance. The Committee’s determination will take into account the particular 
circumstances of the Executive Director’s departure and the recent performance 
of the Company.
Notes:
1  Whilst unvested awards will normally lapse, the Committee may in its absolute discretion allow for awards to continue until the normal vesting date and be 
satisfied, subject to achievement of the performance conditions. In such circumstances, awards vesting will normally be prorated on a time apportioned 
basis, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
  Any such discretion in respect of leavers would only be applied by the Committee to ‘good leavers’ where it considers that continued participation is 
justified, for example, by reference to past performance to the date of leaving, or by the requirement to achieve an orderly transition. The clawback 
provisions would continue to apply in the event that such discretion were exercised.

Notes:
1  The value of the UK taxable benefits relate to the provision of independent financial advice, provision of a car or car allowance (fully inclusive of all scheme 
costs including insurance and maintenance), health care, private medical assessments and expatriate benefits. Ed Casey’s 2017 benefits relate primarily to 
his expatriate status, including costs of £87,489 for accommodation while in the UK. Where Serco settles the PAYE and NIC liability in respect of benefits 
provided, the value of the benefit has been grossed up at the individual’s marginal tax rate. 
2  The pension amount includes payments made in lieu of pension, calculated as a percentage of base salary, from which the Executive Directors make their 
own pension arrangements. Ed Casey's value includes the Serco contribution to his 401K plan.
3  Performance bonuses earned in the period under review, but not paid until the following financial year. During the year Rupert Soames and Angus Cockburn 
participated in the DBP by deferring 50%, and Ed Casey by deferring 35.6%, of their 2016 bonuses via the purchase of Investment Shares.  
Any deferral by Rupert and Angus of their 2017 bonuses, payable in 2018, will take place during 2018 and be reported in the 2018 DRR.
4  This is the estimated or actual value of Long-Term Incentives for which the performance period ended in the year. Also included is the gain on vesting of 
Recruitment Awards vesting in 2017 for Rupert Soames and Angus Cockburn for which there were no performance conditions but which were not included 
in the single figure value for the year of grant. These awards were granted in compensation for non-performance based awards forfeited by Rupert and 
Angus on joining Serco, therefore no performance conditions applied to the vesting of these awards. The 2014 PSP Award, and the performance related 
Recruitment Awards granted to Rupert and Angus, that were subject to TSR performance (for which the performance period ended 22 February 2017) did 
not meet the minimum criteria and therefore these awards lapsed in full. Further details are provided on page 134.
5  Ed Casey's remuneration is paid in US dollars and has been converted into GBP using the average exchange rate over the relevant financial year. For the 
purpose of the 2017 single figure USD 1 = GBP 0.77601. For the purpose of the 2016 single figure USD 1 = GBP 0.72672. The increase in the GBP value of 
Ed Casey’s base salary and pension is due to the exchange rate difference between 2016 and 2017. His 2017 base salary and pension cash alternative were 
unchanged from 2016 (salary USD 1,061,690 and cash alternative of USD 306,306), with a small reduction in his employer 401K contribution to USD 7,103 in 
2017 (USD 7,950 in 2016). His 2017 bonus is USD 1,175,609 (USD 1,274,824 in 2016).
The annual base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2017 were:

Variable pay outcomes (audited information) 
Performance-related annual bonus
For 2017, the Executive Director bonus was based on achieving a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which 
were weighted 70:30 respectively. The financial measures were based on Trading Profit (40%), Free Cash Flow (40%) 
and Revenue (20%) and the non-financial measures were individually set and based on key strategic goals. Payments 
under the 2017 annual bonus were subject to an Underlying Trading Profit underpin (after adjustment for in-year 
Onerous Contract Provisions (OCP) items) of £60.4m at constant currency rates.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the achievements against the targets for the year and the proposed annual 
incentive payments for the Executive Directors. The tables below show the achievement against the financial and 
non-financial measures.

For FY17, the Serco Bonus Plan in which Executive Directors participate was focused on three core measures 
which comprised 70% of the overall opportunity: Group Revenue, Group Trading Profit and Group Free Cash 
Flow. The remaining 30% of the opportunity is based on role-specific objectives related to the delivery of the 
business transformation. 
Financial performance has been strong; on both Trading Profit and Free Cash Flow the achievements of the 
business over the year were in excess of the stretching targets set by the Committee at the beginning of the year 
and therefore these components have paid out at 94% and 100% of maximum respectively. The level of Revenue 
achieved over the period was below threshold and as such none of this component of the bonus was awarded. 
The financial bonus outcomes have been calculated after appropriate adjustments, which were agreed at the 
beginning of the year as part of the target-setting process and in line with the approach disclosed in respect of 
2016. The Committee has once again spent considerable time reviewing the Trading Profit calculation for bonus 
purposes, initially working with management to determine a robust approach to decision-making, informed by 
a review of each individual contract and with cross-referencing to information shared with the Audit Committee. 
The Company’s external auditors verified the extraction of figures appearing in the accounts and those tabled for 
bonus purposes, followed by a formal sign-off by the Audit Committee on the numbers used to determine bonus 
payments prior to decisions being made by the Committee. As a result of the rigour applied to this process, the 
Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus out-turn fairly reflects management performance in the year. 
Trading Profit of £54.0m is adjusted by the Committee to arrive at a figure for Trading Profit for bonus purposes; 
shareholders were consulted on the principles behind these adjustments in early 2015, and the bonus outcome for 
both 2015 and 2016 reflected these principles, the purpose of which is to ensure that management are measured 
against their in-year performance and are not given credit for gains for which they have not materially influenced. 
The Committee has applied 2017 in a consistent manner the principles established in 2015 and 2016. 
Directors’ Report
131
Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Variable pay outcomes (audited information) continued
The first adjustment is to put Trading Profit into constant currency, so that it is consistent with the targets set 
at the beginning of the year; this is a £6.8m reduction. The Committee then considers items to properly reflect 
management effort and in-year operational performance. The Committee has concluded that a total of £23.6m 
should be added to Trading Profit in constant currency to arrive at a calculation of Trading Profit for bonus purposes 
in 2017; this compares with the £20.9m which was subtracted from Trading Profit in 2016. The main difference 
between the two years is that in 2016 there was an £11.8m net credit to Trading Profit related to Onerous Contract 
Provisions charges and releases which were excluded from Trading Profit for bonus purposes, whilst in 2017 there 
was a debit of £19.5m similarly excluded.
For the purposes of comparison the table below sets out the adjustments made by the Committee between 
Trading Profit and Trading Profit for bonus purposes in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

Non-Financial Performance
Rupert Soames
Rupert’s objectives included:
• Improving Business 
Development performance  
to rebuild the pipeline, with 
focus on both new business 
wins and total wins including 
re-competes and extensions. 
• Supporting Divisions in 
dealing with commercial 
issues and managing key 
relationships. 
• Supporting the Chairman to 
ensure the effective working 
of the Board.
The Committee deemed performance to be very strong. Rupert has continued to 
show highly effective and visible leadership throughout 2017 and over the course 
of the last 12 months has delivered significant further progress in implementing 
the strategy and transformation. The Group signed contracts with a total value 
of £3.4bn during the year delivering a strong performance with the largest order 
intake since 2012. Over 30 contract awards were worth more than £10m each 
and the large value of the new business won resulted in this being approximately 
70% of the total value signed, with the balance represented by secured 
extensions or re-bids of existing work. The Committee continue to monitor the 
successful embedding of values through the annual employee engagement 
survey “Viewpoint” which has shown the fourth successive year of improvement; 
engagement is a key determinant of the future success of the business. The 
Chairman regards the support Rupert has provided to him in ensuring the 
effective operation of the Board to continue to be first class. Based on Rupert’s 
achievement the Committee has awarded an above target but below maximum 
performance for the non-financial element relating to these objectives.
Remuneration Report continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 132 Angus Cockburn 
Angus’s objectives included:
• Improving Business 
Development performance 
to rebuild the pipeline, with 
focus on both new business 
wins and total wins including 
re-competes and extensions. 
• The development of a new 
Finance Operating Model.
• Improving the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the finance 
function through the Global 
Finance Transformation with 
a number of key milestones 
agreed at the start of the 
year which built on progress 
made in the previous year. 
The Committee deemed Angus’s performance to be very strong against all 
objectives. With profits at top end of expectations we set out some 15 months 
ago, net debt lower than we expected, fully funded pension schemes, and 
strong order intake, Angus made a critical contribution to delivering a solid 
performance in 2017 in a difficult market. Contract and Balance Sheet Onerous 
Contract Provision liability now stands at £168m, down from £220m in 2016 and 
£447m in 2014. Significant work has been undertaken to stress-test the Group’s 
financial plan against key sensitivities within the Group’s principal risks. The 
Global Finance Transformation has gathered pace and significant improvements 
have been made against the key milestones agreed at the start of the year.  
In terms of the Transformation Plan, operating costs reduced in proportion to 
the scale of revenue reduction; further shared services and overhead savings 
of around £20m were achieved, taking total overhead savings over the last three 
years to over £100m. Based on Angus’s achievement the Committee has awarded 
an above target but below maximum performance for the non-financial element 
relating to these objectives. 
Ed Casey
Ed’s objectives focused on: 
• Improving Business 
Development performance 
to rebuild the pipeline, with 
focus on both new business 
wins and total wins including 
re-competes and extensions. 
• Continue to refine and 
embed Risk Management 
process and work to embed 
as part of our operational 
approach to running the 
business. 
• Continue to strengthen 
“zero harm” HS&E culture 
and implement necessary 
changes to effect change. 
Deliver consistent measures 
across the Group, and 
achieve targeted reduction 
in accident rates.
The Committee deemed Ed’s performance to be very strong. Ed made a 
significant positive impact on the development of the pipeline with £3bn of 
pipeline opportunities added over the course of 2017. The acquisition of BTP 
Systems was completed for USD 20m, bringing deep skills in defence satellite 
communication and radar engineering technical services, together with a 
pipeline of USD 200m. Significantly improved risk management processes 
and consistently improved reporting to the Group Risk Committee. In 2017 
the policies relating to safe and healthy operations were reviewed and 
strengthened Group Standards with definitions of safety critical risks. Ed 
continued to build our health and safety focus across the Group; examples 
include in the UK, several Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Gold 
Awards won in 2017, including at RAF Fylingdales and Forth Valley Royal 
Hospital. Continuous improvement has been driven in health and safety 
across our businesses, including new tools and training in Serco Americas 
to reduce risks and improve safety management in air traffic control and 
naval engineering, and new tools in Serco AsPac to improve roadside welfare 
safeguards for our road safety camera operators. Based on Ed’s achievement 
the Committee has awarded an above target but below maximum 
performance for the non-financial element relating to these objectives.
Note:
1  Rupert Soames and Angus Cockburn are entitled to participate in the Deferred Bonus Plan (the DBP) in 2018, up to a maximum of 50% of the bonus 
determined in respect of 2017 performance. Ed Casey is unable to participate following the cessation of his employment on 31 December 2017.

performance periods ending in the relevant year which were granted in 2014 to Rupert Soames and Angus 
Cockburn in respect of unvested performance awards forfeited on joining Serco. These elements of the 
Recruitment Awards were (i) subject to relative TSR performance in the period to the announcement of the 
Company’s 2016 results on 22 February 2017 (40% of the award), and (ii) Strategic Objective performance (20% of 
the award) in the period ending 27 June 2017 (in respect of Rupert’s award) and 31 October 2017 (in respect of 
Angus’s award). The remaining 40% of these awards is subject to an Absolute Share Price performance condition for 
which the performance period will end in 2018.
For the TSR element, 25% of the award would vest for median ranking compared to the comparator group rising on 
a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile or better ranking when compared to the comparator group. 
The comparator group for the TSR performance was the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts. 
The relative TSR performance assessed was below median and therefore this element lapsed in full.
The Remuneration Committee made the following assessment of performance against the Strategic Objectives and 
determined that in both cases the award should vest in full.
Executive Director Strategic Objectives set Assessment of performance
Rupert Soames Rupert’s objectives focused on:
• Improving cash conversion; 
• Implementing transparent KPI 
reporting;
• Development of strong 
management talent within the 
finance function; and
• Improving operating margin.
• Significant progress has been made in improving cash 
conversion and minimising net debt. 
• Rupert has ensured that the Company now has a 
comprehensive management accounts pack and has 
been instrumental in introducing standardised and 
transparent Divisional reports.
• The Finance function has been transformed with the 
recruitment of Angus Cockburn, whom Rupert has 
supported in the recruitment of additional core talent 
into this team.
• Since the year of grant (2014) there has been a  
significant improvement in operating margin.
Based on Rupert’s achievement the Committee determined 
that 100% of this award should vest.
Angus Cockburn Angus’s objectives focused on:
• Implementing the Company’s 
corporate plan;
• Rebuilding the Senior 
Management Team;
• Improving cash conversion; and
• Improving operating margin.
• Angus has been central to the development and 
implementation of our corporate plan, and most 
specifically around the Rights Issue, the assessment of 
the write-downs and provisions in November 2014, and 
the subsequent implementation of an effective reporting 
process.
• Angus has completely overhauled the Finance Team, 
including the recruitment of a number of high-class 
individuals, transforming it into an effective global team.
• Since the year of grant (2014) there has been a significant 
improvement in operating margin.
Based on Angus’s achievement the Committee determined 
that 100% of this award should vest.

Performance graph and table
This graph shows the value as at 31 December 2017, of a £100 investment in Serco on 31 December 2008 compared 
with £100 invested in the FTSE250 index on the same date. It has been assumed that all dividends paid have been 
reinvested. The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-
day period up to and including that date. The Company chose the FTSE250 index as the comparator for this graph 
as Serco has been a constituent of that index throughout the period.

Percentage change in CEO’s remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in the salary, benefits and bonus of the CEO compared to that for 
the average UK employee. The UK employee sub-set of the Company’s global employee population has been 
chosen as the group which provides the most appropriate comparator; this comprises some 21,000 of the 42,700 
employees Serco employs worldwide. Inflation and local pay practices form a key driver in the salary and benefits 
provided in each location, and as the CEO is based in the UK we have chosen employees within the same country.

Notes:
1  This represents the average pay increase for all UK employees that was applied in the 2017 annual pay review cycle.
2  The nature of benefits provided to the CEO and to employees in 2017 compared to 2016 remains the same. The percentage change represents a reduction in 
the cost to the Company of the benefits over the period. The increase in the CEO’s taxable benefit value (with the increase equivalent to 1% of salary) relates 
to taxable travel which was provided in line with the approved Remuneration Policy. 
3  The bonus element is shown for those employees eligible for such payments. The figures shown here relate to a calculation of the bonus earned, but not yet 
paid, related to performance in 2017 compared to the 2016 bonuses paid in April 2017. The reduction in the average employee bonus is due to the different 
performance outcomes at Divisional and Business Unit levels compared to 2016 which impacts the bonuses for the comparator population.

Pensions (audited information)
As at 31 December 2017, there were no Executive Directors actively participating in or accruing additional 
entitlement in the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a defined benefits scheme.
Payments for loss of office (audited information)
The Committee determined that Ed Casey would not receive any additional payments on the termination of his 
employment. In recognition of his contribution to the Company throughout the whole performance year the 
Committee determined that he would remain entitled to receive his 2017 Annual Bonus as disclosed in the single 
figure table and accompanying notes, which will be paid in March 2018. All unvested share awards lapsed in full on 
cessation of employment. In line with his expatriate arrangement Ed will receive UK and US tax return assistance for 
the final year of his assignment. No further payments will be made.
Payments to Past Directors (audited information)
No payments were made in the year to past Directors.

Awards made in 2017
Performance Share Plan (PSP) (audited information)
In 2017 the Executive Directors received awards equivalent to 200% of salary for the CEO and COO and 175% of 
salary for the CFO.
The awards will vest at the end of the performance period, if the Executive Directors are still in employment 
with Serco and to the extent that the performance conditions have been met as measured over the three year 
performance period ending 31 December 2019. 
Performance Measure Weighting of Measure Performance Target
Aggregate EPS 1/3rd Statutory Earnings Per Share (EPS) before exceptional items (adjusted 
to reflect tax paid on a cash basis) of 13.5p (threshold, 25% vesting) to 
16.5p (maximum, 100% vesting), measured as an aggregate over the 
three-year performance period.
Relative TSR 1/3rd Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of median (threshold, 25% vesting) 
to upper quartile (maximum, 100% vesting) when ranked relative to 
companies in the FTSE250 (excluding investment trusts), measured 
over the three year performance period.
Average ROIC 1/3rd Pre-tax Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 8.4% (threshold, 25% 
vesting) to 10.2% (maximum, 100% vesting), measured as an average 
over the three-year performance period.
The structure for vesting is the same for all measures, with straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum, 
and no shares vest where performance is below threshold.
Each element of the PSP award is subject to a post-vesting holding requirement that takes the total term of the 
award (ie performance period plus holding period) to a minimum of five years. Pre-vesting malus and post-vesting 
clawback is also applicable to these awards.

The table below summarises the Matching Share Awards granted to Executive Directors’ in 2017 in relation to their 
participation in the DBP.
Executive Directors received a Matching Share Award (in the form of a conditional share award) on a 2:1 basis in 
respect of their gross bonus deferred (i.e. for every one Investment Share that could have been purchased from 
the gross bonus deferred, two Matching Shares are granted). Matching Share Awards granted in 2017 vest subject 
to Aggregate EPS over the three year performance period ending 31 December 2019. 25% of the Matching Share 
Award will vest for threshold performance (Aggregate EPS of 13.5p), rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting 
for maximum performance (Aggregate EPS of 16.5p or above).
The definition of EPS is statutory Earnings Per Share before exceptional items (adjusted to reflect tax paid on a  
cash basis).

Matching Share Award. 
2  The Investment Shares that Ed Casey invested into the DBP in respect of 2016 bonus earned will be released to him. The Matching Share Award lapsed in full

Other shareholding information 
Shareholder dilution
Awards granted under the Company share plans are met either by the issue of new shares or by shares held in trust 
when awards vest. The Committee monitors the number of shares issued under its various share plans and their 
impact on dilution limits. The relevant dilution limits established by the Investment Association (formerly the ABI) in 
respect of all share plans is 10% in any rolling ten-year period and in respect of discretionary share plans is 5% in any 
rolling ten-year period. Based on the Company’s issued share capital at 31 December 2017, our dilution level was 
within these limits.
The Group has an employee share ownership trust which is administered by an independent trustee and which 
holds ordinary shares in the Company to meet various obligations under the share plans.
The Trust held 9,864,986 and 8,728,497 ordinary shares at 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 respectively.

Articles of Association
The rules relating to the appointment and replacement 
of Directors’ are contained in the Company’s Articles 
of Association. Changes to the Articles of Association 
must be approved by the shareholders in accordance 
with the legislation in force from time to time.
Share capital
The issued share capital of the Company, together with 
the details of shares issued during the year, is shown in 
Note 34 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The powers of the Directors’ to issue or buy back shares 
are restricted to those approved at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting.
At the Annual General Meeting in May 2017, pursuant to 
Section 570 of the Companies Act 2006, shareholders 
approved the issue of shares for cash up to 5% of the 
existing issued share capital and an additional 5% (only 
to be used in connection with an acquisition or specified 
capital investment) in each case without the application 
of pre-emption rights. The authority granted continues 
until the earlier of the AGM planned to be held in May 
2018 or close of business on 30 June 2018.
Rights attaching to shares
Each ordinary share of the Company carries one vote 
at general meetings of the Company. There are no 
restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
capital of the Company other than certain restrictions 
which may from time to time be imposed by law. In 
accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Conduct Authority, certain employees are required to 
seek the approval of the Company to deal in its shares.
The Company is not aware of any agreement between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities and/or voting rights. 
Authority for the purchase of shares

Company’s AGM in May 2017 remains in force, as set out 
in the 2017 Notice of Meeting which is available on our 
corporate website www.serco.com
Dividends

2017 financial year (2016: nil). The Directors’ do not

Directors' Report
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 144 Details of the Directors’ interests in the ordinary shares 
and options over the ordinary shares of the Company 
as at 31 December 2017 are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 142 and 143. Between 
1 January 2018 and the date of this report there were 
no changes in the Directors' interests in ordinary shares 
and options over ordinary shares.
Directors’ indemnities
Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover has been 
established for all Directors to provide cover against 
their reasonable actions on behalf of the Company. 
As permitted under the Articles of Association and in 
accordance with best practice, deeds of indemnity have 
been executed indemnifying each of the Directors’ and 
Company Secretary of the Company in respect of their 
positions as officers’ of the Company as a supplement 
to the Directors’ and officers’ insurance cover. The 
indemnities, which constitute a qualifying third party 
indemnity provision as defined by Section 234 of the 
Companies Act 2006, remain in force for all current 
Directors’ and the Company Secretary of the Company.
Branch offices
In certain jurisdictions, the Group will operate through 
a branch of one of its subsidiary companies. These 
include the following countries: Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, 
Belgium, Dubai, France, Germany, Greenland, 
Guam, Iraq, Italy, Luxembourg, Qatar, Singapore 
and South Africa.
Significant agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control
Given the business-to-government nature of many 
of the services provided by the Company and its 
subsidiaries, many agreements contain provisions 
entitling the other parties to terminate them in the 
event of a change of control, which can be triggered by 
a takeover of the Company. The following agreements 
are those individual agreements which the Company 
considers to be significant to the Group as a whole 
that contain provisions giving the other party a specific 
right to terminate if the Company is subject to a 
change of control:
Material contracts
• New Grafton Correctional Centre: On 14 June 2017, 
NorthernPathways Project Trust (of which Serco 
Australia Pty Limited is a member) entered into a 
Project Deed with the Australian State of New South 
Wales to design, construct and operate a new build 
prison named the New Grafton Correctional Centre. 
The prison is expected to become operational in 
2020. Also, on 14 June 2017, Serco Australia Pty 
Limited entered into an operator sub-contract with 
NorthernPathways. The operator sub-contract will 
expire 20 years from the date of acceptance of the 
completed New Grafton Correctional Centre by the 
State. Both the project deed and the operator sub-
contract contain change of control provisions that 
provide that any change of control to an unrelated 
third-party that has not been approved by the State 
of New South Wales would be a major default.  
A major default under either the project deed  
or operator sub-contract, if not cured, could result 
in a termination of that contract. 
• Australian Immigration Services: On 11 December 
2014, Serco Australia Pty Limited entered into a 
contract with the Commonwealth of Australia (acting 
through the Department of Immigration and Border 
Protection) for the provision of detention services 
at all onshore immigration facilities in Australia. 
The contract has an initial five-year term, with two 
two-year extension options available. In the event of 
a change in control or ownership of Serco Australia 
Pty Limited, which in the reasonable opinion of the 
Commonwealth adversely affects the Company’s 
ability to perform the services, the contract may be 
terminated by the Commonwealth.
• AWE: Serco Holdings Limited is a shareholder in 
AWE Management Limited (the ‘AWE JV’). Serco 
Holdings Limited’s joint venture partners and the 
other shareholders in the AWE JV are UK subsidiary 
companies of Lockheed Martin Corporation and 
Jacobs Engineering Group. The AWE JV oversees the 
design, development, maintenance and manufacture 
of warheads for the UK’s strategic nuclear deterrent. 
This work is carried out by the AWE JV under a 
management and operation contract with the 
Secretary of State for Defence (the ‘AWE Contract’). 
The AWE Contract was entered into on 1 December 
1999 and has a 25-year term. Under the terms of the 
AWE Contract, any change in shareholding or the 
identity of a shareholder in the AWE JV requires the 
consent of the Secretary of State for Defence. In 
the event that there is a change of control of Serco 
Holdings Limited, it is required to transfer its entire 
shareholding in the AWE JV to the Serco Group or 
another wholly owned subsidiary of the Serco Group 
prior to such change of control. In the event that 
there is a change of control of Serco Holdings Limited 
without its entire shareholding in the AWE JV first 
being transferred to another member of the Serco 
Group or if there is a change of control of the Serco 
Group then the other shareholders in the AWE JV are 
entitled (subject to the approval of the Secretary of 
State and applicable regulatory approvals) to purchase 
the AWE JV shares and loans held by Serco Holdings 
Limited and any other member of the Serco Group.

• CMS Eligibility Support Services (ESS): On 1 July 
2013, Serco Inc. entered into a contract with the 
United States of America (acting through the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)) for the 
provision of support for the Exchanges implemented 
to provide affordable health insurance and insurance 
affordability programmes. The contract had an initial 
base term of one year, with four options of one year 
each. In the event of a change in control or ownership 
of Serco Inc., which in the reasonable opinion of the 
U.S. Government adversely affects the Company's 
ability to perform the services, the contract may be 
terminated by the U.S. Government.
• SSA: In order to bid and perform on certain classified 
contracts involving US national security, Serco Inc. 
was required to mitigate its foreign ownership 
through a Special Security Agreement (SSA) between 
the US Government, Serco Inc., and Serco Group plc. 
The effective date of the SSA is 18 June 2008. The 
U.S. Department of Defense may terminate Serco's 
SSA in the event of the sale of the Corporation to a 
company or person not under Foreign Ownership, 
Control or Influence (FOCI). 
Financing facilities
• Revolving credit facility: the Company has a 
£480,000,000 revolving credit facility dated 28 March 
2012 (amended and restated 12 March 2015) with 
the Bank of America Securities Limited, Barclays 
Bank PLC, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit 
Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, DBS 
Bank Limited, HSBC Bank PLC, J.P. Morgan Limited, 
Lloyds TSB Bank PLC, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
UFJ Limited and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC as 
mandated lead arrangers, and Barclays Bank PLC 
as Facility Agent. The facility provides funds for 
general corporate and working capital purposes, 
and bonds to support the Group’s business needs. 
The facility agreement provides that in the event of a 
change of control of the Company each lender may, 
within a certain period, call for the prepayment of 
the amounts owed to it and cancel its commitments 
under the facility.
• US notes: the Company has notes outstanding 
under three US Private Placement Note Purchase 
Agreements (the ‘USPP Agreements’) dated 9 May 
2011, 20 October 2011 and 13 May 2013, respectively. 
The total amount of the notes outstanding under 
the three USPP Agreements was $352,192,038 at 31 
December 2017, and their maturity is between 9 May 
2018 and 14 May 2024. Under the terms of the USPP 
Agreements, if a change of control of the Company 
occurs it is required to offer to prepay the entire 
principal amount of the notes together with interest 
to the prepayment date but without payment of any 
make-whole amount.
Share plans
The Company’s share plans contain provisions in 
relation to a change of control. Outstanding options 
and awards may vest and become exercisable on a 
change of control of the Company, in accordance with 
the rules of the plans.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company  
will be held at Clifford Chance LLP, 10 Upper Bank 
Street, Canary Wharf, London, E14 5JJ on Thursday  
10 May 2018 at 11.00am.
Financial risk policies
A summary of the Group’s treasury policies and 
objectives relating to financial risk management, 
including exposure to associated risks, is on  
pages 207 to 212.
Employment policies
The Board is committed to maintaining a working 
environment where staff are individually valued and 
recognised. Group companies and Divisions operate 
within a framework of human resources policies, 
practices and regulations appropriate to their own 
market sector and country of operation, whilst subject 
to Group-wide policies and principles.
Diversity
The Group is committed to ensuring equal 
opportunity, honouring the rights of the individual, 
and fostering partnership and trust in every working 
relationship. Policies and procedures for recruitment, 
training and career development promote diversity, 
respect for human rights, and equality of opportunity 
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, marital 
status, disability, race, religion or other beliefs and 
ethnic or national origin.
The Group promotes diversity so that all employees are 
able to be successful regardless of their background. 
The Group gives full consideration to applications 
for employment, career development and promotion 
received from the disabled, and offers employment 
when suitable opportunities arise. If employees 
become disabled during their service with the Group, 
arrangements are made wherever practicable to 
continue their employment and training.
Directors' Report continued
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 146 The Group recognises the importance of protecting 
human rights. We seek to respect and uphold the 
human rights of individuals in all aspects of our 
operations wherever we operate. Our Human Rights 
Group Standard demonstrates this commitment 
and the significance of human rights for a diverse 
global organisation. It also sets out expectations for 
individual and corporate behaviour across our business 
in regards to human rights. We use International 
Human Rights Standards such as the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
(2011) (UN Guiding Principles) as frameworks to assist 
our decision-making and constructive engagement; 
to identify, assess, and manage adverse human rights 
impacts; and to integrate and act on findings, track 
responses, monitor effectiveness and communicate 
how impacts are addressed.
Employee Engagement
The Group remains proud of its record of managing 
employee relations and continues to believe that the 
structure of individual and collective consultation and 
negotiation is best developed at a local level. Over the 
years, the Group has demonstrated that working with 
trade unions and creating effective partnerships allows 
improvements to be delivered in business performance 
as well as in employment terms and conditions. Where 
employees choose not to belong to a trade union, 
employee communication forums such as works councils 
exist to ensure involvement of staff within the business. 
The Group has been proactive in providing employees 
with information on matters of concern to them as 
employees. These mechanisms ensure employees' 
views are considered in decision-making and that they 
have a common awareness of Group strategy, matters of 
concern to them and the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Company.
Participation by staff in the success of the Group is 
encouraged by the availability of long-term incentive 
arrangements for senior management, which effectively 
aligns their interests with those of shareholders by 
requiring that Company-level financial performance 
criteria are achieved as a condition of vesting.
Corporate responsibility
The Group recognises that operating in a responsible 
manner helps drive Serco's success. Our commitment 
to corporate responsibility is supported by defined 
policies embedded in our Serco Management System. 
More information on Corporate Responsibility, including 
greenhouse gas emission reporting, can be found in the 
Strategic Report on pages 69 to 84.
Research and development
Serco undertakes a limited amount of research and 
development (R&D), given that our primary business 
model is the delivery of public services through our 
people. In 2017, we spent £1.7m on R&D on IT-related 
projects, compared to £3.6m in 2016.
Political donations
During the year neither the Company nor the Group 
made political donations and they intend to continue 
with this policy. However, it is possible that certain 
routine activities may unintentionally fall within 
the broad scope of the Companies Act provisions 
relating to political donations and expenditure. As in 
previous years, the Company will therefore propose to 
shareholders that the authority granted at the AGM in 
May 2017 regarding political donations be renewed. 
Details will be included in the Notice of AGM. 
Within the US business there exists a Political 
Action Committee (PAC), which is funded entirely 
by employees and their spouses. The Serco PAC 
and its contributions are administered in strict 
accordance with regulatory requirements. Employee 
contributions are entirely voluntary and no pressure 
is placed on employees to participate. Under US law, 
an employee-funded PAC must bear the name of the 
employing company.
Financial statements
At the date of this report, as far as each Director is 
aware, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Group’s Auditor is unaware. Each Director has taken 
all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself or herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s Auditor is aware of that information.
Auditor
The Company undertook a formal competitive tender 
exercise for external audit services during 2016, as 
detailed in the 2016 Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
As a result of this tender process KPMG LLP was 
appointed as the Company’s External Auditor by the 
Board on 27 May 2016 and Deloitte LLP resigned as 
Auditor on the same date.
The appointment of KPMG LLP for the 2018 financial 
year will be subject to shareholder approval at the next 
AGM in May 2018. Further details are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting sent to shareholders.

Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
Directors' Report continued
Going concern
In assessing the basis of preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, the Directors 
have considered the principles of the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting, 2014; namely assessing the applicability of the going concern basis, 
the review period and disclosures. The Group’s principal debt facilities at the year-end comprised a £480m revolving 
credit facility, and £261m of US private placement notes. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had £741m of committed 
credit facilities and committed headroom of £588m. 
Assessment of going concern
The Directors have undertaken a rigorous assessment of going concern and liquidity taking into account financial 
forecasts. In order to satisfy ourselves that we have adequate resources for the future, the Directors have reviewed 
the Group’s existing debt levels, the committed funding and liquidity positions under our debt covenants, and our 
ability to generate cash from trading activities.
Review period
In undertaking this review the Directors have considered the business plans which provide financial projections for 
the foreseeable future. For the purposes of this review, we consider that to be the period ending 30 June 2019. The 
Directors have also reviewed the principal risks considered on pages 20 to 29 of the Strategic Report and taken 
account of the results of sensitivity testing. 
Assessment
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to operate within the 
level of available facilities and cash for the foreseeable future and accordingly believe that it is appropriate to 
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Interests in voting rights

Directors’ Report

Financial Statements Strategic Report Directors' Report
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group 
and Company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law, the Directors are required to 
prepare the Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union ('IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU') and applicable law, and have elected 
to prepare the Company financial statements in 
accordance with UK accounting standards, including 
FRS 101, Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and Company and of their profit or loss for 
that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, 
relevant, reliable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether 
they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU;
• for the Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK accounting statements have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the Company financial statements; 
• assess the Group and Company's ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and
• use the going concern basis of accounting unless they 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative 
but to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are responsible for such internal controls as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of the financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and 
have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, 
Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in 
the UK governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report and Accounts
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting standards, give 
a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as  
a whole; and
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
We consider, the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
to the members of Serco Group plc
Our opinion is unmodified We have audited the financial statements of Serco Group Plc (“the Company”) for the 
year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheet, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes, including the accounting policies 
in Note 2. 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. 
Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit 
opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee. 
We were appointed as auditor by the directors on 27 May 2016. The period of total 
uninterrupted engagement is for the 2 financial years ended 31 December 2017. We have 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in 
accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.
Key audit matters: our assessment  
of risks of material misstatement
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed 
risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the 
audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit 
matters (unchanged from 2016), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our 
audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, 
as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters 
were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and 
solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.

and page 205 (provisions note in the financial statements)
The risk Our response
Subjective estimate
The contractual arrangements that 
underpin the measurement and 
recognition of revenue by the group 
can be complex, with significant 
judgements involved in the assessment 
of current and future financial 
performance of those contracts. 
The key judgements impacting the 
recognition of revenue and resulting 
operating profit include:
• Interpretations of terms and 
conditions in relation to the required 
service obligations in accordance 
with contractual arrangements;
• The allocation of revenue and costs 
to performance obligations where 
multiple deliverables exist;
• Assessment of stage of completion 
and cost to complete, where 
percentage completion accounting 
is used;
• Consideration of the Group’s 
performance against contractual 
obligations and the impact on 
revenue and costs of delivery;
• The recognition and recoverability 
assessments of contract related 
assets, including those recognised 
as direct incremental costs prior to 
service commencement.
Where an onerous contract provision 
is required, judgement is required in 
assessing the level of provision, including 
estimated cost to complete taking into 
account contractual obligations to the 
end of the contract, extension periods 
and customer negotiations.
Our audit procedures included the following: 
Contracts were selected for substantive audit procedures based on qualitative factors, such as 
commercial complexity, and quantitative factors, such as financial significance and profitability that 
we considered to be indicative of risk. Our audit testing for the contracts selected included the 
following: 
• Assessing policy application: We inspected the contract agreements to challenge the method 
of revenue recognition adopted by the Group including, where relevant, the allocation of revenue 
across contractual obligations and compared the specific method used to Group policy
• Independent reperformance: Where percentage of completion is used, we re-calculated 
the stage of completion on the basis of actual costs and latest cost forecasts to inform our 
assessment of the appropriate amount of revenue and profit to recognise and compared this 
to the amounts recorded by the Group
• Accounting analysis: We assessed whether the revenue recognition methodology applied 
was consistent with accounting standards. We also inspected accounting papers prepared 
by the Group to understand the support provided in respect of key contract judgements and 
onerous contract provisions
• Tests of details: We inspected a sample of correspondence with customers and third parties, 
in instances where contractual variations and claims have arisen, to inform our assessment of 
the revenue and costs recorded up to the balance sheet date
• Site visits: We visited key contract locations and attended a sample of monthly Divisional 
and Business Unit Performance Reviews used to assess business performance to inform our 
assessment of operational and financial risks
For onerous and potentially onerous contracts identified through application of quantitative 
selection criteria, our procedures also included:
• Benchmarking assumptions: We compared contract level forecast revenues and costs to 
Group budgets and forecasts approved by the directors. We challenged key assumptions 
made by the Group in preparing these forecasts, including those in relation to revenue growth 
and cost reductions, vouching to external evidence where possible and obtaining supporting 
plans where appropriate
• Our sector experience: We assessed the contractual terms and conditions to identify the key 
obligations of the contract to inform our challenge of completeness of forecast costs and cost 
accruals recorded at the balance sheet date
• Historical comparisons: We compared the contract forecasts to historic and in year 
performance to assess the historical accuracy of the forecasts
• Tests of details: We assessed the mathematical accuracy of the models used to forecast 
contract revenues and costs
• Independent reperformance: We compared the forecast margin to the cumulative margin 
recognised up to the balance sheet date to assess whether provisions for loss-making 
contracts had been appropriately recorded and, in the case of profitable contracts, that 
margin recognised to date did not exceed the forecast.
For selected contract related assets, representing capitalised bid and phase in costs, our 
procedures included:
• Assessing application: We assessed whether these had been recognised in accordance with 
the Group’s accounting policy and relevant accounting standards
• Comparing valuations: We inspected actual and forecast contractual cash flows and profits 
to assess whether these supported the carrying value of the assets
• Historical comparisons: We inspected the underlying contracts to inform our assessment of the 
forecast cash flows, and compared actual cash flows to forecasts to assess reasonableness
• Independent reperformance: We compared the amortisation period with the duration of the 
contract and checked that the amortisation had been calculated correctly
Assessing transparency: We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the estimates 
and judgements applied reflected the risks related to revenue and margin recognition.
Our results 
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we considered the revenue and margin 
recognised, and the level of onerous contract provisioning, to be acceptable.

Recoverability of group goodwill and of parent’s investment in subsidiaries
Group: £551.3m (2016: £577.9m); Parent company: £2,010.5m (2016: £2,001.3m)
Assessment of risk vs. prior year: Unchanged
Refer to page 99 (Audit Committee Report), page 170 (accounting policy), page 176 (key judgements)  
and page 196 (Goodwill note in the financial statements)
The Risk Our response
Forecast-based valuation
Goodwill in the group and the carrying amount of 
the parent company’s investments in subsidiaries 
are significant and at risk of irrecoverability due to 
uncertainty regarding contract attrition and new 
contract wins and extension rates, and the impact 
of the Group’s transformation programme to 
reduce operating costs. 
The estimated recoverable amount of these 
balances is subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting 
future cash flows. 
In the year ended 31 December 2016, the Health 
and Americas cash generating units presented the 
lowest headroom, and as a result the carrying value 
of goodwill for these CGUs may be particularly 
sensitive to a deterioration in the divisions’ 
projections or an increase in discount rate.
Our procedures included the following: 
• Benchmarking assumptions: With the assistance of our valuation specialists, 
we challenged the growth rate and discount rate for each CGU used in the 
value in use calculation by comparing the Group’s assumptions to external data. 
We challenged forecast assumptions around new contract wins or extensions, 
contract attrition, cost reductions and the allocation of central costs. 
• Historical comparisons: We compared the forecast cash flows against budgets 
and historic actual performance to test for historic accuracy. 
• Sensitivity analysis: We tested the sensitivity of the impairment calculation to 
changes in the underlying assumptions to inform our assessment of the significant 
assumptions.
• Comparing valuations: We considered whether the forecast cash flow 
assumptions used in the value in use calculation were consistent with the 
assumptions used to calculate the expected loss on onerous contract provisions, 
the recognition of deferred tax assets and the Director’s assessment of going 
concern and viability. The value in use derived was compared to the appropriate 
goodwill and investments carrying value to identify any impairment.
• Assessing transparency: We also assessed whether the Group’s and parent 
Company’s disclosures about the sensitivity of outcomes reflected the risks 
inherent in the valuation of goodwill and investment in subsidiaries.
Our results:
We found the group’s assessment of the recoverable amount of goodwill in the group 
and the parent company’s investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable.
Retirement benefit surplus £41.8m (2016: £150.4m)
Assessment of risk vs. prior year: unchanged
Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee Report), page 172 (accounting policy), page 177 (key judgements) and page 212 (Retirement benefit 
schemes note in the financial statements)
The Risk Our response
Subjective valuation
Significant estimates are made in valuing the Group’s 
retirement benefit surplus in respect of the Serco 
Pension Life Assurance Scheme (SPLAS), including 
mortality, price inflation, discount rates and future 
increases in salary and pension. Small changes in the 
assumptions and estimates used to value the Group’s 
net pension surplus would have a significant effect on 
the Group’s financial position. 
Accounting treatment
As the Group’s main defined benefit scheme is in 
a net surplus of £41.8 million at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £150.4m), judgement is required to determine 
if it is appropriate to recognise an asset. 
The application of specific accounting treatments 
in respect of transactions undertaken in the period, 
including the impact of curtailments, settlements 
and the purchase of a bulk annuity insurance 
policy require careful analysis with regards to the 
application of IAS 19.
Judgement is also required to determine if pension 
obligations associated with contract arrangements 
meet the definition of defined benefit or defined 
contribution schemes, and whether an associated asset 
or liability is required to be accounted for by the Group.
Our procedures in respect of the SPLAS included the following:
• Tests of details: We performed procedures to test the accuracy of data provided 
by the Group to the scheme actuaries. This involved selecting a sample of scheme 
participants to compare data provided to the actuaries to underlying employment 
records held by the Group and the Scheme Administrator.
• Benchmarking assumptions: We challenged the key assumptions used to calculate 
the valuation of the Group’s net pension surplus with input from our actuarial 
specialists, comparing the discount rate, inflation rate, salary increases, pension 
increase rates and life expectancy assumptions used against externally derived data.
• Accounting analysis: We challenged the basis of the Group’s judgement that 
it has an unconditional right of refund based on our assessment of the scheme 
rules and advice provided by external actuaries. We have also considered the 
application of accounting standards with regards to specific changes in the 
scheme during the period, including the effect of curtailments.
• Accounting analysis: We have also considered the application of accounting 
standards with regards to specific changes in the scheme during the period, 
including the effect of curtailments.
Assessing principles: In respect of contract related pension obligations, we 
challenged the judgements made by the Group in assessing whether defined 
benefit liabilities have been recognised in accordance with contractual terms. 
Our procedures included assessment of the underlying contract agreements and 
consideration of legal advice obtained by the Group.
• Assessing transparency: We assessed the Group’s disclosure in respect of the 
sensitivity of the surplus to changes in the key assumptions. 
Our results
We found the valuation of the retirement benefit surplus to be acceptable.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 154 Our application of materiality  
and an overview of the scope  
of our audit
Materiality
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £5 million (2016: £5 
million), determined with reference to a normalised benchmark of Group Profit Before Tax and 
Exceptional Items taking into account historic financial performance and the Group’s current 
profit margins in light of the Group’s ongoing Strategy Review. This represents 12.9% (2016: 
5.8%) of Group Profit Before Tax and Exceptional Items of £38.7 million (2016: £85.9 million) 
and 0.2% (2016: 0.2%) of Group Revenue of 2,953.6 million (2016: £3,011 million). 
Materiality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at £4.5 million 
(2016: £4.5 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of 
which it represents 0.2% (2016: 0.2%).
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified 
misstatements exceeding £0.25 million (2016: £0.25 million), in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Scope of our audit
Of the group’s 8 (2016: 9) reporting components, we subjected 6 (2016: 7) to full scope audits 
for group purposes. 
These 6 (2016: 7) components represent approximately 99.8% (2016: 98.6%) of the Group’s 
Revenue, 99.4% (2016: 98.7%) of Group profit before tax and 98.4% (2016: 99.1%) of Group 
total assets. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be 
covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. 
The Group team approved component materiality levels, which ranged from £2.0 million to 
£3.6 million (2016: £2.0 million to £3.6 million) having regard to the mix of size and risk profile 
of the Group across the components. The work on 4 of the 6 components (2016: 5 of the 7 
components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the 
parent company, was performed by the Group team. The Group team visited all (2016: all) 
component locations to assess the audit risk and strategy. Video and telephone conference 
meetings were also held with these component auditors. At these visits, the findings reported 
to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group 
team was then performed by the component auditor.

Respective responsibilities Directors’ responsibilities
As explained more fully in their statement set out on page 150, the directors are responsible 
for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error; assessing the Group and parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities 
(see below), or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can 
arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the members of Serco Group plc only
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 156 Respective responsibilities continued Irregularities – ability to detect
Our audit aimed to detect non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations (irregularities) 
that could have a material effect on the financial statements. In planning and performing our 
audit, we considered the impact of laws and regulations in the specific area of anti-bribery 
and corruption, recognising the Governmental nature of many of the group’s customers. 
We identified these areas through discussion with the directors and other management (as 
required by auditing standards), from our sector experience, and from inspection of the 
group’s regulatory, licensing and legal correspondence. In addition we had regard to laws and 
regulations in other areas including financial reporting, and company and taxation legislation.
We considered the extent of compliance with those laws and regulations that directly affect 
the financial statements, being anti-bribery and corruption as part of our procedures on the 
related financial statement items. For the remaining laws and regulations, we made enquiries 
of directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and inspected 
correspondence with regulatory and licensing authorities, as well as legal correspondence. 
We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert 
to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication 
from the group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at group 
level, with a request to report on any indications of potential existence of irregularities in 
these areas, or other areas directly identified by the component team.
As with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal controls.
The purpose of our audit work and to 
whom we owe our responsibilities
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 162 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General information
Serco Group plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the 
registered office is Serco House, 16 Bartley Wood Business Park, Bartley Way, Hook, Hampshire, RG27 9UY. 
These consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and are presented 
in pounds Sterling because this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which Serco operates. All amounts have been 
rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand pounds, foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 2.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements on pages 152 to 239 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards adopted for use in the European Union (IFRS) and therefore comply with the requirements set out in Article 4 of the EU 
IAS regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. Historical 
cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The following principal accounting 
policies adopted have been applied consistently in the current and preceding financial year except as stated below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company up to 
31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
(i) has the power over the investee; 
(ii) is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
(iii) has the ability to use its power to affect the returns. 
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more 
of the three elements of control listed above.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective 
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profits or losses and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is 
presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity of shareholders of Serco Group plc.
Going concern 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to operate within the level of available 
facilities and cash for the foreseeable future and accordingly believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.
In assessing the basis of preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, the Directors have considered 
the principles of the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting, 2014’; namely assessing the applicability of the going concern basis, the review period and disclosures. The Directors have 
undertaken a rigorous assessment of going concern and liquidity, taking into account financial forecasts, which indicate sufficient capacity 
in our financing facilities and associated covenants to support the Group. In order to satisfy themselves that they have adequate resources 
for the future, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s existing debt levels, the committed funding and liquidity positions under our debt 
covenants, and our ability to generate cash from trading activities and working capital requirements. The Group’s current principal debt 
facilities at the year-end comprised a £480m revolving credit facility, and £261m of US private placement notes. As at 31 December 2017, 
the Group had £741m of committed credit facilities and committed headroom of £588m.
In undertaking this review the Directors have considered the business plans which provide financial projections for the foreseeable future. 
For the purposes of this review, we consider that to be the period ending 30 June 2019. The Directors have also reviewed the principal risks 
considered on pages 20 to 29 of the Strategic Report and taken account of the results of sensitivity testing.

Prior year restatement
The Group has undergone a programme of work on its financial data structures to appropriately allocate and charge costs to the 
relevant divisions and between cost of sales and administrative expenses. As a result of the activities performed in this area, the Group’s 
classification of cost items in the income statement has changed. The prior periods’ results have been restated to reflect the cost items 
identified which should have been reallocated in 2016.
Cost of sales are considered to be the direct costs of operating ongoing contracts. This includes the unavoidable costs of servicing 
contracts and all costs that a contract would incur purely on its own without a parent company, regardless of how those services are 
delivered within the wider Group, such as IT or Human Resource management services provided centrally.
The impact on the relevant line items in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2016 is as follows:

Adoption of new and revised standards
None of the changes to IFRS that became effective in the current reporting period have had a significant impact on the Group’s 
financial statements.
New standards and interpretations not applied: IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective 1 January 2018), provides a single, principles-based five step model to be 
applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers. It replaces existing revenue recognition 
guidance for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS11 Construction Contracts and IAS18 Revenue.
Under the transition rules IFRS15 will be applied retrospectively to the prior period in accordance with IAS8 Accounting policies, changes 
in accounting estimates and errors, subject to the following expedients:
• contracts completed prior to 1 January 2018 and that begin and end within the same annual reporting period will not be restated; 
• for contracts that have variable consideration and which have completed prior to 1 January 2018, the revenues recognised will reflect the 
actual outcome, rather than being estimated and trued up; and 
• the disclosures required for comparative periods in respect of amount of revenue allocated to the remaining performance obligations 
and an explanation of when that amount is expected to be recognised will not be made.
The cumulative effect of initially applying the standard will be shown as an adjustment to brought forward retained earnings as at 
1 January 2017.
Below is set out the expected revenue recognition policy under IFRS15 together with the estimated impact of adopting the standard.
Revenue recognition: Repeat service based contracts
The majority of the Group’s contracts are repeat service based contracts where value is transferred to the customer over time as the core 
services are delivered and therefore in most cases revenue will be recognised on the output basis, with revenue linked to the deliverables 
provided to the customer. Where any price step downs are required in a contract accounted for under the output basis and output is not 
decreasing, revenue will require deferral from initial years to subsequent years in order for revenue to be recognised on a consistent basis.
There are some contracts where a separate performance obligation has been identified for services where the pattern of delivery differs to 
the core services and are capable of being distinct. In these instances, where the transfer of control is most closely aligned to our efforts 
in delivering the service, then the input method is used to measure progress, and revenue is recognised in direct proportion to costs 
incurred. Where deemed appropriate, the Group will utilise the practical expedient within IFRS15, allowing revenue to be recognised at 
the amount which the Group has the right to invoice, where that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s 
performance completed to date.
Under IFRS15, unless upfront fees received from customers including transition payments can be clearly attributable to a distinct service 
the customer is obtaining, then such payments do not constitute a separate performance obligation and instead are deferred and spread 
over the life of the core services.
Any changes to the enforceable rights and obligations with customers and/or an update to the transaction price will not be recognised as 
revenue until there is evidence of customer agreement in line with the Group’s policies.
Any variable amounts will only be recognised where it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 164 Where the Group is required to assess whether it is acting as principal or as an agent in respect of goods or services procured for 
customers, the Group is acting as principal if it is in control of a good or a service prior to transferring to the customer and an agent  
where it is arranging for those goods or services to be provided to the customer without obtaining control.
Revenue recognition: Long-term project based contracts
The Group has a limited number of long-term contracts for the provision of complex, project-based services. When control of such a 
deliverable is passed onto the customer at the final stage of a contract, the recognition of revenue is delayed until control has been 
passed. However, where the customer has control over the life of the deliverable or where the Group has a legally enforceable right to 
remuneration for the work completed to date, or at milestone periods, revenue will be recognised in line with the associated transfer of 
control or milestone dates.
Revenue recognition: Other
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. 
Interest income is accrued for on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable,  
which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s  
net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.
Contract costs
Bid costs are capitalised only when they relate directly to a contract and are incremental to securing the contract. Any costs which would 
have been incurred whether or not the contract is actually won are not considered to be capitalised bid costs. 
Contract costs are charged to the income statement as incurred, including the necessary accrual for costs which have not yet been 
invoiced, unless the expense relates to a specific time frame covering future periods. 
Contract costs can only be capitalised when the expenditure meets all of the following three criteria and are not within the scope of 
another accounting standard, such as inventories, intangible assets, or property, plant and equipment:
• The costs relate directly to a contract. These include: direct labour, being the salaries and wages of employees providing the promised 
services to the customer; direct materials such as supplies used in providing the promised services to a customer; and other costs that 
are incurred only because an entity entered into the contract, such as payments to subcontractors.
• The costs generate or enhance the resources used in satisfying performance obligations in the future. For initial contract costs capitalised, 
such costs only fall into one of the following two categories: the mobilisation of contract staff, being the costs of moving existing contract 
staff to other Group locations; or directly incremental costs incurred in meeting contractual obligations incurred prior to contract delivery, 
which are required to ensure a proper handover from the previous contractor. Redundancy costs are never capitalised.
• The costs are expected to be recovered, i.e. the contract is expected to be profitable after amortising the capitalised costs.

The Group will continue to work to design, implement and refine procedures to apply the new requirements of IFRS15 and to finalise 
accounting policy choices, including in its subsidiaries and joint ventures. As a result of this ongoing work, it is possible that there may 
be some changes to the impact above prior to the 30 June 2018 results being issued. However, at this time these are not expected to 
be significant.

New standards and interpretations not applied: IFRS15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers continued
Estimated impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 continued
The total adjustment to the opening balance of the Group’s equity at 1 January 2017 is a decrease of £32.8m. The principal components of 
the estimated adjustment are as follows:
• A decrease of £14.4m due to revenues being recognised at a constant amount over the life of the contract where the level of services 
provided is broadly consistent.
• A decrease of £11.4m due to a change in the basis of measuring progress for asset maintenance and replacement services, including dry 
docking. Where the resources used to fulfil the performance obligations best depicts how control is passed to the customer, the input 
method of accounting has been applied.
• A decrease of £6.8m due to upfront fees and transition payments being deferred and spread in line with delivery of the core services.

(viii) OCP charges and releases – – (8.4)
Adjusted under IFRS15 50.3 2,950.6 40.9
(i)  Upfront fees. For some contracts, the Group receives non-refundable amounts at the start of the contract to cover initial costs. Under 
IFRS15, unless upfront fees are attributable to a good or a service the customer is in control of, such fees do not constitute a separate 
performance obligation and instead are allocated to the performance obligations of the contract, therefore being spread over the 
life of the other services. In some instances such upfront fees were recognised as revenue under IAS18 but are deferred under IFRS15. 
Upfront payments are analysed to determine whether they constitute a material financing arrangement under IFRS15.
(ii)  Transition, transformation and other mobilisation activities. Transition activities which are administrative in nature are not treated as 
separate performance obligations. Transition and transformation activities which are more than administrative in nature are assessed 
to determine whether they form a separate performance obligation. Where it can be demonstrated that the transition activities 
benefit the customer without future activities being provided then the transition phase is accounted for as a separate performance 
obligation under the contract and revenue recognised accordingly. Where it is concluded that the transformation, transition or 
mobilisation activity does not form a separate performance obligation under the contract, any payments received from the customer 
are allocated to the performance obligations of the contract and recognised over the life of the other services. In some instances 
revenue recognised under IAS18 is deferred under IFRS15.
(iii)  Asset maintenance and replacement, including vessel dry docking. In many of the contracts the Group enters into, the provision 
of maintenance and replacement services are capable of being distinct and therefore these have been accounted for as separate 
performance obligations. The input method of accounting is used to reflect the pattern of delivery to the customer and the 
enhancement of customer owned assets. In some instances the output method of accounting is used due to the ongoing repetitive 
nature and frequency of the services. Adopting IFRS15 will result in the deferral of revenue recognised under IAS18 on certain 
contracts.
(iv)  Percentage of completion accounting. Changes to the Group’s current accounting policy arise when the percentage of completion 
model under IAS11 is replaced by the output method of accounting. The output method is used where the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits in direct proportion to the deliverable performed rather than the level of expense incurred to 
date. 
(v)  Pass through revenues and procurement arrangements. A pass through arrangement is where goods or services are provided by 
a third party, but sourced by the Group on behalf of the customer. In this instance, the Group does not recognise revenue for the 
amount received from the customer as compensation of the cost of the good or service but rather only the margin element (if any) is 
recorded as revenue. Recognition of such revenues under IFRS15 is linked directly to whether the Group has control of the deliverable 
prior to transfer rather than an assessment of the risks and rewards associated with the services as was the case under IAS18. For 
certain procurement arrangements the Group does not have control prior to transfer, but does have a level of risk associated with the 
activity, and therefore these arrangements are not recognised on a net basis instead of the gross basis under IAS18.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 166 (vi)  Consideration payable to a customer. Under IFRS15 all amounts payable to a customer (including all payments to the customer and 
all reductions to amounts paid by the customer) are recorded as a reduction in revenue. In 2017, an element of reductions have been 
recorded as costs.
(vii)  Variable pricing. It is not uncommon in outsourcing arrangements for the payment terms to be set to decline over the future periods 
(i.e. a 5% reduction in fees is built into years five to six, 6% reduction in years seven to eight and so on). However, where revenue 
recognition under IFSR15 is based on the output method and the service remains consistent over the contract life, the reduction in 
the amounts paid by the customer should not be reflected in declining revenues, even if this was appropriate under IAS18. As a result, 
revenue recognised in prior years for certain contracts will be deferred under IFRS15. 
(viii)  OCP charges and releases. Where an adjustment is required by IFRS15 and the relevant contract is loss making, the deferral of 
revenue from prior years can result in a decrease in the level of OCP needed under IFRS15, as future losses will reduce by the level 
of deferred revenue. During the year one contract recorded a release against the OCP balance held under current accounting 
standards. As a result of IFRS15, revenues on this contract have been deferred, reducing the opening OCP balance, increasing 
deferred revenue and therefore the release of the relevant OCP balance is lower under IFRS15. 
In addition to the areas where a financial impact has been identified as a result of adoption of IFRS15 as identified above, there are certain 
accounting policies which are new or change existing policies applied by the Group and may have an impact on the future financial 
performance of the Group. The policies in these areas to be adopted by the Group are set out below:
(ix)  Contract variations. Contract modifications such as change orders, variations, change notices and amendments could be approved in 
writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. Under IFRS15 contract modifications are changes in the scope 
or price (or both) of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. If the parties to the contract have not approved a contract 
modification, revenue should be recognised in accordance with the existing contractual terms and associated cash payments are 
deferred until the contract modification is approved. The judgements historically applied have been consistent with this policy. 
(x)  Variable revenues requiring estimation. IFRS15 provides clear guidance on variable income unlike IAS18 and two areas may be impacted 
as a result. First, if the consideration paid by a customer includes a variable amount requiring judgement, it is only recognised where it is 
highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Second, service penalties or any claims made by us against the customer which 
must be recognised in revenue unless it is highly probable that they will not result in future settlement. However, judgements taken 
historically are consistent with the requirements of IFRS15 and there is no impact of these changes on the Group.
(xi)  Capitalised redundancy costs. Under certain contracts there is an obligation to make redundancies and the Group is compensated 
for these costs. Historically, the Group may have recognised revenues as and when the customer makes payments or the Group 
may have capitalised the expense to match with payments being made in the future. Under IFRS15, all redundancy costs must be 
expensed in the period they are incurred and revenue is not recognised on these redundancy transactions, with any cash payments 
deferred over the contract in line with the other services being delivered. No adjustment was required in respect of this difference.
(xii) Licence income. Where the Group receives income for software licences and maintenance services provided through ongoing   
 support and operational functionality, this licence revenue is recognised over the period when the maintenance obligation exists.  
 There are currently no significant licencing arrangements entered into by the Group with its customers which are impacted by IFRS15.
(xiii)  Extension periods granted or other options. Providing the option for a customer to obtain extension periods or other services may 
lead to a separate performance obligation where a material right exists. If a separate performance obligation exists then there would 
be an allocation of the transaction price from the original contract in addition to any revenues earned through the option period. A 
separate performance obligation exists for options under a contract if both of the following conditions are met. First, if the customer 
is unable to obtain the right to acquire the additional goods or services on the same or similar terms without entering into the original 
contract (for example they cannot get the option without first entering into the main contract, which would be the case for any 
extension period). Second, the option does not simply give the customer the right to acquire additional goods or services at a price 
that reflects the stand alone selling price for those goods or services (for example if the pricing of the option is consistent with what 
the pricing would have been in any case there is no separate PO, as the customer gains no incremental benefit from the existence of 
the option). No differences were noted under IFRS15 in this area. 
(xiv)  Work in progress. Revenue is only recognised when control is passed to a customer and therefore where revenue is recognised over 
time no work in progress is created unlike under current accounting standards. None of the contracts with revenues recognised over 
time have work in progress balances. 
(xv)  Significant financing component. Where the timing of payments agreed with the customer provides either party with a significant 
benefit of financing (either explicitly or implicitly), the associated asset/liability is adjusted for the time value of money and an interest 
charge or income is recognised and a corresponding offset in revenue. The Group’s policy under IFRS15 is to consider “significant” to 
be greater than 5% of the total transaction price of the contractual arrangement and no such arrangements are in place. 
(xvi)  Non-cash consideration. If a customer contributes goods or services (for example, materials, equipment or labour) to facilitate the 
fulfilment of the contract, the Group assesses whether control is obtained for those contributed goods or services. If the Group 
obtains control of the contributed goods or services, then the estimated fair value of these would be recognised as revenue. No such 
transactions have been noted.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Other new standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following changes to IFRS have not been applied but could potentially have a 
significant impact:
(i) IFRS9 Financial Instruments has been endorsed by the EU and will be effective from 1 January 2018.
This standard replaces IAS39 and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial instruments and puts in place 
a new hedge accounting model that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities 
when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures.
  The impact of IFRS9 on the regular trading activities of the Group is expected to be immaterial. The key areas of focus for the Group 
under IFRS9 are:
•  External loan receivables, including those from equity accounted entities.
•  Debt refinancing not accounted for as a significant modification under IAS39.
•  Expected credit losses being recognised on trade debtors and contract assets recognised under IFRS15.
•  Intercompany loan recoverability.
  IFRS9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS39 with an ‘expected credit loss’ model. The new model applies to financial assets that 
are not measured at FVTPL (fair value through profit and loss), including loans, lease and trade receivables, debt securities, contract 
assets under IFRS15 and specified financial guarantees and loan commitments issued. It does not apply to equity investments. 
Under the expected credit loss model, the Group is required to calculate the allowance for credit losses by considering on a 
discounted basis the cash shortfalls it would incur in various default scenarios for prescribed future periods and multiplying the 
shortfalls by the probability of each scenario occurring. The allowance is the sum of these probability weighted outcomes. Because 
every loan and receivable carries with it some risk of default, it is expected that every such asset has a loss attached to it from the 
moment of its origination. 
The financial assets held on the balance sheet have been reviewed in order to determine whether any loss is required to be recorded 
based on these expected credit losses. However, given the fact that the Group’s customers are governments it is unlikely that there 
will be a default as a result of credit risk and any provision for bad debts is more likely to be related to a contractual dispute. In most 
cases, each amount receivable has specific risk attached to recoverability which is most likely based on the services provided under 
the terms of the contract and, given the majority of receivables are backed by organisations with a sovereign credit rating, a general 
view on recoverability based on the counterparty credit risk could be misleading.
(ii) IFRS16 Leases is pending EU endorsement, which is expected prior to the effective date of 1 January 2019.
The standard replaces IAS17 Leases and has been introduced in order to improve the comparability of financial statements through 
developing an approach that is more consistent with the conceptual framework definitions of assets and liabilities.
The key change will be in respect of leases currently classified as operating leases. Under the new standard leases will be recognised 
on the balance sheet as liabilities with corresponding assets being created, grossing up the balance sheet but with no net effect on 
net assets at the start of the lease. The income statement impact will be a new interest charge arising from the rate implicit in the 
liability and as currently the full impact is a charge to operating profit, the change will result in an improvement to operating results.
We have not quantified the likely impact of the new standard, the transition approach to be taken or concluded whether it will be 
adopted early, which is allowed from the date IFRS15 is adopted. The quantitative impact of the adoption of IFRS16 will be disclosed 
prior to the adoption of this new standard.
Fair value
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market 
participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or is estimated using another valuation 
technique. There are certain transactions in these financial statements which are similar to fair value, but are determined by the treatment 
set out in their respective standards. These are share based payment transactions that are within the scope of IFRS2 Share based Payment, 
leasing transactions that are within the scope of IAS17 Leases, or the calculation of net realisable value under IAS2 Inventories or value in 
use under IAS36 Impairment of Assets. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts due for goods and services 
provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes. Calculating the fair value of revenue 
typically does not require a high level of judgement, the exceptions to this are the following areas:
• Uncontracted variations or claims. Where work has been performed outside of the normal contracting framework at the request of the 
customer or a claim has been made for work performed but is in dispute, judgement is required in order to determine whether there 
is sufficient certainty that the Group will be financially compensated. Revenue is only recognised to the extent that they have been 
orally agreed by the customer or are virtually certain of being received and revenue recognised in this manner is not considered to be 
significant to the Group’s results. 
• Payments by results contracts. When returns are directly linked to performance, through cost savings or other customer driven key 
performance indicators over a period of time an estimate is made of the likelihood of achieving the necessary level of performance 
when the period covers a financial year end. Revenue is only recognised when we can be reasonably certain of achieving the required 
level of performance and such payment mechanisms do not represent a significant proportion of annual revenue.
• Long term contracts. Revenue and profit is recognised for certain long term project based contracts based on the stage of completion 
of the contract activity. The assessment of the stage of completion requires the exercise of judgement and is measured by the 
proportion of costs incurred compared to the estimated whole life contract costs, except where whole life contract costs exceed the 
contract value, in which case the excess is expensed immediately.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 168 While each of these areas requires a high level of judgement, only long term contract accounting could have a significant impact on the 
Group’s financial results or position. However, the only revenues associated with these contracts are earned on loss making contracts with 
onerous loss provisions and as a result we do not identify this as a separate item for disclosure in Note 3. 
Revenue recognition: Repeat service based contracts
Revenue on repeat service based contracts is recognised as services are provided in line with the transfer of control to the customer. 
Where initial contract costs (phase in costs) are paid for by the customer, revenue is recognised when the related costs are incurred.
Revenue recognition: Long term project based contracts
The Group has a limited number of long term contracts for the provision of complex, project-based services. Where the outcome of such 
long term project based contracts can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the contract activity at the balance sheet date in accordance with IAS18 Revenue and IAS11 Construction Contracts. This is normally 
measured by the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date compared to the estimated total contract costs, but 
where a more accurate basis is available that alternative methodology is used. Contract costs include a rational allocation of overheads. 
Where the outcome of a long term project based contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that  
it is probable that contract costs will be recovered. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately. Such amounts are not discounted.
Revenue recognition: Other
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.
Bid costs and phase in costs
All bid costs are expensed through the income statement up to the point where contract award (or full recovery of costs) is virtually certain, 
being the point at which the Group has at least reached preferred bidder status. Bid costs incurred after this point are then capitalised within 
trade and other receivables. On contract award these bid costs are amortised through the income statement over the contract period by 
reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date. Bid costs are only capitalised to the extent that it is 
expected that the related contract will generate sufficient future economic benefits to at least offset the amortisation charge. 
Phase in costs that are incremental and directly related to the initial set up of contracts are capitalised within trade and other receivables 
and are recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract, except where they are specifically reimbursed as part of the terms 
of the contract when they are recognised in line with the associated revenue.
Determining whether bid and phase in costs are recoverable involves a high level of judgement as it requires a forecast to be prepared for 
the expected future profitability of the contract, taking into account the likely future costs and revenues associated with the services not 
yet performed. The level of bid and phase in costs can be seen in Note 23.
Operating profit
Operating profit is not a measure defined by IFRS and the Group considers this to include the profits and losses from continuing 
operations prior to corporation tax, interest revenue and finance costs.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences 
arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity through the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income (SOCI).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are 
recognised directly within equity in the Group’s hedging and translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income 
or expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.

Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is 
measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments 
issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value. Subsequent changes in fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition 
where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (which is subject to a maximum of one year). All other subsequent changes in 
the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting 
standards. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS3 (2008)  
Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except where a different treatment is mandated  
by another standard.
Investments in joint ventures and associates
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the owning parties have joint control and rights over the net assets of the arrangement.  
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are incorporated using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost 
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint 
venture. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of the joint venture recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is included within the carrying value 
amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value 
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss. Where the Group entity transacts with a joint venture, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the arrangement.
Determining whether joint control exists requires a level of judgement, based upon specific facts and circumstances which exist at the year 
end. Details of the unconsolidated joint ventures are provided in notes 6 and 7.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. 
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint 
control. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are also incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is 
recognised as an intangible asset when control is achieved. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement. Fair 
value measurements are based on provisional estimates and may be subject to amendment within one year of the acquisition, resulting in 
an adjustment to goodwill.
Goodwill itself does not generate independent cash flows and therefore, in order to perform required tests for impairment, it is allocated 
at inception to the specific cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs which are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
On the disposal of a business which includes all or part of a CGU, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit 
or loss on disposal. Where part of a CGU with goodwill is sold, the attributable amount is calculated based on the future discounted cash 
flows leaving the Group as a proportion of the total CGU future discounted cash flows.
The fair values associated with material business combinations are valued by external advisers and any amount of consideration which is 
contingent in nature is evaluated at the end of each reporting period, based on internal forecasts.
Other intangible assets
Material intangible assets are grouped into classes of similar nature and use and separately disclosed. Other intangible assets are 
amortised from the date of completion.
Customer relationships can arise on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represent the incremental value expected to be gained as a result 
of existing contracts in the purchased business. These assets are amortised over the average length of the related contracts.
Licences comprise premiums paid for the acquisition of licences, while franchises represent costs incurred in obtaining franchise rights 
arising on the acquisition of franchises. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective licence or franchise.
Software and IT represent computer systems and processes used by the Group in order to generate future economic value through normal 
business operations. The underlying assets are amortised over the period from which the Group expects to benefit, which is typically 
between three to eight years. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 170 Development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset only if all of certain conditions are met, with all research costs and other 
development expenditure being expensed when incurred. The period of expected benefit, and therefore period of amortisation, is 
typically between three and eight years. The capitalisation criteria are as follows:
• an asset is created that can be separately identified, and which the Group intends to use or sell;
• the finalisation of the asset is technically feasible and the Group has adequate resources to complete its development for use or sale;
• it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
• the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Property, plant and equipment
Assets held for use in the rendering of services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Assets are grouped into classes of similar nature and use and separately disclosed except 
where this is not material.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates designed to reduce the assets to their residual value over their estimated useful lives.
The principal annual rates used are:
Freehold buildings 2.5%
Short leasehold assets The higher of 10% or the rate produced by the lease term
Machinery 15% – 20%
Motor vehicles 10% – 50%
Furniture 10%
Office equipment 20% – 33%
Leased equipment The higher of the rate produced by the lease term or useful life
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. Given that there is limited history of material gains or losses on 
disposal of fixed assets, the level of judgement involved in determining the depreciation rates is not considered to be significant.
Asset impairment 
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets (including goodwill) at each reporting period, together with 
any other assets under the scope of IAS36 Impairment of Assets, in order to assess whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. As the impairment of assets has been identified as both a key source of estimation uncertainty and a critical 
accounting judgement, further details around the specific judgements and estimates can be seen in Note 3.
If any indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine if there is any impairment 
loss. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the 
asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value with reference to pre-tax discount rates that reflect the risks specific to the asset for which 
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount of the asset, the carrying amount is impaired to its recoverable 
amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to 
the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. Where an impairment loss subsequently 
reverses, the carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been 
recognised in prior years. 
Impairment losses and reversals are recognised immediately within administrative expenses within the income statement unless it is 
considered to be an exceptional item.

Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method, 
with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in 
which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and are presented in the SOCI.
Both current and past service costs are the amounts recognised in the income statement, reflecting the expense associated with the 
individuals. Current service cost represents the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities expected to arise from employee 
service in the current period. Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested. Gains and 
losses on curtailments or settlements are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value 
of available refunds (which is only recognised to the extent that the Group has an unconditional right to receive it) and reductions in 
future contributions to the scheme. To the extent that an economic benefit is available as a reduction in future contributions and there is 
a minimum funding requirement required of the Group, the economic benefit available as a reduction in contributions is calculated as the 
present value of the estimated future service cost in each year, less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in respect of 
the future accrual and benefits in that year.
Calculation of the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes requires a 
high level of judgement, as further explained in Note 3. 
Defined benefit obligations arising from contractual obligations
Where the Group takes on a contract and assumes the obligation to contribute variable amounts to the defined benefit pension scheme 
throughout the period of the contract, the Group’s share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the pension scheme assets 
that it will fund over the period of the contract is recognised as a liability at the start of the contract with a corresponding amount being 
recognised as an intangible asset. The intangible asset, which reflects the Group’s right to manage and operate the contract, is amortised 
over the contract period. The Group’s share of the scheme assets and liabilities is calculated by reducing the scheme assets and liabilities 
by a franchise adjustment. The franchise adjustment represents the estimated amount of scheme deficit that will be funded outside the 
contract period. Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Group’s share of pension obligations are recognised within Other 
Comprehensive Income.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange risk and price 
risk, including currency swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity future contracts. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are given in Note 32.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of 
the hedge relationship. The Group designates certain derivatives as either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair 
value hedges) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of firm commitments (cash flow hedges). 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Both at the inception of the hedge 
and on a periodic basis, the Group assesses whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. 
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months 
and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Derivatives, which mature within 12 months, are presented as current 
assets or current liabilities.
Details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes and movements in the hedging and translation reserve in 
equity are detailed in the SOCI and described in Note 32. 
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, 
together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the income statement 
relating to the hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group de-designates the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising 
from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 172 Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in equity are 
reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the 
recognised hedged item. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group de-designates the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense.
Current tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which these items can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of an 
asset and liability in a transaction other than a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group  
is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the  
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based 
upon tax rates and legislation that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is 
also recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority where the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis.
Share based payment
Where the fair value of share options requires the use of a valuation model, fair value is measured by use of Binomial Lattice, Black-
Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme, as set out in Note 37. The expected life used in the models 
has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural 
considerations. Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take account of market conditions applicable to 
the option.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and comprise service spares, parts awaiting installation and work in 
progress for projects undertaken for customers where payment is received on completion. Cost comprises direct materials and, where 
applicable, direct labour costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at cost (being the same as fair value) and subsequently at amortised cost less any provision for 
impairment, to ensure that amounts recognised represent the recoverable amount. 
A provision for impairment arises where there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due, which is achieved by 
creating an allowance for doubtful debts recognised in the income statement within administrative expenses. Determining whether a 
trade receivable is impaired requires judgement to be applied based on the information available at each reporting date. Key indicators 
of impairment include disputes with customers over commercial positions, or where debtors have significant financial difficulties such as 
historic default of payments or information that suggests bankruptcy or financial reorganisation are a reasonable possibility. The majority 
of contracts entered into by the Group are with government organisations and therefore historic levels of default are relatively low and as a 
result the risks associated with this judgement are not considered to be significant. 
When a trade receivable is expected to be uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for doubtful debts. Subsequent recoveries 
of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited against administrative expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition. This definition is also used for the consolidated cash flow statement.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at fair value or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease 
payments determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement, unless 
they are directly attributable to a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on 
borrowing costs (see below).
Total rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the  
relevant lease.
Loans
Loans are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest-rate method. Accrued interest is recorded separately from the associated 
borrowings within current liabilities.
Loans are described as non-recourse loans and classified as such only if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an 
obligation, under a guarantee or other arrangement, to repay the debt.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the 
assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has an obligation to make a cash outflow as a result of a past event. Provisions are measured at 
the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date when settlement is considered to be likely.
Onerous contract provisions (OCPs) arise when the unavoidable costs of meeting contractual obligations exceed the remuneration 
expected to be received. Unavoidable costs include total contract costs together with a rational allocation of shared costs that can be 
directly linked to fulfilling contractual obligations which have been systematically allocated to OCPs on the basis of key cost drivers except 
where this is impracticable, where contract revenue is used as a proxy to activity. The provision is calculated as the lower of the termination 
costs payable for an early exit and the expected net cost to fulfil the Group's unavoidable contract obligations. Where a customer has an 
option to extend a contract and it is likely that such an extension will be made, the expected net cost arising during the extension period, 
is included within the calculation. However, where a profit can be reasonably expected in the extension period, no credit is taken on the 
basis that such profits are uncertain given the potential for the customer to either not extend or offer an extension under lower pricing 
terms. Further details of the judgements can be seen in Note 3.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 174 Net investments in foreign operations
Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations are initially  
recognised in equity and accumulated in the hedging and translation reserve and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal  
of the net investment.
Dividends payable
Dividends are recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are declared, appropriately authorised 
and no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Segmental information
Segmental information is based on internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The CODM is 
considered to be the Board of Directors as a body.
Segmental revenue is analysed on an external basis. Inter-segment revenue is not presented as it is not significant in the context of revenue 
as a whole. Net finance costs are not presented for each operating segment as they are reviewed on a consolidated basis by the CODM. 
Specific corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments. Segment assets comprise goodwill, other intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables (excluding corporation tax recoverable) and any retirement benefit 
asset. Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables and retirement benefit obligations. 
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 above, management has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. As described below, many of 
these areas of judgement also involve a high level of estimation uncertainty.
Prior year restatement: Change in accounting policy
The accounting policy regarding the classification of cost items within cost of sales and administrative expenses was changed in the year. 
Judgement was applied in reaching the conclusion that it provides more relevant financial results to exclude these amounts from the 
underlying transactions of trading operations. Further details are provided in Note 2. 
Use of Alternative Performance Measures: Operating profit before exceptional items
IAS1 requires material items to be disclosed separately in a way that enables users to assess the quality of a company’s profitability.  
In practice, these are commonly referred to as ‘exceptional’ items, but this is not a concept defined by IFRS and therefore there is a level  
of judgement involved in arriving at an Alternative Performance Measure which excludes such exceptional items. We consider items which 
are material and outside of the normal operating practice of the company to be suitable for separate presentation. Further details can be 
seen in Note 11.
The segmental analysis of continuing operations in Note 5 includes the additional performance measure of Trading Profit on continuing 
operations which is reconciled to reported operating profit in that note. The Group uses Trading Profit as an alternative measure to 
reported operating profit by making several adjustments. Firstly, Trading Profit excludes exceptional items, being those we consider 
material and outside of the normal operating practice of the company to be suitable of separate presentation and detailed explanation. 
Secondly, amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisitions are excluded, because these charges are based on 
judgments about the value and economic life of assets that, in the case of items such as customer relationships, would not be  
capitalised in normal operating practice. The CODM reviews the segmental analysis for continuing operations together with  
discontinued operations.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Provisions for onerous contracts
Determining the carrying value of onerous contract provisions requires assumptions and complex judgements to be made about the 
future performance of the Group’s contracts. The level of uncertainty in the estimates made, either in determining whether a provision is 
required, or in the calculation of a provision booked, is linked to the complexity of the underlying contract and the form of service delivery. 
Due to the level of uncertainty and combination of variables associated with those estimates there is a significant risk that there could be 
material adjustment to the carrying amounts of onerous contract provisions within the next financial year.
Major sources of uncertainty which could result in a material adjustment within the next financial year are:
• The ability of the company to maintain or improve operational performance to ensure costs or performance related penalties are in line 
with expected levels.
• Volume driven revenue and costs being within the expected ranges.
• The outcome of matters dependent on the behaviour of the customer, such as a decision to extend a contract where it has the unilateral 
right to do so.
• The outcome of open claims made by or against a customer regarding contractual performance.
• The ability of suppliers to deliver their contractual obligations on time and on budget.
In the current year material revisions have been made to historic provisions, which have led to a charge to contract provisions of £62.0m, 
including £0.5m in relation to new provisions, and releases of £43.4m. Further details are provided in the Finance Review within the 
Strategic Report. All of these revisions have resulted from triggering events in the current year, either through changes in contractual 
positions or changes in circumstances which could not have been reasonably foreseen at the previous balance sheet date. To mitigate 
the level of uncertainty in making these estimates Management regularly compares actual performance of the contracts against previous 
forecasts and considers whether there have been any changes to significant judgements. A detailed bottom up review of the provisions is 
performed as part of the Group’s formal annual budgeting process.
The future range of possible outcomes in respect of those assumptions and significant judgements made to determine the carrying value 
of onerous contracts could result in either a material increase or decrease in the value of onerous contract provisions in the next financial 
year. The extent to which actual results differ from estimates made at the reporting date depends on the combined outcome and timing of 
a large number of variables associated with performance across multiple contracts.
The individual provisions are discounted where the impact is assessed to be significant. Discount rates used are calculated based on the 
estimated risk free rate of interest for the region in which the provision is located and matched against the ageing profile of the provision. 
Rates applied are in the range of 0.72% and 1.95%. 
Investigation by the Serious Fraud Office
In November 2013, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office announced that it had opened an investigation, which remains ongoing, into the Group’s 
Electronic Monitoring Contract. 
We are cooperating fully with the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation but it is not possible to predict the outcome. However, disclosed in 
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties in this Report is a description of the range of possible outcomes in the event that the Serious Fraud 
Office decides to prosecute the individuals and/or the Serco entities involved. This was a critical matter in our assessment of the group’s 
going concern and viability statements and in considering the necessary disclosure of contingent liabilities in Note 31.
Impairment of assets
Identifying whether there are indicators of impairment for assets involves a high level of judgement and a good understanding of the 
drivers of value behind the asset. At each reporting period an assessment is performed in order to determine whether there are any such 
indicators, which involves considering the performance of our business and any significant changes to the markets in which we operate.
We seek to mitigate the risk associated with this judgement by putting in place processes and guidance for the finance community  
and internal review procedures. 
Determining whether assets with impairment indicators require an actual impairment involves an estimation of the expected value in 
use of the asset (or CGU to which the asset relates). The value in use calculation involves an estimation of future cash flows and also the 
selection of appropriate discount rates, both of which involve considerable judgement. The future cash flows are derived from approved 
forecasts, with the key assumptions being revenue growth, margins and cash conversion rates. Discount rates are calculated with reference 
to the specific risks associated with the assets and are based on advice provided by external experts. Our calculation of discount rates are 
performed based on a risk free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to the asset being tested, 
which is subsequently adjusted to factor in local market risks and risks specific to Serco and the asset itself. Discount rates used for internal 
purposes are post tax rates, however for the purpose of impairment testing in accordance with IAS36 Impairment of assets we calculate a 
pre-tax rate based on post tax targets. 
A key area of focus in recent years has been in the impairment testing of goodwill as a result of the pressure on the results of the Group. 
However, no impairment of goodwill was noted in the year ended 31 December 2017.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 176 Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, 
based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits. Recognition has been based on forecast future taxable profits. 
Further details on taxes are disclosed in Note 17.
Current tax
Liabilities for tax contingencies require management judgement and estimates in respect of tax audits and also tax exposures in each 
of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Management is also required to make an estimate of the current tax liability together with an 
assessment of the temporary differences that arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments. Key judgement areas 
include the correct allocation of profits and losses between the countries in which we operate and the pricing of intercompany services. 
Where management conclude that a tax position is uncertain, a current tax liability is held for anticipated taxes that are considered 
probable based on the current information available.
These liabilities can be built up over a long period of time but the ultimate resolution of tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time,  
and given the inherent uncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these exposures, these estimates are prone to change in future periods. 
It is not currently possible to estimate the timing of potential cash outflow, but on resolution, to the extent this differs from the liability 
held, this will be reflected through the tax charge/(credit) for that period. Each potential liability and contingency is revisited on an annual 
basis and adjusted to reflect any changes in positions taken by the company, local tax audits, the expiry of the statute of limitations 
following the passage of time and any change in the broader tax environment.
On the basis of the currently available information, the Group does not anticipate a material change to the estimated liability in the 
short term.
Retirement benefit obligations
Identifying whether the Group has a retirement benefit obligation as a result of contractual arrangements entered into requires a level 
of judgement, largely driven by the legal position held between the Group, the customer and the relevant pension scheme. The Group’s 
retirement benefit obligations and other pension scheme arrangements are covered in Note 33. 
The calculation of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on material key assumptions including discount rates, mortality rates, 
inflation rates and future contribution rates. 
In accounting for the defined benefit schemes, the Group has applied the following principles:
• The asset recognised for the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme is based on the assumption that the full surplus will ultimately be 
available to the Group as a future refund of surplus.
• No foreign exchange item is shown in the disclosures as the non-UK liabilities are not material.
• No pension assets are invested in the Group’s own financial instruments or property.
• Pension annuity assets are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date based on the share of the defined benefit obligation covered 
by the insurance contract.

4. Discontinued operations
The Global Services division, representing private sector BPO operations, was classified as a discontinued operation in 2015 and 2016.  
The most significant part of this business was disposed in 2015, and the disposal of one of the two remaining elements of the offshore 
business was completed in March 2016 and the final element completed in December 2016. The residual UK onshore private sector BPO 
operations were sold or exited in 2016 with the exception of one business consisting of a single contract, where disposal was completed 
in July 2017. Total revenues for the remaining operations were £5.4m and the loss before exceptional items was £0.6m up to the point of 
disposal, therefore the results have been included in continuing operations in 2017 on the grounds of materiality. The final contract was 
sold with no profit or loss on disposal, with a net cash outflow of £0.5m.
The results of the discontinued operations were as follows:
For the year ended 31 December
2016 
£m
Revenue 36.8 
Expenses (40.1)
Operating loss before exceptional items (3.3)

Net loss attributable to discontinued operations presented in the income statement (18.0)
Attributable to:
Equity owners of the Company (18.1)
Non-controlling interests 0.1
Included above are items classified as exceptional as they are considered to be material and outside of the normal course of business. 
These are summarised as follows:

Other exceptional operating items (11.4)
Exceptional operating items arising on discontinued operations (14.2)
In 2016 a charge of £1.1m arose in discontinued operations in relation to the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review. 
This included redundancy payments, provisions and other charges relating to the exit of the UK private sector BPO business, external 
advisory fees and other incremental costs.
A charge of £13.7m arose in 2016 in relation to the movement in the value of indemnities provided on business disposals made in previous 
years. These relate to changes in exchange rates where indemnities were provided in foreign currencies and increases to provisions for 
interest and penalties on any indemnities. There were no changes in the value of these indemnities in 2017.
A charge of £0.4m was incurred in 2016 as a result of early payments to the US Private Placement (USPP) Noteholders following the disposal 
of the offshore private sector BPO business. These charges were treated as exceptional finance costs as they were directly linked to the 
restructuring resulting from the Strategy Review.

5. Segmental information
The Group’s operating segments reflecting the information reported to the Board in 2017 under IFRS8 Operating Segments are as set 
out below. 
Reportable segments Operating segments
UK & Europe Services for sectors including Citizen Services, Defence, Health, Justice & Immigration and 
Transport delivered to UK Government, UK devolved authorities and other public sector customers 
in the UK and Europe;
Americas Services for sectors including Defence, Transport and Citizen Services delivered to US federal and 
civilian agencies, selected state and municipal governments and the Canadian Government;
AsPac Services for sectors including Defence, Justice & Immigration, Transport, Health and Citizen Services 
in the Asia Pacific region including Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong;
Middle East Services for sectors including Defence, Transport and Health in the Middle East region; and
Corporate Central and head office costs.
Each operating segment is focused on a narrow group of customers in a specific geographic region and is run by a local management 
team which report directly to the CODM on a regular basis. As a result of this focus, the sectors in each region have similar economic 
characteristics and are aggregated at the operating segment level in these financial statements. 
During the year two existing divisions, UK Central Government and UK & Europe Local & Regional Government, were merged to form the 
new UK & Europe division (UK&E) with the management team structure and responsibilities altered to match the segment. This note has been 
adjusted to reflect the impact of this, which has been to add together the results of the two former divisions in the comparative period.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in Note 2.

The financial statements of MSHCL are for a period which is different from that of the Group, being for the 52 week period ended  
6 January 2018 (2016: 52 week period ended 7 January 2017). The 52 week period reflects the joint venture’s internal reporting structure 
and is sufficiently close so as to not require adjustment to match that of the Group. The NRHL franchise ended on 31 March 2016, with the 
results reflected in year ended 31 December 2017 reflecting the ongoing post contract negotiations.
Certain employees of the groups headed by AWEML and MSHCL are members of sponsored defined benefit pension schemes. Given the 
significance of the schemes to understanding the position of the entities the following key disclosures are made:

AWEML is not liable for any deficiency in the defined benefit pension scheme under current contractual arrangements. The deficit 
reflected in the financial statements of MSHCL covers only that portion of the deficit that is expected to be funded over the term of the 
franchise arrangement the entity operates under. In addition, the defined benefit position reflects an adjustment in respect of funding 
required to be provided by employees.

8. Acquisitions
On 26 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of BTP Systems, LLC, for consideration of US Dollar $20.5m in cash. 
Further details on this post year-end transaction are provided in Note 40. 
The Group signed a revised Business Purchase Agreement (BPA) on 13 February 2018 with the Special Managers and Provisional Liquidators 
acting on behalf of the relevant Carillion plc subsidiaries to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management contracts. The 
portfolio has annual revenues of approximately £90m and a weighted average remaining term of 14 years. Upon the receipt by the Special 
Managers and Provisional Liquidators of the requisite third party consents, each individual contract will be transferred to Serco on a cash-free, 
debt-free basis, with the consideration to be paid in instalments and to be satisfied using Serco’s existing financing facilities. If all the contracts 
are transferred to Serco under the revised BPA process, the total consideration payable would be £29.7m. The consideration payable is lower 
than the amount of £47.7m announced on 13 December 2017 in respect of substantially the same contracts that were subject to the initial 
BPA signed with Carillion plc at that date. The change in consideration reflects the Group’s re-evaluation of potential liabilities, indemnities, 
warranties and the additional working capital investment required as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The financial effects of this transaction 
have not been recognised at 31 December 2017. As consents are required for each individual contract to be transferred and therefore acquired, 
at the time the financial statements were authorised for issue no legal transfer or control of assets had taken place and so no disclosures have 
been made in respect of the assets and liabilities being acquired. The fair values of the assets and liabilities will be determined at the date when 
contracts are acquired. It is also not yet possible to provide detailed information about each class of acquired receivables and any contingent 
liabilities in respect of the acquired contracts.
On 24 August 2017 the Group acquired 50% of the issued share capital of Serco Sodexo Defence Services Pty Ltd (SSDS) for £1.6m, obtaining 
full control. SSDS was previously a 50% owned joint venture accounted for on an equity accounting basis. The business has a contract with the 
Australian Defence Forces Joint Logistics Command relating to the operation of the Defence Forces national clothing stores and strengthens 
the financial performance of the AsPac division. As a result of the increase in ownership from 50% to 100% the Group fair valued the existing 50% 
shareholding held at £0.2m, with the resulting uplift in value of £0.7m being recorded in Other gains, outside of operating results. The amounts 
recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below:

The net cash inflow as a result of the acquisition was £2.7m, being £3.1m cash acquired less £0.4m consideration paid. 
No acquisition related costs were incurred.
The additional stake in SSDS contributed £3.8m and £0.7m to operating profit before exceptional items in the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2017. Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2017 Group revenue and operating profit before exceptional items for 
the year would have increased by £4.2m and £0.6m respectively, taking total Group revenue to £2,957.8m and total Group operating profit 
before exceptional items to £50.2m.

11. Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items of financial performance that are outside normal operations and are material to the results of the Group either 
by virtue of size or nature. As such, the items set out below require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement to assist in the 
understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. 
Exceptional items arising on discontinued operations are disclosed on the face of the income statement within the loss attributable to 
discontinued operations, of which there are none in 2017 (2016: charge of £3.4m), whereas those arising on continuing operations are 
disclosed on the face of the income statement within exceptional operating items. Further information regarding the exceptional items 
arising on discontinued operations in 2016 can be seen in Note 4.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that there is a risk that it could be impaired. The 
recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (CGU) is based on value in use calculations derived from forecast cash flows based on 
past experience, adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, the Group’s strategy and key risks. These forecasts include an 
estimated level of new business wins and contract attrition and an assumption that the final year forecast continues into perpetuity at a 
CGU specific terminal growth rate. The terminal growth rates are provided by external sources and are based on the long-term inflation 
rates of the geographic market in which the CGUs operate and therefore do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for 
the individual markets.
In 2016, goodwill of £17.8m arose following the acquisition of Orchard & Shipman (Glasgow) Limited, the Group’s subcontractor on  
the COMPASS contract, providing accommodation to asylum seekers in Scotland and Northern Ireland on behalf of the Home Office. 
This goodwill was then immediately impaired as the CGU is forecast to be loss making and therefore the asset cannot be supported. 
The annual impairment testing of CGUs in 2017 has identified no other impairment of goodwill.
The Group is incurring costs in relation to restructuring programmes resulting from the Strategy Review. These costs include redundancy 
payments, provisions, external advisory fees and other incremental costs, including in 2017 £2.8m of intangible asset impairment (2016: 
£nil). Due to the nature and scale of the impact of the transformation phase of the Strategy Review the incremental costs associated with 
this programme are considered to be exceptional. Costs associated with the restructuring programme resulting from the Strategy Review 
must meet the following criteria: that they are directly linked to the implementation of the Strategy Review; they are incremental costs as a 
result of the activity; and they are non-business as usual costs. In 2017, a charge of £28.6m (2016: £17.2m) arose in relation to the restructuring 
programme resulting from the Strategy Review. The Strategy Review is discussed in more detail in the Strategic Report on page 16.  
Non-exceptional restructuring charges are incurred by the business as part of normal operational activity, which in the year totalled £11.1m 
(2016: £6.7m). We expect restructuring costs of approximately £35m to be incurred in 2018 which will be treated as exceptional.
The disposal of the Environmental and Leisure businesses was aborted in 2015 and during 2016 costs related to the aborted transaction 
were finalised, resulting in a charge of £nil (2016: £0.1m).
In 2017, there were exceptional costs totalling £0.4m (2016: £0.1m) associated with the UK Government reviews and the programme of 
Corporate Renewal. These costs were treated as exceptional when the matter first arose and consistent treatment is applied in 2017.
In 2017 there were releases of provisions of £0.4m (2016: £0.6m) which were previously charged through exceptional items in relation to the 
exit of the UK Frontline Clinical Health contracts.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 188 An exceptional charge of £10.7m arose in 2016 in respect of the bulk transfer of a number of employees that are being transferred from 
the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (SPLAS) to the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme. This transfer was legally agreed in 
December 2016 at which point all obligations of SPLAS to pay retirement benefits for these individuals were eliminated and as a result a 
settlement charge of £10.7m arose. In 2017 a new agreement was reached with the UK Government to transfer out the scheme members on 
an individual basis and the 2016 legal and commercial arrangements were cancelled by consent of all parties. As a result of the changes, 
the impact of the transfer was treated as an experience gain adjustment through other comprehensive income and the majority of the 
provision made in 2016 was reversed, resulting in a £10.3m credit to exceptional items. 
In 2016 a review of a joint venture’s cash flow projections led to the impairment of certain equity interests and associated receivables 
balances, totalling £13.9m. The impairment was outside of the normal course of business and of a significant value, and was therefore 
considered to be an exceptional item. In the year ended 31 December 2017 payments of £4.5m were received against the impaired loan. 
The likelihood of further receivables remains uncertain. 
As a result of contracts coming to the end of their natural lives and no significant new contracts being awarded by the customer, the remaining 
customer relationship intangible assets of the DMS Maritime Pty Limited business acquired in 2012 were impaired, totalling £6.1m.
Tax impact of above items
Exceptional tax for the year was a tax charge of £5.0m (2016: £3.1m credit) comprising a £2.3m credit on exceptional items within operating 
profit and a £7.3m charge in respect of other exceptional tax items.
Exceptional costs of £19.6m only gave rise to a credit of £2.3m, as the majority of these costs were incurred in the UK where they only 
impact our unrecognised deferred tax in relation to losses.
The other exceptional tax items relate to two matters, the first is the impact on tax of the pension buy-in disclosed in Note 33 which led to a 
£95.0m reduction in the IFRS valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and consequently a deferred tax charge to the income 
statement of £16.1m. Movements in the valuation of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and the associated deferred tax impact are 
reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (SOCI) and do not flow through the income statement, therefore do not impact profit 
before tax or the tax charge. However, the net amount of deferred tax recognised in the balance sheet relates to both the pension accounting 
and other timing differences, such as recoverable losses. As the net deferred tax balance sheet position is at the level supported by future 
profit forecasts, the decrease in the deferred tax liability associated with the pension scheme (with the benefit reported in the SOCI) leads to 
a corresponding decrease in the deferred tax asset to match the future profit forecasts. Such a reduction in the deferred tax asset therefore 
leads to a charge to tax in the income statement. Where deferred tax charges or releases are the result of movements in the pension scheme 
valuations rather than trading activity, these are excluded from the calculation of tax on underlying profit and the underlying effective tax rate, 
with the prior periods being restated to reflect this. These amounted to £1.9m for 2017 (2016: £nil).
The second element is a credit of £8.8m related to legislative changes in the UK and the US which have impacted the value of deferred 
tax held on the balance sheet. There is a reduction in the deferred tax liability that is held in connection with our US operations of £12.5m, 
as future US tax liabilities are expected to crystallise at lower US tax rates. The fall in future expected US rates is primarily due to the 
enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in December 2017 which reduces the corporate income tax rate in the US from 35% to 21% effective 
from 1 January 2018. In addition, there was a change in UK tax law in 2017. This UK change will reduce the quantum of loss brought forward 
that can be used to offset taxable profits arising in a year, and will also enable losses carried forward in one company to be used to offset 
profits in another. The combined impact of these UK law changes results in a tax charge of £3.7m.

17. Deferred tax continued
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority. The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances 
(after offset) for financial reporting purposes:
2017 
£m 
2016
 £m 
Deferred tax liabilities 20.4 30.5
Deferred tax assets (55.0) (50.8)
(34.6) (20.3)
As at the balance sheet date, the UK has a potential deferred tax asset of £177m (2016: £147m) available for offset against future profits. A 
deferred tax asset has currently been recognised of £17.4m. Recognition has been based on forecast future taxable profits. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining asset (net £160m) based on current forecasts; additional asset recognition is 
contingent on further improvement in the UK profit forecast. In the summer of 2016, UK Government announced a reduction in the UK 
corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% effective from April 2017. Further measures enacted during 2016 cut the rate further from April 2020 
to 17%. These measures have reduced the UK 2017 current tax credit and will reduce the Group's future current tax charge accordingly. 
The deferred tax balance at 31 December 2017 has been calculated reflecting these rates. In addition, the fall in the future expected US 
tax rates due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act in December 2017 has generated a £12.5m deferred tax credit in 2017 due to the 
calculation of the US deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 using these reduced rates.
Losses of £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) expire within 5 years, losses of £0.1m (2016 £0.2m) expire within 6–10 years, losses of £4.1m (2016 £8.6m) expire 
within 20 years and losses of £998.4m (2016 £884.6m) may be carried forward indefinitely.
18. Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share (EPS) have been calculated in accordance with IAS33 Earnings per Share.
The calculation of the basic and diluted EPS is based on the following data:
Number of shares
2017 
millions
2016
 millions
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic EPS 1,089.7 1,088.3
Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Share options 44.9 37.3
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted EPS 1,134.6 1,125.6
At 31 December 2017 options over 236,616 (2016: 246,818) shares were excluded from the weighted average number of shares used for 
calculating diluted earnings per share because their exercise price was above the average share price for the year and they were, therefore, 
anti-dilutive.
Due to the loss making position of the combined continuing and discontinued operations in 2016 and for continuing in 2017, the dilutive 
impact has not been separately disclosed for those measures of profitability.

* Restated based on rates applied in impairment testing in the prior year.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 196 Discount rate
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital have been used in discounting the projected cash 
flows. These rates are reviewed annually with external advisers and are adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the CGU operates. 
Short-term growth rates
The annual impairment test is performed immediately prior to the year end, based initially on five year cash flow forecasts approved by 
senior management. Short-term revenue growth rates used in each CGU five year plan are based on internal data regarding our current 
contracted position, the pipeline of opportunities and forecast growth for the relevant market. 
Short-term profitability and cash conversion is based on our historic experiences and a level of judgement is applied to expected changes 
in both. Where businesses have been poor performers in recent history, turnaround has only been assumed where a detailed and 
achievable plan is in place and all forecasts include cash flows relating to contracts where onerous contract provisions have been made.
Terminal growth rates
The calculations include a terminal value based on the projections for the fifth year of the short-term plan, with a growth rate assumption 
applied which extrapolates the business into perpetuity. The terminal growth rates are based on long-term inflation rates of the 
geographic market in which the CGUs operate and therefore do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual 
markets. These are provided by external sources.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption, a 1% movement in discount rates and a 1% movement in terminal growth 
rates are considered to be reasonably possible. The only CGU impacted by a reasonably possible change in a key assumption is Health 
where a 1% increase in discount rates and a 1% decrease in terminal growth rates would result in an impairment of £4.2m. The breakeven 
point of Health goodwill impairment is a 0.8% increase in discount rate combined with a 0.8% decrease in terminal growth rate. A reduction 
of £2.0m in the terminal year cash flows for the Health CGU would lead to the recoverable amount no longer exceeding the carrying value. 
Any additional reduction in terminal year cash flows would result in an impairment of the goodwill of this CGU.

Total trade and other receivables held by the Group at 31 December 2017 amount to £563.8m (2016: £587.9m).
The Group has a receivables financing facility of £30.0m (2016: £30.0m), which was un-utilised at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 
£7.7m utilised). The unwinding of the facility by £7.7m in 2017 is reflected through a negative working capital movement in the year.
The management of trade receivables is the responsibility of the operating segments, although they report to Group on a monthly basis 
on debtor days, debtor ageing and significant outstanding debts. The average credit period taken by customers is 23 days (2016: 23 days) 
and no interest is charged on overdue amounts.
Each customer has an external credit score which determines the level of credit provided. However, the majority of our customers have 
a sovereign credit rating as a result of being government organisations. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £54.1m 
is due from agencies of the UK Government, the Group’s largest customer, £33.1m from the Australian Government, £47.9m from the 
Government of the United Arab Emirates, and £13.8m from the US Government. There are no other customers who represent more 
than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of 2016, £71.4m was due from agencies of 
the UK Government. The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables at the reporting date is the fair value of trade 
receivables. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
As at 31 December 2017, a total of £1.6m (2016: £2.8m) of trade receivables held by the Group were considered to be impaired. 
Impairments to trade receivables are based on specific estimated irrecoverable amounts and provisions on outstanding balances greater 
than a year old unless there is firm evidence that the balance is recoverable. The total amount of the provision for the Group was £3.6m as 
of 31 December 2017 (2016: £3.6m).

Contract provisions relate to onerous contracts which will be utilised over the life of each individual contract, up to a maximum of 7 years 
from the balance sheet date. The present value of the estimated future cash outflow required to settle the contract obligations as they fall 
due over the respective contracts has been used in determining the provision. The individual provisions are discounted where the impact 
is assessed to be significant. Discount rates used are calculated based on the estimated risk free rate of interest for the region in which 
the provision is located and matched against the ageing profile of the provision. In 2017, additional charges have been made in respect of 
future losses on a number of onerous contracts totalling £62.0m. This increase related to revisions to existing OCPs of £61.5m and a new 
provision raised on one contract totalling £0.5m. 
A full analysis is performed at least annually of the future profitability of all contracts with marginal performances and of the balance sheet 
items directly linked to these contracts. 
Due to the significant size of the balance and the inherent level of uncertainty over the amount and timing of the related cash flows upon 
which onerous contract provisions are based, if the expected operational performance varies from the best estimates made at the year 
end, a material change in estimate may be required. The key drivers behind operational performance is the level of activity required to be 
serviced, which is often directed by the actions of the UK Government, and the efficiency of Group employees and resources. 
Employee related provisions are for long-term service awards and terminal gratuity liabilities which have been accrued and are based on 
contractual entitlement, together with an estimate of the probabilities that employees will stay until retirement and receive all relevant 
amounts. There are also amounts included in relation to restructuring. The provisions will be utilised over various periods driven by local 
legal or regulatory requirements, the timing of which is not certain.
Property provisions relate to leased properties which are either underutilised or vacant and where the unavoidable costs associated 
with the lease exceed the economic benefits expected to be generated in the future. The provision has been calculated based on the 
discounted cash outflow required to settle the lease obligations as they fall due, with the longest running lease ending in April 2039. 
Other provisions are held for indemnities given on disposed businesses, legal and other costs that the Group expects to incur over 
an extended period, in respect of past events. These costs are based on past experience of similar items and other known factors and 
represent management’s best estimate of the likely outcome and will be utilised with reference to the specific facts and circumstances, 
with the majority expecting to be settled by 31 December 2021.

The Company has guaranteed overdrafts, finance leases, and bonding facilities of its joint ventures and associates up to a maximum value 
of £4.3m (2016: £20.4m). The actual commitment outstanding at 31 December 2017 was £4.3m (2016: £17.9m).
The Company and its subsidiaries have provided certain guarantees and indemnities in respect of performance and other bonds,  
issued by its banks on its behalf in the ordinary course of business. The total commitment outstanding as at 31 December 2017  
was £227.1m (2016: £252.1m). 
As we have disclosed before, we are under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. In November 2013, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office 
announced that it had opened an investigation, which remains ongoing, into the Group’s Electronic Monitoring Contract. 
We are cooperating fully with the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation but it is not possible to predict the outcome. However, disclosed in 
the Principal Risks and Uncertainties in this Report is a description of the range of possible outcomes in the event that the Serious Fraud 
Office decides to prosecute the individuals and/or the Serco entities involved.
The Group is aware of other claims and potential claims which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group. The Directors 
are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received and the Group’s insurance arrangements, that it is unlikely that these matters will, 
in aggregate, have a material effect on the Group’s financial position.
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 206 32. Financial risk management
32 (a) Fair value of financial instruments
i) Hierarchy of fair value
The classification of the fair value measurement falls into three levels, based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.  
The levels are as follows:
Level 1:  Inputs derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:   Inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability,  
either directly or indirectly.
Level 3:  Inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Based on the above, the derivative financial instruments held by the Group at 31 December 2017 and the comparison fair values for  
loans and finance leases, are all considered to fall into Level 2. Market prices are sourced from Bloomberg and third party valuations.  
The valuation models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves. There have 
been no transfers between levels in the year.

The Directors estimate that the carrying amounts of cash, trade receivables and trade payables approximate to their fair value due to the 
short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair values of loans and finance lease obligations are based on cash flows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate 
associated with the liability.
The fair value of derivatives is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach applying discount factors derived from observable market 
data to actual and estimated future cash flows. Credit risk is considered in the calculation of these fair values.
ii) Fair value of derivative financial instruments
The fair valuation of derivative financial instruments results in a net asset of £12.8m (2016: net assets of £18.5m) comprising non-current 
assets of £3.7m (2016: £14.2m), current assets of £10.3m (2016: £4.9m), current liabilities of £1.1m (2016: £0.6m) and non-current liabilities of 
£0.1m (2016: £nil).

The fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss is £1.1m (2016: £0.6m) and relates to derivatives that are not 
designated in hedge accounting relationships. The fair value of the derivatives and their credit risk adjusted fair value are not materially 
different, and are approximately equal to the amount contractually payable at maturity due to the short tenor of the instruments. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 208 32 (b) Financial risk
The Board is ultimately responsible for ensuring that financial and non-financial risks are monitored and managed within acceptable and 
known parameters. The Board delegates authority to the executive team to manage financial risks. The Group’s treasury function acts as 
a service centre and operates within clearly defined guidelines and policies that are approved by the Board. The guidelines and policies 
define the financial risks to be managed, specify the objectives in managing these risks, delegate responsibilities to those managing the 
risks and establish a control framework to regulate treasury activities to minimise operational risk.
32 (c) Liquidity risk

On 31 March 2016, £368m of the Group’s £480m revolving credit facility was extended to April 2020. The remaining £112m matures  
in April 2019. 
In addition to the banking facility the Group has outstanding US private placements of £260.7m (2016: £290.2m) which will be repaid as 
bullet repayments between 2018 and 2024. 
In addition to the bank and private placement facilities the Group has a £30.0m receivables financing facility (2016: £30.0m) of which £nil 
(2016: £7.7m) was drawn at year end. 
ii) Maturity of financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities will be settled on both a net and a gross basis over the remaining period between the balance sheet date 
and the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows based on the earliest date on

32 (d) Foreign exchange risk
i) Transactional
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts to fix the functional currency 
value of non-functional currency cash flows. At 31 December 2017, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary 
assets or liabilities, firm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions. 
ii) Translational
Where possible the Group will raise external funding to match the currency profile of its foreign operations, in order to mitigate translation 
exposure. If matched funding is not possible, currency derivatives may be used to protect against movements in foreign exchange. 
iii) Hedge accounting
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments 
in foreign operations. Detail the Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS39 can be 
seen in Note 2. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges against $69.5m of the US Dollar private 
placements. Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling. 
The profile of these cross currency swaps held by the Group in the current and prior year is as follows:

The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. These derivatives are hedging highly

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 210 All derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and as at 31 December 2017 a net fair value loss of £0.7m (2016: £0.5m) 
has been deferred in the hedging reserve. During the course of the year to 31 December 2017, £0.1m (2016: £3.4m) of fair value gains were 
transferred to the hedging reserve and £0.2m (2016: £1.1m) reclassified to the consolidated income statement.
The Group has entered into a net investment hedge. This uses a portion of the USD denominated loans payable as a hedging instrument 
against movements in the value of the assets and liabilities of Serco North America (Holdings), Inc. All loans payable are recorded at 
amortised cost, and movements in value due to foreign exchange in the portion designated as hedging instruments are taken to reserves. 
The value of loans used in the hedging relationship at 31 December 2017 was £151.8m (2016: £nil).
iv) Currency sensitivity
The Group’s currency exposures in respect of monetary items at 31 December 2017 that result in net currency gains and losses in the 
income statement and equity arise principally from movement in US Dollar and Euro exchange rates. The impact of a 10% movement  
is summarised below:

32 (e) Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to minimise the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings to provide an appropriate level of certainty to cost  
of funds. Exposure to interest rate risk arises principally on changes to US Dollar and Sterling interest rates.

Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated through the issuance of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate derivatives.  
Excluded from the above analysis is £20.2m (2016: £28.2m) of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed  
rates of interest. 
ii) Interest rate sensitivity
The effect of a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR rates on the net financial liability position at the balance sheet date, with all other 
variables held constant, would have resulted in an increase in pre-tax profit for the year to 31 December 2017 of £1.0m (2016: £1.7m).

32 (f) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty could default on its contractual obligations. In this regard, the Group’s principal exposure  
is to cash and cash equivalents, derivative transactions and trade receivables. 
The Group’s trade receivables credit risk is relatively low given that a high proportion of our customer base are Government bodies  
with strong sovereign, or sovereign like, credit ratings. However, where the assessed credit worthiness of a customer, Government  
or non-government, falls below that considered acceptable, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate against the risk of contractual 
default using instruments such as credit guarantees. The Group’s credit risk on loans receivable is relatively low. The balance is comprised 
of a single loan, which was subject to a fair value assessment by an independent specialist in 2016. This assessment included the 
determination of a synthetic credit rating of the issuer, using industry-standard methodology. We monitor the results and financial position 
of the issuer on an annual basis to determine whether the risk of default has changed, and therefore whether the assumptions used in the 
valuation remain appropriate. 
The Group’s treasury function only transacts with counterparties that comply with Board policy. The credit risk is measured by way of a 
counterparty credit rating from any two recognised rating agencies. Pre-approved limits are set based on a rating matrix and exposures 
monitored accordingly. The Group also employs the use of set-off rights in some agreements.
The Group’s policy is to provide guarantees for joint ventures and associates only to the relevant proportion of support provided by the 
partners. At 31 December 2017, the Company has issued guarantees in respect of certain joint ventures and associates as per Note 31.
32 (g) Capital risk 
The Board’s objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Group’s strategic objectives, including but not limited to 
reshaping the portfolio through mergers, acquisitions and disposals. In doing so the Board seeks to manage funding and liquidity risk, 
optimise shareholder return and maintain an implied investment grade credit position. This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
The Board reviews and approves at least annually a treasury policy document which covers, inter alia, funding and liquidity risk, capital 
structure and risk management. This policy details targets for committed funding headroom, diversification of committed funding and 
debt maturity profile. 
The Group plans to maintain sufficient funds and distributable reserves to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders.

33 (a) Defined benefit schemes
i) Characteristics and risks
The Group contributes to defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and Europe. The normal 
contributions expected to be paid during the financial year ending 31 December 2018 are £7.1m (2017: £9.7m). 
Among our non-contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme (SPLAS). The most recent full 
actuarial valuation of this scheme was undertaken as at 5 April 2015 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of £4.0m for funding 
purposes. Pension obligations are valued separately for accounting and funding purposes and there is often a material difference between 
these valuations. As at 31 December 2017 the estimated actuarial deficit of SPLAS was £33.7m (2016: £42.6m) based on the actuarial 
assessment on the funding basis whereas the accounting valuation resulted in an asset of £41.8m. The primary reason a difference arises 
is that pension scheme accounting requires the valuation to be performed on the basis of a best estimate whereas the funding valuation 
used by the trustees makes more prudent assumptions. A revised schedule of contributions for SPLAS was agreed during the year, with 
29% of pensionable salaries due to be paid from 1 November 2017 to 31 October 2018 and 28% from 1 November 2018 to 18 December 
2022. An additional shortfall contribution of £1.0m is due by 30 April 2018 and four further payments of £0.5m payable at the end of each 
April through to 2022. 
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 212 The assets of funded schemes are held independently of the Group’s assets in separate trustee administered schemes. The trustees of each 
pension scheme are required by law to act in the interest of the scheme and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the 
pension fund are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the scheme. The Group’s major schemes are valued by 
independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method for accounting purposes. This reflects service rendered 
by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions including: discount rates to determine the present value of 
benefits; projected rates of salary growth; and life expectancy of pension plan members. Discount rates are based on the market yields of 
high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned. Pension assets and liabilities in the different defined benefit schemes are not offset.
The schemes typically expose the Group to risks that impact the financial performance and position of the Group and may affect the 
amount and timing of future cash flows. The key risks are set out below:  
• Investment risk. The schemes hold assets with which to discharge the future liabilities of these schemes. Any decline in the value of 
these investments directly impacts on the ability of the scheme to meet its commitments and could require the Group to fund this 
shortfall in future years. As a result of the SPLAS’s investment strategy, which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to 
liabilities, 45% of the scheme’s assets are annuity policies and 55% are Liability Driven Investments (LDIs). The annuity policies result in 
an insurer funding the future benefit payments to the relevant members and therefore eliminate the risk of changes in the future value 
of the benefits to the scheme. The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with inflation 
and interest swap overlays and are therefore linked to the key drivers of the schemes’ liabilities. The value of these investments vary 
in line with gilt yields, which has decreased from 2.65% p.a. to 2.53% p.a. during 2017 resulting in a decrease in these assets. SPLAS 
previously identified an investment strategy consisting of Multi-Asset Absolute Return (MAAR), Buy and Maintain credit (B&M) and LDI. 
SPLAS began to wind down its previous investment strategy in late 2016, with assets transferred to a passive LDI portfolio managed by 
BlackRock, over the course of late 2016 and early 2017. This ensures that the scheme remains protected against changes to interest rates 
and long term inflation expectations, with the funding level therefore being relatively stable. As explained in section (a) ii), in the first 
half of 2017 the Trustee secured a buy-in of the majority of the pensioner members, resulting in a significant de-risking of the scheme’s 
position, which has provided a secure match of that significant proportion of the scheme’s liabilities. Since the buy-in was completed 
the scheme has been developing a revised investment strategy which will aim to invest in private debt instead of MAAR to enable the 
scheme to reach full funding on the self sufficiency basis within an acceptable time period.
• Interest risk. The present value of the defined benefit schemes’ liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference 
to high quality corporate bond yields and therefore a decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the scheme liability. This will be 
partially offset by an increase in the return of the plan’s debt investments. 
• Longevity risk. The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of 
plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the 
plan’s liability. 
• Salary risk. The present value of the defined benefit scheme liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants, 
as such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.
The defined benefit schemes are grouped together as follows:
• Contract specific. These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes. The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the 
pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts as defined by the contract and scheme rules. At rebid, any deficit or surplus 
would be expected to transfer to the next contractor. At the start of these relevant contracts the Group recognised the defined benefit 
obligation less the fair value of scheme assets with a corresponding amount recognised as an intangible asset. Subsequent actuarial 
gains and losses in relation to the Group’s share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the SOCI. The intangible assets 
are amortised over the initial term of the contracts with none remaining at the current or prior year end. Where the relevant scheme 
has a deficit which is not required to be fully funded by Group an adjustment is made to limit the amount recognised in the Group’s 
balance sheet by way of a ‘franchise adjustment’. Under contractual arrangements the Group sponsors a section of an industry wide 
defined benefit scheme, the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), paying contributions in accordance with a Schedule of Contributions. 
There is no residual liability to fund a deficit at the end of the franchise period and any costs are shared 60% by the employer and 40% 
by the members. The Group also makes contributions under Admitted Body status to a number of sections of the Local Government 
Pension Scheme for the period to the end of the relevant customer contracts. The Group will only participate in the Local Government 
Pension Schemes for a finite period up to the end of the contracts. The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the 
respective Scheme Actuary and as detailed in each scheme’s Schedule of Contributions. In addition, the Group may be required to pay 
some or all of any deficit (as determined by the respective Scheme Actuary) that is remaining at the end of the contract. In respect of 
this, the Group recognises a sufficient level of provision in these financial statements based on the IAS19 valuation at the reporting date 
and contractual obligations.
• Non-contract specific. These do not relate to any specific contract and consist of two pre-funded defined benefit schemes and an 
unfunded defined benefit scheme. Any liabilities arising are recognised in full and the liabilities in relation to unfunded scheme amount 
to £0.4m (2016: £0.2m). The unfunded scheme is the only non-UK scheme in which the Group participates. The funding policy for the 
pre-funded schemes is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected 
salary basis. One of these schemes is SPLAS and the other is a non-contract specific section of the RPS.

ii) Events in the year
In June 2017 the Trustees of SPLAS entered into a bulk annuity purchase whereby an insurer will fund future benefit payments to the 
relevant members, commonly referred to as a “buy-in”. The liability to pay the members remains with SPLAS and therefore the pension 
scheme will continue to include the relevant pension liabilities. However, an insurance asset is held at fair value, which, in line with IAS19 for 
qualifying insurance policies, is deemed to be equal to the present value of the related obligations. This removes the risk of longevity and 
investment movements for this portion of the scheme on a funding basis, and also removes the accounting risk of movements in underlying 
assumptions on the liabilities. Of the total remeasurements recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income in the year ended 
31 December 2017 of £106.5m, £95.0m related to the revaluation of the assets and liabilities as a result of this transaction. Whilst the impact 
substantially reduced the asset on an IAS19 valuation basis, on an actuarial basis the transaction decreased the deficit of the scheme by 
approximately £12m. As a result of the transaction, the scheme also exited a longevity swap arrangement early, at a cost borne by the 
scheme of £7.5m.
In 2016, certain active former members of SPLAS on a specific contract were transferred back to a Government backed pension scheme 
they had previously been members of. This resulted in contribution savings due to lower rates required under the Government Serco 
scheme and a curtailment gain of £1.9m was recognised in 2016. In 2017 certain of these deferred members transferred their accrued 
benefits from SPLAS to the Government scheme. The arrangements for this process had been made by a planned transfer on a bulk 
basis, which resulted in settlement accounting being applied in 2016 and an exceptional charge booked at the time. However, it was 
subsequently agreed that the Government would allow the transfer of members on an individual basis and as the members are taking 
an existing option to take an individual transfer out of the scheme, settlement accounting was no longer applicable following the 
change of arrangements in 2017. The impact of the individuals transferring out is now treated as a change in actuarial assumptions and 
impacts on reserves, not through the income statement. The remaining provision of £10.3m was therefore reversed through exceptional 
items in 2017. The impact of the transfer resulted in a charge to other comprehensive income of £5.1m, included within the effect of 
experience assumptions. 
In November 2017 certain members of SPLAS agreed to transfer their active membership to defined contribution schemes and a 
curtailment gain of £2.0m is recognised in the year in the Group’s income statement.

The SPLAS Trust Deed gives the Group an unconditional right to a refund of surplus assets, assuming the full settlement of plan liabilities 
in the event of a plan wind-up. As such, the Group recognises the surplus of scheme assets over liabilities on the balance sheet.
As required by IAS19, the Group has considered the extent to which the pension plan assets should be classified in accordance with the 
fair value hierarchy of IFRS13. Virtually all equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets. Annuity policies and property 
assets can be classified as Level 3 instruments, and LDIs are classified as Level 2.

Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 218 v) Actuarial assumptions: SPLAS
The assumptions set out below are for SPLAS, which reflects 92% of total liabilities and 94% of total assets of the defined benefit pension 
scheme in which the Group participates. The significant actuarial assumptions with regards to the determination of the defined benefit 
obligation are set out below. 
The average duration of the benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period is 17.9 years (2016: 17.7 years).

Sensitivity analysis is provided below, based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting 
period, assuming all other assumptions are held constant. The sensitivities have been derived in the same manner as the defined benefit 
obligation as at 31 December 2017 where the defined benefit obligation is estimated using the Projected Unit Credit method. Under this 
method each participant’s benefits are attributed to years of service, taking into consideration future salary increases and the scheme’s 
benefit allocation formula. Thus, the estimated total pension to which each participant is expected to become entitled at retirement is 
broken down into units, each associated with a year of past or future credited service. The defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 
2017 is calculated on the actuarial assumptions agreed as at that date. The sensitivities are calculated by changing each assumption in 
turn following the methodology above with all other things held constant. The change in the defined benefit obligation from updating the 
single assumption represents the impact of that assumption on the calculation of the defined benefit obligation.

Management acknowledges that the method used of presuming that all other assumptions remaining constant has inherent limitation 
given that it is more likely for a combination of changes, but highlights the value of each individual risk and is therefore a suitable basis  
for providing this analysis.
Assumptions in respect of the expected return on scheme assets are required when calculating the franchise adjustment for the contract-
specific plans. These assumptions are based on market expectations of returns over the life of the related obligation. Due consideration 
has been given to current market conditions as at 31 December 2017 in respect to inflation, interest, bond yields and equity performance 
when selecting the expected return on assets assumptions.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates is derived from their market value. The yield on equity investments 
contains an additional premium (an ‘equity risk premium’) to compensate investors for the additional anticipated risks of holding this type 
of investment, when compared to bond yields. The Group applies an equity risk premium of 4.6% (2016: 4.6%). 
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns for the principal asset categories held 
by the scheme.

33 (b) Defined contribution schemes
The Group paid employer contributions of £75.0m (2016: £73.9m) into UK and other defined contribution schemes and foreign state  
pension schemes.
Serco accounts for certain pre-funded defined benefit schemes relating to contracts as defined contribution schemes because the 
contributions are fixed until the end of the current concession and at rebid any surplus or deficit would transfer to the next contractor.  
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.

Executive Option Plan (EOP)
Options granted under the EOP may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of a financial 
performance target over three years. The options are granted at market value and awards made to eligible employees are based on 
between 50% and 100% of salary as at 31 December prior to grant. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the 
date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
Details of the movement in all EOP options are as follows:

Of these options, 92,540 (2016: 92,540) were exercisable at the end of the year, with a weighted average exercise price of £4.16 (2016: £4.16).
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average contractual life of 0.87 years (2016: 1.87 years). 
The exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 December 2017 ranged from £3.88 to £4.55 (2016: £3.88 to £4.55).
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise approximates to the weighted average share price during the year, which was 
£1.17 (2016: £1.13).
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial Lattice model. The Binomial Lattice model is 
considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time 
between the vesting date and the expiry date. There were no new options granted under Executive Option Plan during the year and all 
shares are now vested. 
Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
Awards made to eligible employees under the above schemes are structured as options with a zero exercise price. The extent to which an 
award vests (and therefore becomes exercisable) is measured by reference to the growth in the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) or total 
shareholder return (TSR) over the performance period or service period conditions.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire. Furthermore, options may be forfeited 
if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest. Details of the movement in all LTIS and LTIP options are as follows:

average contractual life of nil years (2016: 0.65 years).
There were no new options granted under either LTIS or LTIP during the year.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Under the PSP, eligible employees have been granted options with an exercise price of two pence. Awards vest after the performance 
period of three to five years and are subject to the achievement of four performance measures with the exception of new non-performance 
awards granted in 2014. These non-performance options are only subject to continued employment on vesting dates which vary from six 
months to three years after the grant dates. 
On the performance related awards, the primary performance measure is TSR and the second performance measure is based  
on EPS growth. Two additional measures on new grants in 2014 were Absolute Share Price and Strategic Objectives.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.

Of these options, 1,040,066 (2016: 133,470) were exercisable at the end of the year. The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a 
weighted average contractual life of 7.7 years (2016: 7.5 years).
In the year, ten grants were made, of which five were non-performance conditional share awards and two non-performance nominal share 
awards. The remaining three performance based awards are with Earnings per Share (EPS), Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on 
Invested Capital (ROIC) performance conditions each attached to 33.3% of options. The options subject to market-based performance 
conditions (such as the TSR condition for these awards), were valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation model. The options subject only to 
non-market based performance conditions (such as the EPS and ROIC conditions) a Black-Scholes model has been used. This approach 
has also been used for the Awards made with no performance conditions attached to them. 
The Monte Carlo Simulation model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under schemes where there are 
changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured, such as for the Absolute Share Price or TSR based awards.
The Monte Carlo and Black-Scholes Models used the following inputs::
2017
Weighted average share price £1.161
Weighted average exercise price £0.02
Expected volatility 44.8%
Expected life 3 years
Risk free rate 0.184%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
The weighted average fair value of options granted under this scheme in the year is £0.99 (2016: £0.89).
Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 222 Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
Under the DBP, eligible employees are entitled to use up to 50% of their earned annual bonus to purchase shares in the Group at market 
price. Provided they remain in employment for this period, the shares are retained for that period and the performance measures have 
been met, the Group will make a matching share award, up to a maximum of two times the gross bonus deferred.

None of these options were exercisable at the end of the year (2016: none). The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted 
average contractual life of 1.6 years (2016: 2.1 years).
There were 2,549,262 new options granted under the Deferred Bonus Plan in the year, with 100% of the deferred bonus subject to the same 
EPS performance conditions as the PSP. 
The portion subject to EPS performance conditions was deemed to have a fair value equal to their face value less the present value of any 
dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years.  
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

2017
Weighted average share price £1.20
Weighted average exercise price Nil
Expected volatility 43.9%

Of these options, none (2016: none) were exercisable at the end of the year. There were no outstanding options at 31 December 2017 
(2016: none). Given that options granted under the Sharesave plan can be exercised at any time after vesting, management consider the 
Binomial Lattice model to be appropriate to value the options granted under this scheme. The Binomial Lattice model allows exercise over 
a window in time, from vesting date to expiry date and assumes option holders make economically rational exercise decisions.
There were no new options granted under Sharesave Plan in the year.

On 26 January 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of BTP Systems, LLC (BTP), for consideration of US Dollar 
$20.5m/£14.5m in cash. BTP provides satellite communications (SATCOM), radar modernization, operations and maintenance and 
sustainment services that enable customers to extend the lives of existing systems and achieve phased upgrades with new technology 
to enhance operational capability. BTP specializes in areas including obsolescence engineering, systems engineering services, test 
equipment and design, and field engineering services, and maintains a near-field and compact antenna test range at their Ludlow, MA 
headquarters. BTP's expertise spans shipboard and submarine SATCOM antenna systems, MILSTAR command post antennas and radar 
antennas. No acquisition related costs were incurred. The acquisition is expected to increase the Group’s market share. The financial 
results and impact of this transaction have not been recognised in these Consolidated Financial Statements, the operating results, assets 
and liabilities will be recognised with effect from 26 January 2018.

The Group signed a revised Business Purchase Agreement (BPA) on 13 February 2018 with the Special Managers and Provisional 
Liquidators acting on behalf of the relevant Carillion plc subsidiaries to acquire a portfolio of selected UK health facilities management 
contracts. The portfolio has annual revenues of approximately £90m and a weighted average remaining term of 14 years. Upon the receipt 
by the Special Managers and Provisional Liquidators of the requisite third party consents, each individual contract will be transferred to 
Serco on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with the consideration to be paid in instalments and to be satisfied using Serco’s existing financing 
facilities. If all the contracts are transferred to Serco under the revised BPA process, the total consideration payable would be £29.7m. The 
consideration payable is lower than the amount of £47.7m announced on 13 December 2017 in respect of substantially the same contracts 
that were subject to the initial BPA signed with Carillion plc at that date. The change in consideration reflects the Group’s re-evaluation of 
potential liabilities, indemnities, warranties and the additional working capital investment required as a result of Carillion’s liquidation. The 
financial effects of this transaction have not been recognised at 31 December 2017. As consents are required for each individual contract to 
be transferred and therefore acquired, at the time the financial statements were authorised for issue, no legal transfer or control of assets 
had taken place and so no disclosures have been made in respect of the assets and liabilities being acquired. The fair values of the assets 
and liabilities will be determined at the date when contracts are acquired. It is also not yet possible to provide detailed information about 
each class of acquired receivables and any contingent liabilities in respect of the acquired contracts.

41. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and have been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year. 
Basis of accounting
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 (Financial Reporting Standard 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. The Company has not presented its own profit and loss 
account as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The total loss for the year was £9.7m (2016: £39.8m), and loss in total 
comprehensive income for the year was a loss of £2.9m (2016: loss of £61.6m).
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash-flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis and on the going concern basis, except for the revaluation of 
certain financial instruments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the goods 
and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, 
except as noted below. 
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
