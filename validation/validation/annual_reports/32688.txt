On 1 December 2017, Redefine 
International P.L.C. changed its 
name to RDI REIT P.L.C.
Although you may see some changes in 
branding, this Annual Report is dated 
26 October 2017, before our change in 
name became effective. The Company’s 
name referenced throughout therefore 
remains Redefine International P.L.C. 
Our new brand, short for Real Estate 
Diversified Income REIT, provides a solid 
platform for the delivery of superior, 
sustainable and growing income for our 
shareholders. The move is synonymous 
with our intention to become the UK’s 
leading income focused REIT.
More than just a change of name, the 
RDI REIT brand is a demonstration of 
our unique approach to real estate 
investment. Through our relentlessly 
inquisitive nature, tenacity and creativity 
we realise and add value that others miss.
Real estate, redefined. Redefine International is a diversified  
FTSE 250 UK-REIT committed to becoming 
the UK’s leading income focused REIT. 
Our income-led business model and strategic  
priorities are designed to offer shareholders  
superior , sustainable and growing income returns.

Annual Report 2017 04
Strategic report
2017 has been a year of heightened global 
and political uncertainty and prospects of 
continued volatility across markets. In a 
world where change is happening at an 
ever‑increasing pace, our strategy to be the 
UK’s leading income focused REIT is well 
placed. I am therefore pleased to report 
another solid set of results, with underlying 
earnings per share at 2.75 pence, in line with 
recent guidance and EPRA NAV per share up 
3.5 per cent to 41.4 pence.
Results and dividend
Underlying earnings increased by 7.6 per 
cent to £49.8 million (2016: £46.3 million). 
Underlying earnings per share are in line with 
guidance at 2.75 pence and form the base 
from which we will grow income in line with 
our medium‑term growth target of 3.0 to 
5.0 per cent per annum.
EPRA NAV increased by 3.5 per cent to 
41.4 pence per share (2016: 40.0 pence per 
share) supported by a 3.0 per cent like‑for‑like 
increase in the value of the Group’s portfolio. 
The Board has declared a second interim 
dividend of 1.3 pence per share taking 
dividends declared for the full year to 
2.6 pence per share. The full year dividend 
reflects a pay-out ratio of 94.5 per cent 
of underlying earnings, delivering on our 
strategic priority of distributing superior 
income returns which are fully covered 
by underlying earnings and aligned with 
operating cash flow. The total dividend for 
the year of 2.6 pence per share reflects a 
6.3 per cent yield on EPRA NAV, over 50 per 
cent higher than the UK‑REIT average of 
4.1 per cent.
Strategic priorities
In February 2017 we held an inaugural Capital 
Markets Day and set out the Company’s 
strategic priorities which have the goal of 
delivering superior, sustainable and growing 
income returns. Following a period of 
significant growth and transactional activity 
these priorities underline our ongoing 
ambition to become the UK’s leading  
income focused REIT. 
Our initial earnings target of 2.7 to 2.8 pence 
per share has been achieved and in only six 
months we have made material progress in 
improving the quality of the portfolio so as to 
deliver long‑term sustainable income returns 
and enhanced growth prospects.
Scalable business
There are a number of long-term benefits 
associated with greater scale, including greater 
access to capital markets and liquidity, a lower 
cost of capital, overhead efficiencies and 
operational flexibility. However, these benefits 
will remain secondary to securing the right 
income focused investment opportunities for 
our shareholders. 
The acquisition of a further 32.8 per cent 
stake in International Hotel Properties Limited 
(“IHL”) by way of a scheme of arrangement, 
as announced in August 2017, will result in the 
issuance of approximately 45.9 million new 
Redefine International shares. In addition, 
the Company will reach agreement later 
today to acquire a further 5.0 million shares 
(representing an 8.9 per cent stake) in IHL 
from Redefine Properties on the same terms 
as the scheme of arrangement. 12.5 million 
new Redefine International shares will be

issued	in	consideration	(representing	0.7 per	
cent of the current issued share capital). 
The completion	of	these	two	transactions	will	
result in the Group’s overall interest in IHL 
increasing	to	58.9	per	cent.	IHL	will	be	delisted	
and	the	portfolio	will	be	managed	as	part	
of the Group’s existing hotel portfolio. Last 
valued at £104.4 million, the assets include 
the	Hampton	By	Hilton	at	Gatwick	Airport,	
the Holiday Inn Express, Edinburgh and 
four Travelodge hotels providing long‑ dated 
uncapped CPI‑ linked income. The acquisition 
is expected to provide a yield on equity of over 
10	per	cent	which	will	be	earnings	enhancing	
and provide exposure to assets demonstrating 
strong trading performance. This acquisition 
clearly demonstrates our ambition to increase 
scale through investing in the right earnings 
enhancing opportunities.
Income focused portfolio
Our strategic priority to improve our 
portfolio’s exposure to more resilient property 
fundamentals supports our target to deliver 
secure,	sustainable	and	growing	income.	
Our investment	philosophy	is	simple;	we	look	
to invest in and extract value from assets 
which	can	deliver	consistent	and	growing	
income	returns.	Equally,	we	look	to	recycle	
capital from assets providing limited further 
rental	and/or	capital	growth	expectations,	
where	business	plans	have	been	successfully	
executed and value creation maximised.
It has been a productive year in terms of 
both investment and disposal activity. Over 
£148 million	was	generated	from	asset	sales	at	
a	premium	of	12.2	per	cent	to	book	value	with	
a further £11.0 million sold post year end. 
The disposals completed during the year are 
testament to our strategy as set out above. 
These	actions,	combined	with	disciplined	
reinvestment, are continuously improving 
the quality of the portfolio and its ability to 
deliver	long‑term	sustainable	and	growing	
income returns.
The Company is at advanced stages of 
negotiation on the sale of a portfolio of 
German retail assets for approximately 
€200 million.	The	sale	would	include	the	
repayment of associated debt facilities. 
This opportunistic	disposal	capitalises	on	an	
exceptionally strong investment market and 
an approximate 17 per cent increase in the 
value of the Euro relative to Sterling over the 
investment period.
The Company intends to recycle the disposal 
proceeds	into	new	investments	which	
are	in	line	with	the	Company’s	strategy	of	
enhancing the quality of the portfolio and its 
growth	prospects.	A	number	of	investment	
opportunities	have	been	identified	which	
are at various stages of due diligence. In 
particular, the Company is currently in 
exclusive negotiations to acquire a portfolio of 
high	quality	assets	in	the	UK	which,	if	acquired,	
would	utilise	the	majority	of	the	disposal	
proceeds. The income yield is expected to be 
commensurate	with	the	yield	achieved	on	the	
disposal and likely to be accretive to investors 
over	the	medium	term.	However,	there	
can be no guarantee that such acquisition 
will	proceed	to	completion,	and	a	further	
announcement	will	be	made	by	the	Company,	
as appropriate, in due course.
Our relentless focus on maximising income 
delivered from the portfolio is evidenced 
by the continued high level of occupancy 
achieved at 97.7 per cent (2016: 97.7 per cent). 
235	leasing	events	were	completed	during	
the	year	reflecting	a	3.9	per	cent	(£0.6	million)	
increase on passing rent and a 0.7 per cent 
increase on ERV. Excluding temporary leases, 
gross annualised rental income increased by 
5.0 per cent and 4.9 per cent on passing rent 
and ERV respectively. 
The redevelopment and expansion of existing 
assets remains an important part of our 
strategy to enhance the quality of the portfolio 
and deliver attractive income returns on 
marginal investment. Capital expenditure 
during	the	year	totalled	£19.6	million	with	
current	capital	projects	anticipated	to	provide	
a 7.6 per cent yield on cost.
Efficient capital structure
We are focused on further strengthening the 
balance	sheet	by	mitigating	refinancing	risk	
and	efficiently	reducing	leverage,	whilst	also	
limiting the impact on income. 
The Group’s loan‑ to‑ value ratio of 50.0 per 
cent,	reflecting	transactions	post	year	end,	
is at the top end of our medium‑ term target 
of 45 to 50 per cent. The acquisition of a 
further 44.0 per cent interest in the Leopard 
portfolio during the second half of the year 
raised leverage temporarily above 50 per cent 
but this has been largely addressed through 
successful disposals and the acquisition of the 
controlling interest in the IHL hotel portfolio 
post year end. 
Our investment 
philosophy is simple; 
we look to invest in 
and extract value 
from assets which 
can deliver consistent 
and growing 
income returns. Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 06
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s  
report 
 continued
The	Group’s	weighted	average	cost	of	debt	
stands at 3.1 per cent (2016: 3.4 per cent), 
below	our	medium‑term	target	of	3.2	to	
3.4 per	cent.	The	reduction	in	our	interest	
costs has provided enhanced interest cover 
at a	Group	level	of	3.2	times	(2016:	2.7	times).
The long‑ term debt secured against four of 
our	UK	Shopping	Centres	was	successfully	
restructured in the second half of the year 
to reduce leverage and interest costs. 
The aggregate	facility	of	£167.8	million	was	
reduced to £146.1 million, extended to 
April 2042	and	included	the	termination	of	the	
historic	profit	share	arrangement	on	Grand	
Arcade, Wigan. The aggregate prepayment 
and restructuring costs of £27.6 million 
provided a marginal return of approximately 
10	per	cent,	resulting	in	an	efficient	reduction	
in leverage. 
Financial discipline 
In	February	2017,	we	aligned	underlying	
earnings	to	the	EPRA	measure,	adjusted	
for	limited	Company	specific	non‑cash	
adjustments.	Utilising	this	industry	standard	
metric	will	provide	a	closer	alignment	of	
earnings	to	operating	cash	flow.	Our	dividend	
for	the	year	was	fully	covered,	with	the	 
pay‑out	ratio	of	94.5	per	cent	within	our	
target of 90 to 95 per cent. Progress against 
our	medium‑term	financial	targets	has	been	
positive	with	key	metrics	largely	on	target	or	
moving in the right direction.
Growing our business sustainably
On the Corporate & Social Responsibility 
front, the Group has been proactive in 
ensuring	compliance	with	forthcoming	Energy	
Performance	Certificate	(“EPC”)	regulations.	
Over	500	EPCs	have	been	reviewed	or	
renewed	eliminating	compliance	risk	in	
advance of the 2018 deadline. On Green 
initiatives,	we	have	improved	our	GRESB	
rating	for	the	second	year	running,	and	we	
have conducted tenant surveys at our UK 
Shopping centres to help us develop better 
experiences for occupiers and customers 
alike. For certain centres this has resulted in 
the implementation of electric vehicle charging 
bays, provided free of charge to customers. 
2016 marked ten years since the Group’s 
listing	and	to	celebrate	we	have	been	paying	
it	back	with	community	projects	called	‘Ten	
4 Ten’. Each centre has invested ten days 
during	the	year	towards	initiatives	designed	to	
support	the	communities	in	which	we	operate.
Outlook 
The income return from direct real estate 
in the UK has contributed approximately 
75 per cent	of	total	direct	real	estate	returns	
over the long‑term, and our income focused 
portfolio	is	well	placed	to	capitalise	on	this	
trend	in	the	future.	With	growing	global	
appetite for predictable income returns, 
we believe	our	income‑led	strategy	to	deliver	
market leading shareholder distributions 
remains extremely attractive. 
The expectation of rising interest rates in 
the UK in the near term appears increasingly 
likely. Despite this, interest rates remain 
exceptionally	low	by	historic	standards	and	
the outlook for longer‑term rates remains 
benign, suggesting that the search for yield 
is likely	to	endure	as	a	key	investment	theme.	
Our	income	focused	and	diversified	portfolio	
provides limited exposure to any single sector 
or	occupier	with	the	opportunity	to	allocate	
capital	to	assets	and	sectors	where	we	identify	
the best opportunities. We are increasingly 
looking to invest in locations and sectors 
with	long‑term	structural	support	driven	by	
occupier demand, infrastructure investment 
and strong demographics. 
Significant	progress	has	been	made	in	
strengthening	our	balance	sheet	and	we	will	
continue	to	target	a	lower	leverage	structure	
over	time.	Notwithstanding	this	objective,	
the Group’s average debt maturity is already 
in	excess	of	seven	years	and	with	material	
covenant headroom and interest cover 
over three times, this has resulted in limited 
refinancing	risk	and	strong	cash	flow	cover.	
All our medium‑term targets remain in place. 
Our	growth	target	of	3.0	to	5.0	per	cent	per	
annum in underlying earnings per share 
reflects	the	confidence	we	have	that	our	
business	will	continue	to	deliver	superior,	
sustainable	and	growing	income.	Earnings	
growth	is	driven	with	focus	on	all	aspects	
of our income statement. The continuous 
improvement in the quality of our portfolio 
is	supporting	rental	growth	expectations.	
We are seeing strong occupier demand for 
our logistics, hotels and retail park assets 
(47 per	cent	of	the	UK	portfolio)	supported	
by 38.9 per cent of the overall portfolio being 
subject	to	inflation‑linked	and	fixed	rental	
increases.	In	addition,	we	have	a	number	
of income‑led asset management initiatives 
planned	and	underway	to	support	our	growth	
targets. Weighted average cost of debt has 
reduced	to	3.1	per	cent	which,	combined	
with	improvements	in	our	EPRA	cost	ratio	is	
providing positive operating leverage.
We remain committed to becoming the UK’s 
leading income focused REIT and to delivering 
upper quartile income returns relative to other 
UK‑REITs.

Economy
Economic and political uncertainty have 
become commonplace. In many respects, the 
UK	has	faired	well	post	the	EU	referendum.	
Unemployment	remains	at	very	low	levels	and	
GDP	growth	forecasts	remain	positive,	albeit	
below	2.0	per	cent.	Germany	has	benefited	
from	low	unemployment,	solid	economic	
growth	and	a	broad	based	European	
economic recovery. 
The	UK	will	likely	experience	its	first	rise	
in	interest	rates	in	ten	years	with	the	base	
rate expected	to	increase	over	the	coming	
months. Despite this likely increase in  
short‑ term rates, the outlook for longer‑ term 
rates	remains	low	with	UK	ten	year	gilts	below	
1.5 per cent immediately after the increase 
in	the	base	rate.	Likewise,	interest	rates	in	
Germany	remain	exceptionally	low	by	historic	
standards. While interest rates remain at such 
depressed	levels,	the	premium	between	real	
estate	yields	and	interest	rates	remains	well	
above historic averages.
Economic uncertainty generally results 
in businesses and consumers delaying 
investment decisions. Despite these  
near‑ term challenges, our strategy of investing 
in	Europe’s	two	largest	and	most	liquid	real	
estate markets is expected to provide  
long‑ term sustainable income returns. 
 
The UK occupational market has been resilient 
and performed better in a post Brexit climate 
than generally expected. Performance has 
however	been	varied,	with	distribution	
and	industrial	benefiting	strongly	from	the	
structural	change	in	retailing	while	certain	
parts of the retail market have come under 
pressure from changing consumer habits and 
the corresponding change in retailers’ sales 
and	delivery	network.	
Retailers embracing these changes remain 
successful,	however	the	traditional	sales	
channels	and	store	networks	have	and	will	
continue to change. Our largely food, discount 
and	convenience	shopping	centres	reflect	a	
more resilient part of the market evidenced by 
the portfolio’s continued high occupancy rate 
of	96.7	per	cent.	Engagement	with	retailers,	
customers and local communities all form 
an integral part of our asset management 
process. We are actively investing in our assets 
to ensure they remain relevant and attractive 
to both retailers and customers. 
The	London	hotel	market	has	benefited	from	
a stronger than anticipated economy and 
weaker	Sterling	with	London	centric,	limited	
service hotels demonstrating positive trading. 
Regional	office	markets	have	seen	limited	new	
development and robust occupier demand. 
However	we	have	taken	the	opportunity	to	sell	
regional	office	assets	where	we	believe	values	
have been maximised. Occupier demand from 
London	offices	has	been	resilient	and	future	
speculative supply has reduced. Our exposure 
to	areas	of	London	benefiting	from	large	scale	
transport and infrastructure investment is 
well placed.
Market 
context
We anticipate 
income returns to 
remain the focus 
for UK-REITs which 
aligns well to our 
strategy. Our focus on 
Europe’s two largest 
real estate markets 
provides liquidity 
and transparency. 
Income and income quality is as important 
as ever. As investors seek out acceptable 
yields, our ability to deliver sustainable asset 
backed income returns is compelling.

Investment	market	activity	was	strong	across	
most sectors, both in the UK and Germany. 
Capital and liquidity for real investment 
remains	strong	but	is	selective	with	depth	
of	demand	significantly	stronger	for	good	
quality	assets.	One	area	of	significant	growth	
has been the alternative sectors including 
student accommodation, self‑ storage and 
the private rented sector. As occupier and 
customer	needs	evolve,	flexibility	and	service	
levels are becoming an increasingly important 
consideration. 
Capital values in most markets have performed 
well	driven	by	both	lower	investment	yields	
and	rental	growth.	With	investment	yields	
now	broadly	at	levels	previously	seen	in	2007,	
investment demand has become increasingly 
focused	on	sectors	with	rental	growth	
expectations. Shopping centres, particularly 
in the UK, have been the exception and have 
seen a sharp reduction in investment demand 
and transactional volume. Market concerns 
reflect	a	lack	of	real	growth	in	retail	sales	
volumes and the impact of online retailing 
and changing consumer habits on physical 
retail outlets. At 20 per cent by market value, 
UK	Shopping	centres	reflect	a	decreasing	part	
of our portfolio.
Investment and disposal activity continues to 
focus on allocating capital to assets in locations 
and	sectors	with	long‑term	structural	support	
and occupier demand. Our experience of 
managing	a	diversified	portfolio	of	assets	
provides clear evidence of greater levels of 
occupational	and	investment	activity	in	major	
cities and key economic areas. The increased 
weighting	of	the	Group’s	portfolio	to	London,	
the “Big six” UK cities and the South East as 
well	as	key	German	cities	including	Berlin	
and	Hamburg	provides	greater	confidence	in	
future growth	and	sustainability.	
Real	estate	continues	to	be	defined	by	
technological and social disruption, and 
businesses	continue	to	respond	with	new‑tech	
initiatives to match customer behaviour. 
The	‘on‑demand’	culture	created	by	the	
entertainment	sector	has	filtered	through	to	all	
aspects of daily life. Consumers demand to be 
‘where	it’s	happening’	whether	that	be	at	work,	
at leisure or at home. 
The retail sector is responding to consumer 
demands by focusing on space‑ as‑ a‑ service, 
bringing together physical space and location 
with	technology	to	create	ultimate	engagement	
and experience. Augmented reality, beacons 
and voice recognition technology are 
just	some	of	the	tools	being	employed	in	
physical shopping locations to challenge 
online shopping.
Smartphones and social media remain the 
enabler for shopping centres, utilising apps to 
deliver greater convenience. An example of 
this is app‑ driven ticketless, cashless parking 
solutions	which	are	becoming	commonplace	
as retail destinations strive to become 
customer driven and outcome‑ focused. 
The	growing	use	of	data	analytics	is	also	
impacting	the	retail	environment.	Knowing	
the	customer	is	certainly	not	a	new	concept	
but	with	technology	advances	retailers	and	
retail environments are able to gain an 
in‑depth	knowledge	of	their	shoppers	and	
target audiences like never before. It goes 
beyond	age	and	demographic	profiling,	
enabling brands to create personal, tailor 
made marketing activity resulting in brand 
immersion and engagement.
In addition to a robust traditional research 
programme, our Retail Portfolio utilises our 
consumer	websites,	apps	and	social	media	
functionality to understand and respond to 
customer	needs	and	wants.

Principal 
risks
The Group seeks to minimise, control  
and monitor the impact of risks to  
profitability whilst maximising the 
opportunities they present.
Redefine	International	acknowledges	that	it	
faces	a	number	of	risks	which	could	impact	
the achievement of its strategy. 
While it is not possible to identify or anticipate 
every risk due to the changing business 
environment, the Group has an established 
risk management process to manage and 
mitigate risk. The Group’s process for 
identifying and managing risk is set by 
the Board.	
The Board has	delegated	the	oversight	of	risk	
to the Audit and Risk Committee. Risks are 
assessed	‘bottom	up’	throughout	the	business	
both gross and net of mitigating controls. 
The Audit	and	Risk	Committee	reviews	the	risk	
management	plan	bi‑annually	with	the	design,	
implementation and monitoring being the 
responsibility	of	management	on	a  
day‑to‑day basis.	
Risks are considered in terms of their impact 
and	likelihood	from	both	a financial	and	
reputational perspective. 
Although not exhaustive, the principal 
risks facing the Group are categorised into 
four broad risk types: Strategic, Financial, 
Operational and Legal and regulatory. 
The potential	impact	of	these	risks	and	the	
mitigating controls in place to manage their 
impact	are	as	follows:

Viability statement
In the context of the above principal risks, the 
Directors have considered a three‑ year time 
horizon in assessing longer term viability. This 
aligns	with	the	Group’s	internal	strategic	plan	
and is underpinned by an average unexpired 
lease	term	and	weighted	average	debt	
maturity	comfortably	exceeding	three years.
In reaching their opinion, the Directors 
considered the Group’s internal control 
environment	together	with	the	results	of	
plausible but conservative scenarios. In light 
of recent events, the Directors paid particular 
attention to the risk of a deterioration 
in economic outlook impacting property 
fundamentals, including the impact on 
property	valuations	of	a	weakening	investor	
and	occupational	market,	coupled	with	
restricted	availability	of	finance.	Key	inputs	
included extended vacancy periods, increased 
finance	costs	and	lower	levels	of	scrip dividend	
take‑ up. In performing these tests, the 
Directors	considered	the	limit	at	which	
a threat	to	viability	may crystallise.
Having considered these factors both 
individually and collectively the impact on the 
Group’s	forecast	cash	flows	and	covenant	
compliance,	the	Directors	confirm	that	they	
have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will	be	able	to	continue	in	operation	and	meet	
its debts as they fall due during the  
next	three years. Strategic report

Portfolio positioning by business plan
Each	asset	is	viewed	in	terms	of	its	ability	to	deliver	sustainable	income	returns	and/or	growth.	Approximately	76	per	cent	of	the	current	portfolio	
is	classified	as	either	“Core	income”	or	“Growth	income”.	Core	income	assets	typically	exhibit	long	lease	lengths,	high	cash	on	cash	returns	and	are	
predominantly	multi‑let,	often	with	some	form	of	indexation.	Growth	Income	assets	constitute	approximately	30	per	cent	of	the	current	portfolio.	
These	assets	are	typically	lower	yielding	but	with	higher	intrinsic	growth	prospects.	
20	per	cent	of	the	portfolio	comprises	properties	which	have	shorter	term,	more	intensive	asset	management	plans	underway.	These	opportunities	
are	typically	income‑led	with	a	significant	percentage	of	pre‑let	income	being	secured	before	development	commences.	Our	ability	to	create	
marginal revenue and enhance the quality of assets is fundamental to our overall strategy. 
Where	we	believe	we	have	maximised	the	potential	of	individual	assets	or	where	the	market	is	prepared	to	pay	a	higher	price	than	our	view	of	the	
assets’	intrinsic	value,	we	will	look	to	recycle	that	capital	into	new	opportunities.	At	31	August	2017,	approximately	4	per	cent	of	the	portfolio	was	
considered	mature	with	a	number	of	those	assets	being	actively	considered	for	sale.

Valuation overview 
The portfolio increased in value by 
£40.7 million	or	3.0	per	cent	on	a	like‑for‑like	
basis.	This	increase	in	value	was	driven	by	a	
2.7 per cent increase in like‑ for‑ like annualised 
net	rental	income	and	an	inward	yield	shift	
of	7	basis	points.	A	more	detailed	review	of	
the valuation movement is presented in the 
Financial	review.	
Leasing activity 
In	the	last	12	months,	235	lease	events	were	
agreed providing a total rent of £17.3 million, 
a	3.9 per cent	(£0.6	million)	increase	above	the	
passing	rent	and	a	0.7	per	cent	(£0.1 million)	
increase on ERV. Portfolio occupancy remained high 
and stable at 97.7 per cent (2016: 97.7 per cent).
As	previously	reported,	we	have	experienced	
little evidence to suggest a material change 
in occupational demand in the markets 
in	which	we	operate.	Post	year	end,	over	
53,702 sqft	(4,989	sqm)	of	vacant	space	in	the	
UK Shopping Centre portfolio is in solicitor’s 
hands, including the former BHS unit at Grand 
Arcade,	Wigan	which	has	exchanged	with	
Poundland, resulting in the highest occupancy 
achieved	since	acquiring	the	shopping centres.
Rateable values
In	January	2016,	the	UK	Valuation	Office	
Agency published an updated rating list for 
England	and	Wales	which	has	been	adopted	
from 1 April 2017. The change in rateable 
values	for	commercial	real	estate	will	have	
a direct impact on business rates and 
therefore the total cost of occupation for 
tenants and the cost of vacant space for 
landlords. In general, rates are to increase 
materially	in	London	while	many	regional	
centres	will	see	a	reduction	in	rateable	values.	
Across our UK portfolio (excluding UK Hotels) 
rates	will	reduce	by	approximately	6.9	per	
cent.	Our	hotels,	which	are	largely	London	
focused,	will	see	a	51	per	cent	increase	in	
rates. While the impact of the change in rates 
is to be phased in over a three year period, 
the	change	is	already	reflected	in	hotel	
property values.	 Redefine International P.L.C.

Acquisitions 
Leopard portfolio 
The acquisition of the controlling interest 
in	the	Leopard	portfolio	was	completed	
on 26 April 2017. The portfolio consists 
of	66	German	retail	properties	which	
were	independently	valued	at	the	time	of	
acquisition	at	€175.5	million	reflecting	a	
net initial yield of 7.4 per cent. The portfolio 
generates gross annualised rental income of 
€13.9	million,	of	which	99.2	per	cent	is	indexed	
between	60	and	70	per	cent	of	German	CPI,	
subject	to	indexation	reaching	a	cumulative	
hurdle of 10 per cent. Tenants including 
Edeka, Netto, Real and Rossman account for 
over 85 per cent of the gross rental income. 
The portfolio has a WAULT of 7.9 years and is 
nearly fully occupied at 99.0 per cent by ERV.
The	joint	venture	interest	was	acquired	for	
an aggregate consideration of €49.0 million 
(€49.4 million including transaction costs). 
Following	the	transaction,	the	Company	holds	
an	effective	94	per	cent	controlling	interest	in	
the	portfolio,	whilst	providing	100	per	cent	of	
its	non‑bank	financing	requirement	by	way	of	
shareholder loans.
IHL
In	August,	the	Company	made	an	offer	to	
increase its shareholding in IHL by 32.8 per 
cent	(from	17.2	to	50.0	per	cent).	Following	
subsequent shareholder and court approval, 
the	Company	will	acquire	16,429,687	IHL	
shares from the minority shareholders by 
way	of	a	scheme	of	arrangement	and	a	
further	1,913,479	IHL	shares	from	Redefine	
Properties. The transactions are expected to 
complete simultaneously in early November 
2017.	Consideration	for	the	IHL	shares	will	
be settled via a share‑ for‑ share exchange 
with	2.5	Redefine	International	shares	to	
be issued for every 1 IHL share held. A total 
of	45.9 million	new	Redefine	International	
shares are expected to be allotted. On 
implementation of the scheme, the listing of 
IHL’s	shares	on	both	the	JSE	and	LuxSE	will	
be	terminated.	The	Company	will	also	later	
today reach agreement to acquire a further 
8.9	per	cent	interest	in	IHL	from	Redefine	
Properties on the same terms as the scheme 
of arrangement, by the issue of an additional 
12.5	million	new	Redefine	Intentional	shares.	
This transaction constitutes a smaller related 
party	transaction	and	falls	within	LR	11.1.10	R	
of the UK Listing Rules. The Group’s interest 
will	initially	increase	to	26.2	per	cent	and	
then	to	58.9 per	cent	once	the	scheme	of	
arrangement completes.	
The IHL portfolio comprises nine high 
quality	UK	hotels	which	were	last	valued	
at	£104.4	million	and	will	complement	the	
Company’s existing hotel portfolio. The four 
Travelodge hotels, comprising 27.7 per cent 
of the portfolio, are let on long‑ term leases 
with	average	unexpired	lease	term	of	over	
20 years.	These	assets	reflect	a	net	initial	yield	
of	5.3	per	cent	and	benefit	from	five	yearly	
upward	only	CPI	escalations	that	provide	
attractive	rental	growth	prospects	in	a	higher	
inflationary	environment.	
The	remaining	five	hotels,	valued	at	
£75.4 million,	will	be	leased	to	the	Company’s	
associate,	RedefineBDL	Hotel	Group.	Four	
of the hotels are franchised to Holiday Inn 
Express and one to Hampton by Hilton. The 
five	hotels	to	be	leased	by	RedefineBDL	have	a	
strong trading record. The Hampton by Hilton 
at	Gatwick	Airport	is	integrally	linked	to	the	
airport terminal building and the Holiday Inn 
Express,	Edinburgh	has	shown	strong	growth	
since	acquisition	by	IHL.	The	five	franchised	
hotels are expected to deliver a net initial yield 
of over 7.5 per cent. The portfolio is currently 
financed	at	41.7	per	cent	loan‑to‑value,	at	an	
all‑ in cost of debt of 3.3 per cent. 
Following	the	transactions,	UK	Hotels	are	
expected	to	comprise	approximately	21 per	
cent of the Company’s gross assets, up 
from 16 per cent at 31 August 2017. It is 
anticipated	that	there	will	be	material	savings	
on the integration of the hotel assets into 
the Company’s existing hotel portfolio and 
REIT status.	 Redefine International P.L.C.

Strategic disposals
As part of our strategy to enhance the quality 
of the portfolio, mature assets and assets in 
weaker	locations	will	be	considered	for	sale.
VBG office portfolio, Germany
On 18 January 2017, the Company completed 
on	the	sale	of	four	German	office	assets	for	
a gross consideration of €106.0 million. The 
assets,	which	were	disposed	of	via	a	share	sale	
and	included	related	debt	facilities,	were	held	
in	a	joint	venture	with	the	Menora	Mivtachim	
Group. The disposal of the Company’s 
49 per	cent	share	reflected	an	8.6	per	cent	
premium to the August 2016 market value 
in Euro terms. The Company’s net proceeds 
of	€25.6 million,	which	included	a	net	
Performance Fee of €1.8 million, delivered an 
IRR of 24 per cent over the investment period.
The properties, situated in Berlin, Dresden, 
Cologne and Stuttgart, total 485,900 sqft 
(45,100 sqm), and are let to a German 
government‑ backed social insurance body, 
VBG,	on	a	combined	WAULT	of	just	under	
seven years. The portfolio generated a total 
annual gross rental income of €8.1 million, 
of	which	€4.0	million	was	attributable	to	the	
Company.	Significant	capital	would	have	been	
required on expiry of the leases to make 
market rents achievable.
Other
Other strategic sales included certain regional 
office	assets	and	a	number	of	smaller	retail	
assets	in	Germany	which	had	limited	rental	
growth	expectations.	
Realising value
The ability to enhance income and value 
through asset management initiatives is a 
key part of our investment strategy. Where 
asset values have been maximised through 
reconfiguration,	refurbishment	or	leasing	
activity,	these	assets	will	be	considered	
for sale.
Delta 900, Swindon
Swindon	was	successfully	sold	for	£3.6	million,	
following	the	completion	of	a	new	15‑year	
lease	with	Oxford	Brookes	University	for	
28,412 sqft (2,640 sqm) on an agreed rent 
of £0.3 million, 20.8 per cent above ERV. 
The disposal	represents	a	28.6	per	cent	
premium on book value.
Carphone Warehouse unit,  
Priory Retail Park, London
The standalone Carphone Warehouse unit 
at	Priory	Retail	Park,	Merton	was	sold	for	
£5.5 million	relative	to	an	apportioned	
value	of	£2.1	million	reflecting	a	161.9	per	
cent premium.	
Opportunistic disposals
We are consistently looking to generate 
value through alternative use, income‑ led 
asset management or opportunistic sales. 
Opportunities to recycle capital through the 
disposal of assets at attractive prices are 
considered	on	a	risk‑adjusted	basis	taking	into	
consideration future capital commitments, 
planning and letting risks.

The Exchange House completed in 
October 2016	for	£13.3	million,	a	12.7	per	cent

201 Deansgate, Manchester
On 31 January 2017, the Company completed 
on the disposal of 201 Deansgate, Manchester 
for £29.2 million. The property provides 
83,700 sqft	(7,800	sqm)	of	office	space	and	
delivered an annual net rental income of 
£1.1 million,	with	a	WAULT	of	4.1	years.	The	
office	was	originally	acquired	as	part	of	the	
AUK Portfolio in March 2016 and the sales 
price represents a net initial yield of 3.6 per 
cent and a 14.3 per cent premium to book 
value.	The	IRR	over	the	investment	period	was	
22 per cent.
Sytner BMW car showroom,  
High Wycombe
The	Sytner	BMW	showroom	was	sold	
for	£26.1 million	to	a	UK	pension	fund	in	
August 2017.	The	sale	price	reflected	a	net	
initial yield of 5.0 per cent and a premium 
of 5.8 per cent to the 28 February 2017 
book	value.	The	property	was	acquired	in	
March 2016 as part of the AUK transaction.

The redevelopment of this prime retail

approximately 129,000 sqft (12,000 sqm) 
including	two	retail	units	pre‑let	to	Primark	
and H&M of approximately 100,000 sqft 
(9,500 sqm).	The	scheme	is	anticipated	
to generate €2.2 million in rental income

Express format. The hotel’s operating business 
delivered consistent underlying revenues

and	refurbishment	works.	
UK Retail Park expansions
The	new	PureGym	unit	at	Banbury	Cross	Retail

A further seven units are in various stages 
of	development,	with	pre‑let	agreements	
for all the units either already completed or 
in solicitor’s hands to strong A3 covenants. 
We	are	particularly	pleased	with	The	Arches	
Retail	Park,	Watford	where	competitive	
bidding resulted in indicative rental values of 
over	£90	per	sqft.	The	new	units	will	provide	
an additional £0.5 million of rental income 
reflecting	a	yield	on	cost	of	over	10	per	cent.	
Albion Street, Derby
In	May	2017	an	agreement	for	lease	was	
signed	with	TK	Maxx	for	a	new	22,000	sqft	
(2,044 sqm) store at Albion Street in Derby. 
The redevelopment of 9‑ 11 Albion Street 
has commenced to combine the basement, 
ground,	first	and	second	floors	of	the	three	
existing units into a single, modern space 
to	accommodate	TK	Maxx.	The	new	store	
is scheduled to open by late 2017, once 
internal	fittings	have	been	installed,	creating	
35	new	jobs	and	improving	the	retail	pitch	
for the city. The agreed rent of £0.2 million is 
50 per cent	ahead	of	the	February	2017	ERV.	
Capital	expenditure	to	reconfigure	the	space	
is anticipated	to	be	£2.2	million.	
The	ten	adjoining	retail	units	under	our	
ownership,	inclusive	of	the	three	being	
combined for TK Maxx provide a key artery in 
Derby’s main retail centre, linking the city’s Intu 
Shopping Centre to Primark and the historic 
Old	Town.	The	area	is	the	subject	of	major	
redesign and refurbishment plans by Derby 
City	Council,	which	will	transform	the	area	into

performance of retail assets in different  
sub-sectors and locations. Unemployment 
levels are at an historic low, however, 
consumer confidence has been impacted 
by political uncertainty and negative real 
wage growth. 
Unsurprisingly, the investment demand for 
retail, shopping centres in particular, has 
been weak which has been reflected in our 
valuations in the second half of the year. 
On the positive side, our shopping centre 
exposure is heavily weighted toward food, 
discount and convenience shopping which has 
proved more resilient when compared to retail 
of a more discretionary nature. 
Commercialisation income of £1.1 million 
was collected during the year, a 9 per cent 
increase relative to last year. Our in-house 
commercialisation team, CentreStage has 
enhanced the quality and profitability of the 
speciality retailing and advertising activity 
within our shopping centres and retail parks, 
collaborating with international and national 
brands as well as supporting smaller local 
businesses and communities. Income from 
commercialisation activities is targeted to grow 
by 7 per cent in 2018. Further opportunities 
to drive ancillary revenues from the Group’s 
wider portfolio have been identified.
Shopping centres
Despite a tough retail environment, 76 lease 
events were completed during the year which 
were marginally down on previous passing 
rents. Occupancy decreased to 96.7 per 
cent (2016: 98.1 per cent) as a result of five 
small units becoming vacant, three of which 
have successfully exchanged post year end. 
Annualised gross rental income decreased 
marginally, however, values declined 6.9 per 
cent on a like-for-like basis reflecting a weak 
investment market with very few transactions 
in the year.
The former 41,315 sqft (3,838 sqm) BHS 
unit at Grand Arcade, Wigan has been let to 
Poundland post year end. This is a good result, 
with the majority of old BHS units in the UK 
still vacant. 
Shopping Centre occupancy will increase to 
99.2 per cent following the inclusion of the 
lettings achieved post year end and will result 
in a saving of £0.6 million on vacancy costs.
Overall footfall increased by 2.1 per cent over 
the year. The majority of our shopping centres 
have benefited from this increase, other than 
Grand Arcade, Wigan where the former BHS 
vacancy impacted footfall. The re-letting of the 
BHS unit to Poundland is anticipated to have a 
positive impact on footfall in 2018.
We have seen significant variation in the 
performance of retail assets in different  
sub-sectors and locations.

A modest 1.0 per cent decline in  
like-for-like valuations was impacted by a 
reduction in the valuation of the House of 
Fraser department store in Hull. Contracts 
have been exchanged on the sale of this 
asset post year end. Excluding this property, 
valuations increased 1.0 per cent. Annualised 
gross rental income was down by 2.1 per cent 
over the last 12 months largely as a result of 
the development started in Derby and two 
vacant units totalling 17,238 sqft (1,601 sqm) 
at Banbury Cross Retail Park. There are 
various discussions underway to re-let this 
space including the potential to enhance the 
tenant mix. 
Occupier demand remains healthy, 
particularly for our larger schemes in London 
and the South East. Discussions with a 
number of discount food retailers and  
drive-through food and beverage operators 
are providing potential opportunities to 
realise higher rental values on the parks, as 
well as to deliver income and value enhancing 
asset management initiatives. The new ten 
year lease with PureGym at Banbury Cross 
Retail Park will deliver £0.2 million of rental 
income and a yield on cost of 15.0 per cent 
for the recently completed 7,500 sqft 
(697 sqm) extension.

The regional office market has been resilient, 
both in terms of occupational demand and 
investment volumes. With rental growth 
expected to remain relatively static in a 
number of key regional cities and some 
aggressive pricing of core assets, we have 
taken the opportunity to sell assets where 
we believe pricing was ahead of their 
growth prospects. 
The London Southbank market has benefited 
from large scale redevelopment and 
investment from London Bridge through 
to Waterloo. Our exposure to 104,622 sqft 
(9,720 sqm) of London office space in 
areas undergoing material redevelopment 
has provided strong rental growth as well 
as longer-term redevelopment options. 
According to UK government projections, 
the expected growth in London’s population 
from 8.9 million people to 9.9 million by 
2027, providing opportunities to acquire 
assets in improving locations with rising 
rental values. Our London portfolio is well 
positioned to benefit from areas of structural 
change and has no exposure to financial 
services occupiers. 
Distribution and industrial development 
activity remains restrained and general levels 
of supply are low suggesting the supply/
demand dynamics will remain positive in the 
near term. The continued growth in online 
retailing from 14.9 per cent of total retail sales 
in 2016 to an anticipated 18.5 per cent by 2022 
(source: GlobalData) should provide ongoing 
structural support as retailers adapt to an 
omni-channel sales strategy.
Our focus remains on multi-let industrial 
estates that benefit from a broad range of 
occupier demand and suitable to catering for 
growth in last mile distribution. Our largest 
exposure at Camino Park, Crawley benefits 
from the Crawley/Gatwick market which has 
both strong occupier demand and almost 
negligible available supply. 
With aggressive pricing of core assets, we have 
taken the opportunity to sell assets where we 
believe pricing was ahead of growth prospects.

UK Hotels
Despite the squeeze on real incomes in the 
UK, the weak pound has helped to boost 
the UK hotel industry, by attracting overseas 
visitors. The performance of the sector in 
2017 has exceeded expectations with PwC 
expecting occupancy, average daily room 
rates and RevPars to finish 2017 higher than 
2016 and forecast in London to increase 
2.4 per cent in 2018.
The investment market was strong in the first 
half of 2017 with investment in London hotels 
of approximately £1.1 billion; 55 per cent 
of the overall UK hotel investment volume. 
London hotels have seen strong demand from 
Asian investors originating from Hong Kong, 
Malaysia and Singapore with interest from 
India also now appearing, highlighting the 
strength of London as a world tourist and an 
investment destination. 
The Group’s hotel portfolio remains heavily 
weighted to London which has consistently 
proven to be a stable and growing market. 
The hotel portfolio will increase to 
approximately 21 per cent of the overall 
portfolio (31 August 2017: 16 per cent) post 
year end following the increase in the IHL 
shareholding. The acquisition will provide 
further exposure to Edinburgh and to Gatwick 
Airport, the UK’s second busiest airport. In 
addition, the acquisition of a further four 
Travelodge hotels provides exposure to  
long-dated inflation linked income. 
The portfolio increased in value by 2.9 per cent 
on a like-for-like basis supported by underlying 
EBITDAs for the RedefineBDL leased hotels 
ending the financial year 4.7 per cent higher 
than last year. The Travelodge, Enfield also 
increased in value by 13.0 per cent reflecting 
the improved Travelodge covenant and the 
general investment demand for long-dated 
index-linked income. 
The rent for the RedefineBDL leased portfolio 
for the 2018 financial year has been set 
at £15.4 million, a 7.5 per cent  
like-for-like increase. 
The Group’s hotel portfolio remains heavily 
weighted to London which has consistently 
proven to be a stable and growing market.

The Company’s 17.2 per cent investment

Scalable business
Post year end we concluded on the 
opportunistic acquisition of an additional 
56.9 per cent holding in International Hotel 
Properties Limited (“IHL”) which supports 
our strategic priority of achieving greater 
scale through investing in the right earnings 
and value enhancing opportunities. 
The IHL portfolio comprises nine good 
quality UK hotels which were last valued in 
February 2017 at £104.4 million. Supported 
by our strategic partnerships, we expect to 
capitalise on the strong trading record and 
positive economic outlook.
Controlling our assets and simplifying  
our corporate structure: 
• 
following the transaction we will hold a 
controlling interest of 74.1 per cent in IHL, 
with the remaining 25.9 per cent being 
held by Tsogo Sun, South Africa’s largest 
hotel chain;
• the acquisition eliminates Redefine 
Properties Limited, the Company’s major 
shareholder, as a shareholder in IHL and 
further simplifies our structure; and 
• we have no further related investments 
with Redefine Properties Limited.
Scalable business model supported by 
strategic partnerships:
• 
we continue to build strong operational 
partnerships to ensure we maximise 
shareholder returns through the effective 
management of the underlying assets;
• straightforward integration and synergistic 
cost savings on hotel acquisitions; 
• we hold a 30.4 per cent holding in 
RedefineBDL Hotel Group, the UK’s largest 
independent hotel operator; and 
• following this acquisition RedefineBDL 
operates 13 of the Company’s hotel 
assets, with the remaining five hotels 
leased to Travelodge on long dated index 
linked leases. 
Continuously improving our income 
focused portfolio quality:
• 
our diversified portfolio provides us the 
ability to invest across sectors where we 
see the best growth prospects;
• we will add nine well performing UK hotel 
assets to our portfolio;
• four of the hotels, valued at 
£29.0 million, are let on long term 
leases to Travelodge with an effective 
average unexpired lease term of over 
20 years. The Travelodge portfolio 
reflects a net initial yield of 5.3 per cent 
and benefits from five yearly RPI 
escalations providing attractive 
rental growth prospects in a higher 
inflationary environment; 
• the remaining five hotels, valued at 
£75.4 million, will be managed by the 
Company’s associate RedefineBDL 
Hotel Group. Four of the hotels are 
franchised to Holiday Inn Express 
and one to Hampton by Hilton. The 
hotels have a strong trading record 
and provide exposure to the Hampton 
by Hilton at Gatwick Airport which is 
integrally linked to the airport terminal 
building and the Holiday Inn Express, 
Edinburgh which has shown strong 
growth since acquisition. The five 
franchised hotels are anticipated to 
deliver an effective net initial yield of 
over 7.5 per cent; and
• following the transaction, UK Hotels will 
comprise approximately 21% of our 
portfolio by market value.
Focus on reinvesting at lower leverage:
• 
the portfolio is currently financed at 
41.5 per cent LTV, comfortably below 
the Company’s medium-term target of 
between 45 and 50 per cent.

Europe
The investment market in Germany continues 
to attract significant domestic and foreign 
capital which, combined with a lack of available 
investment product, has supported competitive 
market activity. Of note is the entry of Asian 
investors into the direct market, accounting for 
close to nine per cent of the transaction volume 
in the first half of the year. Berlin continues to 
see strong investment demand which bodes 
well for our portfolio, where 20 per cent is 
located. Logistics and industrial assets have 
witnessed a material increase in activity and the 
trend of increasing investment into alternative 
assets is rising given the competitive pricing of 
the traditional sectors. 
The European portfolio delivered strong 
growth supported by a stronger Euro relative 
to Sterling. The portfolio increased in value by 
2.5 per cent in local currency terms and on a 
like-for-like basis. 
Asset management activity at our Berlin 
shopping centre is progressing well. Terms 
have been agreed to extend the REWE 
supermarket by 1,840 sqft (171 sqm). The 
lease will also be extended on a new ten-year 
term with the additional rent reflecting an 
8.3 per cent yield on cost. Similarly, the dm 
pharmacy has agreed to extend its store by 
1,076 sqft (100 sqm). The lease will also be 
extended on a ten-year term with the additional 
rent reflecting a 9.4 per cent yield on cost. 
Both of these initiatives increase the centre’s 
weighting to food and convenience shopping 
and reduces the number of units on the lower 
ground floor, improving the supply demand 
position of the centre. The refurbishment of 
the food court began during the year and will 
provide a more modern concept with improved 
services to customers. 
Redevelopment options at Altona, Hamburg 
are currently being progressed in consultation 
with the local authority. The wider master plan 
for this historic and commercially important 
area will be driven by the planned relocation 
of the high-speed railway terminal. This 
relocation is anticipated to take place in 2023 
but in the interim, the development of a further 
5,000 new homes has already commenced. 
The European portfolio delivered strong growth 
supported by a stronger Euro relative to Sterling.

Overview
As set out at our Capital Markets Day in 
February, the year has seen considerable 
capital recycling and reinvestment, targeting 
our core objective of delivering market leading 
income returns for our shareholders. We have 
re-based our key earnings metric and dividend 
structure to ensure we retain sufficient 
operating cash flow within the business to 
fund asset management initiatives which are 
designed to grow income-led total returns. 
Capital profits from disposals have been 
partly applied towards debt restructuring and 
prepayments to drive down finance costs 
and leverage.
Guidance on the Group’s re-based earnings 
measure, set out at the Capital Markets Day, 
has been delivered on and these full year 
results demonstrate solid progress against 
all commitments made. 
Underlying earnings, the Group’s earnings 
measure, were £49.8 million or 2.75 pence 
per share. Aligning the comparative period, 
which removes the impact of discontinued 
Company adjustments, would have resulted 
in underlying earnings of £46.3 million or 
2.8 pence per share. The marginal reduction 
per share is largely attributable to both 
non-recurring administrative costs and the 
timing of reinvestment following a period of 
extensive capital recycling.
EPRA NAV per share rose by 3.5 per cent to 
41.4 pence, driven primarily by both realised 
and unrealised gains on the Group’s property 
portfolio, and the impact of our European 
investments which benefited from the relative 
strength of the Euro.
An aggregate premium to book value of 
£16.1 million (12.2 per cent) was generated 
through the disposal of mature assets and the 
strategic sale of certain high yielding assets, 
with reinvestment into lower yielding but 
higher growth assets during the year. The 
most significant were the disposal of the VBG 
portfolio and Deansgate, Manchester which 
achieved a 24 and 22 per cent IRR respectively 
over the investment periods.
Proceeds from the VBG disposal were 
used to acquire the joint venture’s interest 
in the German supermarket portfolio for 
€49.0 million, an investment providing a 
10 per cent cash on cash yield. As well as 
being an efficient reinvestment of capital, 
the acquisition provides flexibility over the 
portfolio’s asset management initiatives and 
longer-term investment decisions.
Post year end, a scheme of arrangement 
was approved by the minority shareholders 
in IHL which will see the Group’s interest 
increase from 17.2 to 50.0 per cent via a  
share-for-share exchange. IHL owns nine 
UK hotels last valued at £104.4 million. 
The transaction is anticipated to complete in 
early November 2017 with IHL to be delisted 
shortly after.
With a sector leading dividend yield of  
6.3% and growth in EPRA NAV of 3.5%,  
we have delivered a total accounting  
return of almost 10% for our shareholders.

Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
In April an opportunity arose to restructure 
and	refinance	the	£167.8	million	Aviva	facility	
secured over four UK Shopping centres. In 
return for a prepayment of £21.7 million, the 
interest	rate	on	the	refinanced	principal	of	
£146.1 million reduced by 31 basis points and 
has	resulted	in	an	annual	finance	cost	saving	
of £1.7 million. The restructuring also removed 
an	historic	arrangement	whereby	Aviva	
shared	in	both	the	annual	profits	and	(subject	
to certain hurdles) the capital appreciation 
of the Grand Arcade, Wigan. An aggregate 
annual saving of £1.5 million is expected 
to	result	from	the	removal	of	the	profit	
share arrangement.
The Board today declares a second interim 
dividend of 1.3 pence per share, bringing 
the total paid and payable in respect of 2017 
to	2.6 pence	per	share,	which	represents	a	
94.5 per	cent	pay‑out	ratio	on	underlying	
earnings,	which	is	in	line	with	guidance.
Presentation of financial information
The	Board	reviews	information	and	reports	
presented on a proportionately consolidated 
basis,	which	includes	the	Group’s	share	of	
interests	in	joint	ventures.	To	align	with	how	
the	Group	is	managed,	this	financial	review	
has been presented on the same basis.

income from the 2016 AUK Portfolio acquisition. On a like‑ for‑ like basis gross rental income 
increased by 3.7 per cent, or 0.7 per cent on a local currency basis. The strengthening of the

The income from the UK Hotel portfolio fell 
1.3 per cent like‑ for‑ like, the result of lease 
incentive payments extended for general 
improvements	to	the	portfolio,	which	masked	
a modest headline rental increase. 
European	rents	were	relatively	flat	in	local	
currency terms, although a stronger Euro 
relative to Sterling during the year resulted in 
a 12.3 per cent increase in Sterling terms.
Property operating expenses have increased 
primarily due to the enlarged portfolio and 
a repairs and maintenance programme 
carried out on a number of German schemes, 
the	most	significant	being	the	Berlin	
Shopping Centre.
Other income of £2.7 million includes a 
Performance Fee earned on the VBG portfolio 
disposal of £1.6 million. This arose from the 
asset management services provided to the 
joint	venture	and	the	IRR	achieved	on	exit.	
The Group’s administrative cost base 
increased by £4.2 million to £15.6 million, 
in	part	due	to	significant	non‑recurring	
charges incurred during the year. As guided, 
£1.6 million	was	paid	to	terminate	the	historic	
AUK	asset	management	contract	following	
the Group’s 2016 acquisition and integration 
of	the	portfolio,	with	a	further	£0.4	million	in	
professional fees incurred through the year 
which	are	non‑recurring.	The	residual	increase	
in cost base can be attributed to the enlarged 
portfolio. The EPRA cost ratio, although above 
our medium‑ term target, has been managed 
downwards	during	the	second	half	of	the	year	
to	17.2	per	cent,	after	adjusting	for	 
non‑ recurring items.
A	saving	in	net	finance	costs	of	£4.1	million	
has been achieved as a result of several 
refinancing	initiatives	carried	out	during	the	
year.	The	Aviva	refinancing	in	April	reduced	
finance	costs	by	£3.2	million	relative	to	2016,	
benefiting	from	both	a	lower	cost	of	debt	
and	the	extinguishment	of	the	historic	profit	
share	arrangement	with	the	lender	to	Grand	
Arcade, Wigan.
Other	finance	expense	includes	a	£4.3	million	
non‑ cash charge in relation to the net fair 
value	adjustment	on	refinancing	of	the	fixed	
rate	Aviva	facility.	The	fair	value	adjustment	on	
the	new	facility	was	lower	than	that	released	
on the old, due in part to the £21.7 million 
prepayment made. 
The	year	also	saw	£10.7	million	in	realised	
profits	following	disposal	of	11	properties,	
with	significant	premiums	received	on	
Deansgate Manchester, Exchange House 
Watford and a Carphone Warehouse unit at 
Priory Retail Park in Merton. In addition, the 
VBG	portfolio	was	disposed	of	via	a	share	
sale at a £3.8 million premium to the Group’s 
proportionate share of its carrying value at 
31 August	2016. Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 43
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
Following	a	number	of	asset	management	
initiatives, the portfolio increased in value by 
3.0 per cent like‑ for‑ like. The overall increase 
was	supported	by	the	Group’s	European	
investments	which	benefited	from	the	
relative strength of the Euro, increasing by 
11.2 per	cent	compared	to	2.5	per	cent	in	local	
currency terms.
The UK Retail portfolio decreased by 
£25.1 million	or	4.7	per	cent,	driven	by	
the	UK	Shopping	centre	portfolio	which	
suffered	rising	yields	and	a	general	lack	of	
transactional evidence.
The UK Commercial portfolio continued its 
strong	performance,	with	an	8.3	per	cent	 
like‑ for‑ like increase in values. Underpinning 
this	performance	were	particularly	strong	
uplifts	in	offices	and	distribution	warehouses	
caused by a reduction in vacancies, rising 
rents	and	the	weight	of	both	overseas	and	
domestic capital fuelling a competitive 
investment market.
The UK Hotels portfolio increased by 2.9 per 
cent	following	a	strong	trading	performance,	
despite the increase in business rates 
during the year. The DoubleTree by Hilton 
in	Edinburgh	performed	particularly	well,	
drawing	from	Edinburgh’s	RevPar	growth	in	
2016 of 17 per cent. The London portfolio also 
continues	to	benefit	from	one	of	the	highest	
occupancy	rates	in	the	UK	at	82	per	cent,	with	
growth	in	occupancy,	average	daily	rate	and	
RevPar forecast for both 2017 and 2018.

and	a	12‑bedroom	extension	to	our	Southwark	Hotel	on	London’s	Southbank.
Financing activities included net repayment 
and prepayment of debt and dividends paid, 
including	withholding	tax.	Scrip	take‑up	on	
the	two	dividend	payments	made	during	the	
year	were	27.3	per	cent	and	28.8	per	cent

Dividends
The dividends paid and payable during the 
year represent an annualised yield of 6.3 per 
cent on EPRA NAV, and 6.6 per cent based on 
the Group’s share price at 31 August 2017.
The	Board	intend	to	offer	shareholders	a	scrip	
dividend alternative. Full details including 
the tax components of the dividend and 
the	timetable	will	be	released	separately	on	
Friday 27	October	2017.	The	dividend	payment	
date has been set for Monday 18 December 
2017, to shareholders on the register on 
Friday 1 December	2017.
Going concern
At 31 August 2017, the Group’s cash and 
undrawn	facilities	were	£63.4	million	and	
its	capital	commitments	were	£16.8	million.	
Having considered severe but plausible 
scenarios,	the	Directors	are	satisfied	that	the	
security of the Group’s income taken together 
with	an	average	debt	maturity	profile	in	excess	
of	seven	years,	headroom	against	financial	
covenants and strong interest cover, continues 
to provide a reasonable expectation that 
the	Group	will	have	the	resources	it	requires	
to meet ongoing and future commitments. 
Accordingly,	the	2017	financial	statements	
have been prepared on a going concern basis.

CSR strategy
At	Redefine	International,	CSR	means	
understanding and pro‑ actively managing 
ESG risks and opportunities that can impact 
on	income	growth	and	net	asset	value,	
whilst	also	taking	account	of	the	Company’s	
responsibilities	towards	stakeholders,	in	
particular investors and shareholders, 
employees,	the	businesses	with	which	
we	work	and	the	communities	in	which	
we operate.
The	CSR	Committee,	which	comprises	three	
of the	four	Executive	Directors	and	is	attended	
by our CSR advisers, asset managers and the 
Company	Secretary,	was	formed	in	2014	to	
establish and implement a formal CSR strategy 
for the Group.
The strategy seeks to ensure that our 
governance	and	risk	management	framework,	
together	with	our	investment	and	asset	
strategy, continue to be resilient to the  
ever‑ changing economic, social and 
environmental landscape and sets out a 
series of actions in the form of a CSR roadmap 
targeting both short and medium term 
strategic	objectives.

The CSR Committee implements the CSR 
strategy using targets and carefully selected 
KPIs to measure progress, tasking key 
stakeholders	within	the	business	responsible	
for the day‑ to‑ day management of those 
targets. The CSR Committee meets regularly 
to	review	progress	against	the	CSR	roadmap,	
review	environmental	performance	data	and	
receive updates on UK and German  
CSR‑ related legislation.
During 2017, the Company has made several 
achievements, the most notable being:
• the Company’s participation in the GRESB 
Real	Estate	Assessment	benefited	from	a	
continued increase in score, up 12 per cent 
on	the	prior	year’s	result;
• a four per cent like‑ for‑ like (“LfL”) reduction 
in carbon (CO
2
e) emissions based on 39 of 
our properties;
• a	six	per	cent	LfL	reduction	in	water	
consumption	across	24	of	our properties;
• utilities	and	waste	data	within	our	2017	
CSR	Report	is	now	aligned	to	EPRA	*sBPR

• over	500	Energy	Performance	Certificates	
(“EPCs”)	have	been	either	reviewed	or	
renewed	to	ensure	our	100	per	cent	‘risk	
free	EPC strategy’	is	achieved;
• achieved outstanding Q compliance 
Health and Safety scores across our 
UK Shopping centres;	and
• inaugural GRESB Public Disclosure rating 
of	‘B’	for	Redefine	International	against	an	
industry	average	‘C’	rating.

governance
Approach
Redefine	International	seeks	to	operate	
efficient	processes	and	procedures	that	
demonstrate social and environmental risk 
management, and foster open stakeholder 
engagement.	The	Group	will	also	continue	
to uphold the highest standards of ethical 
behaviour	and	actively	support	our	workforce.
The Group’s approach to maintaining these 
commitments include:
• complying	with	all	applicable	regulation	
and preparing for anticipated future 
regulation,	and	its	implications;
• providing	confidence	to	stakeholders	
of our sound management of CSR risks 
through our ongoing participation in the 
most prominent industry benchmark 
survey,	GRESB;
• ensuring employees receive appropriate 
training on ESG issues, and providing 
bespoke training on sustainability topics  
to	those	that	require	it;
• maintaining best practice in health 
and	safety	management	to	the	benefit	
of tenants, contractors, customers 
and employees;
• ensuring that suppliers adhere to a code of 
ethics, covering inter alia, anti‑ bribery and 
modern	slavery;
• continued	relationship	with	first	class	
sustainability advisers to provide 
leadership and guidance on sustainability 
across	the	business;
• operating a robust data management 
system to ensure our disclosure and 
reporting	is	accurate;	and
• fostering a culture of openness.
With	respect	to	our	employees,	the	Group	will:
• ensure that no applicant or employee 
is discriminated against either directly 
or indirectly;
• treat all employees, prospective 
employees, agents, contractors, tenants, 
and suppliers fairly and equally, regardless 
of their gender, age, race, sexuality 
or disability;
• promote	staff	training	and	development	
with	a	focus	on	fostering	innovation;
• seek	to	diversify	our	workforce	to	
support the nature of the Company’s 
operations or the communities in 
which	we	operate,	taking	into	account	
relevant	skills,	experience,	knowledge,	
personality,	ethnicity	and	gender	whilst	
maintaining our responsibility to select the 
best candidate;
• recognise our social and moral duty 
to	offer	opportunities	to	people	with	
disabilities and doing all that is practicable 
to	meet	their	needs;	
• uphold our commitments under our Code 
of	Ethics	which	promotes	honesty	and	
integrity in business dealings and conduct 
commensurate	with	an	organisation	of	our	
size.	Any	breaches	will	lead	to	disciplinary	
proceedings and, if appropriate, 
disciplinary	action;	and	
• all	employees	are	provided	with	a	
handbook outlining the Company’s key 
policies,	which	are	designed	to	encourage	
a	pleasant	working	environment,	free	from	
discrimination, undue stress or bullying. 
The Company recognises, respects and 
upholds all UK employment rights and 
human	rights	and	outlaws	any	forms	of	
modern slavery.
Performance
Good	progress	was	made	during	2017	 
in relation to CSR governance.
Over	the	last	twelve	months,	the	focus	has	
been on ensuring a year‑ on‑ year continual 
improvement to the GRESB Real Estate 
Assessment score.
In	order	to	support	this	objective,	the	available	
utilities data set has been expanded from 
24 properties to 39, representing over a 
60 per	cent	improvement	in	data	collection	
and	reporting	across	the	two	geographic	
locations	where	Redefine	International	hold	
assets under management. This has enabled 
discussion around setting corporate targets 
given the solid foundation formed during the 
last	twelve	months	on	provision	of	a	vastly	
improved	data	set	aligned	to	the	EPRA	*sBPR	
(2nd edition) core requirements. The utilities 
reduction	target	is	now	subject	to	Board	
approval	for	integration	within	the	2018	set	of	
CSR	Roadmap objectives.
During the year, the CSR Committee has 
reviewed	the	implementation	of	green	
building	certification	across	the	portfolio.	
The Omnibus	Building	in	Reigate	was	certified	
to Environmental Management Systems 
International Standard ISO14001:2015, a 
great achievement. The CSR Committee 
has considered the implementation of SKA 
assessments for planned refurbishments 
and	investigation	into	whether	an	asset	
level	BREEAM‑In‑Use	certification	would	be	
suitable	for	certain	properties	within	the	
portfolio. A number of developments have 
been	reviewed	for	SKA	suitability,	with	the	
current redevelopment of the food court at 
West Orchards,	Coventry	in	process	of	being	
SKA assessed.
The	award	of	the	first	Green	Star	 
for GRESB 2017 and the 12 per cent  
year‑ on‑ year improvement in score has 
meant another successful year of reporting 
has	been	achieved.	Notwithstanding	
the ongoing aspirations to continually 
improve and the associated tasks that 
accompany	this	objective,	this	is	a	good	
result and demonstrates our commitment to 
sustainability	and	positions	the	Company	well	
for the future.
The Company believes that achieving 
compliance	with	environmental	legislation	
is key to protecting value and enabling the 
improvement of our assets. In order to 
manage	and	reduce	risk,	we	have	either	
reviewed	or	renewed	over	500	portfolio‑wide	
EPCs in relation to the ongoing management 
and commitment required as part of our 
100 per	cent	EPC	risk	free	compliance	strategy.	
In particular, our portfolio exposure across 
England & Wales to the Minimum Energy 
Efficiency	Standards	(“MEES”)	regulation	in	
tandem	with	our	CSR	Roadmap	target	of	
100 per	cent	compliance	has	meant	that	EPCs	
rated	‘F’	or	‘G’	now	have	ongoing	action	plans	
in	place.	EPCs	identified	as	“missing”,	either	on	
a	whole	building	basis	or	per	area	of	tenant	
occupied	demise	under	lease,	now	have	EPCs.	
For	clarity,	where	required	under	MEES,	these	
EPCs have been prepared on a lease by lease 
basis covering each area of tenant occupied 
demise.	The	assessments	included	FRIs	and	‘E’	
or	‘D’	rated	EPCs	(if	completed	prior	to	2011).
Focused	sustainability	training	was	delivered	
to all employees based at the Group’s head 
office	and	across	its	operational	locations.	
Ensuring	our	employees	are	made	aware	of	
and educated in sustainability issues helps 
bring	sustainability	to	life	and	allows	for	
integration of initiatives into everyday activities 
throughout	the	workplace.
Redefine	International	has	its	own	dedicated	
Health	and	Safety	Manager	whose	role	it	is	
to provide guidance and support to tenants, 
contractors, customers and employees alike.
The Group manages an environmental data 
reporting	system	which	is	able	to	collect	and	
analyse quarterly performance data from a 
growing	portfolio.	The	Company	has	met	its	
obligations	under	the	CRC	Energy	Efficiency	
Scheme	with	allowances	purchased	to	cover	
2017 emissions of 7,076 tonnes of CO
2
 at a 
cost of £121,707.20. Redefine International P.L.C.

Corporate social 
responsibility
 continued
Redefine	International	is	committed	to	
maintaining its culture of openness and 
transparency.	There	is	a	strong	work	ethic	
amongst	staff	and	team	spirit	is	fostered	
through regular meetings and team building 
days	which	encourage	better	working	
relationships and provide the forum for 
sharing	ideas	with	the	executives	in	a	less	
formal environment. As the Company 
expands, and the number of employees 
and responsibilities increases, the Board 
committees have ensured that the necessary 
internal controls have been implemented, 
and that executives and employees remain 
well	rewarded.	The	Board	recognises	the	
importance of culture and providing a good 
working	environment	to	attract	and	retain	
high	calibre	staff.	To	this	end,	an	employee	
survey	was	undertaken	to	provide	a	forum	for	
confidential	feedback.	The	Board	was	pleased	
that	there	was	a	generally	positive	response	
to	the	survey,	whilst	providing	for	areas	of	
focus for further improvements to employees’ 
satisfaction	and	health	and	wellbeing.
It	is	the	aim	of	Redefine	International	to	
extend	diversity	within	the	Group	and	
acknowledge,	accept	and	accommodate	the	
differences	between	individuals.	The	Group	
strives to treat all employees, prospective 
employees, agents, contractors, tenants, and 
suppliers fairly and equally, regardless of their 
gender, sexual orientation, family status, race, 
colour, nationality, religious or political belief, 
age or disability.
The Company is committed to having an 
appropriate	level	of	diversity	that	reflects	the	
nature	of	the	Group’s	operations	and	which	
best supports the achievement of strategic 
objectives.	Over	the	last	year	diversity	across	
the Group and the Board has remained 
unchanged. The Nominations Committee 
regularly considers skills, experience, 
knowledge,	personality,	ethnicity	and	gender	
of the Board and has set a target to extend 
the female representation at Board level to 
at least	one	third	by	2020.	
During	the	year	a	wide	pool	of	candidates	
were	selected	for	consideration	as	a	new	 
non‑ executive. The Company hopes to 
make	an	announcement	regarding	a	new	
appointment by the end of the year.
Employee turnover has been modest during 
2017. All employees are based in the UK 
or	Germany,	where	there	are	few	human	
rights issues. No human rights concerns or 
whistle‑blowing	reports	were	received	from	
employees during the year.

investment
Approach
The	Company	seeks	to	implement	an	effective	
investment strategy that realises the full 
potential of our investments for both our 
shareholders	and	the	communities	in	which	
we	operate	throughout	the	investment	
life cycle.
The	Group	will	achieve	this	by:
• identifying investment risks during 
acquisition due diligence and identifying 
opportunities	to	add	value;
• considering the social and environmental 
performance	of	our	assets;	and
• monitoring and measuring our resource 
consumption	to	identify	efficiencies,	
particularly relating to energy and reduce 
our carbon emissions footprint and the 
operational costs for our tenants.
Performance
We have continued to take important 
steps in the deployment of our resilient 
investment strategy.
The Company	has	invested	time	with	its	
CSR advisers	to	prepare	utilities	and	waste	
data	sets	aligned	to	EPRA	*sBPR	(2nd edition)	
core requirements. Data capture has 
been	significantly	improved	and	a	new	
reporting	format	is	now	presented	in	line	
with	industry	accepted	environmental	
performance indicators.
In	2017,	Redefine	International	celebrated	
its tenth anniversary since listing and to 
commemorate this milestone, the Company 
undertook	a	community	project	called	
“Ten for 10”.	This	entailed	investing	ten	
days into initiatives designed to support the 
communities	in	which	we	operate.	See	our	
case study for more information on page 55. Redefine International P.L.C.

Our Tenant Energy Data (“TED”) initiative 
commenced during the year. The initiative is 
aimed	at	understanding	how	the	Company	
can	support	and	influence	tenants	to	reduce	
their energy consumption. TED proved to 
be a complex task due to factors such as 
tenant	non‑disclosure,	time	factors	to	which	
tenants	did	not	wish	to	commit	and	general	
data	unavailability.	Significant	progress	was	
however	made	on	the	eight	hotels	under	third	
party	management,	which	given	their	relative	
size	should	make	a	material	difference.	
Energy	efficiency	audits	have	been	undertaken	
across a third of our existing shopping centre 
locations,	in	order	to	identify	areas	where	
energy conservation measures can be realised 
at	either	no	cost	or	via	low	cost	projects.
Over	the	next	financial	year	the	BBP	(Better	
Buildings	Partnership)	2017	will	launch	their	
Acquisitions	Sustainability	Toolkit.	This	will	be	
investigated to ensure the Group is equipped 
with	practical	guidance	on	how	to	ensure	
sustainability risks and opportunities are 
captured as part of the acquisition process. 
   R esilient  
assets
Approach
Redefine	International	will	undertake	asset	
management	which	maximises	net	asset	value	
whilst	providing	the	best	experience	possible	
for occupiers and visitors alike.
Redefine	International	will	uphold	this	
commitment by:
• engaging	with	and	contributing	to	
charitable and community initiatives on an 
ongoing	basis;
• engaging	with	local	authorities	and	
supporting	their	community	campaigns;
• collaborating	with	tenants	to	conceive	and	
promote	joint	community	projects;
• understanding, enhancing and promoting 
the	Group’s	role	as	a	placemaker,	with	
a focus on creating and maintaining 
prosperous communities in the local areas 
where	we	invest;
• ensuring key environmental and social 
risks	are	well	managed	when	the	Group	
is undertaking development activities 
and throughout the management of our 
portfolio;	and
• engaging	with	tenants	to	better	respond	
to their needs and position ourselves to 
anticipate future requirements.
Performance
The	Company	has	continued	to	refine	its	
procedures to manage environmental risks, 
reduce cost and future‑ proof its assets across 
the	portfolio.	Specifically:
• the continuation of an asset management 
working	group;	to	ensure	lessons	
learnt are discussed and best practice 
disseminated	amongst	the	growing	team;
• ensuring Health, Safety and Environmental 
(“HSE”) compliance audit scores across 
UK retail and shopping centre locations 
are over ninety per cent, driven by the 
relationship	between	managing	agent,	
Centre Management teams and the 
Group’s	Health	and	Safety	Manager;
• the HSE audit scores are generated from 
software	which	is	provided	by	a	third	
party HSE compliance auditing company 
(Q Compliance).	The	software	captures,	
tracks and analyses HSE compliance 
activity	related	to	a	set	of	predefined	
indicators.	The	current	scope	will	be	
broadened to include the remainder of the 
UK assets and German investments over 
the	forthcoming	year;
• the Group has undertaken Fire Risk 
Assessments and Water Hygiene 
Audits	with	external	auditors	across	
the UK Shopping centre portfolio to 
ensure compliance;	
• continued commitment to 
participation in the GRESB Real Estate 
Assessment process;	
• completed	an	EPC	risk	review	of	the	
UK portfolio;
• ensured all funding raised from charitable 
activities undertaken at each UK Shopping 
centre are channelled to the nominated 
local	charity	which	has	fostered	a	great	
community	spirit;
• conducted a tenant satisfaction survey 
with	the	objective	of	seeking	feedback	
for improvement;	and
• considered SKA assessments for all 
suitable	development	projects	to	ensure	
development activities consider the 
materials used and their associated 
impact on the environment. This has 
led	to	developments	at	Southwark,	
Derby, Banbury and the West Orchards 
in	Coventry	undergoing	scoping	review.	
Due to	a	combination	of	timing	and	the	
type	of	fit‑out	planned	for	Southwark,	
Derby	and	Banbury,	the	fit‑out	itself	
was	unable	to	benefit	from	the	SKA	
certification	process	yet	West	Orchards	in	
Coventry	is	expected	to	gain	certification	
post year end.
Energy Performance  
Certification (“EPC”) risk
The Company’s exposure to EPC risk from 
the forthcoming MEES and present Section 
63	legislation	has	been	thoroughly	reviewed	
for	the	UK	portfolio	with	a	view	to	identifying	
and integrating applicable EPC improvement 
measures into asset business plans ahead of 
legislative deadlines. Addressing the MEES 
risk has	been	viewed	as	a	necessary	 
pro‑ active step, and balances sustainability 
with	regulation	and	stakeholders’	interests	
alike.	A minimum	EPC	rating	level	of	D	will	
be sought for planned refurbishments and 
upgrade	works	to	our	portfolio	assets.
Performance data
The Company is committed to monitoring 
and measuring the environmental impact of 
energy,	water	usage	and	waste	management	
which	falls	under	its	operational	control.	Since	
November	2014,	Redefine	International	has	
maintained a data management system to 
capture this information at a property level. 
In order	to	enhance	our	level	of	utilities,	waste	
and	emissions	disclosure	this	year,	we	have	
adopted	guidance	provided	within	the	EPRA	
*sBPR	(2nd	edition)	in	accordance	with	the

EPRA commentary
The Company has enhanced its environmental 
performance	data	disclosure	to	align	with	the	
EPRA	*sBPR	(2nd	edition)	and	our	reporting	to	
the GRESB Real Estate Assessment.
We	now	present	consolidated	property	
energy,	greenhouse	gas	(GHG),	water	and	
waste	data	on	both	an	absolute	(“Abs”)	and	 
like‑ for‑ like (“LfL”) basis, covering assets 
in both our UK and German portfolios. 
We believe	that	adopting	this	approach	
provides greater transparency and 
comparability for our stakeholders in 
respect to	the	environmental	performance	 
of assets under management.
As per mandatory greenhouse gas 
disclosure, our organisational boundary for 
environmental disclosure is based on the 
principle of operational control, and therefore 
includes	all	property	assets	where	we	are	
responsible for the procurement of energy, 
water	and	waste	services.	A	total	of	41	assets	
fall	within	the	boundary	in	both	the	2016	and	
2017 reporting periods. We have provided 
data to cover 95 per cent of these assets for 
the	current	reporting	period.	Only	two	assets	
(in Germany) under our operational control 
are excluded from the disclosure, due to lack 
of reliable and accurate data. 
As our data management programme is 
continually	evolving,	we	are	not	yet	able	to	
report	the	specific	end	use	of	procured	energy	
and	water.	We	have	also	considered	the	EPRA	
guidance in relation to segmental analysis. 
We believe that reporting “managed” assets 
provides	a	fair	overview	of	performance,	
given	that	the	majority	of	environmental	
impact	is	associated	with	our	shopping	
centre assets and to a lesser extent a small 
number	of	multi‑let	offices.	We	will	continue	
to consider the need for further segmental 
analysis in the future development of our 
data management programme.
A small proportion of our data may be 
subject	to	estimation;	this	is	completed	to	
ensure that our reporting per asset covers 
the correct reporting period and is complete. 
Estimation	is	only	made	where	actual	billed	
or	metered	data,	and	where	the	date	of	
the	data	recording	falls	within	six	months	
or less	from	the	period to	be	estimated.	
Our methodologies use	pro‑rated	calculation	
or	like‑for‑like replacement.
In terms of absolute energy consumption 
change, electricity and gas consumption 
increased by seven per cent and 13 per cent 
respectively in the past year due to property 
acquisitions and increased occupancy 
(and heating demand) across our multi‑ let 
properties. District heating consumption 
fell	significantly	due	to	reduced	demand	
for	heating	within	our	German	shopping	
centre assets.

Our LfL portfolio for the purpose of the 
EPRA disclosure is mostly composed of 
our UK Shopping centres, and to a lesser 
extent our German shopping centres. These 
properties have the largest environmental 
impact of all assets under management. 
Actual LfL increase in electricity consumption 
was	less	pronounced	(one	per	cent).	Water	
consumption	saw	a	six	per	cent	decrease	due	
to decreased demand.
In relation to intensity of environmental 
performance,	we	have	chosen	to	use	
net rental income as the denominator to 
be	consistent	with	our	GHG	disclosure	
methodology.	However,	we	recognise	
that other normalisation factors may be 
more appropriate	for	use	in	the	future,	
with a particular	focus	to	ensure	that	 
like‑ for‑ like performance changes can be 
properly understood.
Our absolute scope 1 and 2L GHG emissions 
remained broadly the same as conveyed by 
the mandatory GHG emissions reporting table 
– see page 58.
We expect to continue to enhance our data 
reporting programme during the course of 
the next year to provide better insight into 
where	energy	and	water	data	is	sub‑metered	
exclusively	to	tenants,	as	well	as	improve	the	
coverage of our data management system.

In January 2017, 
Redefine International 
launched ‘Ten for 10’ 
– a community 
engagement 
programme enabling 
us to contribute and 
connect with the local 
communities in which 
we operate.
In celebration	of	Redefine	International’s	tenth	
anniversary,	staff	across	our	property	portfolio	
and	our	head	office	pledged	to	donate	ten	
working	days	per	location	to	local	community	
groups and charities through the Ten for 10 
volunteering programme.
The	scope	of	the	project	enabled	the	Redefine	
International	team	to	work	with	a	wide	range	
of	people	within	the	local	community,	from	
school children to the elderly, providing much 
needed	support	and	making	a	difference	to	
the lives of so many.
At the Grand Arcade Shopping Centre 
in Wigan, the Centre Management team 
supported ten local groups including 
the	British	Heart	Foundation,	New	
Lodge Preschool and the Green Slate 
Community Farm.
West Orchards, Coventry and Byron Place, 
Seaham had large teams supporting local litter 
picking	and	community	clean‑up	projects.	
Staff	at	Weston	Favell	Shopping	Centre,	
Northampton supported the Salvation Army’s 
homelessness	project	by	volunteering	with	
their	‘street	team’,	and	the	team	at	St George’s,	
Harrow	assisted	at	a	Mother	and	Toddler	
group	and	marshalled	the	‘Run	Wembley’	
community	event.	Birchwood	Shopping	
Centre, Warrington helped to remodel a 
sensory	garden	for	their	‘Charity	of	the	
Year’, Brainwave.
Head	office	staff	supported	the	Grenfell	
Tower	relief	effort	by	collecting,	donating	
and delivering much needed essentials for 
the	victims	of	the	disaster,	which	occurred	
in	June 2017,	as	well	as	volunteering	at	one	
of the many donation centres set up in 
West London.
In total, 26 community groups and 
organisations	benefited	from	the	initiative,	
which	ran	until	August	2017,	with	127	days’	
volunteering	completed	across	Redefine	
International’s six UK Shopping centres and 
the	head	office	team.

Case study –  
legislative value 
enhancement
Redefine	International	continues	to	consider	
ways	to	deliver	compliance	strategies	that	
are aligned to investors’ interests. This is 
underpinned by our commitment to resilience 
in	governance,	investments	and assets.
Spanning	two	geographic	locations,	the	
Group continually seeks to better understand 
legislation	that	affects	the	portfolio	from	an	
environmental perspective. 2015 marked an 
early	step	in	ensuring	the	EPC	strategy	was	
developed	in	the	most	cost	effective	manner	
whilst	targeting	a	risk	free	status.	
During	the	last	two	years,	any	EPCs	which	
were	found	to	be	missing	were	instructed	and	
any	EPCs	reviewed	and	seen	to	be	within	the	
risk	zone	were	revisited.	Risk	zone	EPCs	were	
classed	as	either	any	existing	‘F’	and	‘G’	rated	
areas of demise across our properties, soon 
to expire EPCs prior to the MEES regulations 
coming	into	play	on	1	April	2018,	affecting	all	
new	leases.	Across	Scotland,	risk	in	relation	
to Section 63 meant that from September 
2016	upon	a	new	sale	or	lease	of	a	building	
greater than 1,000m
2
, an approved Section 
63 action plan must be in place and made 
available	in	the	same	way	as	an	EPC	and	
reviewed annually.	
The	‘action	plan’	identified	targets	for	
improvement of the carbon and energy 
performance	of	the	building	and	how	these	
targets	would	be	met	through	physical	
improvements to the property, all produced 
and	registered	by	a	‘Section	63	Advisor’.	
Categories	of	EPC	risk	were	assigned	based	on	
analysis	of	data	provided.	The	categories	were:	
• risks	that	were	yet	to	be	fully	
investigated (“Risk”);	
• risks	under	control	with	planned	
actions	accounted	for	where	required	
(“Managed Risk”);	and
• risk is managed and declared safe in 
respective	of	relative	jurisdiction	specific	
EPC	legislation	and	known	portfolio	
impacts	have	been	assessed	(“Safe Zone”).
EPCs	which	may	soon	to	expire,	rated	either	
‘F’	or	‘G’	or	lease	or	break	dates	forthcoming	
were	assigned	category	2.	With	respect	to	
MEES,	this	will	mean	that	any	areas	of	demise	
planned for lease from April 2018 may be 
at risk of impacting on asset/unit expected 
rentable value (“ERV”). Thereby any EPC 
recommendations such as improvements to 
improve	building	fabric,	heating	efficiencies	
and lighting can be planned in earlier 
stages	and	either	accrued	centrally	where	
required or foster tenant engagement into 
a planned programme of building upgrades 
to ensure their occupation remains risk 
free as each lease nears expiry and EPC 
recommendations are implemented, ensuring 
minimum disruption and maximum value. 
The total	‘F’	or	‘G’	figure	is	relatively	low	across	
the portfolio	and	the	Group	will	target	planned	
refurbishments to achieve a minimum 
rating of	‘D’.

Our	German	assets	have	been	reviewed	as	
part	of	the	legislative	gap	analysis	with	respect	
to the three pieces of German legislation, 
being EDL‑ G/Energy Services Act, ENEV/Energy 
Saving Ordinance and KrWG/Circular Economy 
Act.	From	information	provided	by	Redefine	
International to third party consultants, the 
following	conclusions	were	drawn:
EDL-G/Energy Services Act
Reporting of total energy 
consumption; energy audits 
of properties and operations
Whilst	the	balance	sheet	of	Redefine	
International exceeds the threshold as set 
out by the EDL‑ G, neither the number of 
employees nor the turnover exceed the 
appropriate	thresholds.	Therefore	Redefine	
does not qualify under the EDL‑ G and does 
not have to meet the requirements. EDL‑ G 
German legislation spans from the EU Energy 
Efficiency	Directive	Article	8.	In	the	UK,	this	
was	translated	into	UK	law	in	June	2014	as	the	
Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”). 
The same third party consultants deemed the 
UK	companies	to	stand	outside	of	qualification	
of ESOS phase one in this respect and 
compliance activity surrounding ESOS Phase 
2	will	be	revisited	ahead	of	the	compliance	
notification	date	of	5	December	2019.
ENEV/Energy Saving Ordinance
Display a building energy performance 
certificate; provide a certificate to 
potential tenants/buyers
Redefine	International’s	portfolio	has	been	
checked in the respect of building energy 
performance	certificates	required	for	display.	
This	comprises	all	buildings	with	a	floor	
space of 500m
2
	or	greater	which	the	public	
access frequently such as supermarkets. 
There are also a number of buildings in 
Redefine’s	portfolio	which	have	been	leased	
since	July	2009	at	which	point	building	energy	
performance	certificates	have	been	provided	
to the interested party. Third party consultants 
understand	this	applies	to	five	units	in	a	mixed	
use building in Leipzig and three units in a 
mixed use building in Munich. It has been 
noted that any buildings leased or sold in the 
future	by	Redefine	must	continue	to	have	
building	energy	performance	certificates	
which	are	provided	to	interested	parties	
at this point.
KrWG/Circular Economy Act
Disposal of waste in line with  
regional requirements
The	disposal	of	waste	is	undertaken	in	line	
with	requirements	through	the	hire	of	a	
competent	waste	disposal	company	where	the	
Company	is	responsible	for	waste	generation.
On the basis our UK and German based 
assets are compliant, data has to be 
managed, maintained	and	updated.	The	
relationship	between	Redefine	International	
and that of their CSR Advisers is one of 
assurance and provides a data repository 
which	can	be	used	during	regular	review,	
reporting and in leading high level through 
to asset	level	discussions	on	where	
compliance activity should be focused. 
A snapshot	into	this	world	here	shows	some	
legislative	risks	and	Redefine’s	interpretation	
of responsible compliance activity. 
With each part of the Legislative Value 
Enhancement	(“LVE”)	process	working	actively	
with	one	another	in	equilibrium,	Redefine

Methodology
Redefine	International’s	carbon	emissions	
disclosure has been produced in accordance 
with	guidance	issued	in	the	ISO	14064‑
1:2006 international standard and the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition). Location based 
emissions factors are sourced from the UK 
Government (2016 & 2017) and International 
Energy Association (to cover German assets). 
Guidance on the reporting of Scope 2 GHG 
emissions	under	the	GHG	Protocol	was	
updated	in	2015	and	we	are	now	required	
to	report	two	different	values	to	reflect	the	
‘location‑based’	and	‘market‑based’	emissions	
resulting from purchased electricity. The 
location‑ based method uses an average 
emission factor for the national grid on 
which electricity	consumption	occurs.	The	 
market‑based	method	reflects	emissions	
from the	electricity	that	companies	have	
chosen to purchase in the market. Where a  
market‑ based emissions factor is unavailable 
the residual mix or location‑ based factor 
has	been	applied.	Markets	differ	as	to	what	
contractual instruments are commonly 
available or used by companies to purchase 
energy	or	claim	its	specific	attributes.	Redefine	
International has chosen to use a supplier 
specific	emissions	rate.	This	method	has	been	
used	in	alignment	with	the	GHG	Protocol’s	
quality	criteria.	In	alignment	with	UK	DEFRA	
Environmental	Reporting	Guidelines,	we	
have used the conversion factor for the year 
the emissions took place. Data is disclosed 
in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013.
Data qualifying notes
The	boundary	of	Redefine	International’s	
carbon emissions disclosure is based 
on the principle of operational control. 
Therefore	emission	sources	within	real	
estate	assets	owned	and	managed	by	
Redefine	International	are	included	in	the	
reported	emission	figures.	We	do	not	have	
responsibility for any emissions sources 
that are not included in our consolidated 
statement. We are not responsible for the 
purchase of the energy supplied to our 
head	office	in	London.	Emission	sources	
relating to occupier activities that do not fall 
under	the	operational	control	of	Redefine	
International	are	excluded,	except	where	we	
are responsible for procurement and supply 
of	energy	to	occupiers.	Due	to	adjustment	of	
our emission scope compared to the previous 
year	(2016),	we	have	chosen	to	recalculate	the	
previous	year’s	emission	figures	as	the	hotels,	
although	owned	are	not	under	the	operational	
control	of	Redefine	and	had	previously	been	
included in prior year’s reporting. We have 
also	adjusted	our	normalisation	metric,	from	
Net Operating Income to Net Rental Income, 
to ensure that the measure of carbon intensity 
is	better	reflective	of	our	business	type.	For	
2016 and 2017, there have been no reported 
fugitive emissions from air‑ conditioning 
refrigerant leaks, and there has been no  
top‑ up of refrigerant volume.
CSR adviser’s statement
As	Redefine	International’s	strategic	adviser	
on corporate social responsibility, Savills 
would	like	to	acknowledge	the	continual	
improvement	demonstrated	by	Redefine	
International	in	terms	of	their	focus	on	how	
they have chosen to implement, maintain 
and	improve	Redefine’s	CSR	strategy.	
The continuation	of	robust	data	collection	
supported by core reporting systems 
provides	a	strong	basis	on	which	to	focus	
environmental	efficiency	improvements	
and strengthen reporting against best 
practice standards and industry benchmarks. 
Special comment should be noted for the 
significant	action	taken	in	respect	of	Redefine	
International’s preparation for the upcoming 
MEES legislation across England and Wales 
and Section 63 in Scotland, leaving the 
Company 100 per cent risk free. In addition, 
the commitment given by their CSR Steering 
group has been invaluable to reaching their 
year’s	CSR	Targets.	Redefine	International	is	
a proactive	Company	that	considers	their	CSR	
responsibility	to	be	embedded	within	their	
core	operations	and	integrated	within	their	
investment strategy for short, medium and 
long	term	growth.	Our	engagement	with	the	
Company	has	shown	that	employees	have	
high	levels	of	interest	with	respect	to	the	
Company	CSR	initiatives	and	are	well	equipped	
to	proceed	with	their	implementation	and,	by	
ensuring	that	sufficient	time	and	resources	
are	made	available,	Redefine	International	
will	effectively	tackle	both	the	straightforward	
and	the	more	challenging	targets	which	have	
been	approved	within	the	CSR	Roadmap	
for	the	2018	financial	year.	We	confirm	
that environmental data published in this 
report provides a true representation of the 
Company’s	current	performance.	Savills	will	
continue	to	support	Redefine	International	
over the coming year to achieve their 2018 
CSR	targets	and	will	provide	progress	updates	
within	the	CSR	Committee	held	quarterly	prior	
to preparing next year’s CSR Annual Report 
and	corresponding	updates	to	their	website.

strategy to sustain the Company through 
potential uncertainties ahead.
Directors’ report
Governance
Chairman’s  
statement
2017 has been a year of political and economic 
uncertainty with a constantly changing 
macroeconomic backdrop. With a sharper 
focus on risk management and mitigation, 
the Redefine International Board remains 
confident that it has the right strategy to 
sustain the Company through potential 
uncertainties ahead, whilst continuing to 
provide our shareholders with market-leading 
income returns.
During the year the Board has sought 
to strengthen the portfolio, through the 
recycling of assets with lower rental or growth 
potential, in favour of assets with stronger 
property fundamentals and longer-term 
growth prospects. Disposal proceeds have 
largely been reinvested or used to reduce 
gearing. Refinancing initiatives have broadly 
been concluded at lower levels of gearing 
and resulted in a reduced cost of debt and a 
stronger capital structure. 
Communication of the Company’s strategy 
was conveyed to shareholders at the Capital 
Markets Day in February, which was well 
attended and received. The Board’s decision 
to rebase the dividend to better align earnings 
with operating cash flow has been clearly set 
out and communicated. The Company has 
made significant progress in becoming the 
UK’s leading income focused REIT.
On 1 December 2017, the Company will be 
rebranded to Real Estate Diversified Income 
REIT, or RDI REIT. The purpose of rebranding 
is to ensure the Company has a clear and 
independent identity as well as supporting 
better communication with stakeholders.
Greg Clarke
Chairman of the Board
Through communication with its wider 
stakeholder base, the Company strives 
to improve both our buildings and the 
environments they provide whilst contributing 
where possible to communities in which 
we operate. We endeavour to ensure that 
our suppliers adhere to a strict code of 
ethics and undertake to pay them fairly and 
within agreed timeframes. We build strong 
relationships with our lenders and deal with 
them in an open and transparent manner. 
We encourage openness amongst our 
employees and listen to their concerns, while 
supporting them to develop their careers 
and work-life balance through training and 
transition through various stages in their lives.
At the heart of our success is our culture. 
Both internally and externally, the Company 
is considered agile and experienced, 
hands on, proactive, efficient, personable 
and approachable. The personable and 
experienced nature of the Board and its 
executive has resulted in a strong leadership 
team. A team that is relentlessly inquisitive, 
seeking out new opportunities with agility 
enabling opportunities to be harnessed. 
Boardroom culture is good natured and 
constructive and relationships between 
executives and non-executives are good, 
although with the uncertainty of the 
political and economic environment, the 
non-executives have been increasingly 
challenging management to ensure that 
the long-term success of the Company has 
been properly considered. An analysis was 
conducted in January to record how Redefine 
International should react to a range of 
different scenarios that could be faced by 
the Company in the next few years. The 
Board evaluation conducted at year end 
showed that Directors wanted more time set 
aside to review strategy, to ensure that the 
current model remains fit for purpose in the 
constantly changing economic environment.
As Chairman of the Board and Nominations 
Committee, I have sought to expand the 
experience and diversity of the Board and  
I am confident that the appointment of a  
new Non-executive Director will be announced 
before the end of the calendar year which 
will further enhance the strength of the 
Board. Succession planning for the executives 
and committee chairs will be a focus area 
during 2018. Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 61
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
I thank shareholders for their support of the 
Company’s new Remuneration Policy, which 
was approved at the AGM in January 2017. 
During 2016 the CEO received 62 per cent 
of his target income, considerably below 
comparable peers. The policy was amended 
following a strategic review to ensure closer 
alignment between remuneration, strategy 
and shareholder returns. The new policy 
provides the executives with a fair and 
balanced package that motivates performance 
and rewards results. 
For the first time this year, the Company will 
be reporting under the 2016 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”) and the Audit 
and Risk Committee adopted new model 
terms of reference to comply with the 
provisions of the new Code, FRC guidance and 
revised ethical standards published earlier 
this year. Focus areas for the committee this 
year have been to oversee compliance and 
regulatory change, improvement in internal 
controls and risk reporting.
With robust corporate governance, a strong 
Board and strategy, I am pleased to report 
that the Company has delivered a solid set of 
results and is well positioned to look to the 
future with confidence. 
Full details of the Company’s operations have 
been laid out in this Annual Report, which the 
Board has reviewed and considers to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
shareholders with the necessary information 
with which to assess the Company’s position 
and performance, business model and 
strategy. The Board recommends that 
shareholders vote to adopt the Annual Report 
and support the re-election of the Board at 
the AGM to be held on 25 January 2018, where 
Directors will be available to answer any 
questions shareholders may have regarding 
the operation of their Company.
I have informed the Board that I intend to 
step down as Chairman during 2018. The 
exact timing will be determined by the 
process to recruit a new Chair and execute 
an appropriate handover. 
By this time I will have been Chairman of 
Redefine International for seven years, during 
which time we have domiciled to London, 
become a REIT and entered the FTSE 250. 
I consider it time to move on and for a new 
Chair to oversee the next exciting phase of 
Redefine International’s future.
Greg Clarke
Chairman of the Board
26 October 2017
Corporate governance statement 
Compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 (the “Code”)
Redefine International is a UK-REIT with a 
premium listing on the Main Market of the LSE 
and a secondary listing on the “Real Estate – 
Real Estate Holding and Development” sector 
of the Main Board of the JSE. The Company 
was incorporated in the Isle of Man with 
registered number 111198C in 2004 and was 
re-registered under the Isle of Man Companies 
Act 2006 in December 2013, with registered 
number 010534V. The Company’s home state 
is the United Kingdom.
Further to the secondary listing of the 
Company in South Africa on 28 October 2013, 
the JSE accepted that Redefine International 
will primarily comply with the Code as 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in April 2016 (www.frc.org.uk) as opposed 
to the provisions of the King IV Report on 
Governance for South Africa 2016. It should 
be noted that during the reporting year ended 
31 August 2017 and up to the date of this 
document the Company has complied with all 
of the Code principles, but has not complied 
with the following Code provisions: 
a. Code B.1.2. Half of the Board should 
comprise independent Non-executive 
Directors. 
  Explanation: At year end, the Board 
comprised four executives, four 
independent non-executives and two 
non-executives who represent the major 
shareholder, Redefine Properties Limited. 
  Although the composition fails to meet 
the provisions of the Code, the Board 
structure does meet the Code principles, 
with no block of individuals dominating 
the decision making and includes an 
appropriate combination of Executive 
and Non-executive Directors. With an 
additional appointment expected by 
the end of the year, the balance will 
be improved, but in order to reach the 
required Board composition another 
independent Non-executive Director would 
need to be appointed, taking the Board 
size to 13, which is considered too large. 
  It should be noted that to ensure that 
there is enough independent oversight 
of related party transactions, a committee 
comprising solely of independent 
Directors has been established to review 
such matters before deciding whether a 
transaction can progress to the Board for 
final consideration. 
b. Code B.2.3: Non-executive Directors 
should be appointed for a specified term.
  Explanation: Directors are appointed for 
a term which expires when either the 
Director (i) is not re-appointed following 
retirement, (ii) is removed or vacates office, 
(iii) resigns or does not offer himself  
for re-election, or (iv) terminates his 
appointment on three months’ notice. 
It should be noted, that, as a FTSE 250 
company, all Directors are subject to annual 
re-election and therefore it is considered 
that the Company’s terms are appropriate.
c. Code E2.4: Notice of general meetings.
  Explanation: The EGM held on 25 April 
2017, regarding the acquisition of the 
German supermarket Portfolio, was held 
on 14 clear days notice in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association, 
rather than the 14 business days 
required by the Code. This was due to the 
transaction being time sensitive and the 
Board was mindful that any delay would 
cause a transactional risk. 
Compliance with the Listing Rules
During the reporting year, Redefine Properties 
Limited was regarded as a controlling 
shareholder of the Company in accordance 
with LR 6.1.2A. As a Chapter 6 Company with a 
controlling shareholder, Redefine International 
has complied with LR 9.8.4 R (14):
1.  The Company entered into a relationship 
Agreement with Redefine Properties on 
17 November 2014 (the “Agreement”) and 
the Board confirms that during the period 
under review:
a. the Company has complied with the 
independence provisions included in 
the Agreement;
b. as far as the Company is aware, 
Redefine Properties has complied with 
the independence provisions included 
in the Agreement; and 
c. the election and re-election of 
independent Directors at the AGM held 
on 23 January 2017 was conducted in 
accordance with the election provisions 
of LR 9.2.2.E and LR 9.2.2F R and 
approved by:
i. the shareholders of the Company; 
and
ii. the independent shareholders of 
the Company.
2.  No independent Director has declined to 
support the statements in (1) above.
Compliance with the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules

The Board
Led by the Chairman, the Board is collectively responsible for the long term success of the Company and operates under a formal 
quarterly schedule of matters reserved for the Board. This ensures that the Company’s strategy and objectives, risks, Group operations, 
internal controls, policies and debt providers are all reviewed throughout the year. To assist in the effectiveness of its operations, 
certain matters are delegated to committees whose roles and duties are outlined in terms of reference set by the Board. The committee 
chairs provide a summary of the committee activities at each Board meeting, advising of any issues or recommendations.  
Day-to-day management of the Company is overseen by the CEO and the executives, who carry out the strategy established by the Board, 
within the confine of policies and delegated authorities set by the Board.
Each year, four scheduled Board meetings are held, aligned to the financial calendar, and there are four scheduled update calls.

All members and

Directors
Redefine International is an income focused 
diversified UK-REIT, listed in the UK and 
South Africa, with properties in the UK and 
Germany. For such a diversified company, 
it is essential that the Board has the right 
balance, knowledge and skills appropriate for 
overseeing the business and, as the Chairman 
is responsible for the leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board, it is appropriate 
for the Nominations Committee to be led by 
the Chairman, Greg Clarke. Two independent 
Non-executive Directors, from the UK and SA,

Board composition 
The Nominations Committee started the year 
by reviewing the size and mix of the Board. 
Since 2015 the Board has comprised 11 
Directors: the Chairman, four executives, 
four independent non-executives and two 
non-executives. This composition is not 
compliant with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, and although the Board works well, the 
Nominations Committee was mindful that 
there was not enough independent oversight 
on the Board, and was intent on improving the 
level of independence. However, in 2016 due 
to the pending requirement for a prospectus 
in February 2016 to support the capital raise, 
for which a new Director would have taken full 
responsibility, it was considered in everyone’s 
best interests that the matter be put on hold. 
The Nominations Committee was keen to 
address this matter again in 2017.
Before commencing the search for a new 
independent Non-executive Director, the 
Nominations Committee reviewed the mix 
of the Board to identify any potential area of 
weakness, to ensure that the Board was fully 
equipped to deal with the current strategy 
and any potential challenges ahead. The 
Committee agreed with the conclusions of last 
year’s external evaluation that the Board had 
a good balance of skills with a strong industry 
focus and deep financial expertise with 
sufficient knowledge of the European markets, 
and no major skill gaps. 
Diversity was considered. The Directors 
number ten male and one female, aged from 
38 to 74, with a range of different educational 
backgrounds from the UK, South Africa and 
New Zealand. Although the Nominations 
Committee considered there to be a diversity 
of thought, the Board is committed to having 
an appropriate level of diversity which 
reflects the nature of the Group’s operations. 
The Committee acknowledged that gender 
diversity and ethnicity was poor.
ZRG Partners LLC, which has no prior 
connection with the Company, was appointed 
to assist with the search for an independent 
Non-executive Director and instructed to 
encourage a wide pool of candidates with 
experience of Board membership, evidence 
and understanding of business strategy and 
shareholder value creation with property or 
property finance expertise. A long list of 50 
diverse candidates was drawn up, 14 were 
interviewed and four were recommended 
to be shortlisted. Those shortlisted were 
discussed at length by the Nominations 
Committee assisted by Robert Orr, an 
independent Non-executive Director 
with a depth of property experience. 
The two best candidates were interviewed by 
the CEO, and separately by the Nominations 
Committee. As well as assessing skills and 
experience, it was important that the new 
Director fit into the Board chemistry, as 
the current Board works well as a team. 
The Boardroom culture is good natured 
and constructive and relationships between 
Executive and Non-executive Directors are 
good, although Non-executive Directors are 
not afraid to challenge executives during 
meetings. The Chairman and CEO set a 
tone of openness and thoroughness which 
is upheld by the Board, and Directors hold 
themselves to a high standard of integrity.
Following an in-depth discussion between 
the Nominations Committee and all the 
independent Non-executive Directors to 
consider the merits of each candidate, a 
final recommendation will be made to the 
Board in the near future. It is hoped that an 
announcement will be made to shareholders 
before the end of the year. 
The appointment of an additional  
independent Non-executive Director will 
improve the level of independent oversight, 
and will provide an opportunity to review 
and possibly refresh membership of the 
Committees. Diversity on the Board will also 
be improved, and the Company is confident 
it will be able to meet its target of one third 
female membership by 2020. 
Appointment terms 
All new Non-executive Directors are provided 
with a letter of appointment detailing the 
terms of their appointment and their expected 
commitment to the role. Non-executive 
Directors are not appointed for a specified 
term, but until the Director is either (i) not re-
appointed following retirement, (ii) removed 
or vacates office, (iii) resigns or does not offer 
himself for re-election, or (iv) terminates his 
appointment on three months’ notice. 
All Directors are expected to attend the 
quarterly Board meetings, quarterly update 
calls, any committees of which they are 
a member and shareholders meetings. 
Non-executive Directors are expected to make 
themselves available for a minimum of eight 
days per year in the discharge of their duties.
The Board has agreed that any Director may, 
if necessary in the furtherance of their duties, 
take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, subject to having first 
notified the Company Secretary. Any such 
payment by the Company would, of course, be 
subject to any restriction under company law.
The Company has liability insurance which 
covers Directors and officers of the Company 
and any subsidiary company of Redefine 
International.
Conflict of interest policy
Directors are not, without the consent of 
the Board, to accept any other appointment 
or enter into any arrangement which might 
reasonably be expected to lead to a conflict 
of interest arising. 
Furthermore, Directors must not hold any 
directorships of any company (other than the 
Company or a subsidiary of the Company) of 
which any Director of the Company or any 
of its subsidiaries or of the property adviser 
or property manager to the Company (or 
any shareholder of such entities) is also a 
Director without the prior written approval 
of the Board. Any possible appointments are 
discussed with the Chairman to ensure that 
there are no conflicts of interest or that a 
Director’s independence is not compromised. 
Directors’ induction 
An induction afternoon is provided by the 
executive team, which includes an overview 
of the historical activities of the Group, 
funding options and providers and property 
details. Further information is provided on the 
Company’s key business and risks along with 
the latest financial information for the Group. 
The Company Secretary provides a list of 
matters reserved for the Board, the corporate 
calendar and an overview of the Directors’ 
obligations for an Isle of Man company with 
a dual listing. Further information is provided 
tailored to the needs of each Director. 
Meetings with key advisers are set up, as 
required, and tours of the properties are 
undertaken to provide a full overview of the 
Company’s activities. 
Directors are also provided with details of the 
Board evaluation undertaken at the end of 
the financial year. Redefine International P.L.C.

Directors’ report
Governance
Board evaluation
The 2017 evaluation was performed using an online questionnaire which allowed each Director 
to anonymously evaluate the performance of the Chairman, the individual Board members, the 
Board operations and its committees. 
The main strengths of the Board identified were:
• the diversity of expertise;
• the level of experience; 
• the robust debate; and 
• the agility of the Board to respond to situations. 
All Directors enjoyed Board meetings, which is a key characteristic of a motivated and successful 
team. However, with the uncertainty of Brexit and the UK economy, Directors highlighted 
that, for the year ahead, more focus and time should be spent on the points listed below. 
Disappointingly, these are broadly the same points as raised at last year’s external evaluation, 
although action has already been taken to address many of these points:
Long term 
strategic 
decision 
making
Long term decision making is to be addressed with strategy days planned for next year. 
Thorough  
risk analysis
Risk governance has been a strong focus for the Audit and Risk Committee meetings during 
the year. Full details of their review and findings were presented at the October Board meeting 
and will continue to be presented to the Board on a six month basis going forward to ensure 
that the Board, as well as the Audit and Risk Committee, have a full overview of risks.
Shareholders 
and 
stakeholders
The work of the CSR Committee is now finding momentum and, as it becomes embedded into 
everyday operations, will improve and increase importance in 2018, the road map for which 
can be found on page 59 of the Annual Report.
Board 
composition
Board composition will be improved with the appointment of a new Independent 
Non-executive Director enhancing independence and diversity on the Board. Composition will 
continue to be reviewed.
Succession The Nominations Committee has been primarily focused on succession planning for the CEO. 
Mike Watters was CEO of the management company from 2008 and, following internalisation 
of management, became the CEO of Redefine International in 2013. The possible retirement 
or departure of such a long standing employee obviously is a large risk to the Company and 
the Chairman has been personally managing the development of the Deputy CEO, Stephen 
Oakenfull, involving mentoring, arranging external residential management development 
programmes and increased external networking. 
A succession plan of internal candidates has been drawn up by management, and a 
presentation by the pipeline candidates will be given to the Non-executives next year so they 
are able to meet and question the potential successors to the executives.
Directors’ training 
As part of the evaluation, each Director was assessed by the rest of the Board. The Chairman 
discussed the results with each Director. Any training and development needs were identified 
and Directors were encouraged to update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the 
Company to fulfil their roles on the Board. 
Advisers and managers may be asked to present at meetings to provide Directors with detailed 
information relating to the Company. Property tours are undertaken to enable Directors to view 
the Company’s assets and discuss matters directly with the responsible asset manager.
At each Board meeting, Directors are kept abreast of changes to regulatory rules and corporate 
governance matters and any concerns or developments regarding, inter alia, insurance, health 
and safety, sustainability, bribery and whistleblowing, cyber security and the Modern Slavery Act.

Committee

Directors’ re‑ election
All Directors will be standing for re-election 
at the AGM on 25 January 2018. The Chairman 
considers that each of the Directors continue 
to be effective members of the Board, that 
collectively they hold the requisite range 
of skills to enable the Board to operate 
successfully, and the Directors function well 
together as a team. 
It is noted that Michael Farrow and 
Gavin Tipper have both been on the Board 
for six years. Michael Farrow and Gavin Tipper 
were evaluated by the rest of the Board as 
being either good or outstanding Directors 
and were considered to spend sufficient time, 
and were committed to their roles as Directors 
of the Board and as chairs of committees. 
The Chairman therefore recommends all 
Directors for re-election at the AGM on 
25 January 2018. 
Re‑ election of independent Directors
The interests of each of the independent 
Directors are monitored to ensure that 
their position is not compromised and are 
checked each year against the requirements 
of the Code, to ensure their independence is 
still valid. 
The Chairman is satisfied that Michael Farrow, 
Gavin Tipper, Sue Ford and Robert Orr 
remain independent in both character and 
judgement and adhere to the independence 
criteria of the Code. 
Their biographical details can be found on 
pages 62 to 65 and are contained in the AGM 
Notice of Meeting.

The Board endeavours to regularly engage 
and communicate clearly with shareholders 
throughout the year, promoting dialogue 
with both existing and potential investors 
on Company strategy, management, 
remuneration and governance. The four 
Executive Directors, who act as the primary 
contact for institutional shareholders, are 
supported by the Head of Investor Relations 
with Non-executive Directors attending and 
meeting investors at results presentations and 
property tours. 
Directors are kept informed of investor 
relations through a quarterly report and 
timely updates. They are provided with 
analyst coverage of the Company and any 
feedback received from investors. In addition, 
shareholders are invited to directly contact 
the executives to raise any matters, opinions 
or issues of concern with the Company and 
are encouraged to attend the AGM to put any 
questions to the Board, in person.
January 2017 AGM 
The AGM was held on 23 January 2017 
at the Company’s head office in London. 
Approximately 70 per cent of all shareholders 
voted but it was noted that a significant 
amount of shareholders, particularly on the 
JSE register, voted against four resolutions, 
namely: the new Remuneration Policy (20.09 
per cent), the general Directors’ authority to 
allot shares (20.56 per cent); the disapplication 
of pre-emption rights limited to a five per cent 
issuance of shares for cash (19.54 per cent) 
and a further five per cent issuance of shares 
for cash in connection with a specified 
investment (21.10 per cent). The proposed 
authorities were in line with current UK 
guidelines, but the Board is aware that such 
guidelines differ to those in South Africa and 
advised that it would continue to liaise with 
South African shareholders on such matters.
February 2017 Capital Markets Day
A Capital Markets Day was held in February 
which was well attended by both buy side 
and sell side analysts, reflecting efforts by the 
Company to engage with these audiences. 
The general consensus on conclusion of all 
meetings was that the majority of holders and 
non-holders were supportive of the long-term 
strategy to rebase the dividend in exchange for 
a higher growth outlook and stronger balance 
sheet whilst still maintaining a top quartile 
dividend yield. There was some concern 
about how the Company would balance 
the reduction of LTV, whilst maintaining a 
sufficiently strong dividend yield to ensure the 
Company’s shares remain attractive. Caution 
and concern was also raised around Brexit, 
and the Company will endeavour to provide 
information regarding how this issue is being 
addressed. The event was seen as a success 
and there was appetite for the Company to 
host similar events in the future.
April 2017 EGM
An EGM was held on 25 April 2017, in 
connection with the proposed acquisition 
of the controlling interest in the German 
supermarket portfolio. The EGM was called 
on 14 days’ clear notice in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association due to 
the transaction being time sensitive and the 
Board was mindful that any delay could cause 
transactional risk. 59 per cent of independent 
shareholders voted, with shareholders voting 
overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal. 
January 2018 AGM
This year’s AGM is due to be held at 11.00am 
on 25 January 2018, at the Company’s new 
Head Office at 33 Regent Street, London, 
SW1Y 4NE. The AGM Notice will be sent to 
shareholders on 15 December 2017, more 
than 20 business days in advance of the 
meeting, and will contain all the notes for the 
proposed resolutions rather than referencing 
sections in the Annual Report, for the 
shareholders’ convenience and consideration.
It should be noted that, following significant 
opposition to certain resolutions at the 
2017 AGM, the executives have liaised with 
South African investors. The routine request 
authorising Directors to allot up to one third 
of the existing issued share capital and a 
further one third for pre-emptive rights issues, 
has subsequently been reduced to a general 
authority to allot 20 per cent of the Company’s 
current issued share capital, of which half, it is 
proposed, could be issued in cash. This level is 
more in line with South African guidelines, and 
the Board hopes that shareholders will now be 
supportive of all resolutions at the 2018 AGM.

The Committee comprises three independent 
Non-executive Directors, who are considered 
to have the necessary skills, knowledge and 
professional qualifications to understand 
the financial complexities of the Company’s 
business, the applicable accounting standards 
and regulatory framework and who, as a 
whole, have experience of working in the 
property sector in which the Group operates. 
• Gavin Tipper is a Chartered Accountant 
with over 25 years’ financial experience in 
listed and unlisted companies, including 
property companies; 
• Sue Ford is also a Chartered Accountant 
with over 30 years of financial experience 
and was a co-founder and, until 2013, 
the finance director of Metric Property 
Investments, a UK-REIT focused on the 
retail sector of commercial real estate; and 
• Michael Farrow is a Chartered Secretary 
with 30 years’ experience who has worked 
in a number of listed and private property 
companies.
The terms of reference under which the Audit 
and Risk Committee operates were updated 
and approved by the Board in July 2017. These 
take account of the changes incorporated in 
the 2016 UK Corporate Governance Code, 
against which the Company is reporting this 
year, and the FRC guidance and revised ethical 
standards published earlier this year. 
The terms of reference outline the role of 
the Audit and Risk Committee relating to 
the interests of shareholders regarding 
financial reporting, internal controls and risk 
management. The Committee also seeks to 
provide the Board with assurance regarding 
the efficacy and reliability of the financial 
information used by the Directors in the 
discharge of their duties, and to comment on 
associated risks. 
The Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the effectiveness of internal controls, the 
internal and external auditors, the provision 
of non-audit services and the independence 
of the external auditor. It is also responsible 
for reviewing and assessing the integrity of 
the risk control systems, for ensuring that risk 
policies and strategies exist and that there is 
an effective risk management process in place. 
Details of the principal risks facing the Group 
are set out on pages 16 and 17 and in note 34 
to the financial statements.
The Committee held four meetings during 
the financial year, aligned to the Company’s 
financial reporting and risk management cycle. 
Committee packs are sent out seven days 
in advance of meetings to allow members 
time to properly consider the matters to 
be discussed. Independent external advice 
may be taken by the Committee if required, 
although none was sought this year. Time is 
provided during the year for the Committee 
to meet privately with both the external and 
internal auditors, without the executives or 
management being present, to discuss any 
potential issues or concerns.
All meetings were attended by the Committee 
members, the Chief Financial Officer and 
representatives of the auditors. Valuers 
attended two meetings to discuss the 
processes undertaken in determining the 
market values of selected portfolios at each 
reporting date. The valuers for the UK and 
German shopping centre portfolio were 
invited to attend this year.
During the year the Committee reported 
to the Board at each Board meeting on its 
responsibilities: 
Audit plans
• 
the Committee met with the external 
auditor at the audit planning and reporting 
stages to consider and discuss the audit 
strategy and plan, the results of the audit 
work undertaken and areas of significant 
complexity, judgement or uncertainty; and
• the Committee approved the internal 
auditor’s risk based audit plan for the 
financial year and the related audit fee.
Reviewing effectiveness
• 
of the external and internal auditors;
• of internal controls, particularly financial 
controls, and confirmed to the Board that 
they remained appropriate;
• of the systems of risk management; and
• of the Group’s whistleblowing and 
anti-bribery policies.
Monitoring
• 
REIT compliance;
• the level of non-audit services provided by 
the external auditor; 
• cyber risk and security;
• reports from the JSE addressed to Audit 
Committee chairs; and
• compliance with statutory and listing 
obligations.
Assurances
• 
met with independent property valuers 
to discuss the valuation processes 
applicable to selected property portfolios 
and considered the appropriateness of 
the assumptions underlying the property 
valuations; and
• received and reviewed reports from 
the Group’s Chief Financial Officer and 
Financial Controller relating to the various 
assurances provided by the committee.
Recommendations to the Board
• 
the dividend;
• the Annual Report as a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Group’s 
financial position and results for the 
financial year;
• the interim and annual financial 
statements, the accounting policies used, 
and the appropriateness of the related 
judgements and estimates;
• the Group’s viability statement, including 
the appropriateness of the underlying 
methodology, assumptions and stress tests 
applied (refer to page 17);
• the appropriateness of the application 
of the going concern concept (refer to 
page 92); and
• the re-appointment of the external auditor. Redefine International P.L.C.

Significant areas of judgement
In recommending the financial statements 
to the Board, the Committee assessed 
whether suitable accounting policies had been 
adopted and whether management had made 
appropriate estimates and judgements. The 
Committee considered areas of judgement 
when assessing classification, provisioning 
and the appropriateness of inputs used in 
arriving at fair value. The following matters are 
examples of the complex areas of estimation 
and judgement considered by the Committee 
during the year.
Valuation of investment property
Investment property valuations are the most 
significant judgement in the Group’s balance 
sheet and changes to valuations can impact 
materially on financial performance. Property 
valuations require significant judgements 
and estimates and are based on assumptions 
including estimated rental values, future rental 
income, anticipated maintenance costs and 
future development costs and market yields. 
The conclusion of the Committee was that:
• the valuation processes, which included 
the use of external valuers, appeared to be 
thorough and meticulous;
• the assets were valued on a highest 
and best use basis, consistent with 
prior periods;
• the assets were valued using reasonable 
estimates and professional judgements; 
and
• the assets were valued on a basis which 
took account of comparable market 
transactions.
Fair value of restructured liabilities
New borrowings or existing borrowings 
which have been substantially modified are 
recognised at fair value. The determination 
of fair value involves the application of 
judgement with the key judgement involving 
an assessment of whether the transaction 
price equates to fair value, and if not, what the 
market price should be. During the year the 
Group refinanced its Aviva UK shopping centre 
facility and it was determined that a significant 
modification had occurred. Judgement was 
applied to determine whether the contractual 
rate on the refinanced debt represented 
a market rate and if not, what observable 
market rate should apply having regard to 
the term, duration and security arrangements 
in place. The Committee concluded that 
the approach taken by management was 
reasonable and that the transaction price 
was not a market price and that sufficient 
observable inputs were available. 
Taxation
The Committee satisfies itself as to the 
judgements applied in the calculation 
of any provisions for taxation where 
final determination of the amounts was 
outstanding.
Risk management review
A Risk Register has been established which 
aggregates the Group’s significant risks from 
its various divisions and corporate functions. 
The threshold for a risk to be determined as 
“significant” was established as being either 
a risk carrying a potential impact of five per 
cent or greater of the Group’s distributable 
earnings; or a risk with the potential to expose 
the Group to reputational damage. The risks 
as reflected in the risk register were reviewed, 
challenged and analysed to highlight any 
significant shifts in the Group’s risk profile. 
In comparison to last year key changes were:
• political and economic uncertainty resulting 
from Brexit, leading to potential volatility in 
share prices and valuations;
• higher expectations on inflation and a 
consequential impact on interest rates;
• changing consumer behaviour and the 
impact on rental income, tenant default, 
and valuation on the retail portfolio;
• development risk due to delays and the 
resultant impact on returns;
• the type of cladding and insulation 
materials in place, following the Grenfell 
disaster;
• tax risk arising from enquiries or changing 
legislation (BEPS and new tax evasion 
legislation);
• key person and key supplier risk;
• potential terrorist action; and
• an improvement in the outlook for Europe, 
reducing the risk of adverse foreign 
currency fluctuations. Redefine International P.L.C.

Report on internal controls and 
effectiveness of internal audit 
The internal auditor reported to the 
Committee at each of its meetings, with the 
main areas of focus during the year being 
liquidity forecasting, risk management, 
capital expenditure, human resources and 
compliance.
With the appointment of a dedicated in-house 
resource and the appointment of Grant 
Thornton as internal auditor last year, the 
internal audit framework within the Company 
has improved. 
The internal auditor tracks the issues to be 
resolved, and ensures that they are suitably 
addressed within an agreed timeframe. 
Effectiveness, independence and 
appointment of the external auditor
KPMG was appointed via a tender process 
in 2010 and has expressed their willingness 
to remain in office. The Committee intends 
to put the audit out to tender during 2018, 
which aligns with the scheduled rotation of 
the audit partner.
The Committee has undertaken its annual 
review, with the auditor, of any threats to 
its independence and has concluded that 
the auditor may continue to be considered 
as independent.
In this regard KPMG has informed the 
Committee of all significant facts and 
matters, including those related to the 
provision of non-audit services, and the 
safeguards it has in place to maintain its 
independence, which it considers may 
impact on its independence, and the 
objectivity of the main audit partner on the 
team. KPMG undergoes regular reviews 
of the composition of the audit team, 
including rotation in accordance with 
relevant regulations. 
In assessing the effectiveness and level 
of service from the external auditor, the 
Committee considered KPMG’s knowledge 
of the market and Group, the depth of 
understanding of the key accounting and audit 
judgements, the extent to which the audit 
plan was carried out, input from management 
and the content of the auditor’s reports to the 
Committee. The Committee was satisfied with 
the effectiveness of the external audit.
The Committee monitored the ratio of audit 
to non-audit services, and related fees and the 
level of non-audit services and fees incurred 
during the year was compliant with the 
Company’s policy in that regard.
The Committee is satisfied that KPMG 
is independent, and recommends the 
re-appointment of KPMG at the Company’s 
AGM on 25 January 2018.

Remuneration – unaudited
Annual statement by the 
Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (“RemCo”)
For the year ended 31 August 2017 
(not subject to audit)
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present the Directors’ remuneration report 
for the year ended 31 August 2017. It should 
be noted that as an Isle of Man company, 
Redefine International is voluntarily reporting 
under the UK regulations in order to provide 
transparency to our shareholders. 
2017 Policy: New Executive 
Remuneration Policy approved by 
shareholders on 23 January 2017
At the start of the financial year, the RemCo 
concluded that the executive remuneration 
package, but particularly the outcome of the 
LTIP, did not correctly reflect the executives’ 
performance nor did it align with shareholder 
returns achieved over the same period. 
A strategic review of the remuneration policy 
was therefore undertaken. 
A new remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors was recommended and approved by 
79.91 per cent of shareholders at the AGM on 
23 January 2017 (the “New Policy”) and applied 
to all remuneration components awarded 
after that date. The New Policy will remain 
in place for the next three years unless any 
material changes are proposed. No changes 
have been proposed to the executive 
remuneration policy this year.
A summary of the New Policy can be found 
on pages 84 to 85. 
Remuneration for the 
2017 financial year
2017 Performance: the table overleaf shows 
how the executives have implemented the 
strategic priorities as detailed on pages 14 and 
15 of this Annual Report, and how their 
actions reflect on the bonus targets.
2017 Salary: awarded 1 September 2016.
The average salary increase for employees  
for 2017 was 6.3 per cent. A 15 per cent salary 
increase was awarded to the Deputy CEO to 
bring his salary closer to that of the CEO and 
to recognise his increased responsibilities 
within the executive team. All other executives 
received a 5 per cent increase which, although 
above inflation, still resulted in their salaries 
being in the lower quartile of our peer group.
2017 Bonus: awarded for the performance 
period 1 September 2016 – 31 August 2017.
Due to redressing the balance between long 
and short term compensation, the maximum 
executive bonus has increased from 
100 per cent to 150 per cent of base salary. 
Having exceeded the targets set for cash flow, 
NAV and achieving the target for earnings, the 
executives have been awarded a cash bonus 
of 121.9 per cent of base salary. Of the award, 
60 per cent will be settled in cash immediately 
with 40 per cent deferred for two years, 
subject to continuous employment in the 
Group, and to be settled in shares. The bonus 
award is in line with in the lower quartile of 
the FTSE 250, where the Company is currently 
positioned. 
2017 LTIP vesting: for the three year 
performance period ended 31 August 2017.
The performance period for the award related 
to the three years ending 31 August 2017 and 
was subject to the historic TSR performance 
conditions. The outcome of the LTIP award 
has again resulted in nil vesting. 
2017 LTIP Contingent award: awarded 
for the three year performance period from 
1 September 2016 to 31 August 2019.
Contingent awards, equivalent to 200 per cent 
of salary, were made to each of the executives 
on 25 January 2017. These will be subject to the 
performance criteria set out in the New Policy 
approved at the 2017 AGM and will, subject to 
performance, vest on 25 January 2020. 
2017 Single figure remuneration: the 
total remuneration package received for 
the 2017 resulted in the executives’ total 
salaries remaining in the lower quartile of the 
FTSE 250. On average, the executives received 
56 per cent of target remuneration outlined in 
the implementation scenario within the 2014 
Annual Report.
2017 Non‑ executive Director fees
On 1 September 2016, Non-executive 
Directors received a fee increase of £3,000 
and the Chairman received an increase in 
fee of £6,500. These awards were made in 
recognition of increased responsibilities 
following the completion of AUK transaction, 
and the substantial augmentation of the 
Company. This resulted in the standard  
Non-executive Director fee being £43,000, 
although the Audit and Risk Committee chair 
was paid £50,500 and the Remuneration 
Committee chair was paid £48,000 to 
recognise their additional time commitments. 
Following the review of the remuneration 
policy by the RemCo and the work undertaken 
by the Investment Committee for the AUK 
transaction, the Board wished to acknowledge 
the increase in responsibilities, significant 
time commitment shared by all the committee 
chairs and resolved that the fees of all 
committee chairs be brought in line. From 
1 December 2016, all committee chairs have 
been paid £50,500.
Although these increases were above market 
norm, the fees for the Non-executive Directors 
and chairs remained in the lower quartile of 
the FTSE 250.

Link to  
strategy

Higher earnings
45% 50%
(budget met)
• Capital was recycled into assets with stronger potential growth or used to lower 
the level of gearing and associated finance costs, which has strengthened the 
balance sheet and capital structure. 
• Newer assets have delivered significant value. The AUK assets have seen 
6.2% valuation growth and 7.2% growth in triple net income since their 
acquisition in 2016.
• Asset management activities targeting our best performing assets. 
Demonstrated through the potential development of Charing Cross Road, 
London and extensions at Banbury Cross Retail Park and Holiday Inn 
Express Southwark.
Growth in NAV
45% 100%
(120% of budget 
achieved)
• Disposals totalled £148.2 million during the year, at an average 12.2% premium 
to book value. Properties sold tended to demonstrate weak longer term growth 
potential, thus strengthening the underlying property fundamentals of the 
portfolio. 
• Active recycling of capital into assets demonstrating stronger property 
fundamentals.
• Focusing on assets in geographical locations with the best growth potential. 
Demonstrated with the IHL acquisition where properties are located in the 
South East of England or big six UK centres.
Stronger operating 
cash flow
22.5% 100%
(120% of budget 
achieved)
• Re-financing activity has seen the average cost of debt reduced to 3.1% (from 
3.4% in 2016, resulting in a significant finance cost saving).
• Internal cost of capital reduced with stronger dividend cover and headroom on 
operational cash flow.
• Maintained headroom over operational cash flow to invest in asset management 
initiatives to grow value.
• More flexible capital structure has allowed the Group to apply available cash 
reserves against revolving credit facility to achieve lower ratcheted margin 
throughout the year.
• Extended debt maturity profile following refinancing initiatives removing 
refinancing risk with no significant maturities until 2020.
Personal objectives
37.5% 85%
(at RemCo’s 
discretion)
• Leadership: at the Capital Markets Day held in February 2017, the Company 
outlined clear and measurable medium term targets and the executives have 
demonstrated conviction in executing and delivering on all targets throughout 
the year.
• Communication with shareholders:
• extensive UK and South African road shows and to meet, explain and listen 
to major shareholder views;
• positive investor and analyst feedback following simplification of strategic 
objectives, clear communication, and no surprises in full results; and
• active engagement with investment market as demonstrated by the quantum 
of capital recycling completed and premiums to book values achieved.
• Communication with stakeholders: CSR initiatives undertaken to engage with 
communities and tenants, GRESB improvement and all suppliers required to 
abide by our code of ethics.
• Loyalty of staff: a desirable working culture and environment has been 
developed, demonstrated by a low staff turnover and a positive employee 
survey outcome.

Statement of implementation 
of remuneration for the 
2018 financial year
Set out below is a summary of the planned 
implementation of the remuneration policy 
for the financial year ending 31 August 2018.
2018 Salary: awarded 1 September 2017.
   2017 2018
Mike Watters  £391,000 £406,600
Stephen Oakenfull  £278,100 £289,200
Adrian Horsburgh  £253,100 £263,200
Donald Grant   £235,200 £244,600
Average salary increases of 4.6 per cent 
have been awarded to employees for 
2018, which was arrived at using a base 
inflationary adjustment of +2.5 per cent with 
additional increases awarded to recognise 
extra responsibilities, progress made in 
professional exams and changes in roles. 
Taking this into account, and a review 
of relevant market data, the executives were 
all awarded a 4 per cent increase. 
2018 Pension and benefits: Company 
pension contribution remains at 12.5 per cent 
of salary for the CEO and 9 per cent of salary 
for other Executive Directors. Other benefits 
comprise life assurance, private medical 
insurance, car allowance (CEO only), incapacity 
benefit, season ticket allowance and Directors’ 
and officer’s insurance.
2018 Annual bonus: to be awarded for 
the performance period 1 September 2017 – 
31 August 2018.
Executive Directors can be awarded a bonus 
of up to 150 per cent of salary. This is based 
on underlying distributable earnings (45 per 
cent), adjusted NAV growth (45 per cent), 
operating cash flow performance (22.5 per 
cent) and personal objectives (37.5 per cent). 
40 per cent of any award made will be subject 
to a two year deferral period, to be settled 
in shares. The targets for financial measures 
are deemed to be commercially sensitive. 
However, retrospective disclosure of the 
targets and performance against them will be 
provided in future remuneration reports.
2018 LTIP vesting: relating to the three year 
performance period ending 31 August 2018.
The awards made on 28 October 2015, for 
the performance period 1 September 2015 to 
31 August 2018, will vest on 28 October 2018. 
These awards are the last awards subject 
to the old policy performance conditions, 
approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM. 
This required the attainment of certain targets, 
each weighted at 50 per cent, relating to the 
performance of the Company’s TSR against 
the TSR of two comparator groups namely, 
(i) a bespoke peer group TSR and (ii) the FTSE 
EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index.
2018 Contingent LTIP Award: to be awarded 
for the three year performance period ending 
31 August 2020.
Executive Directors will receive an LTIP 
award over shares worth 200 per cent of 
salary, with the relevant performance targets 
being based on underlying distributable 
earnings per share (50 per cent), relative 
TSR (25 per cent) and relative total property 
return (25 per cent) all measured over a 
three year performance period. These 
measures are intended to align the awards 
with the Company’s strategic objectives and 
with shareholder interests. In particular: (a) 
the EPS measure is designed to incentivise 
distribution growth to shareholders; (b) the 
relative TSR measure (retained from the 
previous policy but with a reduced weighting) 
measures the total shareholder return of the 
Company against an appropriate index, and 
provides a direct link between shareholder 
returns and compensation; and (c) the relative 
total property return measure is designed 
to incentivise the enhancement of portfolio 
quality and distribution growth. Targets for 
these measures are set out on page 89.
Non‑ executive Director remuneration
The table below shows the fee structure for 
Non-executive Directors for 2018. 
   2017 fees 2018 fees
Chairman of the Board  £94,500 £98,000
Audit and Risk Committee  
chair fee   £50,500 £52,000
Remuneration Committee

Investment Committee  
chair fee   £50,500 £52,000
Basic non-executive fee £43,000 £45,000
It is acknowledged that Non-executive Director 
fees remain below market average. Increases 
take effect from 1 September 2017. Aggregate 
fees for seven Non-executive Directors 
amounts to £389,000. 
The Nominations Committee has reported 
on its search for a new independent  
Non-executive Director. It is hoped that an 
appointment will be made before the end of 
the year, which will result in aggregate fees for 
the Non-executive Directors totalling £434,000 
p.a. This exceeds the current £420,000 
aggregate limit set out in the Articles of 
Association and therefore a resolution will be 
proposed at the AGM on 25 January 2018 to 
amend the limit of fees to £500,000 p.a. 
Annual General Meeting
The full remuneration report for the financial 
year ended 31 August 2017 can be found on 
pages 86 to 91. 
The RemCo recommends the remuneration 
report to shareholders and hopes that 
shareholders will support the resolution 
at the AGM on 25 January 2018.

company size, ownership, sector, 
risk and other company specific 
factors. Its recommendations are

specified term but are appointed 
for a term which expires when 
either the Director is (i) not 
re-appointed following retirement 
in accordance with the Articles of 
Association; (ii) removed or vacates 
office; (iii) resigns or does not offer 
themselves for re-election; or

It should be noted that a resolution will be proposed at the AGM on 25 January 2018 to increase the limit of fees to £500,000.
The Non-executive Directors do not receive remuneration other than fees but are entitled to be paid all reasonable travelling, hotel and other 
expenses properly incurred in attending meetings of the Board, committees of the Board, general meetings or otherwise in connection with the 
business of the Company.

Component Purpose Operation Maximum potential value Applicable performance measures Claw back Exit payments
Base salary A fixed market 
competitive 
remuneration 
base to attract and 
retain executives of 
sufficient quality to 
deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Normally reviewed annually with changes effective 1 September. 
However the Company is under no obligation to award an increase 
following the review.
No maximum salary is set.
Increases are dependent on the results of the 
annual review, and are normally in line with the 
average increase for the wider work force, inflation 
and market data. However, increases may be made 
above this level at the RemCo’s discretion to take 
account of individual circumstances such as an 
increase in scope and responsibility or to reflect the 
individual’s development and performance in a role 
or for alignment to a market level.
None None Termination of the service contract can be given by either party 
by way of notice in writing for a period not exceeding 12 months. 
Payment may be given in lieu of notice, subject to the Company’s 
sole and absolute discretion, up to a maximum of one year’s 
basic salary. There is no provision in the contracts for loss of 
office payments, other than those required by employment law.
Pension Part of the overall 
package providing 
comprehensive 
remuneration and 
retirement benefits.
The Company contributes monthly to the Directors’ personal pension 
plans. At the Company’s discretion, a cash allowance of equivalent value 
may be offered.
The Company contributes between 9% and 12.5% 
of their base salary.
Values vary by Directors and are 
reviewed periodically.
None None Payments would cease on the leaving date.
Other benefits Part of the overall 
package providing 
comprehensive 
remuneration.
• Life assurance
• Private medical insurance
• Incapacity
• Season ticket allowance
• Directors’ and officers’ insurance
• Car allowance
• Other benefits may be provided as appropriate
As the costs of providing benefits will depend on a 
Director’s individual circumstances, the RemCo has 
not set a monetary maximum.
None None All benefits would cease on the leaving date.
Bonus – STIP A short term incentive 
to reward executives 
on their personal 
performance and 
the Company’s 
performance in line 
with shareholder 
returns.
Performance will be assessed in line with specific KPIs, 75% of the 
award will focus on financial measures and 25% on personal objectives. 
The purpose of the personal objectives is to encourage leadership, 
loyalty of staff and to communicate with stakeholders, particularly 
shareholders, in a transparent manner.
Designed to offer an annual bonus of between 0% to 
150% of the executives’ base salary. Payable in cash 
and deferred shares.
40% of award to be settled in shares, subject to a 
two year deferral period.
An executive is entitled to dividends on shares under 
the STIP award which will accrue over the deferral 
period and will be paid on vesting.
KPIs are based on:
• 15% operating cash flow;
• 30% underlying distributable earnings;
• 30% adjusted NAV growth; and
• 25% personal objectives.
The financial KPIs (1-3) are calibrated according to the level of 
budget met:
• Less than 90% budget – nil;
• Meeting budget – 75%; and
• 120% of budget – 150%.
The deferred shares are 
subject to a two year deferral 
period conditional only upon 
continued employment 
(subject to the RemCo’s 
discretion such as in the event 
of long term illness or death).
If the employment of an executive is terminated for any reason 
or if he is under notice of termination (whether given by the 
executive or the Company) at or before the date when a bonus 
might otherwise be payable, he will have no right to receive a 
bonus or time apportioned bonus, save that the RemCo will have 
discretion to award a time apportioned bonus to a Good Leaver 
for the year of cessation.
LTIP award A long term incentive 
to align the executives’ 
interests with those of 
the shareholders and 
to promote the long 
term success of the 
Company.
Structured as a rolling annual award of performance shares with a 
three year performance period.
Awards are granted as:
• nil cost options to acquire shares; or
• contingent rights to receive shares.
Such awards may carry award dividends entitling the executive to 
dividends which would have been received on the vested shares  
during the vesting period, payable either in cash or ordinary shares.
• The aggregate number of shares which may be 
awarded may not exceed 23,000,000 over the 
ten year life of the LTIP.
• Individual awards in any financial year shall not be 
greater than 200% of the executive’s base salary, 
but in exceptional circumstances an award can be 
made up to 400% of the executive’s base salary, 
providing that such an award does not exceed 
7,000,000 shares.
Awards will vest at the end of a three year period dependent on the 
following performance conditions:
• 50% of the award is to be linked to underlying distributable earnings 
per share. 25% of the award will vest upon attaining earnings per 
share comparable with the immediate preceding financial year, with 
100% vesting achieved for average annual outperformance of CPI 
during the performance period of 1%;
• 25% of the award to be linked to FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed 
Europe Index performance. 25% of the award will vest for median 
performance with 100% vesting achieved for upper quartile 
performance; and
• 25% of the award to be linked to the relative total property return of 
the Company’s UK assets in comparison to IPD UK All Property Index. 
• 25% of the award will vest once performance reaches that of the 
benchmark with 100% vesting achieved for 2% outperformance.
In circumstances where 
an error has been made 
in determining the extent 
to which the performance 
conditions were met, financial 
results have been materially 
mis-stated or the executive 
has contributed to serious 
reputational damage to the 
Company or engaged in 
serious fraud or misconduct, 
the RemCo, in its absolute 
discretion, may determine 
that an award will cease 
or lapse or impose further 
conditions on the award. 
If the executive leaves employment of the Company other than 
as set out below, the award will lapse or cease to be exercisable 
on the leaving date.
If the executive leaves employment for reasons such as ill 
health, redundancy or retirement (or any other reason at the 
discretion of the RemCo) or in the event of a takeover, scheme 
of arrangement, demerger or winding up of the Company, the 
RemCo, acting fairly and reasonably, will determine whether and 
to what extent a performance target shall then be deemed to 
be satisfied. Subject to that determination, the award will vest in 
proportion to the extent of the vesting period which has expired 
at the date of the relevant event.
In the event that an executive is not re-elected by shareholders 
at an annual general meeting of the Company, the vesting of any 
awards will be subject to the discretion of the RemCo. Redefine International P.L.C.

Summary of the Executive Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 23 January 2017
Component Purpose Operation Maximum potential value Applicable performance measures Claw back Exit payments
Base salary A fixed market 
competitive 
remuneration 
base to attract and 
retain executives of 
sufficient quality to 
deliver the Group’s 
strategy.
Normally reviewed annually with changes effective 1 September. 
However the Company is under no obligation to award an increase 
following the review.
No maximum salary is set.
Increases are dependent on the results of the 
annual review, and are normally in line with the 
average increase for the wider work force, inflation 
and market data. However, increases may be made 
above this level at the RemCo’s discretion to take 
account of individual circumstances such as an 
increase in scope and responsibility or to reflect the 
individual’s development and performance in a role 
or for alignment to a market level.
None None Termination of the service contract can be given by either party 
by way of notice in writing for a period not exceeding 12 months. 
Payment may be given in lieu of notice, subject to the Company’s 
sole and absolute discretion, up to a maximum of one year’s 
basic salary. There is no provision in the contracts for loss of 
office payments, other than those required by employment law.
Pension Part of the overall 
package providing 
comprehensive 
remuneration and 
retirement benefits.
The Company contributes monthly to the Directors’ personal pension 
plans. At the Company’s discretion, a cash allowance of equivalent value 
may be offered.
The Company contributes between 9% and 12.5% 
of their base salary.
Values vary by Directors and are 
reviewed periodically.
None None Payments would cease on the leaving date.
Other benefits Part of the overall 
package providing 
comprehensive 
remuneration.
• Life assurance
• Private medical insurance
• Incapacity
• Season ticket allowance
• Directors’ and officers’ insurance
• Car allowance
• Other benefits may be provided as appropriate
As the costs of providing benefits will depend on a 
Director’s individual circumstances, the RemCo has 
not set a monetary maximum.
None None All benefits would cease on the leaving date.
Bonus – STIP A short term incentive 
to reward executives 
on their personal 
performance and 
the Company’s 
performance in line 
with shareholder 
returns.
Performance will be assessed in line with specific KPIs, 75% of the 
award will focus on financial measures and 25% on personal objectives. 
The purpose of the personal objectives is to encourage leadership, 
loyalty of staff and to communicate with stakeholders, particularly 
shareholders, in a transparent manner.
Designed to offer an annual bonus of between 0% to 
150% of the executives’ base salary. Payable in cash 
and deferred shares.
40% of award to be settled in shares, subject to a 
two year deferral period.
An executive is entitled to dividends on shares under 
the STIP award which will accrue over the deferral 
period and will be paid on vesting.
KPIs are based on:
• 15% operating cash flow;
• 30% underlying distributable earnings;
• 30% adjusted NAV growth; and
• 25% personal objectives.
The financial KPIs (1-3) are calibrated according to the level of 
budget met:
• Less than 90% budget – nil;
• Meeting budget – 75%; and
• 120% of budget – 150%.
The deferred shares are 
subject to a two year deferral 
period conditional only upon 
continued employment 
(subject to the RemCo’s 
discretion such as in the event 
of long term illness or death).
If the employment of an executive is terminated for any reason 
or if he is under notice of termination (whether given by the 
executive or the Company) at or before the date when a bonus 
might otherwise be payable, he will have no right to receive a 
bonus or time apportioned bonus, save that the RemCo will have 
discretion to award a time apportioned bonus to a Good Leaver 
for the year of cessation.
LTIP award A long term incentive 
to align the executives’ 
interests with those of 
the shareholders and 
to promote the long 
term success of the 
Company.
Structured as a rolling annual award of performance shares with a 
three year performance period.
Awards are granted as:
• nil cost options to acquire shares; or
• contingent rights to receive shares.
Such awards may carry award dividends entitling the executive to 
dividends which would have been received on the vested shares  
during the vesting period, payable either in cash or ordinary shares.
• The aggregate number of shares which may be 
awarded may not exceed 23,000,000 over the 
ten year life of the LTIP.
• Individual awards in any financial year shall not be 
greater than 200% of the executive’s base salary, 
but in exceptional circumstances an award can be 
made up to 400% of the executive’s base salary, 
providing that such an award does not exceed 
7,000,000 shares.
Awards will vest at the end of a three year period dependent on the 
following performance conditions:
• 50% of the award is to be linked to underlying distributable earnings 
per share. 25% of the award will vest upon attaining earnings per 
share comparable with the immediate preceding financial year, with 
100% vesting achieved for average annual outperformance of CPI 
during the performance period of 1%;
• 25% of the award to be linked to FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed 
Europe Index performance. 25% of the award will vest for median 
performance with 100% vesting achieved for upper quartile 
performance; and
• 25% of the award to be linked to the relative total property return of 
the Company’s UK assets in comparison to IPD UK All Property Index. 
• 25% of the award will vest once performance reaches that of the 
benchmark with 100% vesting achieved for 2% outperformance.
In circumstances where 
an error has been made 
in determining the extent 
to which the performance 
conditions were met, financial 
results have been materially 
mis-stated or the executive 
has contributed to serious 
reputational damage to the 
Company or engaged in 
serious fraud or misconduct, 
the RemCo, in its absolute 
discretion, may determine 
that an award will cease 
or lapse or impose further 
conditions on the award. 
If the executive leaves employment of the Company other than

Executive bonus (Audited)
The maximum bonus for the year ended 31 August 2017 was capped at 150 per cent of annual base salary, 40 per cent of any bonus is deferred 
in shares.
Bonuses are based on the performance against three financial KPIs and each individual’s personal objectives, apportioned as follows:
• 25 per cent personal objectives;
• 15 per cent operating cash flow;
• 30 per cent underlying earnings; and 
• 30 per cent adjusted NAV.
The personal objectives award is at the RemCo’s discretion and is designed to encourage leadership, loyalty of staff and communication with 
stakeholders and shareholders in a transparent manner. In reaching their decision the RemCo considered the Capital Markets Day held in February, 
at which the Company communicated to shareholders clear and measurable medium term strategic targets. The Executives have demonstrated 
strong leadership and clear conviction in executing the strategy throughout the year resulting in tangible progress across all areas. Key personnel 
have been retained and there has been a low staff turnover. An increased time commitment and prominence given to CSR matters, has resulted in 
the Company’s improved GRESB rating. A table illustrating the executives’ performance against the Bonus KPIs and strategy can be found on page 81.
The financial KPIs are compared to the Board approved budget as follows:
Level of budget met      Bonus awarded (% of respective weighting)
Less than 90% budget           Nil
Meeting budget           50%
120% of budget           100%
The actual target ranges for 2017 for the financial performance measures have not been disclosed. This is considered by the Board to be 
commercially sensitive as certain aspects could be considered to constitute a profits forecast. Retrospective disclosure of the target ranges will 
be made in next year’s annual report on remuneration once the information is no longer considered commercially sensitive.

The RemCo is committed to publishing the financial performance targets once they cease to be commercially sensitive. The financial performance 
targets that applied in respect of the year ended 31 August 2016 are no longer commercially sensitive; accordingly, the targets and the Company’s 
performance against these targets are now set out below. 
The 2016 annual bonus awards were based 75 per cent on financial performance and 25 per cent on the individual’s performance during the year.

Awards cannot be made during closed periods and therefore awards are not granted until a closed period has ended.
The awards will vest three years from the date of grant subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of performance targets. 
The figures above reflect the maximum number of shares that may vest. The actual number to vest will be dependent on performance against 
comparator targets over the applicable performance period. 
2015 and 2016 awards vesting schedule
The 2015 and 2016 awards are subject to the LTIP policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM and will be measured against two total 
shareholder return related performance targets:
• 50 per cent of any such award will be subject to a performance target which measures the Company’s TSR relative to that of the members 
of a bespoke comparator group; and
• 50 per cent of the award will be subject to a performance target which measures the Company’s TSR relative to that of each of the members 
of EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index.
The 2015 and 2016 awards are subject to the following vesting schedule: 
Relative TSR performance          Percentage of one half  
FTSE EPRA/NAREIT          of an award that vests
Upper quartile           100%
Between median and upper quartile         Between 25% and 100%
Median            25%
Below median            0%
2017 awards vesting schedule
The 2017 awards are subject to the LTIP policy approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM with the relevant performance targets measured over a 
three year period being based on:
• 50 per cent on underlying earnings per share;
• 25 per cent on relative TSR; and 
• 25 per cent on relative total property return.
The 2017 awards are subject to the following vesting schedule which forms part of our shareholder approved New Policy:
Performance condition Applicable measure Vesting thresholds
Growth in underlying earnings per share Immediately preceding financial year earnings per share • 25% on attaining previous earnings per share
• 100% on achieving average annual outperformance 
of CPI plus 1%
• Straight line vesting between 25% and 100%
Relative TSR FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index • 25% on achieving median performance
• 100% on achieving upper quartile performance
• Straight line vesting between 25% and 100%
Relative total property return of the UK portfolio IPD All Property Index • 25% for performance in line with IPD
• 100% achieved for 2% outperformance
• Straight line vesting between 25% and 100%
The RemCo may adjust (upward or downwards) the extent to which a LTIP award would otherwise vest if it considers that such level of vesting is not 
reflective of overall corporate performance or of the executives’ personal performance. Redefine International P.L.C.

This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 26 October 2017 and signed on its behalf by:
Michael Farrow
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Directors’ report
Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 92

Results and proposed dividends
The Group statement of comprehensive income is set out on page 100 and shows a profit attributable to equity holders of the Parent 
of £78.7 million.
The Board has declared a second interim dividend of 1.3 pence per share, or a scrip alternative. Dispatch of share certificates or the cash dividend 
will be paid on 18 December 2017 to those shareholders on the register as at 1 December 2017, and will result in a total dividend of 2.6 pence per 
share for the financial year. 
Going concern
At 31 August 2017 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed facilities were £63.4 million and its capital commitments were £16.8 million. 
Weighted average debt maturity of 7.3 years and LTV adjusted for events occurring up until the day of signing this year’s Annual Report was 
of 50.0 per cent, which provides sufficient headroom against financial covenants. Attention is also drawn to the viability statement contained 
within the Group’s principal risk disclosures on pages 16 and 17.
After considering severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors are satisfied that there continues to be a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will have the resources it requires to meet on-going and future commitments. Accordingly, the 2017 financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.
Issued share capital
As at 31 August 2017 the Company’s total issued share capital was 1,828,060,146 ordinary shares of 8.0 pence each. Increases in the issued 
share capital during the year have resulted from the following:
Date       Reason for issue  Shares issued Total
1 September 2016      Start of the financial year  — 1,794,598,650
12 December 2016      Scrip dividend  17,141,172 1,811,739,822
26 June 2017      Scrip dividend  16,320,324 1,828,060,146
Further details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown in Note 25 to the financial statements. Redefine International has one class of 
share; all shares rank equally and are fully paid.

of shareholders can be found in the Company’s Articles, available on the website www.rdireit.com.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of shareholding nor on the transfer of ordinary shares imposed by the Articles of Association of 
the Company.
Other than in connection with the 150 million Euro secured exchangeable bonds issued by Redefine Properties Limited in September 2016, 
exchangeable into shares of Redefine International P.L.C. (the “Exchange Property”) and connected stock lending agreements, that may result 
in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights in connection with the Exchange Property, the Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights.

Purchase of own shares and shares in Treasury
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders granted the Directors authority to make market purchases of ordinary shares in the Company in certain 
circumstances and to hold those shares in Treasury. 
Shares were purchased by the Company in 2011, but Directors have no present intention of exercising this power. The authority to purchase shares 
would only be exercised after careful consideration by the Directors and as and when conditions were favourable, with a view to enhancing earnings per 
share and/or net asset value per share, which would be of benefit shareholders.
Legislation in the Isle of Man was enacted in 2014 which allows companies who buy their own shares to hold them in Treasury rather than cancel 
them, up to a maximum of 10 per cent. If the Company purchased its own shares it would therefore hold such shares as treasury shares which the 
Company could sell for cash. All rights attaching to shares purchased under this authority, including voting rights and rights to dividends, would be 
suspended whilst they were held in treasury. 
During the financial year and up until the date of this document, no shares were purchased and no shares were held in Treasury. 
Notified shareholdings
As at the date of this report, the Company had been notified, or was otherwise aware, of the following persons who were directly or indirectly 
interested in three per cent or more of the issued share capital of the Company.

Dealings of Directors and their Persons Closely Associated
The Company adheres to a strict Share Dealing Code in line with the Market Abuse Regulations, which prohibits persons discharging managerial 
responsibility (“PDMR”) dealing in shares for a designated period preceding the announcement of its annual and interim financial results, or any 
other period considered price sensitive. PDMRs are advised of such periods, and acknowledge their obligations and potential sanctions if the 
obligations are breached. Dealings in shares by PDMRs are strictly monitored during the year with the necessary RNS announcements and FCA 
notifications being made in respect of dealings performed by PDMRs or persons closely associated with them, as required.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
The Group and Company financial statements are required by IFRS, as issued by the IASB, to present fairly the financial position and performance of the Group and 
Company respectively.
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the financial statements of the Group and Company comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB and, in the case of the Company, in accordance with those 
parts the Isle of Man Companies Acts 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time its financial position. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and Company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibility statement
Each of the Directors confirms that to the best of each person’s knowledge and belief;
• the Group and Company financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and 
financial position of the Group and Company at 31 August 2017 and, in the case of the Group, of its profit for the year then ended and in the case of the 
Company, its loss for the year then ended;
• the adoption of a going concern basis for the preparation of the Group and Company financial statements continues to be appropriate based on the year end 
position and having reviewed the forecast financial position of the Group;
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
• the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Annual Report is published on the Group’s website. The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

1 Our opinion is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of 
Redefine International P.L.C. (“the Group” or “the 
Company”) for the year ended 31 August 2017 
which comprise the Group and Company Income 
Statements, the Group and Company Statements of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Company 
Balance Sheets, the Group and Company Statements 
of Changes in Equity, the Group and Company 
Statements of Cash Flows and the related notes,

financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is the Isle of Man Companies 
Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRS”).
2 Key audit matters: our assessment  
of risks of material misstatement 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our 
professional judgement, were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements and include 
the most significant assessed risks of material 
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) 
identified by us, including those which had the 
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing 
the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise 
below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of 
audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion 
above, together with our key audit procedures to 
address those matters and, as required for public 
interest entities, our results from those procedures. 
These matters were addressed, and our results are 
based on procedures undertaken, in the context 
of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental 
to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters. 
Group financial statements
Valuation of investment property 
Refer to page 76 (Audit Committee Report), page 106 (key judgement in accounting policies) and pages 119 to 121 (financial disclosures)
The key audit matter
The valuation of the Group’s investment 
properties involves significant judgements 
made by management using the advice of 
external valuers, particularly those around the 
selection of valuation models and the inputs to 
those models, current market conditions and 
rental levels.
The valuation exercise also relies on the 
completeness and accuracy of the underlying 
lease and financial information provided to the 
valuers by management.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In this area our audit procedures included, among others:
• assessing management’s process for reviewing and addressing the work of the external valuers;
• assessing the competence, objectivity and integrity of the external valuers. This assessment included 
but was not limited to assessing their professional qualifications, experience and independence from 
the Group;
• discussing and where appropriate, challenging, the external valuers in respect of:
• the valuation process adopted; 
• the significant assumptions used and critical judgement areas in the valuation process including 
break clauses, future lease income and yields; and
• the performance of the relevant portfolio.
• for certain portfolios, using our internal valuation specialists to assist us in critically assessing the 
valuation methodology applied, considering whether the methodology is in line with accounting 
principles and also to challenge key inputs in light of market indicators;
• testing on a sample basis the integrity of the information provided to the independent valuers used in 
valuing the properties, by agreeing that information to underlying agreements; and
• considering the completeness and adequacy of the disclosures associated with investment property.
Our Results
• 
based on the results of our testing, we consider the investment property valuations to be acceptable.
Debt refinancing
Refer to page 76 (Audit Committee Report), page 107 (key judgement in accounting policies) and pages 128 and 129 (financial disclosures).
The key audit matter
In determining the fair value of debt on initial 
recognition, the Group must assess whether 
fair value equals the transaction price or, 
specifically, whether the contractual interest 
rate agreed with the counterparty reflects 
a market interest rate. If an alternative 
interest rate is applied in the measurement 
of fair value, the Group must corroborate 
why the contractual rate is not considered 
representative of a market rate.
In reflecting the difference between the 
estimated fair value of the debt and the 
transaction price, the difference is taken to 
profit and loss, only if the interest rate derived 
is based on observable inputs.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In this area our audit procedures included, among others:
• assessing whether the new debt arrangement was considered a substantial modification in 
accordance with the provisions of IAS 39;
• assessing whether the contractual refinanced rate was considered representative of an “off‑market” 
transaction having regard to corroboratory market evidence;
• assessing the reasonableness of the market interest rate applied to the refinanced debt to calculate 
fair value on initial recognition; and
• assessing the completeness and accuracy of the calculations and journal entries associated with the 
refinancing.
Our Results
Based on the results of our testing, we consider the accounting treatment of the debt refinancing to be 
acceptable.
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view 
of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
affairs as at 31 August 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and of the Company’s loss for the year 
then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IASB”); and
• the Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
issued by the IASB.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with 
International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs 
(UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities are 
described below. We believe that the audit evidence 
we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate 
basis for our opinion.

Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
Tax 
Refer to page 76 (Audit Committee Report), pages 108 and 109 (accounting policy) and pages 118 and 131 (financial disclosures)
The key audit matter
The Group has a significant and diversified 
portfolio across the UK and Europe and is 
therefore subject to the relevant tax legislation 
in a number of jurisdictions.
The Group encounters challenges by tax 
authorities on a range of tax matters during 
the normal course of business and recognises 
provisions for anticipated tax audit issues 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes 
will be due. The calculation of these provisions 
is underpinned by judgemental assumptions as 
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In this area our audit procedures included, among others:
• including KPMG international and domestic taxation specialists in the Group audit team. These 
specialists evaluate the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group and its taxation advisers 
in calculating the taxation provisions for the period. Particular focus is placed on assumptions relating 
to provisions for uncertain tax positions;
• specifically considering the taxation risks arising from the Group’s operations when assessing 
the accounting for taxation related balances and applying sensitivity analysis to determine the 
appropriateness of key judgements; and
• assessing the presentation and disclosure in respect of taxation related balances and considering 
whether the Group’s disclosures reflect the risks inherent in the accounting for the taxation balances.
Our Results
• 
based on the results of our testing, we consider the Group’s treatment of uncertain tax positions to 
be acceptable.
Company financial statements
Investment in subsidiary undertakings 
Refer to page 109 (accounting policy) and page 121 (financial disclosures)
The key audit matter
Investments in subsidiary undertakings 
are carried in the Company’s separate 
financial statements at cost less impairment. 
Impairments of these investments are 
determined by reference to the EPRA 
adjusted net assets of the Group.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings is 
significant as the subsidiary’s performance 
can directly impact that of the Company. 
How the matter was addressed in our audit
In this area our audit procedures included, among others:
• assessing the carrying value of subsidiaries for any objective indicators of impairment; and
• assessing the accuracy of management’s fair value calculations.
Our Results
• 
based on the results of our testing, we consider the carrying value of investments in subsidiary 
undertakings to be acceptable.
3 Our application of materiality and 
an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the Group financial 
statements as a whole was set at £16.3 million 
(2016: £16.7 million). This has been calculated 
with reference to a benchmark of total assets  
(of which it represents circa 1 per cent 
(2016: 1 per cent)), which we consider to 
be one of the principal considerations for 
members of the Company in assessing the 
financial performance of the Group. Redefine 
International P.L.C., as a property company, 
generates a return which is largely dependent 
on the assets held. Materiality for the Company 
financial statements as a whole was set at 
£6.4 million (2016: £6.0 million), determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Company 
total assets, of which it represents 1 per cent 
(2016: 1 per cent). 
We reported to the Audit Committee all 
corrected and uncorrected misstatements we 
identified through our audit with a value in 
excess of £0.8 million (2016: £0.8 million), in 
addition to other audit misstatements below 
that threshold that we believe warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
The Group consists of a number of components, 
all of which, with the exception of the Group’s 
30.4 per cent (2016: 25.3 per cent) investment 
in RedefineBDL Hotel Group Limited, are 
accounted for at the Group’s head office in 
London. The Group audit team performed the 
audit of all other components, including the 
audit of the Company, within the Group as 
if it were a single aggregated set of financial 
information. These components represent 
99.3 per cent (2016: 99.3 per cent) of total assets 
and 98.5 per cent (2016: 80.2 per cent) of Group 
profit before tax.
The audit was performed using the materiality 
level set out above.
The remaining 0.7 per cent (2016: 0.7 per cent) 
of total Group assets and 1.5 per cent (2016: 
19.8 per cent) of Group profit before tax is 
represented by the Group’s investment in 
RedefineBDL Hotel Group Limited, which is 
considered immaterial to the Group’s 
financial position.
4 We have nothing to report  
on going concern 
We are required to report to you if:
• we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to the Directors’ 
statement in Note 2 to the financial 
statements on the use of the going concern 
basis of accounting with no material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
over the Group and the Company’s use of 
that basis for a period of at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; or 
• the related statement under the Listing Rules 
set out on page 92 is materially inconsistent 
with our audit knowledge. 
We have nothing to report in these respects.  Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 98
Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report continued
to the members of Redefine International P.L.C.
5 We have nothing to report on the 
other information in the Annual Report 
The Directors are responsible for the other 
information presented in the Annual Report 
together with the financial statements. Our 
opinion on the financial statements does not 
cover the other information and, accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion or, except 
as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether, 
based on our financial statements audit work, 
the information therein is materially misstated 
or inconsistent with the financial statements or 
our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work 
we have not identified material misstatements in 
the other information. 
Strategic report and Directors’ report 
Based solely on our work on the other 
information: 
• we have not identified material 
misstatements in the strategic report and the 
Directors’ report; and
• in our opinion the information given in those 
reports for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Disclosures of principal risks 
and longer‑term viability 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during 
our financial statements audit, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
• the Directors’ confirmation within the viability 
statement on page 17 that they have carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that 
would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency and liquidity; 
• the Directors’ statement of principal risks 
describing these risks and explaining how 
they are being managed and mitigated; and 
• the Directors’ explanation in the viability 
statement of how they have assessed 
the prospects of the Group, over what 
period they have done so and why they 
considered that period to be appropriate, 
and their statement as to whether they have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to 
review the viability statement. We have nothing 
to report in this respect. 
Corporate governance disclosures 
We are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies 
between the knowledge we acquired 
during our financial statements audit 
and the Directors’ statement, where the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report 
and financial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and 
strategy; or 
• the section of the Annual Report describing 
the work of the Audit Committee does 
not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We are required to report to you if the Corporate 
Governance Statement does not properly 
disclose a departure from the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the 
Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to 
report in these respects. 
6 Respective responsibilities 
Directors’ responsibilities 
As explained more fully in their statement set 
out on page 95, the Directors are responsible 
for: the preparation of the financial statements 
including being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view and otherwise comply with the 
Isle of Man Companies Act 2006; such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that 
are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error; assessing the Group 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern; and using the going 
concern basis of accounting unless they either 
intend to liquidate the Group or the Company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
Auditor’s responsibilities 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial 
statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud, other 
irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinion 
in an auditor’s report. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but does not guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud, other irregularities or error and 
are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken 
on the basis of the financial statements. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud or other irregularities is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as 
it may involve collusion, forgery, intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control and may involve any area 
of law and regulation, not just those directly 
affecting the financial statements.
A fuller description of our responsibilities  
is provided on the FRC’s website at  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. 
7 The purpose of our audit work and to 
whom we owe our responsibilities 
This report is made solely to the Company’s 
members, as a body. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

2. Significant accounting policies
2.1 Statement of compliance 
The Group financial statements for the year ended 
31 August 2017 have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”). The Company financial 
statements, have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRS as issued by the IASB and with those parts of 
the Isle of Man Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. The relevant new 
standards, amendments and interpretations that 
have been adopted, as applicable by the Group and 
the Company, during the year are set out below.
Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012‑2014 cycle
• IFRS 5 ‘Non‑Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations’ (amendment) (“IFRS 5”)
• IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
(amendment) (“IFRS 7”)
Other amendments

(amendment) (“IAS 1”)
• IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ 
(amendment) (“IAS 16”)
• IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’ (amendment) (“IAS 27”)
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’ (amendment) (“IAS 28”)

(amendment) (“IFRS 12”)
The adoption of these improvements and 
amendments has not had a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group or Company. The 
accounting policies otherwise applied are the same 
as those applied in the audited financial statements 
as at and for the year ended 31 August 2016.
Disclosed in the following table are the relevant 
new standards, amendments and interpretations 
that have been issued by the IASB but are not yet 
effective or have not been early adopted. The impact 
of these improvements and amendments on the 
financial statements is being assessed.

2.2 Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in Great 
British Pounds, which is the functional currency of 
the Company and the presentational currency of 
the Group, and rounded to the nearest hundred 
thousand pounds. They are prepared using the 
historical cost basis except for investment property, 
certain assets held for sale, derivative financial 
instruments and financial instruments designated 
at fair value through profit and loss, all of which are 
carried at fair value. 
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that both the Group and 
the Company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future 
and for this reason the financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis.
Re‑presentation of prior year comparatives
Certain presentational changes have been made 
to the comparative balance sheet to ensure 
consistency with the current year. This has resulted 
in the reclassification of tenant lease incentives 
of £3.8 million (Group) and other receivables 
of £0.9 million (Group) from current assets to 
non‑current assets. In line with the requirements of 
IAS 1, Paragraph 60, these amounts would not have 
been settled or recovered within 12 months of the 
balance sheet date as at 31 August 2016. In addition, 
current tax liabilities of £2.4 million (Group) and £1.3 
million (Company) as at 31 August 2016 have been 
presented separately on the face of the balance 
sheet in accordance with IAS 1, Paragraph 54 (n). 
Current tax liabilities were previously included in 
trade and other payables.
2.3 Key judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements in 
conformity with IFRS requires the use of judgements 
and estimates that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the year. Although these estimates are based on 
the Directors’ best knowledge of the amount, event 
or actions, actual results may differ materially from 
those estimates.
The principal areas where such judgements and 
estimates have been made are detailed below:
Investment property valuation
The Group uses valuations determined by 
independent valuers in accordance with IFRS 13 
‘Fair Value Measurement’ (“IFRS 13”) as the fair value 
of its investment property. The valuations are based 
upon assumptions including estimated rental values, 
future rental income, anticipated maintenance costs, 
future development costs and appropriate market 
yields. The valuers also make reference to market 
evidence of transaction prices for similar properties. 
Further details are provided in Note 12.
Corporate and property acquisitions 
When control is obtained over an entity or group 
of entities, judgement is required in determining 
whether the transaction constitutes a business 
combination with reference to the inputs, processes 
and outputs of the subsidiary or subsidiary group 
acquired. If it is determined that the transaction is 
a business combination, the requirements of IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ (“IFRS 3”) are applied. 
In addition, when a property is acquired directly, 
the Directors have regard to the substance of the 
transaction and whether related processes and 
activities have been assumed which would represent 
a business. When such an acquisition is considered 
to be the acquisition of a business, the requirements 
of IFRS 3 apply as above, otherwise the transaction 
is treated as an acquisition of a property asset in line 
with IAS 40. 
Classification of UK Hotels as  
investment property
The UK Hotels are held for capital appreciation 
and to earn rental income. Apart from one of the 
properties, the hotels have been let to Redefine 
Hotel Management Limited (“RHML”) and Redefine 
Earls Court Management Limited (“RECML”), on lease 
terms which are subject to annual review. At each 
review, the revised rent is set with reference to the 
forecast EBITDA of the hotels. RHML and RECML run 
the hotels’ operating business and are therefore 
exposed to fluctuations in the underlying trading 
performance of each hotel under management. 
They are responsible for the key decision making of 
the business operations and the day‑to‑day upkeep 
of the properties. 
The Group cumulatively holds a 30.4 per cent 
shareholding in RedefineBDL Hotel Group Limited 
(“RedefineBDL”), which in turn controls RHML and 
RECML. Having considered the guidance in IFRS 10, 
the respective rights of each of the shareholders 
in RedefineBDL and the relative size of the Group’s 
shareholding, the Directors have determined that 
the Group has the ability to exercise significant 
influence over RedefineBDL. The Group does not 
control RedefineBDL and hence does not control 
RHML or RECML. The investment in RedefineBDL 
is therefore classified as an associate.  Redefine International P.L.C. 
Annual Report 2017 107
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
If the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the Group:
• derecognises the assets (including any goodwill) 
and liabilities of the former subsidiary at their 
carrying amounts at the date control is lost;
• derecognises the carrying amount of any 
non‑controlling interests in the former subsidiary 
at the date control is lost (including amounts 
of other comprehensive income attributed to 
non‑controlling interests);
• recognises the fair value of any 
consideration received;
• reclassifies to profit or loss, or transfers directly 
to retained earnings, amounts recognised in 
other comprehensive income in relation to 
the subsidiary on the same basis as would be 
required if the Parent had directly disposed of 
the related assets or liabilities;
• recognises any investment retained in the former 
subsidiary at its fair value at the date when 
control is lost; and
• recognises any resulting difference of the above 
items as a gain or loss in the income statement.
The Group subsequently accounts for any 
investment retained in the former subsidiary in 
accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
(“IAS 39”), or when appropriate, in accordance with 
IAS 28. For a change in the Group’s interest in a 
subsidiary that does not result in a loss of control, 
the Group adjusts the carrying amounts of the 
controlling and non‑controlling interest to reflect the 
changes in their relative interests. Any difference 
between the value of the non‑controlling interest 
acquired or disposed of and the fair value of the 
consideration is recognised directly in equity and 
attributed to the equity holders of the Parent.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra‑group balances, transactions, any unrealised 
gains and losses or income and expenses arising 
from intra‑group transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the Group financial statements. 
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as 
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is 
no evidence of impairment.
Investment in associates and joint ventures 
Associates are entities over whose financial and 
operating policies the Group has the ability to 
exercise significant influence but not control 
and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint 
arrangements. The Group classifies its interests in 
joint arrangements as either joint operations or 
joint ventures depending on the Group’s contractual 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. 
When making this assessment, the Group considers 
the structure of the arrangements, the legal form 
of any separate vehicles, the contractual terms 
and other facts and circumstances specific to 
each transaction. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are 
initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased 
or decreased each year by the Group’s share of 
the post‑acquisition net profit or loss and other 
movements recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity. The Group’s share of 
the post‑tax results of the associate or joint venture 
reflects the Group’s proportionate interest in the 
relevant undertaking.
The Group is not involved with the operation of the 
hotel management business and there are limited 
transactions between the two entities. As a result, 
the hotels are classified as investment property in 
accordance with IAS 40.
Classification of the Group’s investment in 
International Hotel Properties Limited (“IHL ”)  
at fair value through profit or loss 
On 14 October 2015, the Group acquired, by way of 
private placement, 3.8 million shares in the newly 
listed group, International Hotel Properties Limited 
(formerly International Hotel Group Limited), for 
£3.8 million. On the date of listing, this investment 
represented 25.4 per cent of the entity’s issued 
share capital and the investment was recognised 
as an associate of the Group under the equity 
method. On 20 October 2015, the Group ceased to 
recognise IHL as an associate when its shareholding 
was diluted to 13.2 per cent and the investment was 
reclassified as a financial instrument at fair value 
through profit or loss. At 31 August 2016, the Group 
held a 15.5 per cent interest in IHL. During the year 
ended 31 August 2017, the Group’s shareholding 
increased by 1.7 per cent to 17.2 per cent. Refer to 
Note 14 for further details on changes in the Group’s 
ownership interests in IHL. 
The degree of judgement relating to the 
classification as a financial instrument at fair value 
through profit or loss has increased given that the 
Group currently has representation on IHL’s board of 
directors. In drawing their conclusion, the Directors 
have considered the criteria for significant influence 
in paragraphs 5‑9 of IAS 28, the relative size of the 
Group’s shareholding and the fact the Group does 
not have the right to appoint a director. Having 
considered all the facts and circumstances, the 
Directors believe that the designation of the Group’s 
investment as a financial asset at fair value through 
profit or loss continues to be appropriate as at 
31 August 2017.
Refer to Note 38 for changes to the Group’s interests 
in IHL subsequent to the balance sheet date.
Fair value of restructured liabilities
New borrowings or existing borrowings which have 
been substantially modified are recognised at fair 
value. The determination of fair value involves the 
application of judgement. The Group determines 
fair value by discounting the cash flows associated 
with the liability at a market discount rate. The 
key judgement surrounds the determination of 
an appropriate market benchmark. Management 
determine the discount rate on a loan by loan basis 
having regard to the term, duration and security 
arrangements of the new liability and an estimation 
of the current rates charged in the market for similar 
instruments issued to companies of similar sizes.
This judgement is made more difficult given the 
bespoke nature of certain loans obtained by the 
Group. Any difference between the nominal value 
of the loan and its fair value equivalent will be 
recognised immediately in the income statement 
insofar as the fair value measurement is based 
on observable inputs. The deemed fair value will 
subsequently be accreted through profit or loss 
over the term of the loan using the effective interest 
rate method. 
Aviva profit share and capital  
appreciation rights
As part of the Aviva debt restructure in 2013, Aviva, 
the lender with security over the Group’s shopping 
centre asset, Grand Arcade, Wigan, had a right under 
the facility agreement to participate in 50 per cent of 
the valuation uplifts of the property in excess of the 
value of the drawn debt (“capital appreciation right”). 
Once the value of the property exceeded £90 million, 
Aviva had the additional right to realise tranches of 
the excess valuation at any time, with corresponding 
reductions to their right to profit share participation.
Up to and including the year ended 31 August 2016,  
the Group recognised a financial liability in respect 
of Aviva’s right to participate in the profits of the 
shopping centre. However, no provision was 
recognised in respect of Aviva’s capital appreciation 
right as a reliable estimate of the provision could not 
be made and it was not considered probable that a 
payment to Aviva would be required. The contractual 
obligation was disclosed as a contingent liability. 
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the debt was 
again restructured and both Aviva’s existing capital 
appreciation and profit participation rights were 
formally extinguished. 
2.4 Accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Investment in subsidiary undertakings (Group)
A subsidiary undertaking is an investee controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an investee when 
it has power over the investee, is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the investee. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group’s 
financial statements from the date on which control 
commences until the date that control ceases. The 
Group reassesses whether it controls a subsidiary 
when facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more elements of control.
The Group accounts for business combinations 
using the acquisition method, under which the 
consideration transferred is measured at fair value, 
and acquisition related costs are recognised in 
the income statement as incurred. Any excess in 
the purchase price of business combinations over 
the Group’s share of the fair value of the assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is 
recognised as goodwill while any discount received is 
credited immediately to the income statement. If it is 
determined that an acquisition does not constitute a 
business combination, the transaction is accounted 
for as an asset acquisition and the relevant IFRSs are 
applied in the recognition of a group of assets and 
liabilities. No goodwill arises on initial recognition but 
any premium paid or discount received is allocated 
to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities 
based on their relative fair values. 
The Group recognises non‑controlling interests 
on the basis of their proportionate share in the 
subsidiary’s identifiable net assets. Non‑controlling 
interests are presented separately from the equity 
of the owners of the Parent on the balance sheet. 
Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for 
the year attributable to non‑controlling interests are 
presented separately in the income statement and 
the statement of comprehensive income.  Financial statements

2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.4 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Investment in associates and joint ventures continued
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate 
or joint venture is included in the carrying amount 
of the investment. When the Group’s share of 
losses in an associate or joint venture has reduced 
the carrying amount to zero, including any other 
unsecured receivables, the Group does not 
recognise further losses, unless it has incurred 
obligations to make payments on behalf of the 
associate or joint venture.
As goodwill forms part of the carrying amount of 
the net investment, it is not recognised separately 
and it is not tested for impairment separately. 
Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an 
associate or joint venture is tested for impairment 
as a single asset where there is objective evidence 
that the investment may be impaired. Reversals 
of impairment are recorded as an adjustment 
to the investment balance to the extent that the 
recoverable amount of the associate or joint 
venture increases.
Capital contributions result from the non‑reciprocal 
transfer of resources to an associate or joint 
venture without a corresponding increase in the 
Group’s equity interest. Capital contributions are 
also accounted for as an increase in the Group’s net 
investment and are subject to impairment.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from 
transactions with associates and joint ventures are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
those entities.
Where the Group obtains significant influence or 
joint control over an investment that was previously 
accounted for as a financial instrument under IAS 39, 
the Group’s previously held interest is re‑measured 
to fair value through profit or loss. The deemed cost 
of the associate or joint venture is the fair value of 
the existing investment plus the fair value of any 
consideration given to achieve significant influence 
or joint control.
When the Group ceases to have significant influence 
or joint control, it is accounted for as a disposal of 
the entire interest under the equity method, with a 
resulting gain or loss being recognised in the income 
statement. Any retained interest in the investment at 
the date when significant influence or joint control is 
lost is recognised at fair value on initial recognition 
of a financial asset or, when appropriate, treated 
as the deemed cost on initial recognition of an 
investment in an associate.
Any gain or loss on the dilution of an interest 
in an equity accounted investee is calculated as 
the difference between the carrying amounts of 
the investment in the equity accounted investee, 
immediately before and after the transaction that 
resulted in the dilution and is recognised in the 
income statement.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets arising on business combinations 
are carried at cost less impairment. Amortisation of 
intangible assets is recognised in profit or loss on 
a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful life 
from the date that they are available for use. 
Currency translation 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated 
at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the 
reporting date are translated to the functional 
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on 
translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Non‑monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are 
translated to the functional currency at the foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the date that the values are 
determined.
Foreign operations
Exchange differences arising from the translation 
of the net investment in foreign operations are 
taken to the foreign currency translation reserve. 
Cumulative exchange differences are subsequently 
released to the income statement upon disposal. 
On consolidation, the balance sheets of foreign 
subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate and the 
income statement and statement of comprehensive 
income are translated at the transaction date rates 
or at an average rate for the year where this is a 
reasonable approximation.
Revenue recognition
Rental income, including fixed stepped rent, 
is recognised in the income statement on a 
straight‑line basis over the lease term. Tenant lease 
incentives, including rent‑free periods granted and 
cash contributions paid, which are an integral part 
of securing leases, are amortised as a reduction 
of rental income over the lease term. Surrender 
premiums that are paid by the Group to tenants to 
vacate a property are also treated as lease incentives 
if the surrender results in an enhanced future rental 
income stream. 
Contingent rents are recognised as they arise. Rent 
reviews are recognised as income or as a reduction 
thereof from the date it is probable that the revised 
terms will be agreed. Surrender premiums paid by 
the tenant to terminate a lease early are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Management fees receivable from joint ventures are 
recognised in other income during the year in which 
the services are rendered. Performance fees are 
recognised when the conditions are satisfied.
Dividends from listed property investments are 
recognised on the date the Group’s right to receive 
payment is established. 
Dividends from subsidiary undertakings are also 
recognised on the date the Company’s right to 
receive payment is established.
Interest earned on loans receivable and on cash 
invested is recognised on an accruals basis using 
the effective interest rate method. 
Service charges
Where the Group invoices budgeted service charges 
to tenants, amounts received are not recognised as 
income as the risks in relation to the subsequent 
provision of actual goods and services are primarily 
borne by the tenants during the service charge 
period. Consequently, amounts received are 
recognised as a liability on the balance sheet and 
reduced by the actual service charge expenditure 
incurred. Any non‑recoverable service charge 
expenses suffered by the Group, as a result of void 
or capped units, are included within rental expense 
in the income statement. 
Employee benefits and  
share‑based payments
Employee benefits, such as salaries and other 
benefits, are accounted for on an accruals basis over 
the period during which employees have provided 
services. Bonuses are recognised to the extent that a 
legal or constructive obligation to employees can be 
measured reliably. 
Share‑based incentives are provided to certain 
employees and Executive Directors for services 
rendered. The share‑based payments are all 
equity‑settled. The fair value of each award granted 
is calculated at the grant date, using the Monte 
Carlo and Black‑Scholes valuation methodologies. 
The fair value is not subsequently re‑measured and 
is recognised in the share‑based payment reserve 
in equity on a straight‑line basis over the vesting 
period as adjusted for the estimate of the awards 
that will eventually vest at each reporting date. The 
corresponding compensation cost is recognised as 
an administrative expense over the vesting period.
At the end of the performance period, a reserves 
transfer occurs with no further charge reflected in 
the income statement. 
Income taxes
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year 
comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is 
recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is based on taxable profit or loss for 
the year and is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date. Taxable profit differs from net profit 
as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income that are not taxable or 
expenses that are not tax deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance 
sheet liability method, providing for temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
their relative tax base. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based on the expected manner of 
realisation or settlement, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: those arising from goodwill not 
deductible for tax purposes; those arising from the 
initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the asset can be utilised and 
is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be realised. Deferred 
tax liabilities are provided only to the extent 
that there are not sufficient tax losses to shield 
the charge.
Investment property
In accordance with IAS 40, Paragraph 14, judgement 
may be required to determine whether a property 
qualifies as investment property. The Group has 
developed criteria so that it can exercise judgement 
consistently in recognising investment property, 
namely: property held for long‑term capital 
appreciation; property owned (or held under finance 
leases) and leased out under one or more operating 
leases; and property that is being developed for 
future use as investment property. The recognition 
and classification of property as investment property 
principally assumes that the Group: 
• does not retain significant exposure to the 
variation in cash flows arising from the 
underlying operations of tenants; and 
• will recover the carrying value through continuing 
rental income streams and longer‑term capital 
appreciation.
Investment properties are initially recognised at 
cost, including directly attributable transaction 
costs, and subsequently measured at fair value. 
The portfolios are valued on a bi‑annual basis by 
external, independent and professionally qualified 
valuers, having recent experience in the location 
and category of the property being valued. The 
fair values are based on market values, being the 
estimated amount for which the property could 
be exchanged on a highest and best use basis 
between a willing buyer and seller in an arm’s 
length transaction.
The valuations are determined by considering 
comparable and timely market transactions for 
sales and lettings and having regard for the current 
leases in place. In the case of lettings, this includes 
consideration of the aggregate net annual market 
rents achievable for the property and associated 
costs. A yield which reflects the risks inherent in the 
future cash flows is applied to the net annual rents 
to arrive at the property valuation.
The bi‑annual valuations of investment property are 
based upon estimates and subjective judgements 
that may vary materially from the actual values and 
sales prices that may be realised by the Group upon 
ultimate disposal. The critical assumptions made in 
determining the valuations have been included in 
Note 12 to the financial statements.
In determining fair value, the market value of the 
property as determined by the independent valuers 
is reduced by the carrying amount of tenant lease 
incentives and increased by the carrying amount of 
fixed head leases.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value 
of investment property are included in the income 
statement in the year in which they arise.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to investment 
property when the expenditure incurred enhances 
the future economic benefits associated with the 
property, such as enhanced future rental income, 
capital appreciation or both. Contributions to tenant 
refurbishments under lease arrangements are 
treated as tenant lease incentives and amortised 
against rental income over the term of the lease. 
As the fair value model is applied, property under 
construction or redevelopment for future use as 
investment property continues to be measured at 
fair value unless the fair value cannot be measured 
reliably and the property is measured at cost. All 
finance costs directly associated with the acquisition 
and construction of a qualifying development 
property are capitalised during the period of 
active development until practical completion. The 
rate applied is the actual rate payable on specific 
borrowings or the weighted average cost of debt of 
the Group for development spend that is financed 
out of general funds.
Acquisition and disposals of investment property 
are recognised when significant risks and rewards 
attached to the property have transferred to, 
or from, the Group. This will ordinarily occur on 
exchange of contracts unless there are significant 
conditions pending completion. Such transactions 
are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
The profit or loss on disposal of investment property 
is recognised separately in the income statement 
and is the difference between the net sales proceeds 
and the opening fair value asset plus any capital 
expenditure during the period to disposal.
A property ceases to be recognised as investment 
property and is transferred at its fair value to 
property held for sale when it meets the criteria 
of IFRS 5.
Property held by the Group under long‑term leases 
are also treated as investment property in line 
with IAS 40. The Group’s leasehold interests are all 
classified as finance leases as substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the property 
have transferred to the Group. Finance leases are 
recognised as both an asset and a liability and are 
measured at the lower of fair value and the present 
value of any future minimum lease payments. The 
finance lease obligation to the superior leaseholder 
is recognised within borrowings on the balance 
sheet. Lease payments are apportioned between 
the finance charges and the capital reduction of the 
lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability over 
the lease term. Finance charges are charged through 
profit or loss as they arise.
Investment in subsidiary  
undertakings (Company)
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are carried in 
the Company’s separate financial statements at cost 
less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are 
determined with reference to the undertakings’ fair 
value. Fair value is derived from a review of the EPRA 
adjusted net assets of Redefine International P.L.C. 
Group. Impairment reversals are recognised on a 
consistent basis as the original charge and do not 
exceed cost. On disposal of subsidiary undertakings, 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and its carrying amount is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Financial instruments 
Recognition and de‑ recognition
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group 
or Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from those assets expire or when the 
assets are transferred to another party without 
retaining control or substantially all risks and 
rewards of ownership. Regular way purchases and 
sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade 
date. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the 
obligations specified in the contract expire.
Non‑derivative financial instruments
Non‑derivative financial instruments are recognised 
initially at fair value plus, for those instruments not 
designated at fair value through profit or loss, any 
directly attributable transaction costs. Non‑derivative 
financial instruments comprise investments in equity 
securities, trade and other receivables, cash and 
cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade 
and other payables. Loan receivables and payables 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method.
Investments at fair value through profit or loss
An instrument is classified at fair value through profit 
or loss if it is held for trading or is designated as 
such upon initial recognition. Financial instruments 
are designated as fair value through profit or loss if 
the Group or Company manages such investments 
and makes purchase and sale decisions based on 
their fair value. Upon initial recognition, attributable 
transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred. Financial instruments at fair value through 
profit or loss comprise equity securities and are 
measured at fair value with changes therein at each 
reporting date recognised in the income statement. 
Fair values are determined by reference to their 
quoted bid price at the reporting date.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are held to 
manage interest rate risk exposures. Derivatives 
are recognised initially at fair value on the date the 
Group or Company becomes party to the contract; 
any attributable transaction costs are recognised 
in the income statement as incurred. Derivatives 
are subsequently re‑measured to fair value at each 
reporting date, and changes therein are accounted 
for in the income statement and presented 
under change in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments. The Group does not apply hedge 
accounting.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets not carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are assessed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is objective evidence 
of impairment. A financial asset is impaired if 
objective evidence indicates that a loss event has 
occurred and factors include: adverse changes in 
the payment status of a debtor or issuer; default or 
delinquency by a debtor; restructuring of an amount 
due on terms that the Group or Company would not 
consider otherwise; potential bankruptcy of a debtor 
or issuer; and economic conditions that correlate 
with defaults or the disappearance of an active 
market for a security. Financial statements

2. Significant accounting policies continued
2.4 Accounting policies continued
Financial instruments continued
Impairment of financial assets continued
An impairment loss is calculated as the difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial asset 
and the present value of the estimated future cash 
flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. When a subsequent event objectively 
causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, 
the decrease in impairment loss is calculated on a 
basis consistent with the impairment charge but the 
carrying value after any reversal must not exceed the 
original carrying value.
Impairment losses and reversals are recognised 
in the income statement and reflected in an 
allowance account against loans and receivables. 
Finance income on impaired interest‑bearing assets 
continues to be recognised.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances 
on hand, cash deposited with financial institutions 
and short‑term call deposits. Cash and cash 
equivalents are recognised at fair value and have 
maturities of less than three months. Restricted cash 
comprises cash deposits that are restricted until the 
fulfilment of certain conditions.
Non‑current assets and disposal  
groups held for sale
A non‑current asset or a disposal group (comprising 
assets and liabilities) is classified as held for sale if it 
is expected that the carrying value will be recovered 
principally through sale rather than through 
continuing use and the sale is highly probable. 
The asset or disposal group must be available for 
immediate sale, be actively marketed at a reasonable 
approximation to fair value and the sale must have 
the appropriate level of management commitment. 
The sale may complete beyond a period of one 
year from classification so long as there is sufficient 
evidence of a firm commitment from both parties 
and the circumstances of the delay are beyond the 
Group’s or Company’s control. 
Where there is commitment to a sale plan involving 
the loss of control of a subsidiary, the loss of joint 
control of a joint venture or significant influence 
over a joint venture and the criteria set out above 
are met, the Group classifies all the assets and 
liabilities of that subsidiary or the equity accounted 
investment in the joint venture or associate as held 
for sale. This classification is appropriate regardless 
of whether a non‑controlling interest will be retained 
after the sale. Where significant influence over an 
associate will not be lost, only that portion of the 
investment for which there is a commitment to sell 
shall be reclassified as held for sale.
On initial classification as held for sale, non‑current 
assets and disposal groups are ordinarily 
measured at the lower of the previous carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell, with any 
adjustments recognised in the income statement 
and subsequently re‑measured at each reporting 
date. Certain assets such as financial assets within 
the scope of IAS 39 and investment property in 
the scope of IAS 40 continue to be measured in 
accordance with those standards.
Gains and losses on re‑measurement and 
impairment losses subsequent to classification 
as held for sale are presented within continuing 
operations in the income statement, unless they 
meet the definition of a discontinued operation. 
Non‑current assets held for sale are presented 
separately under current assets on the balance 
sheet. Comparatives are not reclassified. 
Borrowings
Interest‑bearing borrowings are recognised initially 
at fair value less directly attributable transaction 
costs. Any difference between the transaction 
price and the deemed fair value of the borrowing 
is treated as a gain or loss in the income statement 
when the determination of fair value is based on 
observable inputs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest‑bearing borrowings are measured at 
amortised cost. Any differences between cost and 
the redemption value as a result of transaction costs 
incurred or fair value adjustments are recognised in 
the income statement over the contractual term of 
the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is 
extinguished. This may happen when:
• full repayment is made to the lender;
• the borrower is legally released from primary 
responsibility for the financial liability; or
• where there is an exchange of debt instruments 
with substantially different terms or a substantial 
modification to the existing terms of a debt 
instrument. 
In the event of a substantial modification of terms, 
any difference between the carrying amount 
of the original liability and the consideration 
paid is recognised in the income statement. The 
consideration paid includes non‑financial assets 
transferred and the assumption of liabilities, 
including the new modified financial liability. The 
modified borrowing is recognised initially at fair 
value and subsequently carried at amortised cost 
under the effective interest rate method. Any costs 
or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or 
loss on extinguishment.
Where existing borrowings are exchanged for new 
or amended borrowings and the terms are not 
substantially different, the new borrowings are 
recognised initially at the carrying amount of the 
existing borrowings. Any costs or fees incurred 
adjust the carrying amount of the borrowings and 
are amortised over the remaining term.
Ongoing finance costs and debt servicing payments 
are recognised in the income statement on 
an accruals basis, using the effective interest 
rate method.
Provisions, capital commitments  
and contingent liabilities
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past 
event, the Group or Company has a present legal 
or constructive obligation that can be estimated 
reliably and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting 
the expected cash flows to present value using an 
appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks 
specific to the liability.
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required, or the amount cannot 
be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed 
as a contingent liability, unless the probability of 
outflow of economic benefits is remote. Capital 
commitments are disclosed when the Group or 
Company has a contractual future obligation to a 
third party which has not been provided for at the 
balance sheet date.
Share capital
Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. External 
costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares, 
net of tax, are shown as a deduction from any 
recognised share premium.
Dividends
Dividends to shareholders are recognised when 
they become legally payable. In the case of interim 
dividends, this is when the dividends are declared by 
the Board.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per 
share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is 
calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable 
to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is 
determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable 
to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding adjusted for 
the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
In line with the JSE Listing Requirements, the Group 
also presents headline earnings per share.
Segmental reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group 
that engages in business activities from which it may 
earn revenues and in respect of which it may incur 
expenses, including revenues and expenses that 
relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other 
components. An operating segment’s operating 
results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker to inform decisions about resources 
to be allocated to the segment and to assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial 
information is available as disclosed in Note 3.

3. Segmental reporting
As required by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ (“IFRS 8”), the information provided to the Board, which is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, has been classified into the 
following segments:
UK Retail: the Group’s portfolio of shopping centres, retail parks and other retail assets;
UK Commercial: the Group’s portfolio of offices, roadside service stations and logistics distribution centres;
UK Hotels: the Group’s hotel portfolio which comprises eight hotels in Greater London and South‑East England and one hotel in Edinburgh, Scotland; 
the Group’s 30.4 per cent associate interest in RedefineBDL (5.1 per cent of which is classified as held for sale). RedefineBDL i s an independent hotel 
management company engaged in developing and managing a diverse portfolio of hotels in partnership with reputable international hotel brands. 
RedefineBDL also leases and manages all of the Group’s hotel properties except for the Enfield Travelodge; and
the Group’s 17.2 per cent interest in IHL, a hotel and leisure focused property investment company listed on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg 
Stock Exchange (“LuxSE”) and the AltX of the JSE;
Europe: the Group’s portfolio in Germany. The portfolio is comprised of shopping centres, discount supermarkets and, until 1 January 2017, Government‑let 
offices. In the comparative segmental income statement, the Group’s results from the last legacy asset, The Hague, which was dis posed on 
31 August 2016, are also included; and
Other: the Group’s holding and management companies that carry out the head office and centralised asset management activities of the Group.
Management information, as presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker, is prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis. Segmental reporting is therefore 
reported in line with management information, with the Group’s share of joint ventures presented line‑by‑line. Joint venture adjustments are disclosed to reconcile 
segmental performance and position to the Group financial statements.

  The Group was responsible for the investment management of the property portfolio of the Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l. joint venture. The Group was incentivised during the 
investment period by a Performance Fee dependent on the internal rate of return achieved on disposal. The return on disposal o n 1 January 2017 resulted in a fee of £3.4 million 
payable from the joint venture to the Group, after the deduction of certain costs. The income has been recognised within other income and the Group share of the related 
expense incurred by the joint venture has been recognised within share of post‑tax (loss)/profit from joint ventures. On a proportionate basis, and for segmental reporting 
purposes, the net Performance Fee of £1.6 million earned by the Group has been recognised in other income.

10. Net gain on sale of joint venture interests
On 1 January 2017, Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l. (“Wichford VBG”), exchanged contracts to dispose of all its property‑owning subsidiaries. The value attributed by the 
purchaser to the property portfolio, on which the sale was based, was €106.0 million (£90.6 million). The carrying value of the portfolio was €97.6 million (£83.2 million). 
Net consideration for the subsidiary interests was agreed at €49.7 million (£42.4 million). The transaction completed on 13 January 2017 subject to final completion 
adjustments which were negligible. The equity of the subsidiaries was acquired for nominal value and the consideration receivable was comprised of: 
• €29.4 million (£25.1 million) in settlement of the shareholder loans outstanding to the joint venture partners (Group share: €14.4 million/£12.5 million); and 
• €20.3 million (£17.3 million) in settlement of loans that had been advanced by the retained structure of Wichford VBG (“Finco Loans”) to the disposed subsidiaries 
(Group share: €9.9 million/£8.5 million). The Finco Loans had previously eliminated on consolidation of the joint venture.
Cash consideration of €47.9 million (£40.8 million) was initially received by the joint venture after the deduction of transaction costs of €0.8 million (£0.7 million) 
by the purchaser. In addition, €1.0 million (£0.8 million) was deferred pending the outcome of certain conditions. The conditions were satisfied and the deferred 
consideration was received in advance of the balance sheet date. The net assets of the subsidiaries on disposal were €11.2 million (£9.4 million) and, after adjusting 
for the Shareholder Loans and additional transaction costs incurred of €1.8 million (£1.5 million), an initial gain on sale of €6.5 million (£5.7 million) was recognised by 
the joint venture. The Group share of this gain was €3.2 million (£2.8 million). The Group recognised a total gain of £4.9 million after the recycling of cumulative foreign 
currency translation gains of £2.2 million to the income statement and the deduction of £0.1 million of Group transaction costs. The Directors believe that the recycling 
of the translation reserve is appropriate as the retained Wichford VBG structure has only residual cash to settle final working capital balances at 31 August 2017.
The Finco Loans originated during the Wichford VBG restructuring in September 2012, when a financing vehicle of the retained structure acquired the residual bank 
debt from the existing lender for nominal value. Loan notes of €1 (“Finco Loan Notes”) were issued to the joint venture partners by the vehicle to finance the acquisition 
of the Finco Loans. Under the terms of the Finco Loan Notes, any termination payments received under the Finco Loans would be payable to the Finco Loan Note 
holders after settlement of the Performance Fee (refer to Note 5) and any interest outstanding so that surplus cash could be repatriated efficiently to the joint venture 
partners. Following the disposal of the Finco Loans, a loss was therefore recognised in the financial statements of the joint venture on settlement of the Finco Loan 
Notes (Group share: €3.9 million/£3.5 million) and a corresponding gain was recognised by the joint venture partners. The net impact of the Finco Loan Note settlement 
is £Nil in the Group financial statements. For presentation purposes and to reflect the substance of the transaction, all gains and losses incurred by both the Group 
(£5.6 million gain) and the joint venture on an equity accounted basis (£0.7 million loss), as a result of the disposal, are included within one line in the income statement, 
‘Net gain on sale of joint venture interests’. 
The table below illustrates the financial impact of the transaction on the joint venture and on the Group on a total basis, eliminating the effect of the Finco Loan Note 
settlement for simplicity.

In the reconciliation above for the year ended 31 August 2017, the effective tax rate of the Group was 5.3 per cent (31 August 2016: 12.8 per cent).
The enactment of Finance (No. 2) Act 2015 and Finance Act 2016 has reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 20 per cent to 19 per cent with effect 1 April 2017, 
with a further reduction to 17 per cent from April 2020.
On 4 December 2013, the Group converted to a UK‑REIT. As a result, the Group does not pay UK Corporation Tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental 
business in the UK provided certain conditions are met. Non‑qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax. The Directors intend 
the Group to continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future. As a result, deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary differences relating to the UK property rental 
business which is within the REIT structure. Redefine International P.L.C.

Recognition
Judgement may be required to determine whether a property qualifies as an investment property. Investment property comprises a number of retail and commercial 
properties in the UK and Europe that are leased to unconnected third parties. In addition, the hotel portfolio is held for capital appreciation and to earn rental income. 
The hotels have been let to RHML and RECML (with the exception of Travelodge, Enfield) to separately manage the operating business for a fixed rent which is subject 
to annual review. The review takes into account the forecast EBITDA when setting the revised rent for each hotel. As detailed in the key judgements and estimates in 
Note 2, aside from the Group’s associate interest in RedefineBDL and the receipt of rental income, Redefine International is not involved in the hotel management 
business and there are limited transactions between Redefine International, RHML and RECML. As a result, the Directors consider it appropriate to classify the hotel 
portfolio as investment property in line with IAS 40.
Valuation
The carrying amount of investment property is the market value of the property as determined by appropriately qualified independent valuers and adjusted for 
minimum payments under head leases and tenant lease incentives. Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the 
highest and best use a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, and in limited circumstances in aggregation with other assets, its actual and potential uses 
which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of 
achieving and implementing this change to determine an appropriate valuation. Fees paid to valuers are based on arms length fixed price contracts.
The fair value of the Group’s property for the year ended 31 August 2017 was assessed by independent and appropriately qualified valuers in accordance with the 
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) standards and IFRS 13. The valuations are performed by Strutt & Parker LLP for the UK Shopping Centres, BNP Paribas 
Real Estate for the Esplanade and Savills for rest of the portfolio. The valuations are reviewed internally by senior management and presented to the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The presentation includes discussion around the assumptions used by the external valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations.
Valuation inputs
The fair value of the property portfolio has been determined using either a discounted cash flow or a yield capitalisation technique, whereby contracted and market 
rental values are capitalised at a market rate. The resulting valuations are cross‑checked against the net initial yield and the fair market values per sqft of comparable 
recent market transactions.
The valuation techniques described above are consistent with IFRS 13 and use significant unobservable inputs. Valuation techniques can change at each valuation 
round depending on prevailing market conditions and the property’s highest and best use at the reporting date. The Group considers that all of its investment property 
falls within ‘Level 3’, as defined by IFRS 13 (refer to Note 31). There has been no transfer of property within the fair value hierarchy during the year.
The table below summarises the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the Group’s property portfolio, including the Group’s share of property held by joint

Commercial property price risk
The Board draws attention to the risks associated with commercial property investments. Although over the long‑term property is considered a low risk asset, investors 
must be aware that significant short and medium‑term risk factors are inherent in the asset class. Investments in property are relatively illiquid and usually more 
difficult to realise than listed equities or bonds and this restricts the Group’s ability to realise value in cash in the short‑term.

On 14 October 2015, the Group acquired, by way of private placement, 3.8 million shares in the newly listed International Hotel Properties Limited (formerly 
International Hotel Group Limited) for £3.8 million. This acquisition represented 25.4 per cent of IHL’s issued share capital and the shareholding was recognised  
as an investment in associate under the equity method. 
On 20 October 2015, the Group acquired 3.1 million additional shares for £3.1 million as part of a £13.0 million private placement by IHL, diluting the Group’s interest 
to 13.2 per cent. Significant influence over the operations of IHL was deemed to have ceased from this date and the shareholding was re‑classified from investment in 
associate to investment at fair value through profit or loss (Refer to Note 16). 
On 31 March 2016, the Group acquired an additional 1.5 million shares in IHL for £1.5 million, by way of a £7.0 million private placement and thereby increasing its 
interest to 15.3 per cent.
On 20 April 2016, IHL acquired RBDL Capital Managers Limited from RedefineBDL for consideration of £1.0 million which was settled in the form of 1.0 million shares in 
IHL. RedefineBDL distributed these shares in relative proportion to its shareholders. The Group received 254,084 shares. 
On 7 February 2017, as part of the loan settlement with 4C UK Investments Limited (“4C Investments”), the Group obtained 1.0 million shares in IHL (Refer to Note 32). 
The contractual value attributed to these shares was £1.0 per share and the fair value of these shares on transfer was £0.95 per share. The shares were recognised at 
fair value and increased the Group’s investment in IHL by 1.7 to 17.2 per cent. There were no subsequent changes to the Group’s interests in IHL prior to year end.
As at 31 August 2017, the Group held 9,656,834 shares of IHL’s 56 million issued shares (31 August 2016: 8,656,834) at a fair value of £8.5 million (31 August 2016: £7.9 million) 
and the Directors have determined that the classification of IHL as an investment at fair value through profit or loss continued to be appropriate. 
Refer to key judgements and estimates in Note 2.3 for further information on the classification of IHL at the balance sheet date. Refer to Note 38 for changes in the 
Group’s interests in IHL subsequent to the balance sheet date. Financial statements

Joint venture interests
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group’s material interests in joint ventures which are presented in the tables of this note included the following: 
(i) 49 per cent interest in Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l., a joint venture with Menora Mivtachim, which owned Government‑let properties in Dresden, Berlin, Stuttgart 
and Cologne, Germany. The joint venture disposed of its property‑owning subsidiaries on 1 January 2017 as detailed below;
(ii) 50.5 per cent interest in RI Menora German Holdings S.à.r.l., a joint venture with Menora Mivtachim, which ultimately owns properties in Waldkraiburg, Huckelhoven 
and Kaiserslautern, Germany. Notwithstanding the economic shareholding, the contractual terms provide for joint control and so the Company does not control 
the entity;
(iii) 50 per cent interest in Leopard Germany Holding 1 S.à.r.l., CEL Portfolio 2 Limited & Co. KG., Leopard Germany Property Ed1, Ed2, Ed3 and Ed4, Leopard Germany 
Property Me 1 and Me 2 S.à.r.l., Ciref Berlin 1 Limited and Leopard Germany Property Ed2 GmbH & Co. KG, a joint venture with R edefine Properties Limited 
(“RPL”), the Company’s largest shareholder. These companies, collectively known as the Leopard Portfolio, hold 66 retail properties in Germany comprising a mix 
of stand‑alone supermarkets, food‑store anchored retail parks and cash & carry stores. The Group disposed of its joint venture interests in the Leopard Portfolio 
on 26 April 2017 as detailed below; and
(iv) 50 per cent interest in the Esplanade, a joint venture with Rimstone Limited, which owns an office building in St. Helier, Jersey.
The Group’s interests in joint venture entities are in the form of: 
–  an interest in the share capital of the joint venture companies; and
–  loans advanced to the joint venture entities. 
RI Menora German Holdings S.à.r.l. and Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l. both have accounting year ends of 31 December which differ from the Group so as to align with 
the year end of the joint venture partner, Menora Mivtachim.
Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l.
On 1 January 2017, Wichford VBG Holding S.à.r.l. exchanged on the sale of its four German office assets. The disposal was structured as a share sale of the joint 
venture’s property‑owning subsidiaries. The joint venture recognised a net loss on disposal of these subsidiaries of £1.4 million (Group share: £0.7 million) after 
settlement of the Finco Loans Notes. The Group, however, recognised a net gain on disposal of £4.9 million, including cumulative foreign currency translation of 
£2.2 million. See Note 10 for further details.
Leopard Portfolio
On 6 April 2017, the Group entered into a conditional acquisition agreement with RPL to acquire 88 per cent of RPL’s equity interest and all RPL’s shareholder loan 
interests in the Leopard Portfolio. Shareholder approval was subsequently obtained for this related party transaction at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 
25 April 2017 and the Leopard Portfolio became a controlled subsidiary group on completion on 26 April 2017 but with economic effect from 1 March 2017.
The Group’s joint venture equity and loan interests were derecognised on loss of joint control and the acquisition of control. The carrying value of the Group’s net joint 
venture interests in the Leopard Portfolio at the date of disposal were €44.3 million (£37.7 million). See Note 30 for further details.
The cumulative foreign currency translation difference on the Group’s net investment in Leopard of £2.0 million has been recycled to the income statement on effective 
disposal of the joint venture in accordance with IAS 28.  Redefine International P.L.C.

Interest in joint ventures not recognised
Under the equity method, the Esplanade was carried at £Nil in the Group’s financial statements at 1 September 2016 and remains at £Nil at 31 August 2017. 
This investment is in a net liability position with the cumulative losses exceeding the cost of the Group’s investment. The Group has ceased to recognise further losses 
beyond the original cost of this joint venture and loans advanced have been fully impaired in line with IAS 28. The Group share of cumulative losses amounted to 
£0.7 million at 31 August 2017 (31 August 2016: £1.6 million). On a proportionate basis and for segmental reporting purposes, the Group’s interest in the Esplanade 
is recognised line‑by‑line. Refer to the segmental information presented in Note 3.

On 14 October 2015, the Group acquired, by way of private placement, 3.8 million shares in the newly listed IHL for £3.8 million. On the date of listing this represented 
25.4 per cent of the entity’s issued share capital and the investment was classified as an associate on initial recognition. On 20 October 2015, the Group’s interest was 
diluted to 13.2 per cent and reclassified as an investment at fair value through profit or loss (refer to Note 14). 
On 30 August 2016, the Group settled amounts previously advanced to RedefineBDL by way of an equity contribution of £6.0 million. The equity contribution did not 
result in a further issue of shares to the Group or increase the Group’s percentage interest in the associate. The equity contribution has been recognised in other 
reserves in the underlying financial statements of RedefineBDL. 
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group’s cumulative investment in RedefineBDL increased from 25.3 to 30.4 per cent. On 7 February 2017, the Group 
acquired an additional 5.1 per cent interest in RedefineBDL for £1.3 million to partially settle a loan advanced to 4C Investments. (Refer to Note 32). This portion of 
the Group’s investment has been classified as held for sale on initial recognition as the shares were acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent re‑sale. (Refer to 
Note 20). The table above presents movements in the Group’s existing 25.3 per cent interest in RedefineBDL only. 
Distributions from the associate for the year ended 31 August 2017 of £1.2 million (31 August 2016: £2.3 million) were comprised of cash distributions only 
(31 August 2016: £0.3 million of the total distribution related to the distribution in specie of 254,084 shares in IHL). 
Following an internal impairment assessment and on receipt of an independent valuation of RedefineBDL, the Directors considered that the recoverable amount 
of the Group’s net investment in RedefineBDL was £9.4 million at 31 August 2017 (31 August 2016: £10.2 million). The independent valuation was determined 
on a value‑in‑use basis but was also cross‑checked to market comparables. Using a discount rate range of 11.5 – 12.5 per cent, an enterprise value range of 
£33.5 – £40.5 million was attributed to the investment, with a mid‑point valuation of £37.0 million (Group share: £9.4 million). This has resulted in an impairment 
charge of £0.5 million (31 August 2016: £3.2 million).

Intangible assets were recognised on the acquisition of Redefine International Management Holdings Limited Group (“RIMH”) and represented the fair value of the 
advisory agreements acquired by the Group. The value attributed to the contracts between RIMH and third parties, including joi nt ventures of the Group and the 
non‑controlling interests, was £1.9 million. The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight‑line basis over the remaining term of the contracts, which have an 
average life of eight years.

At 31 August 2017, cash and cash equivalents to which the Group did not have instant access amounted to £0.7 million (31 August 2016: £3.3 million). The restricted 
cash is held on deposit in Germany under an hereditable building right agreement for the property at Ingolstadt. The comparati ve restricted cash was held with Aviva 
in relation to the shopping centre developments at Byron Place Seaham, Birchwood Warrington, Weston Favell and proposed developments at Grand Arcade Wigan. 
This cash was used in part‑prepayment of the debt on restructuring (refer to Note 21).
The Group’s share of total cash and cash equivalents, including its share of joint venture cash, at 31 August 2017 was £53.4 million (31 August 2016: £34.3 million), with 
a further £10.0 million of undrawn committed facilities available (31 August 2016: £23.0 million). Redefine International P.L.C.

All non‑current assets held for sale fall within ‘Level 3’, as defined by IFRS 13 (refer to Note 31). Accordingly, there has been no transfer within the fair value hierarchy 
over the year.
Investment property held for sale
During the year ended 31 August 2017, ten properties were reclassified as held for sale, six of which remained classified as such at the reporting date. Four of these 
assets are being actively marketed and management are committed to a plan for their sale. It is considered highly probable that the carrying value of these assets will 
be recovered through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use, within the next twelve months. On 16 September 2016 the Group exchanged contracts 
for the future disposal of a UK Commercial office in 2 Duchess Place, Edgbaston, for £1.6 million. The purchaser has the right to call completion at any point up to 
1 April 2018. As there is a firm commitment from the purchaser and the Group to complete the transaction and the delay in completion is outside of the Company’s 
control, the asset has also been classified as held for sale at 31 August 2017.
The Group disposed of four held for sale assets from the UK Commercial portfolio and one German property during the year realising a net gain, after disposal costs, 
of £1.5 million. As at 31 August 2017, net proceeds of £40.9 million had been received by the Group, as the Brückmuhl property sale had only exchanged at the balance 
sheet date and £0.2 million of disposal costs had been accrued.

The Group exchanged on the disposal of the House of Fraser department store in Hull post year end (refer to Note 38).
Investment in associate held for sale
On 7 February 2017, as part of the settlement of the loan outstanding from 4C Investments (refer to Note 32), the Group acquired 659 shares in RedefineBDL for an 
attributed value of £1,942 per share. This represented 5.1 per cent of the issued share capital of RedefineBDL. As part of the settlement agreement, 4C Investments 
has the right to buy back the shares at the transfer price of £1.3 million at any time on or before 31 January 2018 subject to written notice. If this right is not exercised, 
the remaining shareholders of RedefineBDL will be offered the shares in proportion to their shareholding at the transfer price. It is considered highly probable that the 
value of the investment will be recovered through re‑sale on or before 31 January 2018. The investment has been classified as held for sale on initial recognition and at 
31 August 2017. The Directors have determined that the value inherent in the right to reacquire the shares is not material.  Financial statements

The Group’s bank loans are secured over investment property of £1,484.1 million (31 August 2016: £1,383.0 million) and are carried at amortised cost. On a proportionately 
consolidated basis, bank loans are secured over investment property of £1,509.7 million (31 August 2016: £1,523.9 million).
The Group has reduced the nominal value of drawn debt (on a proportionately consolidated basis) during the year to £842.2 million (31 August 2016: £850.6 million) 
following a number of successful refinancings;
• in November 2016 the facility held against West Orchards Coventry was restructured after the repayment of £5.2 million which reduced the balance outstanding to 
£11.9 million and extended the maturity to 2021. The restructuring was not considered a significant modification and no extinguishment of the existing loan was 
therefore required;
• in December 2016 and January 2017, the Group drew down on funds from the revolving credit facility (“RCF”) secured against the AUK Portfolio and repaid loans 
previously held with AIB Group (UK) p.l.c. (£5.4 million) and Commerzbank AG (£9.7 million). During the year ended 31 August 2017, the Group also sold eight 
properties secured against the AUK facility and applied £40.0 million of sale proceeds against the RCF. Net movements on the drawn facility for the year are 
£10.5 million;
• Wichford VBG disposed of its property‑owning subsidiaries including associated bank debt with DG Hyp (Group share: £23.5 million), effective 1 January 2017. 
See Notes 10 and 15;
• in April 2017, the Group refinanced £167.8 million of existing debt facilities secured over four of its UK Shopping Centre assets with Aviva. Following a prepayment 
of £21.7 million, the four facilities were amalgamated into one carrying a fixed rate of interest of 5.52 per cent (previous range: 5.7 – 6.4 per cent). The restructure 
qualifies as a substantial modification – the existing facilities have been derecognised and the refinanced debt has been recognised at fair value; 
• in April 2017, the Group acquired control of the previously held joint venture interest in the Leopard Portfolio and the Group assumed bank debt with Berlin Hyp AG 
and BayernLB of £73.6 million at rates of 1.3 – 2.9 per cent. See Note 30 for further information; 
• the Group refinanced its HSH Nordbank facility, secured over the CMC Shopping Center Altona, Hamburg effective 28 April 2017 with the facility being extended to 
February 2024. Following a prepayment of £5.5 million, the nominal value of debt outstanding was reduced to £37.9 million. The refinancing was not considered a 
significant modification and no extinguishment of the existing loan was therefore required;
• in June 2017, the Group completed the refinancing of three facilities held with BayernLB in the RI Menora joint venture. This included a prepayment of £1.7 million 
(Group share: £0.9 million), of which £1.3 million (Group share: £0.7 million) was paid in June and the remainder was paid post year end in September 2017. 
The facilities have been extended to 2024 and carry fixed rates of interest from 1.69 – 1.72 per cent; and
• in August 2017, the Group agreed extensions for two BayernLB facilities secured against the German OBI properties due to mature in October 2017. Under the 
amended agreements, both loans will now run to December 2022 and carry fixed interest rates of 1.59 – 1.62 per cent. 
Fair value disclosures
The nominal value of floating rate borrowings is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of fixed rate borrowings at the reporting date 
has been calculated by discounting cash flows under the relevant agreements at a market interest rate for similar debt instruments. The market interest rate has been 
determined having regard to the term, duration and security arrangements of the relevant loan and an estimation of the current rates charged in the market for similar 
instruments issued to companies of similar sizes. 
With the exception of the Aviva debt refinanced during the year, the Group considers that all bank loans, including the Group’s share of joint venture bank loans at 
a total carrying value of £690.9 million, fall within ‘Level 3’ as defined by IFRS 13 at the reporting date (refer to Note 31). The Aviva debt was recognised at fair value 
on refinancing in April 2017. This resulted in a fair value adjustment of £14.3 million as the refinanced debt was considered to have been negotiated on off‑market 
terms. The fair value was determined with reference to observable inputs and was classified as ‘Level 2’ on initial recognition. The carrying value of the Aviva debt at 
31 August 2017, being £131.6 million, is still considered by the Group to be a reasonable approximation of fair value and therefore falls within ‘Level 2’. All bank loans 
at 31 August 2016 were considered ‘Level 3’. 
The maturity of Group bank loans, gross of unamortised debt issue costs and fair value adjustments is as follows:

More than five years          202.3 288.0
           825.9 773.6
Certain borrowing agreements contain financial and other covenants that, if contravened, could alter the repayment profile.
Aviva profit share
As part of the Aviva debt restructure in 2013, Aviva retained the right to participate in 50 per cent of the income generated by Grand Arcade Shopping Centre, Wigan 
(after all costs, expenses and interest). The profit share participation right was recognised as a financial liability, initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost in prior years. During the year ended 31 August 2017 the debt was again restructured and, following a break cost payment of £5.5 million to terminate 
the existing facility, the Group was released from the historic profit arrangement with Aviva. Financial statements

Present value of minimum lease payments        14.8 13.0
Finance lease obligations relate to the Group’s leasehold interests in investment property. Finance leases are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the 
leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default. The discount rates used in calculating the present value of the min imum lease payments range from 1.8 to 
6.3 per cent.
22. Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to manage the risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
Interest rate swaps and caps are employed by the Group to manage the interest rate profile of financial liabilities. In accordance with the terms of the majority of 
bank debt arrangements, the Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the rates from floating to fixed which has eliminated exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. Likewise, interest rate caps are used to limit the downside exposure to significant changes to the low interest rates currently prevailing in the market. 
It is the Group’s policy that no economic trading in derivatives is undertaken.

at a rate of 0.4 per cent, maturing in September 2020. The interest rate swap liabilities have maturities from September 2018 to November 2021 and the rates range 
from 0.4 to 2.0 per cent.  Redefine International P.L.C.

26. Reserves
Reverse acquisition reserve
The reverse acquisition reserve of £134.3 million arose on the reverse acquisition of Wichford P.L.C. (subsequently renamed Redefine International) by Redefine 
International Holdings Limited (“RIHL”) in August 2011 and reflected the difference between the capital structure of the Company, as the legal acquirer, and RIHL,  
as the accounting acquirer, at the date of the transaction.
On 28 July 2017, the capital of RIHL was reduced by way of a capital reduction and transferred to retained earnings. On consolidation, this capital reduction has resulted 
in the release of £134.3 million from the reverse acquisition reserve which has also been transferred to the retained earnings of the Group.
Other reserves 
Share‑based payment reserve
The share‑based payment reserve at 31 August 2017 of £3.2 million (31 August 2016: £2.2 million) arises from conditional awards of shares in the Company made to 
certain employees and the Executive Directors. The awards will vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject to certain performance conditions being achieved 
over the vesting period. 
Other reserves
Other reserves of £1.0 million (31 August 2016: £1.0 million) arose from the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Foreign currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve at 31 August 2017 of £23.4 million (31 August 2016: £10.8 million) represents exchange differences arising from the translation 
of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations, including both subsidiary and joint venture interests. £4.2 million of cumulative translation gains were transferred 
to the income statement during the year on disposal of joint venture interests (31 August 2016: £3.6 million on disposal of subsidiary). £2.2 million related to the 
disposal of the property‑owning subsidiaries of Wichford VBG and £2.0 million related to the disposal of the Leopard joint venture.

28. Transactions with non‑controlling interests
On 1 June 2016, Ciref Europe Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, acquired the non‑controlling interests in its subsidiaries CEL Portfolio 1 Ltd & Co. KG and Chelvey 
Holdings Limited, of 20.0 and 33.0 per cent respectively, from Ellis Ventures Limited. Consideration for this transaction was £2.3 million (€2.7 million) including the 
acquisition of shareholder loans for £1.9 million (€2.2 million). A loss of £0.2 million on acquisition of the non‑controlling interest was recognised directly in equity.
At 31 August 2016, 4C Investments was a non‑controlling shareholder of RHHL, with an 11.43 per cent equity interest (1,938 shares) in the issued share capital. 
The Group had a loan balance outstanding from 4C Investments (refer to Note 32), for which a share charge was created in favour of the Group over 4C Investment’s 
entire shareholding in RHHL. The total loan balance outstanding, of both principal and interest, was £14.2 million on maturity at 31 December 2016. In the absence of 
repayment, the Group exercised its security over the shares. On 7 February 2017, the 1,938 shares formally transferred to the Group for an agreed transfer price of 
£6,295 per share, valuing the total shareholding at £12.1 million. The carrying value of the non‑controlling interest on transfer was £12.7 million and, as a result, a gain 
of £0.4 million has been recognised directly in equity after transaction costs.
4C Investments has the right to reacquire the RHH shares on or before 31 January 2018 at the transfer price of £12.1 million. The exercise of this right is considered 
improbable and the Directors are satisfied that there is no material value attributable to the option. The remaining non‑controlling interest in RHHL (17.52 per cent) has 
formally waived the pre‑emptive right to acquire its relative proportion of the shares on 31 January 2018. Dividends from these shares have been payable to the Group 
since the transfer and 4C Investments has no representation on the board of RHHL during the option period.
On acquisition of control of the Leopard Portfolio, the non‑controlling interest’s proportionate share (6 per cent) of the identifiable net assets of £0.7 million was 
recognised (debit balance).

30. Acquisition of subsidiaries
On 6 April 2017, the Group reached a conditional agreement to acquire the controlling interest in the Leopard Portfolio, previously held as a joint venture with RPL 
(refer to Note 15). Shareholder approval was subsequently received on 25 April 2017 and the transaction completed on 26 April 2017 but with economic effect from 
1 March 2017. Aggregate consideration paid to RPL was €49.0 million (£41.9 million) and allocated as follows:
• €0.3 million (£0.3 million) for the equity interests acquired; and 
• €48.7 million (£41.6 million) for the shareholder loans acquired. 
Including transaction costs, the total cash outflow in respect of the acquisition was £42.1 million.
On completion, the Group obtained control of the Leopard Portfolio. The Group has become exposed to the variable returns of the portfolio and now has 
the continuing ability to affect those returns by directing its activities. The Group has therefore consolidated the Leopard Portfolio on a line‑by‑line basis from 
1 March 2017, with the resulting elimination of intra‑group shareholder loans. The transaction was not considered a business combination, having regard to associated 
processes acquired, and has therefore been recognised as an asset acquisition. The net assets of Leopard on acquisition were €87.2 million (£74.5 million). The carrying 
value of the Group’s existing joint venture interest, which was derecognised on loss of joint control, was €44.3 million (£37.7 million). 
The premium paid to RPL on acquisition of €6.8 million (£5.9 million) including transactions costs, has been solely allocated to investment property as it was not 
separately identifiable. The carrying value of the Leopard property portfolio on 1 March 2017 was €175.5 million (£149.9 million) and, as a result, the total amount 
recognised as an addition on consolidation was €182.3 million (£155.8 million). Refer to Note 12. 
The non‑controlling interest, being 6 per cent of the equity of the Leopard Portfolio, has been recognised on the basis of its proportionate share in the identifiable net 
assets on completion and share of results to the reporting date. Redefine International P.L.C.

31. Fair value of financial instruments
Basis for determining fair values
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1: quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued 
using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active; 
or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
Level 3: valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs not based 
on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on 
quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments, 
the Group uses valuation techniques to arrive at a fair value that reflects a price that would have been determined by willing market participants acting at arm’s 
length at the reporting date. For common and simple financial instruments, such as over‑the‑counter interest rate swaps and caps, the Group uses widely recognised 
valuation models for determining the fair value. The models use only observable market data and require little management judgement which reduces the uncertainty 
associated with determination of fair values. For other financial instruments, the Group determines fair value using net present value or discounted cash flow models 
and comparisons to similar instruments for which market observable prices exist. Varying degrees of judgement are required in the determination of an appropriate 
market benchmark. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk‑free and benchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other premia used in 
estimating discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and expected price volatilities and correlations. Availability of observable market prices and inputs vary 
depending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets.
The tables below present information about the Group’s financial instruments carried at fair value as of 31 August 2017 and 31 August 2016:

The investment in IHL has been categorised as a Level 1 investment and priced using quoted prices in an active market; the AltX of the JSE. Derivative financial 
instruments have been categorised as Level 2, as although they are priced using directly observable inputs, the instruments ar e not traded in an active market. 
As stated in Note 12 and 20 respectively, the Group considers investment property and non‑current assets held for sale to be categorised as Level 3. As stated in 
Note 21, the Group considers all bank loans to be categorised as Level 3 with the exception of the Aviva debt which is categorised as Level 2. 
The carrying values of loans to joint ventures, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, finance leases and trade and other payables are considered 
to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.

4C UK Investments Limited
On 7 February 2017, the Company exercised its security against a loan advanced to 4C Investments that had matured. In settlement of the £14.2 million balance 
outstanding, the following investments were transferred to the subsidiaries of the Group: 
• 4C Investments non‑controlling interest in RHHL for a transfer price of £12.1 million (Note 28);
• 4C Investments shareholding in RedefineBDL for a transfer price of £1.3 million (Note 20); and
• 4C Investments shareholding in IHL for a transfer price of £1.0 million (Note 14).
As the total transfer price for the shares was £14.4 million, £0.2 million cash was paid back by the Group to 4C Investments. The treatment on initial recognition of the 
transferred shares is explained in the referenced notes.
On the same date, the Group entered into a lock‑up agreement with 4C Investments whereby the latter has the right to buy back the transferred shares in RHHL and 
RedefineBDL on or before 31 January 2018 at the transfer price. Under the terms of the lock‑up agreement:
• the Group cannot dispose of the transferred shares; 
• 4C Investments must be notified of material transactions; and 
• any dividends declared by RHHL and RedefineBDL will be payable to the Group. 
4C Investments is controlled by Bashir Nathoo. Bashir Nathoo was a Director of RHHL and RedefineBDL but resigned from his directorships with immediate effect on 
transfer of the shares.
Redefine Properties Limited
During the year ended 31 August 2016, the Group paid Redefine Properties a fee of £2.5 million in consideration for the financial guarantee to support the AUK 
Portfolio acquisition by underwriting up to £70.0 million in the capital raise. On completion, Redefine Properties was allocated 81,373,179 shares, representing 
30.07 per cent of the total placing and this equated to an aggregate amount of £34.6 million of the total funds raised.
At 31 August 2017, Redefine Properties held a 29.52 per cent interest in the issued share capital of the Company. 
Directors
Non‑executive Directors and Executive Directors represent key management personnel. The remuneration paid to Non‑executive Directors for the year ended 
31 August 2017 was £0.4 million (31 August 2016: £0.3 million) which represents Directors fees only. The remuneration payable to Executive Directors for the year 
ended 31 August 2017 was £2.7 million (31 August 2016: £1.8 million), representing salaries, benefits and bonuses. 4.9 million contingent share awards were issued to 
Executive Directors during the year (31 August 2016: 5.0 million). The IFRS 2 share‑based payment charge associated with the cumulative contingent share awards to 
the Executive Directors was £0.9 million (31 August 2016: £1.1 million) for the year.

The Company’s share‑based payments are all equity‑settled and comprise the Long‑Term Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) for Executive Directors and the Long‑Term 
Restricted Stock Plan (“RSP”) for employees. In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity‑settled share‑based payments to employees is determined at the grant 
date. The expense is recognised on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period based on estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest at each reporting 
date, with a corresponding credit to the share‑based payments reserve. The Company engages external advisers to determine the fair value of each award at the grant 
date who use the Monte Carlo and Black‑Scholes models in their valuations.
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the total IFRS 2 charge recognised in the income statement in relation to the PSP awards was £0.9 million 
(31 August 2016: £1.1 million). During the year ended 31 August 2017, the total IFRS 2 charge recognised in the income statement in relation to the RSP awards was 
£0.1 million (31 August 2016: £0.1 million).

Shares outstanding under each scheme are to be issued for nominal consideration provided performance conditions are met.
As at 31 August 2017, 1.3 million PSP awards and 0.7 million RSP awards were considered to be dilutive (31 August 2016: 0.2 million and 0.5 million respectively).
Full disclosure of the PSP award scheme granted to the Executive Directors is given on pages 88 and 89 of the Annual Report. 
Long‑Term Performance Share Plan
Subsequent to shareholder approval on 23 January 2017 and with effect from 1 September 2016, PSP performance conditions were revised to include non‑market 
based objectives in addition to market based objective. This followed a review by the Remuneration Committee of the existing remuneration policy to better align 
the awards with the Company’s strategic objectives and shareholder interests. The revised PSP awards authorise the Remuneration Committee to make grants of 
PSP shares with a face value of up to 200 per cent of the salary of Executive Directors. The awards are subject to a three‑year vesting period and to the following 
performance conditions:
• 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on underlying distributable earnings per share. 25 per cent of the award will vest upon attaining earnings per share 
comparable with the immediately preceding financial year, with 100 per cent vesting achieved for average annual outperformance of CPI during the performance 
period of 1 per cent;
• 25 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the relative total property return of the Company’s UK assets in comparison to the IPD UK All Property Index. 
25 per cent of the award will vest once performance reaches that of the benchmark with 100 per cent vesting achieved for 2 per cent outperformance; and
• 25 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) equalling, or exceeding, the TSR relative to that of each of the 
members of the FTSE EPRA/REIT Developed Europe Index (the “Index”). 25 per cent of the award will vest for median performance with 100 per cent vesting 
achieved for upper quartile performance.
On 25 January 2017, 4.9 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2019. The share price on 1 September 2016 was 
39.0 pence and the fair value on the grant date was £1.2 million assuming maximum vesting over the performance period. 
The former PSP scheme authorised the Remuneration Committee to make grants of PSP shares with a face value of up to 250 per cent of the salary of Executive 
Directors. These remaining outstanding awards are subject to a three‑year vesting period and to the following performance conditions:
• 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the TSR equalling, or exceeding, the TSR relative to that of each of the members of the Index; and 
• 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on the Company’s TSR relative to that of the members of a bespoke comparator group (the “Comparator Group”). 
Vesting is on the same sliding scale for both of these conditions – 25 per cent for median performance and 100 per cent for upper quartile performance, with 0 per cent 
vesting below a median performance. The following outstanding awards were granted under the former PSP remuneration scheme: 
On 3 February 2015, 3.4 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2017. The share price on 1 September 2014 was 
52.4 pence and the fair value on the grant date was £0.9 million. Performance during the period was determined to be below median and therefore all awards lapsed 
on 31 August 2017.
On 28 October 2015, 5.0 million shares were granted for the performance period from 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2018. The share price on 1 September 2015 was 
52.2 pence and the fair value on the grant date was £1.5 million.
Long‑Term Restricted Stock Plan
Awards of RSPs to certain employees are subject to a three‑year vesting period and to performance measures evenly balanced between corporate performance 
objectives and personal performance objectives. The performance conditions of RSP awards were also revised effective 1 September 2016.
• 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on corporate targets, being the same as those conditions set out above for the PSP under both the revised and existing 
remuneration policies and with the same relative weighting. 
• 50 per cent of the award will vest dependent on personal objectives, linked to average performance grades achieved over the three‑year vesting period. Financial statements

33. Share‑based payments continued
Long‑Term Restricted Stock Plan continued
On 3 December 2015, 0.9 million shares were granted to employees under the old RSP scheme for the performance period 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2018. 
The share price on 1 September 2015 was 52.2 pence and the fair value on the date of grant was £0.3 million.
On 25 January 2017, 1.1 million shares were granted to employees under the revised RSP scheme for the performance period from 1 September 2016 to 
31 August 2019. The share price on 1 September 2016 was 39.0 pence and the fair value on the grant date was £0.3 million assuming maximum vesting over the 
performance period. 
Fair value of share‑based payments
For the market‑based performance conditions, the effect of the performance conditions is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award. No subsequent 
adjustment to the charge can be made to reflect the outcome of the performance test. Adjustments can be made for estimated and actual leavers who forfeit their 
awards during the vesting period. The probability of meeting market based performance conditions is required to be incorporated into the calculation of fair value. 
The Monte Carlo model has therefore been used to value the element of the Awards with a TSR performance condition. 
The remaining non‑market based performance conditions have been valued using a Black‑Scholes model.
It was necessary to make a number of assumptions to calculate the fair value under both models. Reference was made to the Company’s LSE listing in developing share 
price volatility, dividend yield, risk‑free rate and index correlation assumptions. The table below sets out the assumptions made:
           Award year Award year 
Assumptions           2017 (%) 2016 (%)
Volatility            20.7 20.0
Risk‑free rate           0.4 0.85
Dividend yield          8.2 —
Correlation of the comparator group companies         — 28.5
Correlation of the Index companies         24.2 30.1
The fair value calculation under the revised PSP award scheme assumes 28.2 per cent (2016: 53 per cent) of the face value will be awarded at the date of grant relative 
to the Index.
34. Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to the following financial risks through its operations:
• Credit risk;
• Liquidity risk; and
• Market risk.
In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. The following quantitative and qualitative 
disclosures describe the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks, and the Group’s management of capital.
The Group’s risk management policies require the identification and analysis of the risks faced by the Group, the setting of appropriate risk limits and controls, and the 
monitoring of risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly and adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions and the 
Group’s activities.
The Group’s Board of Directors has responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The overall objective of the Board is 
to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Group’s flexibility and ability to maximise returns.
The Group Audit Committee oversees management’s compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk 
management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
There are no significant concentrations of risk and there has been no significant change during the financial year, or since year end, to the types of financial risks faced 
by the Group or the Group’s approach to the management of such risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The carrying amount 
of financial assets represents the Group’s maximum credit risk exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

Annual Report 2017 141
Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Other information
Cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments
Credit risk arises on the Group’s undrawn commitments, its holding of assets such as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks or financial institutions and its 
derivative financial instruments. However, the Group limits such exposure by investing in liquid deposits with material counterparties that have a credit rating of A, A2 
or above from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s, except where specific exemptions are granted by the Board.

Other           3.5 7.3
           53.2 32.8
The Group actively monitors its credit exposure to each counterparty and in dealing with high quality, reputable and long‑established institutions, management do not 
expect any counterparty will fail to meet its obligations.
Trade and other receivables
The Group is also exposed to credit risk from lease contracts in relation to its property portfolio. This risk is actively managed by the asset and property managers who 
continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible, identifying and addressing risks prior to default. If there is objective evidence that 
the Group may not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the lease concerned a specific impairment is made. The Group also makes a 
general provision of 25 per cent against all receivables 120 days or more past due that have not been specifically impaired. Rent receivables exposed to credit risk were 
less than 0.1 per cent of total assets at 31 August 2017 (31 August 2016: less than 0.1 per cent). The credit risk associated with rent receivables is considered to be low, 
owing to the long‑term nature and diversity of the Group’s tenancy agreements. The Group has set a medium‑term target of a 95 per cent collection rate within seven 
days. The Group’s rent collection rate at 31 August 2017 was 94.3 per cent.
Other receivables, including loans to external parties and consideration outstanding on disposal of investment property are secured and therefore they are also 
considered to be of low credit risk. 
Included in trade and other receivables, subject to credit risk, are debtors with the following age profile:
 2017 2016
    
       Gross Impairment Recoverable Gross Impairment Recoverable 
       £m £m £m £m £m £m

       14.9 (1.3) 13.6 26.4 (0.9) 25.5
Loans to joint ventures
The credit risk associated with loans to joint ventures is the risk that the loans advanced may not be recoverable.
As at 31 August 2017, the recognised loan to joint ventures relates to the loan advanced to RI Menora German Holdings S.à.r.l. This joint venture group is in a net asset 
position and has serviced all of its payment obligations to date under the terms of the loan. The Group is also responsible for the investment management of the joint 
venture and therefore has oversight of working capital and can manage cash flow requirements. The recoverability of the loan is considered low risk. 
The Group has also advanced a loan of £3.3 million to the Esplanade. This investment is in a net liability position with the cumulative losses exceeding the cost of the 
Group’s investment due to the fair value losses that have arisen on derivative financial instruments. The Group has therefore fully impaired the loan advanced in line 
with the requirements of IAS 28. 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the Group’s working capital and debt servicing obligations. There is a risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial 
obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that there will always be sufficient resources to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
Liquidity risk is actively managed by the Group’s finance department. Bi‑monthly, management receive and review rolling three‑month cash flow projections to ensure 
that there is sufficient headroom in the near‑term to meet ongoing operational requirements and upcoming capital commitments. In addition, management regularly 
receive and review rolling three‑year cash flow and loan balance projections as part of the Group’s forecasting process. At the balance sheet date, these projections 
indicated that the Group had sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations under all reasonably expected circumstances. 
The monitoring of liquidity is also assisted by the quarterly review of covenants imposed by financial institutions, such as loan‑to‑value and interest covenant ratios. 
Loans are renegotiated in advance of any potential covenant breaches insofar as the factors are within the control of the Group. The Board will ensure during periods 
of increased market uncertainty that sufficient cash resources are available for potential loan repayments or cash deposits as may be required by financial institutions. 
The Group’s loan facilities and other borrowings are also spread across a range of banks and financial institutions so as to minimise any potential concentration of risk. Financial statements

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its 
investments in financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while 
optimising the return on risk.
Since the UK referendum on European membership there has been a change in the potential scale and likelihood of volatility in all aspects of market risk, with softening 
yields, volatility in currency and equity markets and increased inflationary expectations experienced. Refer to the Group’s Principal Risk disclosures on pages 16 and 17 
for further information.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments in the ordinary course of business, and incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. The Board of 
Directors receives reports on a quarterly basis with regards to currency exposures as well as interest rate spreads and takes the necessary steps to hedge and limit the 
risk the Group is exposed to. The Group does not apply hedge accounting.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk, primarily with respect to the Euro (“EUR”). 
Foreign exchange risk arises from the Group’s exposure to monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations recognised in EUR. The Group’s 
income from income‑producing rental properties is denominated in the same currencies as the loans that are financing those properties. The Group’s investments in 
foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are not hedged as the currency positions are considered to be long‑term in nature.
Foreign exchange risk also arises on the payment of the Group’s dividend to its JSE shareholders in South African Rand (”ZAR”) bi‑annually. The Group enters into 
forward rate contracts in advance of settlement of the dividends to mitigate this risk. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign denominated assets and liabilities are as follows:

Group           £m £m

Sensitivity analysis
A five percent strengthening in the GBP exchange rate against the EUR at year end would have decreased equity by £9.9 million (31 August 2016: £7.0 million) and profit 
by £0.6 million (31 August 2016: 1.4 million). A five percent weakening in the GBP exchange rate against the EUR at year end would have had the equal but opposite 
effect. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. 
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long‑term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group 
uses interest rate derivatives to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. At the year end, as a result of the use of interest rate swaps and caps, the majority of 
the Group’s borrowings were at fixed interest.

The table above is presented on a proportionately consolidated basis. The detail included is not a requirement of IFRS and is presented for informational purposes only as it is used 
in reports presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker for monitoring interest rate risk.
The Group targets interest rate protection against 75 per cent or more of external debt. The Group’s EPRA earnings has limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
until the repayment dates of the loans for which the interest rate swaps and caps have been arranged. Refer to Note 22 for further details on the Group’s interest rate 
swap and cap agreements.
Capital structure and management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of 
the balance between its net debt and capital. The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. The Group manages the capital structure and takes reasonable steps in light of changes in the economic conditions and 
the risk characteristics of its underlying business and assets. 
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group, as presented in the following table, are the loan‑to‑value and the interest cover ratios:

           2017 2016

Net finance expense         3 (29.0) (33.1)
Interest cover (times)          3.2 2.7
The tables above are presented on a proportionately consolidated basis. The ratios are not a requirement of IFRS and are presented for informational purposes only as they are 
used in reports presented to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker for monitoring the Group’s capital structure.
The Group’s medium‑term target is that the loan‑to‑value ratio is between 45‑50 per cent and the interest cover is above three times. 
The Board also monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders’ equity, 
excluding non‑controlling interests, and the dividends paid to ordinary shareholders. In order to improve its capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, sell 
assets to reduce debt, refinance existing borrowings, and adjust the amount of any distribution of dividends.
At the 2015 AGM the Company received the necessary authorisation from shareholders to purchase its own shares on the market, subject to such shares being 
cancelled immediately upon acquisition. The timing of purchases will depend on market conditions and purchase and sale decisions will be made on a transaction by 
transaction basis by the Board of Directors. No share purchases took place during the year. The Group does not have a defined share buy‑back plan.
The level of the Company’s borrowings, in terms of its Articles of Association, shall not at any time, without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution of the 
Company, exceed ten times the aggregate of:
(i) the amount paid up on the issued share capital of the Company; and
(ii) the total of capital and revenue reserves.
The Company’s dividend policy is to distribute the majority of its earnings available for distribution in the form of dividends to shareholders. Financial statements

37. Contingencies, guarantees and commitments
A subsidiary of the Group, Redefine Australian Investments Limited, is undergoing a review by the Australian Tax Office in respect of its calculation of Capital Gains 
Tax arising on the disposal of securities in Cromwell Property Group during 2013, 2014 and 2015. No tax assessment notice has been received and dialogue between 
the Company and the Australian Tax Office is ongoing. The Directors remain of the view, having sought advice from reputable tax agents and advisers, that their filing 
position remains correct.
At 31 August 2017, the Group was contractually committed to expenditure of £16.8 million (31 August 2016: £15.8 million), of which £16.5 million was committed to the 
future development and enhancement of investment property.
At 31 August 2017, the Company was contractually committed to expenditure of £0.3 million (31 August 2016: £Nil). The Company has also provided wholly owned or 
controlled subsidiary undertakings with a commitment to provide continued financial support should the need arise.
38. Subsequent events
On 15 September 2017, the proposed scheme of arrangement to increase the Group’s interest in IHL to 50 per cent received IHL minority shareholder approval. 
The scheme was approved by the British Virgin Island Court on 12 October, at which time it became unconditional. The transaction is expected to complete in early 
November 2017 with IHL delisting shortly afterwards. 
On 19 September 2017, the Group exchanged contracts to dispose of the House of Fraser department store in Hull for £11.0 million. The sale is due to complete on 
14 November 2017. 
39. Dividends
During the year ended 31 August 2017, the second interim dividend of 1.575 pence per share for the half‑year ended 31 August 2016 was distributed, as well as the 
interim dividend of 1.3 pence per share for the six month period ended 28 February 2017. Both dividends were settled partly in cash and partly through the issue 
of scrip dividends.
The Board has declared a second interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 August 2017 of 1.3 pence per share. Payment will be made on Monday 
18 December 2017 to shareholders on the register on Friday 1 December 2017. A scrip alternative will again be offered.
