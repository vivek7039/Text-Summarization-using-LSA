 03 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chairman’s statement
Return to full statutory profit, doubling of operating margin to 10%,  
Annually Recurring Revenue growing, and strong cash generation.  
Tribal has maintained its market leadership with significant new customers 
gained. Shareholder value is now being created in a sustainable manner.
With the Group placed on a sound financial footing in 2016, and 
with many of its operational challenges addressed, I am pleased 
to report that the Group has now returned to full year statutory 
profit for the first time since 2013.
Annually Recurring Revenues, which now include cloud services, 
grew over 5% to £37 .5m, overall profitability doubled to an 
adjusted operating margin of 10%, compared with 5% in 2016, 
and the Group ended the year with net cash up 59%, at £14.1m 
(2016: £8.8m). Shareholder value is now being created in a 
sustainable manner as the Group continues to drive efficiencies 
in the business: a further £3m of annualised savings was realised 
in 2017 , bringing the total annualised savings realised to £12.0m 
since the initiation of the cost savings programme; this has driven 
improved financial performance without impacting the Group’s 
ability to serve its customers or drive its business forward. 
For the year to 31 December 2017, Tribal Group achieved an 
adjusted Operating Profit of £8.5m, up 82%, on a revenue 
of £84.9m (2016: operating profit of £4.7m on a revenue of 
£90.3m) and increased Adjusted Earnings per Share (diluted) to 
3.2p (2016: 1.9p). The fall in revenue was adversely impacted by 
a combination of the expiry of the Ofsted Early Years contract 
in March 2017 and the disposal of Synergy in March 2016 
– excluding these factors, the revenue increased by 6.5%, 
particularly due to the strong performance in the remaining 
Quality Assurance Solutions (QAS) business.
2017 confirmed that Tribal remains a leading international 
provider of student information systems to universities, 
colleges and schools in the UK, Australia and New Zealand 
markets as well as elsewhere in the world. We serve a large 
installed customer base, including many of the world's leading 
universities and colleges.
During the year, the Group secured significant new contract wins 
in the Higher Education sector, including Sheffield University 
and Glasgow Caledonian University in the UK, and our third win 
in Malaysia, at the University of Malaya. We also finalised a 
AUD$27 .5m (approx. £16.8m), four-year extension to the Callista 
contract, which provides student information systems to  
11 Australian universities for the on-going development of the 
Callista product and seamless migration into the cloud ready  
Tribal Edge platform. 
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 04 I am also pleased to note the strong performance in Further 
Education and Work-based Learning where, in the UK, the growth 
is being driven by significantly improved software sales to new 
business customers, and in APAC, the Campus solution at the 
British Council has been successfully rolled out to 34 countries.
In our i-graduate business there was a change of leadership in the 
first half of the year, and we successfully secured a number of new 
contracts. However, the overall participation by universities in the 
key International Student Barometer survey towards the end of 
2017 was disappointing, as more universities than expected chose 
to skip a year. We look forward to welcoming them back into the 
survey in 2018.
The Quality Assurance Solutions business also performed 
well in 2017 and secured significant contract wins at the Abu 
Dhabi Education Council, the Ministry of Education of Dubai & 
Northern Emirates. In addition to broadening the offerings beyond 
School Inspections to include Performance Benchmarking and 
Professional Development & Training, QAS continues to have 
opportunities to grow and develop its business both in the UK and, 
more widely, to build on our existing contracts in the Middle East 
and the USA. 
Looking to the Future
In 2018, I expect Tribal to continue to secure new clients for 
our Student Information Systems, with a strong pipeline of new 
opportunities in Higher Education, and the prospect of continued 
improvement in sales performance. Additionally, with a further 
contract already secured in Dubai and a strong pipeline of new 
work, QAS enters 2018 with confidence and optimism.
Revenues are expected to be broadly flat in 2018, which 
represents a small growth excluding the impact of the final year  
of Ofsted revenue in 2017 .
I expect the operating margins to increase further, as the cost 
savings achieved in 2016 and 2017 continue to benefit 2018.  
We will continue to look for further efficiencies in 2018. 
We will also continue to reshape our product development and 
customer-facing support businesses to provide a more agile 
and responsive customer-facing environment. As part of this 
change, we are transitioning our current hosted customers 
to a new data centre, in partnership with Rackspace. The 
investment in this migration will provide us with increased 
sales opportunities for hosting solutions to new and existing 
customers, as well as providing a resilient platform for our next 
generation, cloud-based Student Information System.
Although there remains much to do, I see the momentum continuing 
into 2018 and beyond, as the Group continues to drive cost 
efficiencies in the business and increasingly takes advantage of 
the international market for student information systems. 
Employees
I would like to thank all our employees for their hard work and 
commitment. The Group has undergone significant continued 
change through 2017, and that inevitably brings uncertainty. 
The support of the employees has been invaluable in bringing 
the Group through this challenging period. Although there 
is much still to do in 2018, the overall business structural 
changes have largely been made, which should provide a more 
settled and certain environment for 2018. I should also like to 
thank my fellow directors for their hard work, determination 
and persistence in seeking to improve the efficiency of the 
Tribal business.
Dividends
The Board believes that the payment of dividends is important 
and has previously confirmed its intention to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy once the Group’s financial 
performance supported the payment of a dividend. 
Given the good overall performance of the business in 2017 and 
the strong closing cash position, the Group is now in a sustainable 
financial position. The Board has therefore decided to propose a 
dividend of 1p per share. This will be paid in May 2018, pending 
ratification at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Outlook and Current Trading
We expect overall market conditions and demand for student 
management systems to remain stable in 2018. While the timing 
of deal closures and achievement of implementation milestones 
remains difficult to predict, we are well positioned to continue 
to benefit from the demand for student systems and upgrades. 
We have already secured several software and service contract 
wins in the early part of 2018. 
With the introduction of IFRS15 in 2018, there will be some 
impact on revenues and operating profit as the Group will 
be required to spread the recognition of software revenues 
over the duration of the implementation period, rather than 
immediate recognition on installation. This is likely to cause 
a modest transitional dip in revenues and operating profit in 
2018, as large contract wins in year are spread over the future 
implementation period.
Given the factors described above, and the strong platform 
around which to build sustainable shareholder value, I expect 
continued improvement in our profitability during the current year.

Tribal - the perfect fit for 
"Outstanding" Derwen 
College, UK
Derwen College is a vibrant and pioneering college 
committed to promoting the vocational, educational, 
personal and social development of young people 
with a wide range of learning difficulties and 
disabilities, through personalised learning.
Specialist provision comes with unique challenges 
and Derwen College needed a flexible student 
information system that could easily meet their 
exacting requirements. Derwen College chose ebs  
as the perfect fit.
Tribal developed a staff portal specifically for 
Derwen College that allows all members of staff 
to report on all aspects of student behaviour, be it 
praise or concern for a student, instantly through any 
device. ebs collates this information to give a single 
overview of students’ progress. 
"We selected ebs because the system could easily 
be tailored to our needs, allowing our staff to easily 
monitor our students’ progress, and ultimately focus 
their valuable time on our learners’ success” said 
Maggie Furmanek, Director Finance & Resources, 
Derwen College.

 09 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Tribal Edge is Tribal’s new Student Information System. The initial modules were launched 
in the summer of 2017 and have sinced been in beta testing. We are now in a trial release 
with select customers from both Higher Education and Further Education. The first four 
modules are expected to be generally available later in 2018.
Tribal Edge Platform
Tribal Edge has been designed for the cloud, and following 
our recent collaboration agreement with Microsoft, will be 
made available on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. The 
choice of Azure as a cloud technology has allowed us to take 
full advantage of the Microsoft development stack. We are 
using a Swagger framework to implement open APIs; and 
using authentication services provided by OpenId to create 
consistent and discoverable interfaces. This is enabling single-
sign-on across modules and ensures new functionality can 
integrate with Tribal’s existing student management solutions, 
as well as third -party applications.
Initial New Functionality 
We have initially developed new, rather than replacement 
functionality, to enable us to add value to our existing 
customers and provide compelling reasons for our customers 
to start adopting Tribal Edge. Overall, we are focusing much 
more on the student experience and looking to bring student 
management, including self-service, into the hands of the 
students themselves.
The first four modules of Tribal Edge are shown over.
Tribal Edge
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Student View 
A mobile app giving students anytime, anywhere availability 
to see their day at a glance and enabling them to access all 
information they need at their fingertips, all personalised to their 
timetable, their lifestyle and where they are on their educational 
journey. Student Engage is included within Student View.
Student Support 
Ensures students are supported through the complete 
education lifecycle. Institution support staff have a single view 
of all student performance issues and identify opportunities 
to deliver critical support to reduce drop-outs and maximise 
student successes, while students have easy access to 
support wherever they are.
Student Engage 
A social collaboration app designed to operate like a social 
network but with added safeguarding features that keep staff’s 
professional and personal lives separate. It enables staff and 
students to connect, communicate and collaborate with each 
other safely and securely. 
Student Insight 
A learning analytics solution that monitors and tracks student 
engagement, analysing student data from multiple sources, and 
flagging students at potential risk, thus enabling the targeting of 
students that need support. This timely intervention improves 
outcomes and reduces dropouts.
Software as a Service (SaaS)
Tribal Edge will be made available as a SaaS (cloud-based) solution. It will be able to integrate to on-premise systems as well as 
other cloud-based systems, making Tribal Edge easy to deploy. In general, modules will be available in both Further Education and 
Higher Education versions, adapted to meet the specific needs of these markets. Tribal Edge will also be available in time at three 
differing levels of functionality – Essential (the entry level solution); Enhanced (richer and more flexible); and Enterprise (the most 
complete solution). 
Each module can be used standalone or combined to provide a truly mobile, engaging and supportive experience for students and 
staff that delivers deep insights to improve outcomes.

 13 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Our strategy
To focus on international education sectors – Higher Education, Further 
Education and Vocational institutions, Schools, Government and State bodies, 
Training Providers, and Employers – and to underpin student success through the 
provision of expertise, software and services.
Strategic Priorities
The strategic direction of the business was set after a detailed review early in 2016 and our strategic priorities 
remain unchanged.
Deliver Tribal Edge - the new Student Information Platform  
Tribal Edge, is a cloud-based Student Information platform developed from a student centric perspective that will empower 
institutions to enhance the student experience and support the most appropriate outcome for each unique student. Tribal Edge 
will enable Tribal to offer a portfolio of applications and services to the education sector, developed by Tribal or by Tribal partners. 
The Student Information Platform will focus on creating the underlying interfaces, data structures and embedded analytics that 
enable these value-add solutions. Over time our current functionally rich applications will all reside within Tribal Edge.
Key measures: Revenue (sales of new modules to existing or new customers)
Progress in 2017: The first four Tribal Edge modules moved into beta at the end of 2017 and offer an enhanced student 
information mobile app; an integrated, social collaboration platform; full lifecycle student support; and outcomes-based learning 
analytics. All modules integrate with Tribal’s existing student systems. Early adopters have been identified and the Tribal sales 
teams have been fully briefed, creating a solid foundation for sales growth in 2018.
Increase Annual Recurring Revenue 
We will look to exploit the market direction of Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud-based solutions, both with the introduction 
of new solutions and in the provision of SaaS and cloud for existing products. This will enable an on-going higher value service 
provision and a smoother income flow from those customers on SaaS. The move of existing systems into the cloud will also enable 
a more rapid adoption of modules in our new Student Information framework. 
Key measures: Annually Recurring Revenue; percentage of Revenue annually recurring 
Progress in 2017: We established a partnership with the world-wide, market leading managed cloud provider, Rackspace, to 
enable us to provide our customers with a rich set of cloud services. This partnership has enabled us to offer a flexible “Tribal 
cloud” covering a comprehensive private cloud solution, as well as managed public cloud services on AWS and Azure. The majority 
of new business sales are now on Tribal cloud; from 2017 cloud services revenue are incremental to the support and maintenance 
fees when calculating Annually Recurring Revenue. 
Annually Recurring Revenue increased by 5.5% to £37.5m (2016: £35.5m), which included £4.0m for cloud services (2016: 
£3.3m), and represented 46% of revenue from continuing operations.
 
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Strategic Priorities
Grow market share in established and new territories
A four-prong growth strategy: 
• Product penetration – with cross-selling and upselling opportunities for our large installed base of customers across both 
systems and services; 
• Market penetration – ensuring a pro-active approach to new business in existing territories, and selling add-on solutions to 
sites without a Tribal Student Management System; 
• Geographical expansion – continuing our international sales development in regions such as the Middle East and US and 
reviewing target geographies including Canada, Singapore and Malaysia; 
• Mergers and acquisitions – that broaden our applications or services portfolio, or increases our geographical footprint. 
Key measures: Backlog 
Progress in 2017: We continue to make progress with both product and market penetration with a rejuvenated sales effort in 
2017. The acquisition of intellectual property accelerated our development of Tribal Edge modules as well as immediately giving 
additional functionality that we successfully sold to existing Tribal customers. 
On geography, we have continued to expand student information system sales in Malaysia and continue to prospect in Singapore 
and Canada. Our education services business has won several school inspection contracts in the Middle East, has won another in 
Alabama, US, and renewed the New York state contract.
Backlog increased 5.8% to £120.4m (2016: £113.8m). 
Drive improved margin 
With a clear focus on operational efficiency and managing our overall cost base against the anticipated revenue, we will continue 
to improve upon our margins. A series of business process improvements have been established to improve our sales and delivery 
capability, standardising practices across the Group and ensuring faster time to revenue. Continued margin improvement will 
ultimately increase value to shareholders. 
Key measures: Adjusted Operating Profit Margin 
Progress in 2017: We continue to drive improved profitability achieving a margin of 10.1% (2016: 5.2%).

Chief Executive's report
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 In 2017, the Group has continued to build on the strong 
foundations built in 2016 and has driven a significant and 
sustainable improvement in profitability. 
Revenues fell in 2017 to £84.9m (2016: £90.3m); however, 
2016 revenue included £11.6m relating to the Ofsted contract 
which successfully concluded in March 2017 (2017 Ofsted 
revenue: £3.0m), and £1.7m from Synergy (disposed of in March 
2016) and SLS (closed 2015). Excluding these items, revenue 
relating to continuing operations increased by 6.5%, to £81.9m 
(2016: £76.9m). 
Annually Recurring Revenues, which from 2017 include cloud 
services, increased by 5.5% to £37.5m (2016: £35.5m).
We identified areas where we can more effectively align the 
Group’s resources to deliver material cost efficiencies and 
improve margin without impacting the Group’s ability to serve our 
customers or drive our business forward. Cumulative annualised 
cost savings achieved since the start of the cost efficiencies 
programme total £12.0m, of which £3.0 annualised savings were 
realised in 2017 (2016: £9.0m annualised, of which £5.8m in year). 
The impact of these actions has grown through the year, and 
we can report a significantly improved trading performance for 
2017, with the first full year statutory profit since 2013, and 
adjusted operating profit up 82% to £8.5m (2016: £4.7m). This, 
coupled with good cash generation, with net cash up 59% to 
£14.1m (2016: £8.8m), has left the Group in a stronger position 
at the end of the financial year.
2017 in summary
In our chosen regional markets and sectors, overall activity 
levels for the replacement or enhancement of student 
management systems have remained stable; we have seen 
significantly improved win rates in our UK Further Education 
and Work-based Learning businesses and we continue to win 
new customers in the Higher Education sector, reaffirming 
the strength of Tribal’s software and services portfolio, and 
confirming that our international customer base and continued 
market leading position provide a strong platform around which 
to build long-term shareholder value.
The Group won significant new contracts in the Higher Education 
sector, including at the University of Sheffield, a major UK 
Russell Group University, as well as contracts with Glasgow 
Caledonian University, University of South Wales and Heriot-
Watt University. We also secured our third Higher Education 
customer in Malaysia at the University of Malaya.
Our Callista business, which provides student information 
systems to 25% of Australian universities, performed well, and 
we finalised a AUD$27.5m (approx. £16.8m), four-year extension 
to our contract with the 11 Universities for the on-going 
development of the Callista product with seamless migration 
into the cloud-ready Tribal Edge product platform.
Quality Assurance Solutions (QAS) confirmed its position as a 
market-leading international school inspections business. QAS 
completed the first term as sole provider of school inspections 
for the Department of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi. 
In Dubai, a contract with the Ministry of Education (MoE) for the 
review of public schools was won and delivered. In 2018, the MoE 
in Dubai also awarded us the contract for the review of private 
schools. In the US, evaluations of schools and districts in New 
York State continued under a new contract extension and similar 
review work was won with a new state, Alabama. The contract 
to provide the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of 
Mathematics for the UK Department for Education was expanded 
to include additional maths development in the North of England. 
The Group's large customer base ensures it is well positioned 
to take advantage of the increasing market trend to improve 
student engagement, through our experience in data analytics 
and student barometers from the i-graduate line of business. 
Shareholder returns & dividends
Given recent performance of the business, a strengthened 
balance sheet and confidence in the sustained profitability of 
the business, the Board has declared a full year dividend of 1p 
which will be paid in May 2018, pending approval at the AGM in 
April 2018. The Board of Directors believes that the payment of 
dividends is important, and will continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy.

 17 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
1 Student Information System (SIS) is the general industry term for education management solutions that encompasses Management Information Systems 
(MIS), Customer (or Student) Relationship Management (CRM), business insight and data analytics products. Student Management System (SMS) is more 
specifically the administration aspect of Student Information Systems. We refer to our heritage products as SMS, our new offerings (aligned with their wider 
applicability) as SIS, and the general industry as student information. Chief Executive's report continued
Product & Services Strategy
Tribal is a worldwide, software and services company focussed 
on the education market. At the core of our business, we have 
a portfolio of functionally rich student information systems 
and these are being expanded with the development of a next 
generation, cloud-based solution – Tribal Edge. Our new product 
investment will focus on Tribal Edge and delivering a solution 
that enables institutions to significantly enhance the student 
experience they are able to offer. 
The Group also continues to invest significantly in our existing 
products; in 2017 , the Group spent £10.2m (2016: £10.3m) 
on product development, of which £2.1m (2016: £1.1m) was 
capitalised, and related to development of SchoolEdge and the 
new Tribal Edge solution. The remaining £8.1m (2016: £9.2m) was 
expensed in year and related to product development costs and 
related overheads for the existing SITS, ebs, and Maytas products.
Tribal Edge was successfully launched at our UK Higher Education 
conference in July. The launch was followed by a series of 
roadshows to all our UK customers. This has drawn high interest and 
secured commitments for beta sites and early adopters for the first 
Tribal Edge modules. The launch to our Asia Pacific customers has 
been equally well received, with those using Callista having agreed 
a four-year contract extension that includes the integration of Tribal 
Edge for their use in the near-term. 
Our strategy for Tribal Edge has been to first develop a number of 
new modules that deliver additional functionality for our Higher 
and Further Education customers and that integrate to all our 
core student information systems. The initial modules are:
• Student View – a mobile app giving students anytime, 
anywhere availability to see their day at a glance and enabling 
them to access all information they need at their fingertips, 
all personalised to their timetable and their lifestyle. Student 
View incorporates Student Engage. 
• Student Engage – a social collaboration app designed to 
operate like a social network but with added safeguarding 
features that keep staff’s professional and personal 
lives separate. It enables staff and students to connect, 
communicate and collaborate with each other safely  
and securely. 
• Student Support – ensures students are supported through 
the complete education lifecycle. Institution support staff 
have a single view of all student performance issues and 
identify opportunities to deliver critical support to reduce 
drop-outs and maximise student successes, while students 
have easy access to support wherever they are. 
• Student Insight – a learning analytics solution that monitors 
and tracks student engagement, analysing student data from 
multiple sources, and flagging students at potential risk, thus 
enabling the targeting of students that need support. This 
timely intervention improves outcomes and reduces dropouts. 
The Student Engage module was kick-started with the 
acquisition of intellectual property and exclusive distribution 
rights for an existing private social network solution in the 
education markets across the UK, Australia and New Zealand. 
This gave both an existing customer base and a solution that 
was actively used and could be developed upon, and is now 
available as Student Engage, fully integrated into a single mobile 
app, Student View. 
A closed-beta (limited access) was completed at the end of 
2017 and a full beta programme is now underway with both 
Higher Education and Further Education customers in the UK and 
in Australia. Several early adopters have also been identified and 
they will receive the roll-out of new modules in early 2018. The 
Student Insight module was also used as the enabling platform 
in the ongoing trial of student analytics and analysis with JISC. 
Our progress with Tribal Edge has been further enhanced 
with a strategic partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft’s 
Azure application development team will work with Tribal to 
accelerate the creation of new functionality, enabling the 
rapid development of an enhanced cloud-based platform and 
the conversion of the current functionally-rich applications of 
SITS:Vision and ebs to the Tribal Edge framework. 
Outside of Higher and Further Education, we have continued 
the successful development of SchoolEdge, a new, web-
based product for schools. Schools in Australia have adopted 
many of the new modules on offer and the development 
continues to offer a completely refreshed schools student 
information system. 
We have also continued to invest in our market-leading 
employers and training providers solution, Maytas. This has seen 
particular growth in the UK where the Government’s introduction 
of the Apprenticeship Levy has encouraged companies to 
explore and adopt apprentices. Maytas fully supports the 
management of apprenticeship programmes including the 
critical area of funding. 
Business Structure
“Oxford chose to work with T ribal 
because its SITS product is the 
market leader, and there is a very 
strong user base and an active user 
group. We have found T ribal to be a 
high quality and responsive company 
to work with, with very good customer 
engagement from consultancy staff 
right up to Board level.”

Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 Tribal’s organisational structure has been simplified to 
drive improved customer focus, more agile management, 
responsiveness to local needs and clear accountability across 
our business and is managed through three segments. 
Within the Student Management Systems business, we have 
adopted a primarily regional structure, split between Europe, 
Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Australia, New Zealand and 
Asia-Pacific (APAC). QAS and i-graduate operate as independent 
businesses and are managed globally. 
Student Management Systems (SMS) focusses on the following 
market sectors: Higher Education, Further Education, Colleges 
and Employers (referred to in Australia as VET), and Schools, and 
across three main markets, UK, Australia and New Zealand. Product/
Offerings are split between License & Development Services, 
Support & Maintenance, Implementation, and Cloud Operations; 
from 2017 , SMS no longer includes K2 Asset Management (K2) or 
Software Solutions, as they are non-core businesses and are now 
included within the i-graduate line of business. 
Quality Assurance Solutions covers inspection and review 
services which support the assessment of educational delivery 
including the Ofsted Early Years inspection contract. From 2017, 
it also includes Performance Benchmarking. 
i-graduate covers i-graduate student surveys and data 
analytics as well as various non-core businesses, not forming 
part of Student Management Systems or QAS. These include 
K2 Asset Management, Software Solutions and Information 
Matters. It no longer includes Performance Benchmarking, which 
has moved to QAS in 2017.
Revenue and profit for each segment are restated for 2016 to 
reflect the above changes.
Product & Services revenues
The table below groups products and offerings, irrespective of 
the segment in which they fall. Most license and related services 
(Support & Maintenance, Implementation Services and Cloud 
Services) relate to the Group’s Student Management Systems; 
however, there are businesses which are non-core, managed 
under the i-graduate line of business, which include license and 
related services. This includes K2 and Software Solutions where 
we continue to support and maintain the existing product; the 
Group also has a software product, developed and sold by QAS, 
to support Ofsted as they manage school inspections following 
the conclusion of our Ofsted contract at the end of March 2017. 
All revenue (which includes license, support & maintenance, 
and other services) relating to Synergy (disposed of) and SLS 
(closed) is shown separately.

 19 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chief Executive's report continued
Overall, the revenue from License & Development fees has 
fallen 9.0% to £10.0m (2016: £11.0m). This is due in part to 
contracts successfully moving from a software development 
phase further into the implementation phase. We have also seen 
some Higher Education institutions moving towards a bundled 
pricing model, where the contractual terms result in license 
revenue being phased over time rather than being recognised 
upfront, as previously. In 2017, the contract awarded by Glasgow 
Caledonian University was based on a bundled pricing model 
with contractual terms that resulted in the software license 
recognition being phased over the implementation period. 
For 2018, this transition ends with the move to IFRS15 accounting, 
by which the Group’s revised revenue recognition policy requires all 
significant license revenue to be spread over the implementation 
period (as detailed in the Financial Review section). 
Support & Maintenance retention rates remain high, and as a 
result, our Annual Recurring Revenue base has continued to 
grow. Support & Maintenance fees in the period were £33.5m 
(2016: £32.2m), an increase of 3.9%.
Implementation services deliver the technical implementation 
of our software products at customer sites, typically working 
alongside customer teams. Implementation projects vary in 
length, and range from a small number of days, to more than two 
years for more complex projects. Revenues are typically based 
on day rate fees, although we sometimes operate under fixed fee 
contracts for defined implementation scopes. Overall growth of 
19.6% was driven by the extensive implementation work at British 
Council, University of Waikato and Massey University.
Cloud services cover the provision of managed IT services and 
hosting services to customers to manage their Tribal products 
either on premise, in a private cloud, or in a public cloud. These 
services have grown by 20.5% in 2017, to £4.0m (2016: £3.3m) 
as customers increasingly migrate their IT systems into the 
cloud. These hosting services are recurring, and from 2017 the 
Group will include Cloud services revenue in the calculation of 
Annually Recurring Revenue.
School inspections & related services covers all products and 
services offered by the QAS line of business which do not relate 
to the sale of software licenses and related services.
Surveys & data analytics covers all products and services 
offered by the i-graduate line of business which do not relate  
to the sale of software licenses and related services.

equivalent headcount (FTE) has reduced by 221 FTEs in the year.
This follows an 18% headcount reduction in the previous year, a 
total reduction of 473 heads (36%) since 31 December 2015. 
Of these reductions in 2017, approximately 100 FTE reductions 
were the result of specific actions taken as part of our cost 
reduction program to drive increased profitability. The other 
reductions were due to the winding down of the Ofsted contract, 
and were transferred back to Ofsted under TUPE regulations.

Student Management Systems
Overall activity levels in our markets and sectors for the 
replacement or enhancement of student information systems 
remain stable and we continue to see a steady stream of new 
opportunities in all sectors. 
In 2016, the Student Management System included combined 
revenue of £1.7m and profits of £1.0m, from Synergy (disposed 
of in March 2016) and SLS (closed in 2015). 
Student Management Systems revenues increased by 1.7% to 
£60.0m (2016: £59.0m). Excluding Synergy/SLS, SMS revenue 
grew by 4.8%.
Adjusted operating profit was £17.6m (2016: £12.0m) and the 
adjusted operating margin was 29% (2016: 20%). Excluding 
Synergy/SLS, SMS profit grew by 60%.
The capitalised development cost was £2.1m in 2017 
(2016: £1.1m). This relates to continued development of our 
SchoolEdge product and investment in our Tribal Edge next 
generation, cloud-based student management system.

full student information system at the University of Sheffield, 
a major UK Russell Group University, as well as contracts 
with Glasgow Caledonian University, the University of South 
Wales and Heriot-Watt University. We secured our third Higher 
Education customer in Malaysia, at the University of Malaya, 
reaffirming Tribal as an international market leader in student 
information systems. 
“We were really impressed with the 
level of integration and efficiency 
the combination of Maytas and 
e-track could bring to our learner 
management. The Tribal team 
suggested the best combination of 
systems and tools to address our 
specific business needs.”

 21 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chief Executive's report continued
Within the Higher Education sector, our Callista business, 
which was acquired in March 2015, and which provides student 
information systems to 25% of Australian universities, 
performed well, and we finalised a AUD27.5m (approx. £16.8m), 
four-year extension to our contract with the 11 Universities for 
the on-going development of the Callista product and seamless 
migration into the cloud-ready Tribal Edge platform.
We have successfully completed key implementation stages at 
Massey University and the University of Waikato in New Zealand, 
as well as commencing the implementation of recent wins at 
the University of the Arts London, the University of Malaya, 
and Sheffield University. Other key implementation contracts 
continue to proceed well, if slightly delayed, including Universiti 
Teknologi Petronas (UTP) and Institut Teknologi Petroleum 
Petronas (INSTEP) in Malaysia, and University of Bristol.
In the EMEA Further Education and Work-based Learning 
(WBL) business, we continued to make strong progress in 
2017, with key wins at Nottingham College, Bridgend College 
and the Met Film School, and, following the introduction of the 
apprenticeship levy, secured new WBL Maytas customers, 
including Travis Perkins, Boots Opticians and EY (Ernst & Young).
In the APAC Further Education (referred to as VET in Australia/
New Zealand) and Schools sectors, the New South Wales 
Student Administration and Learning Management (SALM) 
programme has continued to deploy our ebs Student 
Management System successfully; in 2017, we successfully 
concluded the roll-out to 2,200 schools in New South Wales 
(NSW). This is in addition to the 138 TAFE (Technical & Further 
Education) campuses, which continue to operate successfully 
– although, as previously noted, the NSW Government made a 
public announcement in June 2016 that they will be reviewing 
their TAFE student enrolment system and will look to implement 
a new, cloud-based solution. Tribal continues to discuss the 
future solution with TAFE NSW but, regardless, we expect TAFE 
NSW to be a customer into 2019, and the schools’ element of 
SALM will continue as planned.
Within our Campus business, the implementation at the British 
Council continues to proceed well, and we have now gone live in 
119 locations in 34 countries worldwide.
Our other Student Information product for schools, SchoolEdge, 
has enjoyed good customer retention rates during the 
year. However, we have been informed that the dioceses 
representing around 800 of the 1800 schools have decided 
to move from Tribal to a student information system that 
they are building in collaboration with two providers; we have 
commenced discussions regarding transitional arrangement; 
however, we expect to continue to provide software and 
services to these schools into at least 2019.

•  i-graduate student surveys & data analytics
•  K2 Asset Management
•  Software Solutions
•  Transformation and change advisory services
•  Information Management Services
This division’s activities have increasingly focused on those 
skills and tools that closely relate to our student information 
systems. Increasingly, we integrate these activities with our 
software offerings.
“We’ve used Tribal software to 
improve the experience for our

UK
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 22 i-graduate line of business revenue in the period was £7.1m 
(2016: £8.7m), a reduction of 18%. 
Revenue from the core i-graduate student survey and data 
analytics offerings fell 3.7% from £3.1m to £3.0m. In our 
i-graduate business there was a change of leadership in the 
first half of the year, and we successfully secured contracts in 
Australia, including for the Australian Universities International 
Student Barometer. We also extended the strategic partnership 
with Universities UK International, delivering underpinning 
research for the widely distributed UK's Competitive Advantage 
report. However, the overall participation by universities in 
the key International Student Barometer survey towards the 
end of 2017 was disappointing, as more universities than 
expected chose to skip a year. There were also costs of further 
investment in the business and management transition. These 
factors adversely impacted the segmental operating profit, 
which fell to £0.4m (2016: £1.1m).
The revenue from the non-core businesses fell by £1.5m, 
including £0.8m in K2 Asset Management and £0.4m in 
Information Matters as the businesses are transitioned to a 
maintenance mode. However, the focus on optimising margins 
improved the operating profit to £0.7m (2016: £(0.1)m).

QAS provides inspection services used by the Office of 
Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Ofsted), 
the UK government agency responsible for monitoring quality in 
settings such as colleges, schools and nurseries. These services 
have also been purchased by government agencies in the US 
and Middle East. Typically, we provide these services under 
multi-year contracts, with fixed and variable pricing elements. 
We also provide complementary services including training for 
prospective quality assurance inspectors, training and software 
tools for school leaders to prepare for inspections, online 
professional development tools for teachers to enhance their 
professional development, and other similar offerings. 
QAS revenue declined in the period by 21% to £17.8m. However, 
in March 2017, the final Ofsted contract (“Early Years”) came to 
a successful conclusion, as previously announced, to be taken 
back in-house by Ofsted. Revenues relating to Ofsted contracts 
were £3.0m, down from £11.6m in 2016. 
The remaining Quality Assurance Solutions business, which 
excludes the Ofsted contract, had a strong performance and grew 
by 35% in 2017 , to £14.8m. QAS has secured significant contract 
wins at the Abu Dhabi Education Council, worth £8.4m over two 
years, where we are the sole supplier of school reviews in Abu 
Dhabi, and the Ministry of Education of Dubai & Northern Emirates. 
The first tranche of these contracts was successfully delivered in 
2017 . In the US, we signed an extension to our contract with the 
New York State Education Department, as well as gaining a new 
customer, the Alabama State Education Department. We also 
successfully retendered for the NCETM contract (National Centre 
for Excellence in the Teaching of Maths).
QAS adjusted operating profit was £4.4m (2016: £6.5m), and 
adjusted operating margins were 25% (2016: 29%).

For the year ended 31 December 2017 , the Group's revenue from 
continuing operations was £84.9m (2016: £90.3m). Adjusted 
operating profit increased by 82% to £8.5m (2016: £4.7m) and 
adjusted operating profit margin improved to 10.1% (2016: 5.2%). 
Adjusted profit before tax was £8.4m (2016: £4.2m) and

Group made a statutory profit after tax of £2.6m (2016: loss of 
£1.2m), and a statutory operating margin of 3.1% (2016: (1.3)%).
At the end of the year the Group had net cash of £14.1m (2016: 
net cash of £8.8m).
Results of Operations 
Revenue
Revenue was lower by 6% at £84.9m in the year (2016: £90.3m). 
However, total revenue in 2016 included £11.6m (2017: £3.0m) 
from the expiry of contracted work for the Ofsted Early Years 
contract, which successfully concluded in March 2017 , and £1.7m 
(2017: £nil) of combined revenue from Synergy (disposed of in 
March 2016), and the SLS business (closed in 2015). Excluding 
these amounts, revenue grew 6.5% to £81.9m in 2017 from 
£76.9m in 2016.
Across our university and college customer base, retention 
rates remained high, and as a result, our Support & Maintenance 
revenue is 3.9% to £33.5m (2016: £32.2m, excluding Synergy), 
representing 53% of the total revenue from our Student 
Management Systems business (2016: 55%).
Adjusted Operating Profit (EBITA)
The adjusted operating profit was £8.5m (2016: £4.7m). Higher 
margin recurring revenues and improved operational efficiencies 
drove an increase in Gross Profit Margin to 50% (2016: 43%). 
The ongoing cost reduction programme initiated in early 2016 
has achieved cumulative annualised savings of £12.0m, of 
which £5.2m were in-year savings (£3.2m from 2016, and a 
further £2.0m in 2017), with an additional £1.0m of savings 
which will be realised in 2018. The impact of foreign exchange 
movement was £0.3m (2016: £0.7m).
There was a negative impact of £1.9m on earnings in 2017 
compared to 2016, as a combined result of the expiry of the 
Ofsted Early Years contract, which contributed £1.0m less in 
2017 (2017: £1.0m; 2016: £2.0m), and the disposal in March 
2016 of the Synergy/SLS business (£0.9m in 2016). 
The adjusted operating profit is after capitalised development 
costs of £2.1m (2016: £1.1m), reflecting the Group’s revised 
product strategy focussing on development of the new Tribal 
Edge platform and continued development of the SchoolEdge 
product. Amortisation charges relating to capitalised 
development were £1.4m (2016: £1.4m). 
All other development costs are expensed as incurred, 
and totalled £8.1m in 2017 (2016: £9.2m). This relates to 
development of the existing product portfolio, including SITS, 
ebs, K2 Asset Management and Maytas, and associated 
overhead and management cost.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Alternative Performance Measures
The Group uses alternative performance measures, detailed 
below, to provide greater understanding of the underlying 
performance of the business. There have been no changes to 
the Group’s Alternative Performance Measures since 2016, 
although the Annually Recurring Revenue now includes Cloud 
services as they are considered recurring revenues; the 2016 
comparative has been restated accordingly.
Adjusted Operating Profit / Adjusted Operating Margin / 
Adjusted Earnings per Share
These measures are in respect of Operating Profit/(Loss) excluding 
certain items not directly related to the trading business or 
regarded as exceptional in nature. These items have been removed 
from the adjusted profit figure and disclosed as “Other Items” on 
the income statement. The main adjustments are as follows:
Share-based Payments
• In 2017, Share-based payment charges of £1.7m (2016: 
£1.0m) are excluded from the Adjusted Operating profit. 
The charges in the current year relate to the matching 
shares granted as part of the rights issue and share 
subscriptions in April 2016 (£0.5m) and the Long Term 
Incentive Plan options (LTIPs) which were granted to the 
Executive Directors in June 2016 and 2017 (£0.6m), and 
to the senior management team in June 2017 (£0.3m).

Amortisation of IFRS3 Intangibles
• The amortisation charge in relation to IFRS3 intangible assets 
of £2.0m (2016: £1.9m) arose from separately identifiable 
assets recognised as part of previous acquisitions. 
The assets principally relate to software and customer 
relationships and are amortised over their expected life 
which was determined in the year the acquisition took place.
Restructuring and associated costs
• Costs of £1.0m (2016: £1.9m) were incurred, which relate 
to redundancy costs for the restructuring of the Group’s 
operations, initiated in 2016 and continued through 2017.
Sales Order Backlog 
The sales order backlog relates to the total value of orders which 
have been signed on or before, but not fully delivered by, 31 
December 2017. This represents the best estimate of business 
expected to be delivered and recognised in future periods, and 
is based on the Total Contract Value (TCV) signed between 
Tribal and the customer, even though customer contracts 
may contain clauses which, under certain circumstances, may 
permit customers to reduce their commitment at a future date. 
Software Support & Maintenance (S&M) revenues are typically 
subject to annual renewal; due to the high renewal rates, two 
years of S&M revenues are included in the backlog calculation.
The total sales order backlog of the Group as at 31 December 
2017 was up 5.8% at £120.4m (2016: £113.8m). 
Annually Recurring Revenue (ARR)
The annually recurring revenue relates to the amount of revenue 
in the year in respect of ongoing services, charged on a recurring 
basis, usually annually, and which the Group considers is likely to 
continue into the future. This includes the total annual Support 
& Maintenance (S&M) fees relating to Tribal’s software products, 
and from 2017 , includes Cloud revenues, which relate to the 
provision of ongoing, annually recurring hosting services provided 
to customers in either a public or a private cloud environment.
The total ARR for 2017 is £37.5m (S&M £33.5m; Cloud services 
£4.0m), which increased by 5.5% from £35.5m in 2016 (S&M 
£32.2m; Cloud services £3.3m).
Operating Cash Conversion
Operating cash conversion is calculated as net cash from 
operating activities before tax as a proportion of adjusted 
operating profit. In 2017, operating cash conversation was 
130% (2016: 115%).
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is included as a key indicator of the cash that is 
generated by the Group and available for further investment or 
distribution. It is calculated as net cash from operating activities 
less capital expenditure and less capitalised development costs 
(excluding acquired intellectual property). In 2017, free cash flow 
was £8.0m (2016: £6.0m).

Net Finance Costs
Overall financing costs were £0.3m (2016: £1.0m). Financing 
costs on the Group’s loan facility decreased to £0.2m (2016: 
£0.6m). Tribal streamlined its credit facilities with Lloyds Banking 
Group and Clydesdale Bank, committed until June 2018, to 
better match the Group's ongoing requirements, reducing its 
revolving credit facility from £25m at the beginning of 2017 to 
£15m from August 2017. From January 2018, the Group reduced 
the facilities further, to £11m including overdraft facilities 
and bank guarantee lines. Discussions are ongoing to renew 
facilities. Other financing costs reduced to £0.1m (2016: £0.4m) 
following reductions in the unwinding of discounts on deferred 
consideration.
Deferred Contingent Consideration
In March 2017, Tribal signed a variation to the Share Purchase 
Agreement with the vendors of Sky Software Pty ("Campus"), 
which amended the terms of the deferred contingent 
consideration payments. Under the variation, it was agreed 
that a combination of cash (AUD$980,325), 670,882 ordinary 
shares and 1,339,286 share options would be paid/issued in 
full and final settlement of all contingent obligations under the 
Agreement.
Going concern
Tribal had net cash of £14.1m at end of 2017, and a revolving 
credit facility of £15m, committed until June 2018, of which 
£6.5m was allocated to trading guarantees with customers at 
31 December 2017. 
“Without Tribal we would not be as 
accurate or as knowledgeable as we 
are. We would struggle to provide the 
best experience to apprentices.”
Leonardo, UK
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 26 The Group’s software products benefit from a significant 
installed customer base, whilst its other activities are typically 
delivered under the framework of long-term contracts. 
Collectively, the Group has a range of customers across 
different geographic areas, good levels of committed income 
and a pipeline of new opportunities. While the Group has a net 
current liability position, the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
which allow for reasonable possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group will be cash generative 
across the forecast period. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has sufficient financial resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Taxation
The corporation tax on continuing operations was £1.8m (2016: 
£0.9m) and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21% (2016: 
21%). This includes the impact of higher rates of taxation arising 
in overseas jurisdictions.
As the Group continues to operate in international jurisdictions 
with a higher rate of corporation tax, it is anticipated that the tax 
charges on profits in the near- to medium-term future is likely to 
be higher than the standard rate of UK corporation tax. 
Share Capital
On 24 April 2017, the Company issued 670,882 shares as part of 
the settlement of the deferred contingent consideration related 
to the acquisition of Sky Software Pty (“Campus”).
As at 31 December 2017 , there were 196,051,181 shares issued.
Related parties
Transactions with related parties during the period are set out in 
note 32. 
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
before other costs, the results of businesses disposed of, and 
intangible asset impairment charges and amortisation, which 
reflects the Group's underlying trading performance, increased 
to 3.2p (2016: 1.9p). 
Statutory earnings per share (diluted) increased to 1.3p (2016: 
loss of 0.7p).
Shareholder returns & dividends
The Board has proposed a full year dividend of 1p per share, 
pending approval at the AGM on 24 April 2018. This will be paid 
in May 2018, with an associated record date of 4 May 2018, an 
ex-dividend date of 3 May 2018 and an anticipated payment 
date of 25 May 2018. The Board of Directors intend to continue 
to pursue a progressive dividend policy with a single dividend 
payment each year following annual results. 
Impact of IFRS15
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ is effective 
for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and introduces 
an amended framework for revenue recognition. The standard 
provides revised guidance on revenue accounting, matching 
the recognition of revenue to the delivery of performance 
obligations in contractual arrangements for the provision of 
products and services. 
The Group has assessed the impact of adopting IFRS 15, and 
has concluded that software license revenue will be recognised 
over the duration of the project implementation period on a 
percentage complete basis. This will spread the recognition of 
license review over an extended period, rather than immediate, 
upfront recognition of license revenue.
In 2017, this is expected to increase the revenue by £0.4m  
to £85.3m and operating profit by £0.4m to £8.9m, a decrease 
of £0.2m to accrued income and a decrease £0.6m to  
deferred income. 
The Group does not expect the capitalisation and amortisation 
of commissions payments related to software licence sales to 
have a material impact.
In 2018, the Group assessment is that there is likely to be 
a modest transitional dip in revenue and operating profit as 
large new contracts won in year are spread over the future 
implementation period, exceeding the restatement of prior  
year revenues.
“We chose Tribal because they 
understand how to balance our need 
for improved student results with 
customised instructional support. Tribal 
consultants challenge teachers and 
principals to rethink their assumptions 
and motivate them to take on high impact,

Our students are the beneficiaries.”

Net Cash and Cashflow
The Group strengthened its net cash position during the year 
with an end of year balance of £14.1m (2016: net cash £8.8m). 
The main movements in cashflow were as follows:
Net Cash generated from operating activities
• Operating cash inflow for the period was £11.1m (2016: 
£8.3m). Free cash flow is £8.0m (2016: £6.0m).
Capital Expenditure
• Capital expenditure totalled £4.4m (2016: £2.4m), 
comprising £2.1 (2016: £1.1m) on software product 
development, £1.5m (2016: £nil) on the acquisition of 
intellectual property from Wambiz and £0.8m (2016: £1.3m) 
on replacement of IT equipment and office premises.
Acquisitions & Deferred Considerations
• The Group made a total net payments £1.1m (2016: 
£3.0m) during the year in relation to the deferred 
consideration obligations of previous acquisitions being 
Campus £0.8m and Callista £0.3m. 
Pension Obligations
As a consequence of certain contract awards, some employees 
participated in defined benefit pension schemes, the largest of 
which relates to the Ofsted Early Years inspection contract we 
entered during the year ended December 2010. Across these 
pensions schemes, the combined deficit calculated under IAS19 
at the end of the year totalled £1.7m (2016: deficit of £1.7m), 
with gross assets of £11.0m and gross liabilities of £12.7m. 
Total actuarial gains recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income are £0.1m (2016: loss of £1.7m). The 
Ofsted Early Years contract expired in March 2017 , and those 
individuals working directly on the contract were transferred 
to Ofsted, under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of 
Employment) act (TUPE). Under the terms of the contract, they 
may elect to transfer their pension plan from Tribal to Ofsted. The 
Group is working with the Pension Ombudsman to finalise the 
scheme valuation and transitional arrangements which we hope 
to conclude in 2018.
Financial Risks
The main financial risks the Group faces relate to the continued 
sales of our software, where a trading downturn puts a strain 
on the operating cash flow, credit risk arising from contractual 
delays or scope changes, fluctuations in interest rates, and 
foreign exchange risk.
Funding arrangements
The Group finances its operations by a combination of 
cash reserves from equity capital, retained profits and 
bank borrowings. The Group Finance team leads treasury 
management and operates within policies reviewed and 
approved by the Board. 
On 30 June 2016, the Group agreed amendments to the terms 
of its banking facilities which remain committed until June 
2018. During 2017 the size of the overall credit facility has been 
voluntarily reduced from £25m to £15m, and reduced further 
in January 2018 to £11m. The maximum permissible leverage 
ratio (measured as the ratio of net debt to EBITDA) must not 
exceed 2x. The definition of EBITDA has also been defined to 
exclude certain non-cash and one-off trading impacts that have 
unfavourable impacts on the calculation. For the foreseeable 
future, the Group is forecast to operate within the bank 
covenant requirements set out in the facility agreements. 
Credit Risk
The Group seeks to reduce the risk of bad debts arising from 
non-payment by our customers. This risk is closely monitored by 
the Credit & Collections team, which form part of Group Finance. 
Tribal incurred no material bad debts during 2017. 
Interest Rate risk
At the end of 2017, Tribal had no bank loan indebtedness. 
However, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk because 
entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. 
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with 
interest rate views and defined risk appetite, and forward rate 
agreements and interest swaps may be used, where appropriate, 
to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. There 
are no open derivative financial instruments at the year end.
Foreign exchange risk
Tribal's reporting currency is Sterling. A number of its subsidiaries 
have different functional currencies, so increases and decreases 
in the value of Sterling versus the currency used by the Group's 
international operations will affect its reported results, and the 
value of assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Tribal's principal currency exchange exposure is to the Australian 
dollar although as at 31 December 2017, the Group was also 
exposed to movements in the rates between Sterling and the 
US dollar, United Arab Emirates Dirhams, South African Rand, and 
New Zealand dollar. See note 32 for further details.
The Group Finance team oversees management of foreign 
exchange risk, and policies and procedures approved by the Board.

lives and contributes so much to society. We believe in fairness, integrity, and ‘doing the 
right thing’. This means we treat our people well, and that we expect to give something 
back to the communities where we work, through our charitable activities. 
Corporate and social responsibility
Our values
Tribal brings together highly talented people in a creative and 
collaborative environment. In 2016, we revisited our values, ran over 
25 workshops globally, and launched a new set of values. In 2017 , we 
continued to embed this work, including launching on-the-spot awards 
to recognise those who “go the extra mile” and clearly demonstrate 
our values. Our role of honour for the year listed over 120 people from 
across the Company, in all areas of the business and from all regions.
We continue to embed our values and challenge ourselves asking 
“What have you done today which shows our values in action?” 
Our values are:
Trustworthy We value honest discussion, we anticipate, 
listen and respond to requirements and we rely on each other
Pioneering We welcome change, we strive to innovate and we 
aim to meet the needs of the ever-evolving education market place
Accountable We take ownership, we keep our promises 
and are focused on delivering successful outcomes
Dedicated We are committed to our customers; work to secure 
long-term partnerships and we collaborate to deliver optimum solutions
Our people
Tribal’s capabilities are founded on the talent and expertise of our 
people. Our development, retention and recruitment strategies at 
all levels of the business have a strong emphasis on diversity. Our 
work with Business in the Community has helped us to benchmark 
our practices and seek new approaches to attracting, retaining and 
developing a diverse range of talent and we continually review our 
people practices, ensuring they enable all talent to thrive at Tribal. 
Our success as a growing international business is a tribute to our 
people’s energy, commitment and know-how. We invest in our people, 
providing them with the tools and training to support and enable 
them to realise their potential. We continue to build on our learning 
and development programmes. In 2017 we ran numerous courses, 
including business development programmes and the continuation 
of our Manager Academy which broadens the skills and commercial 
awareness of our leaders and future leaders. A highlight in 2017 was 
the successful piloting of e-learning as a part of our L&D strategy.  
This resulted in a significant investment to offer every Developer 
globally unlimited access to a leading-edge learning platform, 
Pluralsight. We also successfully piloted LinkedIn e-learning in several 
departments and have progressed a wider roll-out in 2018. 
Engaging with people
Tribal operates from a range of offices in the UK and around the world. 
Communication among our people is crucial. We use a combination of 
Group-wide updates, including webinars, as well as running specific 
local communication sessions. We supplement these events by

We continue to listen to our people and at the end of 2017 completed 
a detailed cross-Company engagement survey. The results of this will 
give us a baseline for planning further work in 2018 and ensuring we 
have an engaged and motivated team.
Gender Pay Equality
Tribal has published its first Gender Pay Gap statutory report for our UK 
employees, prepared as required under the Equality Act 2010 (Gender 
Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017 that came into effect in April 
2017 . Like the vast majority of UK companies, we do have a gender pay 
gap, primarily because there are more women than men in our lower paid 
roles, but fewer in higher paid ones.
We are encouraged to see that, as far as the data is concerned, we are 
in a better or comparable position to UK businesses in relation to the 
Gender Pay Gap. For example, Tribal’s mean gender pay gap, at 14.5%, 
is below the UK national average of 17 .4% as reported by The Office of 
National Statistics (ONS). Our median pay gap, at 18.8%, is only very 
slightly above the ONS national average of 18.4%.
This gives us reassurance that we are starting from a better position 
than some, and whilst we do not underestimate the challenge at hand 
and impact of wider societal norms, we look forward to continuing and 
reviewing our progress in years to come. 
The Tribal Foundation
Tribal’s charity, the Tribal Foundation, supports projects in the UK and 
globally which reflect Tribal’s expertise in education. 
Tribal match every pound donated and the Foundation is also able to 
access additional funding from the EU and other sources including gift 
aid, which can make a huge impact on the quality of life of the people 
we support. Since its establishment, the Foundation has contributed 
around £0.6m to a variety of programmes.

new learners to get involved with adult learning, 
and to promote adult learning courses to a 
wider audience in Leeds. Tribal’s leading learner 
management system, Maytas, has enabled them 
to make great steps towards achieving this vision. 
In September 2017 they launched the Leeds Adult 
Learning website, with Maytas being instrumental 
in enabling the effectiveness of this platform. 
The council quickly realised a learning management 
solution would not only meet their data processing 
requirements but would also help existing learners 
to progress onto further courses. Starting an 
adult learning course can be a huge decision for an 
individual, and Leeds City Council understood that 
the right solution could simplify this process for 
the learners. 
Leeds City Council engaged the Open Data 
Institute (ODI) and Innovation labs to create a 
searchable data driven website solution that 
integrated with Maytas. The result – Leeds Adult 
Learning – launched in September 2017. The 
website offers one platform for a range of adult 
learning courses across Leeds in a variety of 
different venues. The council also aims to expand 
the website to include data from the wider Leeds 
adult learning institutions as well as looking at 
options to utilise Maytas to support them as an 
apprenticeship employer-provider in 2018. 
“Tribal consultants listened closely to our 
ambitions, aspirations and high expectations of 
a system that could capture and process data 
from 30 subcontracted providers. It’s interesting 
seeing that become a reality, alongside being 
compliant with ESFA funding rules and data returns” 
said Keri Evans, Communities and Partnerships 
Senior Manager, Employment  and Skills, at Leeds 
City Council.

Tertiary Education 
Commission  
New Zealand 
The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is 
responsible for the New Zealand Government’s 
$2.9 billion investment across over 700 tertiary 
education organisations in NZ. It leads the 
Government’s relationship with the tertiary 
education sector which includes universities, 
polytechnics, private training establishments, 
industry training organisation and other providers 
of higher education and training. 
On behalf of the TEC, Tribal has supplied for the 
last 10 years a performance benchmarking 
service to all Universities, Institutions of 
Technology & Polytechnics (ITPs) and Wānanga in 
NZ. This provides a comprehensive view of both 
financial and educational performance, looking  
at financial inputs and educational attainments, 
such as course completion rates, to provide  
a robust performance measurement and 
monitoring framework. 
Tribal’s benchmarking service, NZBT+, provides 
a holistic view of an institution’s performance by 
linking financial data and key qualitative indicators, 
helping identify areas where investment may 
be required, as well as opportunities for greater 
cost efficiencies. It offers an independent 
measurement of financial and educational 
performance to support informed strategic 
decision making and forward planning. 
“The biggest benefit of Tribal’s NZBT+ is how it 
has enabled education organisations to have 
meaningful self-assessment and self-review, so 
that they can have confidence to make informed 
decisions that ultimately benefit the students. 
The Tribal team’s flexibility and commitment to 
the partnership has allowed us to work together 
to support the success of our providers and 
help them deliver high-quality education for New 
Zealanders” said Julia Kennedy, Principal Advisor in 
the TEC’s Monitoring and Crown Ownership Team.

 39 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Corporate Governance
Tribal is committed to high standards of corporate governance and maintaining sound 
business ethics.
The Directors acknowledge the importance of good corporate governance and although not compulsory for companies 
listed on AIM, have chosen to adopt the principles of the Quoted Companies Alliance Code (“QCA”) to the extent they 
consider them appropriate for a company of the size and nature of Tribal Group plc. 
The PLC Board applies the principles of good governance and supports a culture of open debate and constructive challenge to 
enable Tribal to meet its objectives. In fulfilling their responsibilities, the Directors govern the Group in the best interest of the 
Company and its shareholders whilst having due regard to the interests of other stakeholders including customers, employees, 
suppliers and regulators.
The PLC Board
The PLC Board (“the Board”) is responsible for the Company’s 
systems of corporate governance. 
The Non-Executive Directors are Richard Last and Roger 
McDowell, both are considered to be independent of 
management and free from any business or other relationships 
that could materially interfere with the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Non-Executive Directors meet  
at least once a year without the Executive Directors present.
All Directors are required to submit to re-election each year  
at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company. 
All the Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Legal Counsel. Each Director is entitled, if necessary, to seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
The Board meets at least eight times each year with additional 
meetings when circumstances and urgent business dictate. 
At these meetings the Board reviews a schedule of reserved 
matters including trading performance, financial strength, 
strategy (including investment and acquisition opportunities), 
risk management, controls, compliance, reports to 
shareholders and succession management.
The Board plans to evaluate its performance and that of its 
Committees through a process of regular dialogue and periodic 
formal Board evaluations.
Delegated Authorities
All other matters not specifically reserved to the Board are 
delegated to management in accordance with a schedule of 
Delegated Authorities. These delegated authorities cover 
expenditure, agreements, financial matters, remuneration and 
agreements with third parties. Management is required to report 
to the Board concerning authority exercised and matters which 
come, or may come, within the scope of the Board.
Subsidiary Boards
The Group’s subsidiary companies operate a Board of 
Directors that comprises at least one PLC Director and senior 
management of the subsidiary as appropriate.
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Board Committees
The PLC Board has established three committees to assist in the effective operation of the Board: the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee. Each Committee has responsibility to the Board which are outlined 
in formal Terms of Reference that have been approved by the Board. The Terms of Reference, which are available on the Group’s 
website www.tribalgroup.com, are subject to annual review to ensure the Committees continue to follow best practice. The 
Chairman of each Committee reports to the PLC Board after each Committee meeting and minutes are tabled at the next PLC 
Board meeting.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Roger McDowell and comprises Richard Last. The Chief Executive Officer and representatives 
from finance and our external auditors participate in the meeting as non-voting observers. The Committee meets three times a year.
The Committee oversees the Group’s financial reporting and internal controls, including their effectiveness and risk management 
processes, and the external audit process and has the following responsibilities:
• Considering reports from the auditors on the annual and half-yearly financial statements
• Monitoring the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and formal announcements relating to the Group’s  
financial performance
• Making recommendations to the Board on the appointment and remuneration of the external auditors
• Reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process
• Considering reports on the effectiveness of the Group’s risk-management procedures and internal controls.
The Committee advise the PLC Board on the appointment, independence and objectivity of the external auditors and on the 
remuneration for both audit and non-audit work. The Committee also discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with 
the external auditors. The Audit Committee Chairman separately meets with the external auditors during the course of the year.
The auditors’ report to the Audit Committee on matters including independence and non-audit fees on an annual basis. The specific 
audit partner changes every five years. The amount charged by the external auditors for the provision of services during the 12 
month period under review is set out in Note 5 of the financial statements on page 75.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Roger McDowell 
and includes Richard Last. The Committee meets at least 
once a year.
The Committee sets the remuneration of the Directors, 
including basic salary, bonuses and other incentive payments 
and awards. It also ratifies policy proposals in respect of 
remuneration of senior executives in the Group.
The Remuneration report which details the Directors’ 
remuneration, pension entitlements and service contracts, 
including information on Directors’ interests, is set out on 
pages 45 to 49.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is chaired by Richard Last and 
includes Roger McDowell and Ian Bowles, who provides 
Executive management insight. The Committee meets at  
least once a year.
The Committee deals with appointments to the PLC Board, 
monitors potential conflicts of interest and reviews the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors.
The PLC Board also operates the following management 
Boards and committees: 
Executive Board
The Executive Board is chaired by Ian Bowles. The members of 
the Executive Board are drawn from the heads of the business 
units and other operational areas. The Executive Board 
typically meets monthly but the members interact frequently 
in the normal course of their roles. The Executive Board 
oversees the Group’s operational and financial performance 
and is responsible for day-to-day management decisions in 
line with the Group’s strategy. It also considers succession 
planning and talent management. Further matters are outlined 
in the Delegated Authorities. 
Integrated Governance Committee
The Integrated Governance Committee is chaired by the Chief 
Financial Officer and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Committee meets monthly and includes representatives 
from Finance, Information Services, Human Resources, Legal, 
Compliance, Property and Procurement. There are separate 
sub-committees for Health & Safety and Information Security 
which monitor relevant legislative and regulatory requirements.
Internal controls and risk management
The Board is responsible for establishing and monitoring 
internal control and risk management systems throughout 
the Group and assessing their effectiveness. The Board 
recognises that rigorous systems of internal control are 
critical to the Group’s achievement of its business objectives 
and that those systems are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risk of failure to achieve business objectives. The 
internal control and risk management systems can only 
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Tribal maintains a risk framework that contains the key risks 
faced by the Group. The framework includes the impact 
and likelihood of key risks and the controls and procedures 
implemented to mitigate them. Risk management is embedded 
within Tribal by:
• Setting strategic direction, including targets
• Maintaining a clear authorisation framework
• Reviewing and approving annual plans and budgets
• Maintaining documented policies and procedures
• Regularly reviewing and monitoring the Group’s performance 
in relation to risk through monthly Board reports.
The Directors are also responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s internal financial 
controls and risk management systems and the Board reviews 
the effectiveness of all the Group’s internal controls including 
operational and compliance controls and risk management 
systems in effect during the period.
To further manage risks faced by the Group, the Company 
attempts to ensure that employees fully understand the 
Group’s business strategy and objectives. The Group’s 
communication and consultation programme includes regular 
internal briefings by Directors to all employees throughout 
the year. Regular meetings are held with staff and managers, 
both to discuss specific issues and provide an exchange of 
information. Email and the Group’s intranet site also provide 
information to employees.
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting system 
whereby managers submit detailed budgets and forecasts, 
which are reviewed and, where appropriate, amended by 
Executive Directors prior to submission to the Board for 
approval. Each month, actual results are reported against 
budget and distributed to managers and are provided to the 
Board in advance of meetings.
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 Communication with shareholders
The Group reports formally to shareholders when its annual 
and half-yearly financial statements are published. At the same 
time, Executive Directors present the results to institutional 
investors, analysts and the media. Notification of the date 
of the AGM is sent to shareholders at least 21 working days 
in advance of the meeting. Details of the AGM are set out in 
the Notice of Meeting. The Directors are available at the AGM 
to answer questions, both during the course of the meeting, 
and informally afterwards. Contact with major shareholders 
is principally maintained by the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer, who ensure that their views are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. The Chairman is also 
available to discuss governance and other matters directly 
with major shareholders. At every Board meeting, the Board 
is provided with the latest brokers’ reports and a summary 
of the contents of any meetings with shareholders. The 
Board considers that the provision of these documents is a 
practical and efficient way for both the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director to be informed of major shareholders’ 
opinions on governance and strategy and to understand any 
shareholder issues and concerns. 
Approved by the Board of Directors on 22 March 2018.

Audit Committee report
The Audit Committee report details the key activities 
undertaken during the year.
Activities of the Committee during the year 
The Committee’s activities have focused on the accuracy of 
financial reporting and the related statutory audit; and the 
assessment of internal controls. During the year the Committee 
was involved in the reviewing and approving of the annual report 
and accounts for 2017 and the half year report and accounts 
for 2017, overseeing the Group’s readiness for General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance and reviewing the 
Group’s banking arrangements. In addition, the Committee 
reviewed the position of the Group’s independent external 
auditors and re-appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
Financial reporting and statutory audit 
The Committee has reviewed with both management and the 
external auditors the half year and annual financial statements, 
focusing on: 
• the overall truth and fairness of the results and financial 
position, including the clarity of disclosures shown in the 
statements and their compliance with statutory and best 
practice requirements; 
• the appropriateness of the accounting policies and practices 
used in arriving at those results;
• the resolution of management’s significant accounting 
judgements or of matters raised by the external auditors 
during the course of their half year review and annual 
statutory audit; and
• the quality of the Annual Report taken as a whole, 
including disclosures on Governance, Strategy, Risks and 
Remuneration, and whether it gives a fair and balanced 
picture of the Group. 
External audit 
The Committee discussed, challenged and agreed with 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP their detailed audit plans prepared 
in advance of the audit, which set out their assessment of key 
audit risks and materiality. The approach to their work on the half 
year results was also discussed and agreed. 
Accounting policies, practices and judgements 
The selection of appropriate accounting policies and practices 
is the responsibility of management, and the Committee 
discussed these with both management and the external 
auditors. Significant areas considered by the Committee in 
relation to the 2017 financial statements are set out below. 
Going concern
The Group is required to assess its ability to trade as a going 
concern for at least 12 months from the signing of the annual 
financial statements. The Committee reviewed management’s 
assessment and concluded that it remained appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Revenue recognition
The Group’s operations include complex software delivery 
programmes and service activities that can require judgements 
to be made in relation to the timing of revenue recognition. The 
Committee reviewed the revenue recognition judgements taken 
and it was concluded that the judgements were appropriate.
Goodwill
The Group is required to test annually whether goodwill has 
suffered any impairment and consider whether the fixed assets 
used in the business are carried at an appropriate amount. The 
Committee reviewed management’s impairment testing and 
concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill or any of 
the fixed assets used in the business. 
Capitalised product development costs
The Group’s product development costs are capitalised 
where the expenditure meets the criteria of IAS38, and 
the recoverability assessed annually against expected 
future cashflows. The Committee reviewed management’s 
capitalisation process and recoverability assessment and 
concluded the capitalisation was appropriate and there was  
no impairment. 
Assessment of internal financial control 
Management is responsible for putting in place internal financial 
controls over financial reporting and to protect the business 
from identified material risks. The Committee continues to 
monitor these closely and they are happy they are appropriate 
for the business. 
New accounting standards 
The Committee has continued to be kept appraised of progress 
of the Group’s preparations for the implementation of IFRS 15 
(Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 9 (Financial 
Instruments) which the Group will implement in the year ending 
31 December 2018. 
Approved by the Audit Committee on 22 March 2018.
Roger McDowell
Chairman, Audit Committee 45 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
The Remuneration report details the Group’s remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration 
of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors
Remuneration policy
The full Directors’ remuneration policy is shown below for ease of reference, updated with minor changes. A shareholder vote on the 
remuneration policy is not required except as set out below. The original version of the report is set out in the 2014 Annual Report, 
which is available on the Group’s website (www.tribalgroup.com). 
The table below details each element of pay and demonstrates how the remuneration policy is linked to overall Group strategy. 
Element of Pay
Purpose and link to 
Strategy Operation including maximum Performance Criteria
Salary To attract and retain 
high-quality individuals 
with the appropriate skills, 
experience, and knowledge, 
while also recognising their 
on-going performance.
Salaries are reviewed annually or when an individual 
changes position or responsibility. Salaries for the 
current year are set out on page 47.
Assessment of personal and corporate 
performance.
Benefits To provide a range of cost-
effective benefits which 
are typical market practice.
The main benefits provided include private medical 
insurance, a death in service benefit of four times 
salary and private fuel.
None.
Pension To provide cost-effective 
long-term retirement 
benefits which are aligned 
with market practice.
Contributions of 10% of salary are paid to Executive 
Directors. An equivalent cash supplement may 
be paid to an individual if the annual or lifetime 
allowance has been met or exceeded.
None.
Annual Bonus To incentivise and reward 
for the achievement of 
in-year objectives, which 
are linked to the Group’s 
Adjusted Operating Profit.
An annual cash bonus is payable up to a maximum of 
100% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 
70% for the Chief Financial Officer, subject to the 
achievement of performance targets. In all cases, 
bonus payments are subject to the overriding 
discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance measures.
Long-term 
Incentives
To incentivise and reward 
for the achievement of 
long-term performance, 
which is aligned to the 
generation of shareholder 
value.
An annual grant of nil-cost options, which vest after 
three years subject to continued service and the 
achievement of performance conditions.
The plan limit for an award in any year is 200% of 
base salary. The normal policy will be to grant 100% 
of base salary to the Chief Executive Officer and the 
Chief Financial Officer.
Dividends which accrue on vested awards may be 
paid as cash, or treated as reinvested and paid in 
shares.
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance measures and targets 
annually. The Remuneration Committee 
has determined that a share price 
growth target is an appropriate measure 
for awards granted in 2016 and 2017.
No more than 33.3% of the award 
would pay out for threshold levels of 
performance.
All employee 
plans
To encourage broad-based 
employee shareholding in 
the Group.
The Share Incentive Plan (SIP) currently provides all 
employees with the opportunity to acquire shares in 
a tax-efficient manner up to £150 per month.
None.
The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) operates the annual bonus plan and long-term incentive plans according to their 
respective rules, the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. 
Remuneration report Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 46
The use of performance measures
Annual bonus targets will include financial measures which reflect the performance of the business and are directly linked to the 
Group’s Adjusted Operating Profit.
Long-term incentive performance measures are chosen to be aligned to long-term shareholder value creation by using a share price 
growth measure.
Directors’ service contracts
Details of service agreements and notice periods are as follows:

Copies of each Director’s service agreement will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Under the terms of their appointment, the Non-Executive Directors have agreed to commit not less than 25 days per annum to their 
roles. If they are required to commit in excess of 25 days per annum, they may be entitled to an additional fee at a suitable pro rata 
rate per day. 
Policy on payments for loss of office
The Committee aims to deal fairly with cases of termination, while attempting to limit compensation. Executives’ service contracts 
provide the Committee with the discretion to make a payment in lieu of notice limited to base salary. The Committee also retains 
the discretion to pay an annual bonus on a departure in certain circumstances. The rules of the long-term incentive plan set out the 
treatment if a participant leaves employment prior to awards vesting. If the participant is considered a good leaver (through death, 
retirement, injury or disability, redundancy, employment being transferred outside the Group, or any other reason the Committee 
decides) then awards would normally vest on the normal vesting date. In the event of a change of control, an award may vest early 
subject to the extent the performance conditions have been achieved and scaled back pro rata for service, although the Committee 
has the discretion to disapply time pro-rating.
Non-Executive Directors have a defined notice period and no compensation or other benefits are payable other than the potential 
share-based incentives in respect of Richard Last and Roger McDowell.
Risk
The Committee is cognisant of the need for the remuneration policy to operate within an effective risk management system. The 
Committee reviews the various elements of remuneration on an annual basis, to ensure that they do not encourage any undue risk-
taking by Executive Directors or senior management. When setting performance targets for variable components of remuneration, 
the Committee remains mindful of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues. The Committee does not believe that the 
current remuneration structure will encourage dysfunctional behaviours or would reward despite a negative ESG event.
Shareholder’s Views
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received at the AGM and during meetings with investors throughout the year, and 
uses these views to help formulate the overall remuneration policy. 
External Board Appointments
It is recognised that external non-executive directorships may be beneficial for both the Company and Executive. At the discretion 
of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.

Remuneration report continued 49 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
All-Employee Plans
The Committee believes wider employee share ownership can act as an additional retention and motivation vehicle, and therefore 
encourages broad based participation in the SIP scheme. During the year, employees, including the Executive Directors, were invited 
to take part in the SIP . The Committee regularly monitors the participation level in the all-employee arrangements.
Position against dilution limit
The share incentive plans operate in line with the ABI principle, which requires that all commitments must not exceed 10% of the 
issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period. Given the Company’s issued share capital, the number of employees and the level 
of participation in the LTIP , the Committee believe that operating a single 10% in 10 year limit for all share plans remains appropriate. 
The Group’s position against the dilution limit at 31 December 2017 was 6.2%.
Executive Directors external appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept an external non-executive position with the Board’s approval. Any fees received in respect 
of these appointments may be retained by the Executive. No such fees were received by the Executive Directors during the year. 
Approved by the Remuneration Committee on 22 March 2018.

The Group has a three year revolving credit facility committed 
until June 2018 totalling £15m including a £1m overdraft facility 
and £6.5m for trading guarantees with customers as at 31 
December 2017. During the year the Group voluntarily reduced 
the facility from £25m and has further reduced it to £11m from 
January 2018. At the end of 2017 none of the overdraft facility 
was drawn down. Following a review of the Group’s forecasts 
and projections, the Directors consider the Group is well placed 
to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future. 
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Group 
is given in note 31 of the financial statements.
Risks and uncertainties
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties are explained in 
the Strategic Report on page 30. Risks of a financial nature are 
addressed in the CFO’s report on page 24 to 28, and note 31 of 
the financial statements.
Directors’ indemnities

for the benefit of its Directors, which remain in force at the date of 
this report and throughout the year. Directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance is provided for all Directors of the Company.
Directors retiring
The names of the Directors who served during the year and up to 
the date of signing the financial statements are set out on page 
41. All Directors are required to submit to re-election each year 
and will be proposed for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related 
legislations. The Articles themselves may be amended by 
special resolution of the shareholders.
Directors’ interests and share capitals information regarding 
Directors’ interests in the Company, including share options,  
are detailed in the Remuneration report on page 45 and 49.
Political and Charitable contributions

made to a variety of causes and to both local and national 
charities. There were no political donations.
Share capital
Details of the authorised and issued share capital are shown 
in note 24 to the financial statements. The Company has one 
class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income. 
Each share carries the right to one vote at general meetings of 
the Company. During the year, the Company issued 670,882 
ordinary shares of 1p (2016: 100,531,058).
Branches
The Group has overseas branches in Australia, New Zealand,

Employees
Tribal is a business which is highly dependent on its people. 
We seek to attract, develop and retain high-calibre staff and, 
as a consequence, our customers can be assured that the 
service they receive is among the best available. The Group’s 
commitment to its people is discussed in the Corporate 
responsibility section on page 32.
The Group is an equal opportunities employer and bases all 
decisions on individual ability, regardless of race, religion, 
gender, sexual orientation, age or disability. Applications for 
employment by disabled persons will always be fully considered, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Should 
any employee become disabled, every practical effort is made 
to provide continued employment. Depending on their skills 
and abilities, they enjoy the same career prospects and scope 
for realising their potential as other employees. Appropriate 
training is arranged for disabled employees, including retraining 
for alternative work for those who become disabled, to promote 
their career development within the organisation.
The Board has considered the recommendations made in the 
Davies Report, published in February 2011, entitled ‘Women on 
Boards’ and while appointments will continue to be made based 
upon merit, the Group has implemented and continues to support 
its “Women in Tribal Initiative” and has appointed representatives 
to promote those recommendations, where appropriate.
Research and development
The Group continues to invest in research and development of 
software products, as set out in notes 5 and 15 of the financial 
statements. This has resulted in a number of new modules 
to existing software products in our APAC region which we 
expect to contribute to the growth of our business and the 
development of the Group’s next generation cloud-based 
Student information System, TribalEdge. Total research and 
development expenditure moved to £4.7m (2016: £3.2m) of 
which £2.1m (2016: £1.1m) was capitalised.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant events since the balance sheet date.
Future development
An indication of likely future developments in the business of 
the Group is included in the Strategic Report.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulation.

as adopted by the European Union and Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”, and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group and Company for that period. In preparing the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:

statements, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Gompany 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements  
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the  
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and Company and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors of the ultimate parent company are responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the of the ultimate parent 
company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Group and Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
Directors’ responsibility statement confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, 
comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, 
and applicable law), give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
Corporate Governance
The Company’s statement on corporate governance compliance 
can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 
40 to 43 of the Annual Report and Accounts. The corporate 
governance report forms part of this Directors’ report and is 
incorporated by reference.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with Section 418, Directors’ reports shall include 
a statement, in the case of each Director in office at the date 
the Directors’ report is approved, that:
• So far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
• He has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Opinion
In our opinion:
• Tribal Group plc’s Group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a 
true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the Group’s 
profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”, 
and applicable law); and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 (the “Annual Report”), which 
comprise: the consolidated and Company only balance sheets as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, and the consolidated and Company 
only statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach 
Overview 
• Overall group materiality: £845,000 (2016: £900,000), based on 1% of Total revenue.
• Overall parent company materiality: £438,000 (2016: £360,000), based on 0.6% of Total Assets.
• We focused our group audit scope primarily on the operations of the main UK trading entity and the 
Australian sub group. 
• The UK branch of Tribal Education Limited and Australian sub group, were subject to full scope audit. 
• These operations represent the principal business units and account for 85% (2016: 91%) of the 
Group’s revenue.
• Revenue recognition.
• Impairment of indefinite life intangibles.
The scope of the audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  55 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make 
on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks 
identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition
The Group has recognised £85 million (2016: £90 million) of revenue 
in the year. The Group’s key revenue recognition policies are set out 
in note 1 to the financial statements. The risk relates to the key 
judgements required in applying these policies.
The accounting judgements can be complex when associated with 
recognition of invoiced and accrued income for contracts where 
there are specific ongoing delivery challenges, history of slow or 
non-payment, ongoing commercial negotiations, contract claims or 
contract losses. There is also a risk that invoiced and accrued revenue 
on such contracts may not be recoverable.
The timing of when delivery has occurred for software/ licences can 
also be complex (as no physical delivery usually occurs with software 
and encryption keys being sent electronically). Given the material 
nature of the Group’s licence contracts there is a risk that licence 
revenues are recorded in the wrong period.
We sought to identify those contracts where 
management may have encountered unexpected 
complexities in delivering the project. We made 
inquiries of operational management to identify 
contract claims or potential losses, reviewed project 
financial information and sought evidence of payment 
against milestones. 
We evaluated recoverability of invoiced and accrued 
income by selecting a risk-based sample of projects 
and obtaining evidence to support recoverability, 
including subsequent payments, explanations from 
operational teams, customer correspondence, and 
history of customer payments.
We obtained customer acceptance of licences near 
the year end to ensure management have followed 
the documented policies and procedures prior to 
recognising licence revenue.
Impairment of indefinite life intangibles
The carrying value of goodwill as at 31 December 2017 was £21.1million 
allocated to three cash generating units (CGUs) related to the Group’s three 
business segments. No impairment has been recognised in the current year. 
Further detail is included in note 13 to the financial statements (“Goodwill”) 
and notes 1 and 2 which set out the Group’s accounting policy and critical 
judgements in relation to the impairment of goodwill.
The standard for impairment of assets, IAS 36, states that all indefinite 
lived intangible assets (those not subject to amortisation), including 
goodwill, should be tested for impairment annually.
Management have identified the cash generating units (CGUs) for the 
impairment as being; Student Management Systems, i-graduate and 
Quality Assurance Services. The impairment assessment has been 
performed against the assets and liabilities allocated to these segments.
Estimation of the recoverable amount requires management to make 
assumptions in respect of forecast operating cash flows, long-term 
growth rates and discount rates. The assumptions and judgements  
in assessing the carrying value of the intangibles are judgemental, 
giving rise to risk in respect of valuation.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the key 
assumptions driving the cash flow forecasts including 
forecast future performance, discount rates and 
short and long-term growth rates. We considered 
the accuracy of prior year forecasts and performed 
sensitivities across the reporting segments.
We concluded that the assumptions used by 
management were reasonable. 
We also ensured that the disclosures in relation to 
the assumptions and sensitivities, particularly in 
relation to the i-graduate CGU where the headroom 
was lowest and therefore most sensitive to changes in 
assumptions were appropriate.
Given this management has disclosed relevant 
sensitivities (see note 13). 
 
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the parent company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the parent company, the accounting processes and 
controls, and the industry in which they operate.
The Group principally operates from the UK and Australia, accounting for 85% of total revenues, and across 3 business segments, 
SMS, i-graduate and QAS. All Group entities moved onto a common general ledger platform from 1 January 2017 giving improved 
reporting capability of the Group’s results, while the Australian finance function moved into the UK during the year.  Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 56
The UK and Australian operations were scoped for full audit procedures, along with specific line items in other territories where 
they contributed between 5–15% of a specific line item. Across the components subject to audit the population covered by our 
audit sample is 97% (2016: 76%) of the Group’s consolidated revenue. The lowest level of coverage we obtained for any financial 
statement line item was 59%.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process, including testing of consolidation journals, and carried out 
analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to full scope audit.
The UK firm performed all audit work except the audit of Australian tax balances where we determined the Australian firm had the 
better expertise and knowledge.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Overall  
materiality
£845,000 (2016: £900,000). £438,000 (2016: £360,000).
How we  
determined it
1% of Total revenue. 0.6% of Total Assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
The business has experienced significant volatility in recent years 
and the Group has gone under a significant restructure, following a 
significant divestment in the prior year, new management team and 
strategy. Accordingly revenue is deemed to be the most appropriate 
benchmark, we also note that it is a key metric that the Company’s 
analysts use to track and measure the Group’s performance.
The parent company is a holding 
company and does not trade. Total 
assets reflecting primarily the 
investment in the trading companies 
best represents the nature and purpose 
of the entity.
For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.  
The materiality allocated was £739,000 for both significant components. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £42,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £27,000) and £21,900 (Parent company audit) (2016: £18,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, 
in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when: 
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the Group’s and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least 
twelve months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are 
required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.
Independent Auditors’ Report  
to the Members of Tribal Group plc continued 57 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance 
with applicable legal requirements. 
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. 
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibility Statement set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

1. Accounting policies
General information
Tribal Group plc (the Company) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The 
Company is a public limited company which is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM). The address of the registered 
office is given on page 108. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the nature of the Group’s 
operations are set out in note 4 and in the strategic report on pages 7 to 33. The financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. Foreign operations 
are included in accordance with the policies set out below. The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements on pages 58 to 100 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting  
Standards (IFRSs) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to Companies reporting  
under IFRS.
The financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments (Share based payments) 
which are recognised at fair value. 
The preparation of financial statements in conforming with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a 
higher degreee of judgement or complexity, or ares where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements 
are disclosed in note 2.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current financial year, the Group has applied a number of amendments to IFRSs and new interpretations by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) that are mandatorily effective for an accounting period that begins on or after 1 January 2017 
including amendments to IAS 7 Statement of cashflow disclosure, IAS 12 Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, 
and Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014–2016 Cycle. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures 
or on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
At the date of the authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been 
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 2 (amendments) Share based payments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 15 (amendments) Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts
IFRS 4 (amendments) ‘Insurance contracts’ regarding the implementation of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments
Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycles 
The Group has assessed the impact of adopting IFRS 15, and has concluded that software License revenue will be recognised 
over the duration of the project Implementation period on a percentage complete basis. This will spread the recognition of License 
revenue over an extended period, rather than immediate, upfront recognition. There will be no changes to the timing of the recognition 
of Implementation or Support & Maintenance revenue. In 2017 , this is expected to increase the revenue by £0.4m to £85.3m and 
operating profit by £0.4m to £8.9m, a decrease of £0.2m to accrued income and a decrease of £0.6m to deferred income.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 however it is not anticipated that the new standard will have a 
material impact on the Group.
It is anticipated that IFRS 16 could have a potentially material impact on the Group. For IFRS 16 it is not practicable to provide a 
reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.

Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64
1. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has the rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee: and 
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. All intra group transactions, balances, income 
and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Adoption of the going concern basis
The Directors, having considered the cash-flow forecast, and while noting the Group has net current liabilities, have performed a 
risk assessment of likely downside scenarios and associated mitigating actions, and have a reasonable expectation that adequate 
financial resources will continue to be available for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable from the provision of goods and services to third party 
customers in the normal course of business. Revenue is stated excluding sales tax and trade discounts. The particular recognition 
policies applied in respect of the various potential elements of short-term or repeat service contracts are as set out below. Analysis 
has been provided by revenue stream:
Student Management Systems:
• Revenue on perpetual software licences is recognised on transfer to the customer of the risks and rewards of ownership 
providing there are no unfulfilled obligations that are essential to the functionality of the product. If such obligations exist, 
revenue is recognised as they are fulfilled. The transfer of the risks and rewards takes place when the customer has the 
opportunity to access the software. Depending on the specific nature of the product in question and whether they are a new 
site, or an existing customer purchasing new modules, the customer has the opportunity to access the software when links  
are provided, licence keys issued, or installation completed.
• Revenue from term software licences is spread over the period of the licence.
• Revenue from contracts for software maintenance and support is recognised on a pro rata basis over the contract period, 
reflecting the Group’s obligation to support the relevant software products and update their content over the contract period.
• Other services that are purchased for a specific term are recognised on a pro rata basis over the contract period. This includes 
services such as hosting and managed IT services. 
• Revenue from software implementation, consultancy and other services that involve the purchase of a number of days is 
recognised as the service is provided.
Quality Assurance Services and i-graduate:
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised upon transfer to the customer of the risks and rewards of ownership. This is 
generally when services are performed for customers. The method by which the Group measures the service being performed 
varies depending on the nature of the contract, but will typically be driven by either time incurred or deliverables delivered as 
appropriate to the particular arrangement with the customer.
Interest is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
For multi-element contracts that include more than one revenue stream, the fair value of the component parts is established and 
revenue recognised for each element in line with the relevant policy above. Where separate contracts are entered into at or near the 
same time, with the same entity and were negotiated as a package, they are treated as a single arrangement. 
In addition to this, the Group has long-term contracts for the provision of more complex, project-based services including 
arrangements that involve significant production, modification, or customisation of software. Where the outcome of such long-
term project-based contracts can be measured reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion 
of the project at the balance sheet date. This is measured by the proportion that development time incurred for work performed to 
date bears to the estimated total development time required. Variations in contract work and claims are included to the extent that 
the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable. 
Where the outcome of a long-term project-based contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the 
extent of contract costs that it is probable will be recovered. When it is probable that the total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense within administrative expenses immediately. 65 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
1. Accounting policies continued
Deferred contingent consideration
The Group has a number of deferred consideration obligations arising from previous acquisitions which are subject to both 
contingent and non-contingent performance criteria. All acquisitions are now outside of the measurement period for fair value 
acquisition accounting.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of deferred contingent consideration, and non-contingent consideration if applicable, 
that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments, and for which consideration is classified as an asset or liability is 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. 
Any equity based consideration is recognised in equity at the date it is agreed and would not be remeasured at subsequent 
reporting dates, with subsequent settlement accounted for within equity.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the 
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the combination. CGUs (or groups of 
CGUs) to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that 
the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU (or groups of CGUs) is less than its carrying amount, the impairment 
loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGUs (or group of CGUs) and then to the other 
assets of the CGU (or groups of CGUs) pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a division, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on 
disposal. Goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, 
subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve comprises the non-statutory premium arising on shares issued as consideration for acquisitions of 
subsidiaries where merger relief under the relevant section of the Companies Act applies. To the extent that the creation of 
goodwill originally gave rise to a merger reserve, upon impairment an appropriate amount is transferred from the merger reserve 
to the profit and loss reserve. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is 
any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is 
estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any). Tangible and Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives (see notes 14 and 15).
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. The estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced  
to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised  
as income immediately. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 66
1. Accounting policies continued
Business systems
The Group’s business systems are treated as an intangible asset where the probable future economic benefits arising from the 
investment can be assessed with reasonable certainty at the time the costs are incurred. Costs included are those directly 
attributable to the design, construction and testing of new systems (including major enhancements) from the point of inception 
to the point of satisfactory completion. Maintenance and minor modifications are expensed against the income statement as 
incurred. These assets are amortised by equal instalments over an average of five years.
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development costs
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions have been demonstrated:
• the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
• the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
• the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
• how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
• the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
• the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of 2 to 7 years. Where 
no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in 
which it is incurred.
Acquired Intangibles
Acquired intangibles are stated at cost, net of amortisation and any recognised impairment loss. These assets are amortised on a 
straight line basis over their useful economic lives of 5 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is charged 
so as to write off the cost of each asset, other than properties in the course of construction, by equal instalments over their 
estimated useful economic lives as follows:
• Leasehold buildings – life of the lease
• Fixtures, fittings and other equipment – 3 to 7 years
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and 
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Other items
IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements”, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states 
key lines which should be disclosed. It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented 
on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entity’s financial performance.
The Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any 
components of financial performance considered by the Directors to be not directly related to the trading business or regarded as 
exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such 
presentation. Such items may include, inter alia, impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets, the financial 
effect of major restructuring and integration activity, gains or losses associated with acquisitions (including the costs of such 
acquisitions, movements in deferred contingent consideration and the associated unwind of any discount thereon), profits or 
losses arising on business disposals, share based payments and other items where separate disclosure is considered appropriate 
by the Directors, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items. 67 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction

Retirement benefit costs
The Group operates two defined contribution pension schemes that are established in accordance with employment terms set by 
the employing companies. The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered 
funds. The amount charged against profits represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. 
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes, where 
the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, 
the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the 
balance sheet with a charge or credit to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement 
recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is not recycled. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period 
of scheme amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying a discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined 
benefit costs are split into three categories:
• current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;
• net interest expense or income; and 
• remeasurement.
The Group presents the first component of defined benefit costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses in the 
consolidated income statement. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service cost. Net interest expense 
or income is recognised within finance costs. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 
represents the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is 
limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the schemes or reductions in future 
contributions to the schemes.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
A property related provision is recognised and measured as a provision when the Group has a present obligation arising under a 
property related contract. This includes dilapidation costs arising from exiting a leasehold property where the costs are not all 
expected to be incurred during the next year. For a business that is closed or to be discontinued the provision reflects the costs 
associated with exiting the property leased by the discontinued or closed business.
An onerous contracts provision is recognised and measured as a provision when the Group has a present obligation arising under an 
onerous contract. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of 
meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
A legal claims provision is recognised and measured as a provision when the Group has a present obligation arising under a legal 
claim. This includes anticipated costs to resolve any contractual disputes and any anticipated costs in respect of disputes arising 
on previously disposed of businesses. 
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a 
valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main 
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from 
the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the 
ongoing activities of the entity. 
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognised and measured as provisions. An onerous contract is considered 
to exist where the Group has a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed 
the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the local functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange on the dates of the 
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at 
the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date, with differences recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences 
arising, if any, are recognised directly within equity within other comprehensive income. Such translation differences are recognised 
as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured 
at fair value at the date of grant. This is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the instruments. At each 
balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect 
of the particular vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such 
that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves. 
Fair value is measured by use of an adjusted Black-Scholes model for the LTIPs awarded pre 2016, 2016 matching shares,  
2017 LTIPs (including the CSOP) , and a Monte-Carlo model for the LTIPS awarded in 2016, as these will vest dependent on  
market conditions.
Tax
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at 
the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax in the income 
statement is charged or credited, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current 
tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), 
‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on 
the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. The Group does not currently hold 
any held-to-maturity investments or ‘available for sale’ financial assets.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income 
over the relevant period. The effective rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees on 
points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) 
through the expected life of a financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Interest is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial assets designated as at FVTPL. 69 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
1. Accounting policies continued
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market 
are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, 
less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when 
the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets 
are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more event that occurred after the initial recognition of the 
financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are 
subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 
include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions 
that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets, with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the 
impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised through profit or loss are not reversed through profit or 
loss. Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand which have a right of offset 
against cash balances. These instruments are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk 
of change in value.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets expire, or it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the 
Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issued costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL ’ or ‘other financial liabilities’.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest expense recognised on 
an effective yield basis. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of 
allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future 
cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 70
1. Accounting policies continued
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of these assets, until 
such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in 
the period in which they are incurred.
2. Critical accounting judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Board has made the following 
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
The carrying value of goodwill at the year-end is £21.1m (2016: £21.3m). An annual impairment review is required under IAS 36 
‘Impairment of assets’ involving judgement of the future cash flows and discount rates for cash-generating units. The Group 
prepares such cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets approved by the Board of Directors. Further details of 
the other assumptions used are given in note 13.
The carrying value of other intangible assets is £13.9m (2016: £14.2m). Judgement is required to assess whether costs meet the 
criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38, the useful life of those assets, and subsequently the consideration of the potential need 
for impairment of these assets, in particular in relation to their expected ability to generate future revenue.
Revenue recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition policies are disclosed in note 1. In some cases, particularly in relation to significant software 
delivery programmes on which we are engaged in a number of international settings, judgement is required to determine the most 
appropriate measure of the fair value and the timing of revenue and profit recognition related to the services and products that have 
been delivered to customers at the balance sheet date. In particular before any licence revenue can be recognised, the licence must 
have been delivered and installed at the customers premises and be available to use by the customer in the environment on which 
installation will take place. Judgement is also required in the assessment of the risk of recoverability of any associated receivables 
and accrued income where invoicing and/or payment is subject to certain future milestones. Programme delivery requirements, 
software specification and customer expectations may evolve during the course of these major projects. This may result in 
developments to ongoing commercial arrangements that could materially impact the basis of financial judgements made at a period 
end. Therefore the potential impact of these evolving obligations and the overall customer project status must be considered 
carefully and where appropriate reflected in accounting judgements.

the services provided are disclosed in note 4.
Sales of goods are not material and are therefore not shown separately. Included in sales of services is £0.4m (2016: £0.5m) related 
to software licence revenues recognised as a result of a periodic review of our licence entitlement resulting from changes in our 
customers’ enrolled student numbers. 
There is no revenue in respect of discontinued operations. 71 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
4. Business segments
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance is focused on the nature of each type of activity. The Group’s reportable segments and principal activities under  
IFRS 8 are detailed below:
Student Management Systems (“SMS”) represents the delivery of software and subsequent maintenance and support services 
and the activities through which we deploy and configure our software for our customers;
i-graduate, represents a portfolio of performance improvement tools and services, including analytics, software solutions, facilities 
and asset management; and
Quality Assurance Solutions (“QAS”), representing inspection and review services which support the assessment of 
educational delivery.
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, information on segment assets is not shown, as this is not provided to the chief 
operating decision-maker. Inter-segment sales are charged at prevailing market prices.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 1. Segment 
profit represents the profit earned by each segment, without allocation of central administration costs, including Directors’ salaries, 
finance costs and income tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purpose of resource 
allocation and assessment of segment performance.
From the beginning of 2017, the basis of cost allocation for each of the Lines of Business has changed. It was determined that 
the previous methodology allocated central costs (which include Finance, HR, Legal, IT, Corporate services., Marketing and Office 
costs) in a way that did not represent the level of resource utilised by that business, and accordingly did not provide sufficient 
insight into the underlying profitability of the Line of Business. The segmental analysis of Adjusted Operating profit now allocates 
all directly attributable and controllable direct and overhead costs to its business segment. The central and group costs now 
represent the aggregate of all costs which support the Lines of Business, and which are not directly and specifically attributable 
to each Line of Business. 
Within QAS revenues of approximately 4% (2016: 13%) have arisen from the Segments largest customer; within SMS revenues of 
approximately 8% (2016: 7%) have arisen from the Segments largest customer. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

include the following:
Acquisition costs: during the period, a final payment was made in respect of deferred consideration payable on acquisition of 
Callista, which resulted in a true up of the amounts provided (2017: £29,000: 2016 £250,000).
Other exceptional items: amounts principally reflect the costs arising in respect of the restructuring of the Group’s operations. The 
restructuring program was executed in the first half of 2017 and associated costs provided for. Amounts relate mainly to provision 
for redundancy costs. (2017: £1,020,000: 2016: £1,946,000).
Share based payments (see note 23): The numbers above include the movement in associated employers taxes accrual (2017: 
£339,000: 2016: £160,000). 
Amortisation of IFRS3 intangibles: amortisation arising on the fair value of intangible assets acquired is separately disclosed as 
other items. (2017: £2,034,000: 2016: £1,912,000).
Financing charges: consistent with the treatment of movements in deferred consideration, the unwind of the discount on deferred 
consideration is separately presented as other financing costs in the income statement (2017: £128,000: 2016: £398,000). 
Taxation: the tax credit arising on the above items is presented on a consistent basis with the underlying cost or credit to which it 
relates and therefore is also presented separately on the face of the income statement. 75 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction

This rate reflects the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017. Tax for other jurisdictions is 
calculated at the prevailing rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 17% ( effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 
September 2016. This will reduce the Group’s future tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017 have 
been calculated based on these rates.

Diluted earnings per share only reflects the dilutive effect of share options for which performance criteria have been met. Previous 
share incentive schemes vest based on cumulative EPS for a three year period with the earliest vesting based on the Group’s 
results for the three years to 31 December 2017. None of the 552,928 remaining share options that were issued in 2015 met the 
performance criteria.
In regards the diluted loss per share in 2016, all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, including options and deferred shares, are 
anti-dilutive as they would decrease the loss per share.
The maximum number of potentially dilutive shares, based on options that have been granted but have not yet met vesting criteria, 
is 10,084,612 (2016: 5,367,189). In addition there are a further 3,405,996 (2016: 3,405,996) potentially dilutive matching share 
options that have been granted but have not yet met vesting criteria as at 31 December 2017.
The adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share figures shown on the consolidated income statement on page 58 are included as

Goodwill acquired in a business is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from 
the business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows:
2017 
£’000
2016
£’000
Student Management Systems 17 ,579 17 ,782
i-graduate 3,534 3,534
21,113 21,316
Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (CGU) with 
the goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment allocated to that CGU. 
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use risk adjusted cash flow 
projections based on the financial budget approved by management for the period to 31 December 2018. The budget was prepared 
based on past experience, strategic plans and management’s expectation for the markets in which they operate including adjustments for 
known contract ends, contract related inflationary increases and planned cost savings. The budget was extrapolated over an eight-year 
period with a growth assumption of 2% per annum. Cash flows beyond the budget and extrapolation period were calculated into perpetuity 
using a growth rate of 2%. This growth rate is in line with the expected average UK economy long-term growth rate. 
The cash flows projections are discounted at a post-tax discount rate of 11.27% (2016: 12%). The single discount rate, which is 
consistently applied for all CGUs, is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information and reflects 
specific risks relevant to the Group. 
Impairment testing inherently involves a number of judgemental areas, including the preparation of cash flow forecasts for periods 
that are beyond the normal requirements of management reporting; the assessment of the discount rate appropriate to the Group 
and the estimation of the future revenue and expenditure of each CGU. Accordingly, management undertook stress testing to 
understand the key sensitivities and concluded as follows: 
SMS is the largest segment and has significant impairment headroom as such no reasonable sensitivities would cause an impairment.
i-graduate is the smallest segment and the impairment headroom is the most sensitive. The discount rate for 2017 would need 
to increase to 11.8% for an impairment to occur or the growth rate reduce to 1.4% per annum. For example, if the growth rate 
decreased to 1.0% and the discount rate was 11.0% it would result in an impairment of approximately £54,000. One of the 
significant assumptions in i-graduate is the increase of profits in the budget for the period to 31 December 2018. It should be noted 
that the i-graduate budget was prepared on a bottom-up basis which the Directors consider to be a prudent, low case position with 
known potential upside, albeit with some risk attached. The Directors do not feel these sensitivity scenarios or a combination of 
the two are likely to occur. Additionally, the annually recurring nature of the surveys and data analytics i-graduate undertakes give 
further comfort. The Directors will however continue to closely monitor the position given the sensitivity of the segment.
Further to the impairment review, the Directors concluded that no impairment has arisen during the year.  Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Software and customer contracts and relationships have arisen from acquisitions and are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives, which are 3–6 years and 3–12 years respectively. The amortisation period for development costs incurred on the Group’s 
product development is 3 to 7 years, based on the expected life-cycle of the product. Amortisation of development costs is 
included within cost of sales; the amortisation for software, customer contracts and relationships, business systems and software 
licences is included within administrative expenses. 
Included within Business Systems are finance systems with a carrying value of £1.3m (2016: £1.6m). Each system is being 
amortised over a period of three to five years and have an average of three years left. 
On 5 June 2017, the Group acquired Intellectual property from Wambiz Limited. The initial cash consideration was £1,250,000, 
with further consideration of £289,000 amd £485,000 payable at the end of years 1 and 2 respectively. An intangible asset of 
£1,873,000 has been recorded under Acquired intellectual property, discounted for deferred payments which have been recorded 
as a deferred consideration liability in Trade and other payables. This asset is being amortised over a period of 5 years. 81 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction

The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables which represent the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group’s credit risk is primarily related to its trade receivables. The credit 
risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
All receivables are due within one year in both current and prior years.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost. The average credit terms on sales is 30 days (2016: 30 days). The Group sells 
the majority of its services to the public sector or related bodies and institutions, and as such there is a low incidence of default. All 
overdue debts are assessed on an individual basis and a provision for irrecoverable amounts is determined by reference to specific 
circumstances and past default experience.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £4.1m (2016: £5.5m), which are past due 
at the reporting date and which have not been impaired, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the 
Group believes that the amounts are still recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. Of the total trade 
receivables balance at the end of the year, four customers (2016: three) held balances outstanding of more than 5%, being £1.1m, 
£1.0m, £0.7m and £0.6m (2016: £1.1m, £0.7m and £0.6m). The average age of receivables is 47 days (2016: 44 days).

16. Trade and other receivables continued
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group’s credit risk is relatively low because a high 
proportion of trade or other receivables have sovereign or close to sovereign credit rating. Accordingly, the Directors believe that 
there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Total 1,713 1,578
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Accrued income 
Accrued income is measured at amortised cost. Accrued income inherently has some contractual risk associated with it related to 
the specific and ongoing risks in each individual contract with a customer. 
Impairments recognised in the income statement in respect of accrued income amount to £0.1m (2016: £0.3m).
17. Long-term contracts
At the end of 2017, trade and other receivables included amounts due from contract customers (included within accrued income) of 
£0.1m (2016: £0.2m) and trade and other payables included amounts due to contract customers (included within deferred income) 
of £nil (2016: £0.5m).

At 31 December 2017, retentions held by customers for contract work amounted to £nil (2016: £0.2m).
There are no amounts included in trade and other receivables arising from long-term contracts due for settlement after more than 
12 months.
£1.3m (2016: £1.3m) of contract revenue has been recognised.
18. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents of £14.1m (2016: £10.3m) comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value. Of the above balance, 
£nil (2016: £0.2m) represents funds restricted in use by the relevant commercial terms of certain trading contracts. These terms 
have been complied with. 
The credit quality of cash at bank can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings. The Group has not changed it’s risk 
appetite during the year, however one of the Group’s main banks has been downgraded in the period. The following table has been 
sourced from Moodys credit ratings. Notes to the Financial Statements continued

The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 5 days (2016: 7 days). For most suppliers, no interest is charged on the trade 
payables for the first 30 days from the date of invoice. Thereafter, in some cases, interest may be charged on the outstanding 
balances due to certain suppliers at various interest rates. The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that 
all payables are paid within a reasonable timeframe. The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
approximates their fair value. 85 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction
19. Trade and other payables continued
Deferred consideration reflects amounts in respect of the Campus and Wambiz acquisitions. During 2016 all deferred consideration 
became non-contingent, and hence transferred from Provisons into other payables. In March 2017 , a variation to the Share Purchase 
Agreement was signed with the vendors of Tribal Campus Pty Limited (previously Sky Software Pty), which amended the terms of the 
deferred contingent consideration payments. Under the variation, it was agreed that a combination of cash, shares and share options 
would be paid/issued in full and final settlement of all contingent obligations under the Agreement. As a result an amount of £511,000, 
representing the fair value of the share options, was transferred from other payables to the share based payment reserve.
 Other payables are split as follows:

20. Borrowings
The Group has a borrowings facility under a £15m revolving credit facility which includes a £1m committed overdraft facility, and 
a £6.5m committed guarantee facility. The total facility is committed until June 2018, subject to compliance with covenants and 
was agreed in August 2017. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had net cash of £14.1m (2016: of £8.8m), reflecting gross cash 
balances of £14.1m (2016: £10.3m) offset by nil outstanding on the overdraft facility (2016: £1.4m). The Directors estimate that 
the book values of the Group’s borrowings reflect the fair values thereof. The bank loans are all denominated in UK sterling at floating 
rates. At 31 December 2017, the weighted average interest rate paid was 2.0% (2016: 3.0%). The interest rate is reset for a period 
of one, three or six months at LIBOR plus a variable margin determined by covenant calculations.
There was £7.5m (2016: £13.5m) available but undrawn of the revolving credit facility at 31 December 2017. In addition, at the  
year-end there was £1.0m available but undrawn in respect of the overdraft facility, and £5.0m available but undrawn in respect 
of the Guarantee facilty, giving total underlying headroom of £13.5m (2016: £19.4m). £1.5m is currently allocated to the 
Guarantee facility.
The revolving credit facility was voluntarily reduced to £11m in January 2018.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will 
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Property related provision relates to the dilapidation costs arising from exiting leasehold properties where the costs are not all 
expected to be incurred during the next year. 
Onerous contracts provision relates to a specific contract and represents the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under 
the contract that exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.
Legal claims provision relates to a specific contract and represents the anticipated costs to resolve the contractual dispute. 
Restructuring provision represent amounts provided in respect of the Group’s restructuring and reorganisation and principally 
reflect redundancy costs.

The Directors are of the opinion, based on currently available forecasts, that these timing differences will reverse in the near future 
and when they do there will be sufficient taxable profits to recognise the impact of this in the income statement. Accordingly, the 
Directors believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recoverable.
The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of £1,631,000 (2016: £1,939,000) on tax losses carried forward in the UK of 
£9,596,000 (2016: £10,206,000). 
The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £nil (2016: £218,000) in relation to further tax losses carried forward in the

Awards made to eligible employees under the LTIP schemes are nil cost options with an award period of four years. 
LTIPs awarded in 2016
Awards in 2016, to eligible employees, vest according to a target share price on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The 
amount of awards that will vest will range between 0% and 100% of those granted based on a target share price between 60p  
and 80p.
Matching shares
The matching shares are only subject to a time-limit conditions. The matching share options will vest equally over three years and 
may be exercised at any time during the period of two years from the applicable vesting dates (1 January 2017, 1 January 2018 and 
1 January 2019), but not sold during that period. One third of these options have now vested.
SAYE
The SAYE scheme provides for a purchase price equal to mid market value at date of grant. The 2008 SAYE scheme was granted 
at a discount to market value of 20% and was available as a three, five or seven-year scheme. All options have now lapsed and the 
Scheme has finished.
LTIPs awarded in 2017 (includig the CSOP)
New awards in 2017 to Ian Bowles (348,387) and Mark Pickett (247,678) will vest on 29 June 2020 and are subject to a time-limit

*These awards have no market based performance conditions.
The expected life used in the models have been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the term commensurate 
with the expected term immediately prior to the date of grant.
There have been 1,339,286 options over shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2. These options 
were issued to the vendors of Sky Software Pty as part of the deferred consideration payable. These options are subject to a 
performance condition measured over a maximum 3 year period ending 30 June 2020.

27. Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes within individual subsidiaries and 
contributes to certain employees’ personal pension plans. The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 was  
£2.2m (2016: £3.0m), of which £2.0m (2016: £2.4m) related to defined contribution schemes and £0.2m (2016: £0.6m) to defined 
benefit schemes.
Contributions amounting to £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) were payable to the funds at the year end and are included in current liabilities.
Defined benefit schemes
At 31 December 2017, the Group operated two defined benefit pension schemes for the benefit of certain deferred employees 
of its subsidiaries in the UK. These schemes are administered by separate funds that are legally separated from the Company. The 
trustees of the pension funds are required by law to act in the interest of the funds and of all relevant stakeholders in the schemes. 
The trustees of the pension funds are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the funds. 
Scheme 1– the Prudential Platinum Pension Fund
Tribal Education Limited, a Group subsidiary, participates in the Prudential Platinum Pension Fund (“PPP”), which is a defined 
benefit arrangement. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 
31 December 2015.
The Tribal Education section of the Prudential Platinum Pension Fund had 36 deferred members at the year-end. Employer 
contributions amounting to £21,000 were paid in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £21,000). The accounting figures have 
been calculated using the valuation as at 31 December 2015, updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary.
Scheme 2 – the Federated Pension Plan
Tribal Education Limited, a Group subsidiary, participates in the Federated Pension Plan (“FPP”), which is a defined benefit 
arrangement. The Ofsted employees were transferred back to Ofsted in March 2017 and the plan closed to future accrual. All of 
the active members at 31 March 2017 were transferred to the deferred section of the plan. The treatment of the defined benefit 
scheme is currently being discussed with Ofsted. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified 
independent actuary as at 5 April 2015.
The Tribal Education section of the Federated Pension Plan had 210 deferred members at the year-end. Employer contributions 
amounting to £185,000 were paid in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £427,000). The accounting figures have 
been calculated using the valuation as at 5 April 2015, updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2017 by a qualified 
independent actuary.
The assets of the funds have been taken at market value and the actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ for both schemes are:
2017
% per  
annum
2016
% per  
annum
Inflation 2.40–3.40 2.50–3.50
Salary increases nil nil
Rate of discount 2.4 2.6
Pension in payment increases 2.40–3.40 2.50–3.50
The salary increase assumption is nil as the FPP members have transferred to Ofsted in March 2017, leaving only deferred members. 
In addition the PPP only has deferred members.
The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 December 2017 imply the following life expectations:
Males Females
Aged 60 in 2017 27 .7 29.9
Aged 60 in 2037 30.0 32.3 Notes to the Financial Statements continued

Corporate Bonds 3,677 3,403

Cash 108 99
Total fair value of scheme assets 11,013 10,192
All equities and corporate bonds are quoted on active markets. 
The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes’ liabilities are set out below: 
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities
Discount rate Increase by 0.5% Decrease by 11%
Rate of inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 13%
Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 3%
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, 
this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined 
benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated 
with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability 
recognised within the statement of financial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to the previous period.

30. Contingent liabilities
From time to time the Group is subject to potential litigation claims. On the basis of legal advice, claims are being robustly contested 
as to both liability and quantum. A provision of £0.4m (2016: £0.4m) has been made for defending these claims, where appropriate 
(see note 21).
At any time, the Group is overseeing a portfolio of customer implementation projects. Such projects may be complex, multi-phase 
projects giving rise to significant operational risks which the Group must manage. Such risks may, in certain instances, lead to 
potential negotiations or disputes with customers which may give rise to consequential financial or commercial obligations or 
liabilities arising. 
The Company and its subsidiaries have provided performance guarantees issued by its banks on its behalf, in the ordinary course of 
business, totalling £1.5m (2016: £4.2m). These are not expected to result in any material financial loss.
As disclosed in note 33, Tribal Holdings Limited and International Graduate Insight Group Limited have taken advantage of the 
exemption available under Section 394A/ 479A of the Companies Act 2006 in respect of the requirements for audit. As a condition 
of the exemption, the Company has guaranteed the year-end liabilities of these subsidiaries until they are settled in full. The 
liabilities of the subsidiaries at the year-end was £21,145,000 (2016: £15,236,000). These are inclusive of intercompany liabilities.
31. Financial instruments
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure the entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, while maximising

The above tables have been stated at undiscounted values with the exception of deferred consideration. The undiscounted value of 
the deferred consideration is £1,341,000 (2016: £2,755,000), versus a discounted value of £1,223,000 as at 31 December 2017 
(2016: £2,653,000).
There are no financial instruments held at fair value (2016 : £nil).
Financial risk management objectives
Treasury management is led by the Group finance team, which is responsible for managing the Group’s exposure to financial 
risk. It operates within a defined set of policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the Board. This includes both foreign 
exchange risk and interest rate risk. The Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its interest-bearing assets and liabilities is 
selectively managed, using interest rate swaps where appropriate. This is an ongoing risk and the Board will continue with this policy. 
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk
As the Group’s international activities grow, its exposure to overseas markets also increases in non-core territories outside of the 
UK and Australasia. There have been no other significant changes to the Group’s exposure to market risk, or the manner in which it 
manages and measures the risk.
Foreign currency risk management
The Group undertakes an increasing number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Here, exposures to exchange rate 
fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters and the Group enters into forward 
foreign exchange contracts where appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date 
are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is primarily exposed to the following currencies: US Dollar, Euro, Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, South African Rand, 
Canadian Dollar, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Saudi Arabia Riyal, Philippine Peso, Bahraini Dinar and Malaysian Ringgit.
If Sterling were to strengthen or weaken by 10% against the relevant foreign currencies, the balances in the table above would give 
rise to an increase/reduction in profit of £1,695,000 (2016: £990,000). This sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign 
currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period-end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. Notes to the Financial Statements continued
Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 98
31. Financial instruments continued 
Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. Hedging activities 
are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging 
strategies are applied. There are no hedges in place as at 31 December 2017 (2016: nil).
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management 
section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability 
outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting 
interest rate risk internally to the Board and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest 
rates. If interest rates had been 1.0% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 
31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £nil (2016: decrease/increase by £27,000) This is due to a net cash position for 
the year.
Credit risk management
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group’s credit risk is  
relatively low because a high proportion of trade and other receivables have a sovereign or close to sovereign rating. Of the total 
trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £3.4m is due from four customers (2016: £2.4m from three customers).
Contract risk management
Accrued income inherently has some contractual risk associated with it related to the specific and ongoing risks in each individual 
contract with a customer.
Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and banking facilities, and by continuously monitoring 
forecast and actual cash flows. The Group has access to committed financing facilities; the total unused amount was £7.5m at the 
balance sheet date (2016: £13.5m). In addition, at the year-end, there was a £1.0m (2016: £3.6m) undrawn overdraft facility and 
a £5.0m undrawn guarantee facility The Group expects to meet its obligations from operating cash flows. The Group also had cash 
balances at 31 December 2017 of £14.1m (2016: £10.3m) as detailed in note 18. Net cash at the year-end was £14.1m (2016: 
£8.8m), giving underlying headroom at the balance sheet date of £13.5m (2016: £19.4m). £1.5m is currently allocated to the 
Guarantee facility.
