When lending direct, we  
aim to meet all our customers  
face-to-face. Whilst more 
expensive to operate than other 
models, it means we can lend 
when others can’t (or won’t).

Chairman’s statement
2017 results
The Group’s performance in 2017 was ahead 
of our original expectations, driven by a 
strong performance from Everyday Loans 
and also by a sharp uplift at Loans at Home 
which benefited from operational 
challenges at a major competitor. It also 
includes a maiden contribution from George 
Banco whose results were consolidated from 
the middle of August 2017.
Reported revenues were £107.8m (2016: 
£72.8m) and the Group produced an 
operating profit of £3.8m (2016: operating 
loss of £5.2m). Higher interest costs and the 
impact of exceptional charges resulted in a 
reported loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss 
per share of 2.60p).
On a normalised basis and excluding 
temporary additional commission, the 
Group’s underlying performance was strong, 
delivering a 35% increase in pre-tax profit to 
£16.4m (2016: £12.1m) and earnings per share 
of 4.25p (2016: 3.09p).
Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. We 
remain focused on serving the needs of 
consumers who are unable or unwilling to 
borrow from mainstream institutions through 
three distinct business divisions: branch-
based lending, home credit and guarantor 
loans. Each of these segments offers 
significant opportunity for growth and 
having already achieved our target of 20% 
loan book growth across the Group as a 
whole, we remain on course to also deliver a 
20% return on assets in each of our 
operating divisions. This will be achieved 
through the execution of the three elements 
of our business strategy:
• Being a leader in our chosen markets; 
• Investing in our core assets; and 
• Acting responsibly. 
Each of these is explained in more detail in 
the Strategic Report on pages 6 to 53.
Management
During 2017 we made a number of changes to 
the senior management in each of our three 
business divisions. These changes resulted in a 
marked increase in both ambition and pace of 
execution – a combination that is feeding 
through into enhanced operational and 
financial performance. 
As Everyday Loans accounts for over half 
our business, we appointed one of our 
founding Directors, Miles Cresswell-Turner, 
to lead the business in May 2017. Davie 
Thompson became CEO of Loans at Home 
in January 2017 and brings over 30 years’ 
experience in the home credit industry, 18 of 
which were working with John van Kuffeler. 
Marc Howells, the Managing Director of 
George Banco, became CEO of our newly 
formed Guarantor Loans Division 
comprising both George Banco and 
TrustTwo in September 2017. 
As a Board, we have long recognised the 
value of strong leadership, not just in helping 
to achieve short-term goals but also in 
shaping the culture and long-term potential 
of each of our business divisions. 
Culture
In last year’s Annual Report I set out the 
process that we had initiated to identify the 
core elements that underpin the culture of 
each of our businesses and the target 
behaviours that we believe will enable us to 
succeed. This effort continued throughout 
2017 and thanks to the drive and 
determination of our new business leaders, 
we have been able to refine and start to 
embed these values across the Group as 
part of our appraisal and reward process. 
 
A year  
of progress
2017 was another year of 
substantial progress for the 
Group. We delivered strong loan 
book growth in all three business 
divisions whilst the overall rate of 
impairment declined. We also 
completed the acquisition of 
George Banco for an enterprise 
value of approximately £53.5m 
and more than doubled our 
committed debt facilities to 
£260m. Having delivered overall 
loan book growth of more than 
20% in 2017 , we remain on course 
to also achieve a 20% return on 
assets in each of our three divisions.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 5
Strategic Report Overview
Employee engagement is a key measure that 
we monitor closely to determine how 
effectively we are promoting these values 
and to confirm that we are upholding the 
high standards we expect. During 2017 we 
hosted a series of management conferences 
and also launched a Group-wide intranet. 
This is proving popular among staff as a 
source of the latest Company news as well 
as a repository for useful documents and 
procedures. An abridged version of the 
intranet is also available to all of our 
self-employed agents that represent an 
important stakeholder group. Our latest 
internal surveys show that our people are 
well-engaged and, whilst not complacent, 
we are pleased with the progress made so 
far (see the survey results on page 35).
Effective reporting systems and controls help 
the Board to manage and mitigate risk, but 
cannot eliminate it altogether. Throughout 
2017 the Board received regular updates 
from each of the operational management 
teams and also made a number of site visits 
to operations around the country, spending 
time with staff, self-employed agents and 
customers. In addition, my three executive 
colleagues visited our front-line operations 
on a regular and sometimes weekly basis. 
Hearing first-hand about operational issues 
and how they are impacting the experience 
of our customers helps us to refine our 
operations and strategic priorities.
Regulation
Each of our businesses is fully licensed by the 
FCA and we remain supportive of their efforts 
to maintain a rigorous regulatory framework, 
ensuring the protection of consumers, effective 
competition and a well-functioning market. 
We also welcome their recent High-Cost 
Credit Review Update in which they note:
“Consumers can benefit from using high-cost 
credit where repayments are sustainable and 
appropriate forbearance is shown if they have 
temporary repayment problems.” 
1
Whilst supportive of the FCA’s objectives, 
we believe that any potential gains from 
additional regulation must always be 
measured against the cost of achieving them. 
As well as executing the sometimes significant 
changes required of firms as part of the FCA’s 
licensing process, there has also been a near 
continuous flow of consultations, in-depth 
research and proposed regulatory changes 
that regulated firms have to address (see ‘An 
evolving regulatory landscape’ on page 28). 
Even for well-capitalised groups such as NSF , 
this adds significantly to both the regulatory 
burden and the uncertainty of managing a 
business in an ever-shifting regulatory 
landscape. Smaller firms may be less 
well-placed to meet these demands and may 
look to exit the market, resulting in less choice 
for customers.
We are pleased that the FCA appears to have 
no major concerns regarding branch-based 
lending or guarantor loans. In home credit 
however, the FCA has said that it may look to 
introduce measures that it believes will reduce 
the risk of harm and/or consumer detriment. 
However, we do not believe it has provided 
any clear evidence that such harm or 
detriment exists in the home credit market. 
In fact, we would argue that the contrary is 
true: customer complaints are low, customer 
satisfaction is high and the very design of the 
home credit product means that the risk of 
customer detriment or financial distress from 
late payment is low. 
We continue to engage actively with the FCA, 
on a number of levels, both directly as well as 
through industry associations. We are 
determined to demonstrate the important 
service that home credit provides to over a 
million UK consumers, for whom mainstream 
credit may be either out of reach or less suited 
to their needs.
Board
We were delighted to welcome Niall Booker  
to join the Board as an independent Non-
Executive Director in May 2017 . Niall has 
brought a wealth of experience from his time 
at HSBC, Household and more recently 
Co-operative Bank where he was CEO until 
December 2016.
Final dividend
Having declared a half-year dividend of 0.50p 
per share in August 2017 , the Board is pleased 
to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per 
share (2016: 0.9p), making a total of 2.20p for 
the year as a whole (2016: 1.20p). If approved 
by shareholders, this final dividend would 
mean that we had reached our target of a 
payout ratio of at least 50% of 2017 normalised 
post-tax earnings, before temporary 
additional commission. If approved at the 
AGM, the final dividend would be paid to 
those shareholders on the Company’s share 
register on 18 May 2018, with payment being 
made on 15 June 2018.
Outlook
Each of our three business divisions has 
excellent growth prospects and is a top 
three player in its individual market 
segment. Each is led by a highly 
experienced management team and has 
the potential to deliver a 20% return on 
assets before central costs. With £260m of 
committed debt facilities in place, we are 
well-funded and we are optimistic about 
the Group’s prospects. 
Charles Gregson
Non-Executive Chairman

Our values:
• Doing the right thing: we recognise 
our collective responsibility for 
delivering great outcomes – not just 
for our customers but also our other 
stakeholders. We don’t cut corners 
and always seek the path that is 
right before the path that is easy. 
• Integrity: we expect our people to 
respect colleagues and other key 
stakeholders and to do what we  
say we will do. 
• Shared purpose delivered through 
teamwork: we have clear strategic 
and operational goals and expect 
all of our people to understand and 
share in that vision. Our businesses 
are complex, combining many 
different elements to achieve our 
overall objectives. By working 
together we are likely to solve 
problems more effectively than 
trying to do things on our own. 
• Clear communication: we listen 
carefully to those dealing directly 
with our customers; we are well-
informed and believe it’s our duty  
to speak up when we disagree, or 
believe something is not right; we 
celebrate success and don’t blame 
others when something goes wrong, 
always learning from our mistakes. 
• Entrepreneurial leadership: we lead 
by example, using our initiative and 
not just waiting to be told what to 
do; knowledgeable and inquisitive, 
we are prepared to try new things 
so we can perform better and be the 
best we can be.

by being at the vanguard of best practice, meeting the highest standards of regulatory 
compliance and by delivering great outcomes for customers.

An estimated ten million people in the UK are  
unable to borrow from their high-street bank, many 
of which have been closing branches and are 
reluctant to lend to those on low or variable incomes. 
Home credit is a business model that has been 
operating since 1880. With a high level of personal 
engagement, it is often one of few sources of 
regulated credit available for those at the lower  
end of the income scale.
Loans at Home is the third largest home credit 
operator in the UK and each of our 1,000 self-
employed agents is out seeing their customers every 
week, chatting about their lives, making sure they 
are on-track and, importantly, that nothing has 
changed that we need to know about. Living on low 
income can be particularly challenging when things 
happen that are not expected. By building long-term 
relationships, we are well-placed to understand the 
needs of our customers and so can support them 
through difficult times should they need a bit of extra 
help. It is this intimate customer knowledge that 
makes home credit so unique and allows us to lend 
to those that many either will not, or cannot.
Lending money to a customer in trouble or who 
cannot afford a loan is the last thing an agent wants 
to do. The customer is likely to run into difficulty quite 
quickly which means that they cannot repay – this is 
not good for them or the agent. If circumstances do 
change and a customer perhaps needs some more 
time with their payments, we are only too happy to 
work out a revised schedule that works for the 
customer and at no extra cost.
Why are our APRs so high? 
This is a question we often get asked. To answer it, 
we need to explain what happens to the revenue  
we generate.
The chart shown here illustrates what happens to 
NSF Group revenue, based upon the 2017 normalised 
results. Whilst each of our three businesses has 
different dynamics, we have sought to provide an 
NSF overview as follows:
Impairments
Lending to customers with low or impaired credit 
ratings is a risky business and a significant proportion 
of revenue is lost through the impairment of loans that 
don’t get repaid. Higher risk customers tend to result in 
higher impairments and so when lending to such 
customers, lenders look to charge higher APRs.
1.6m
An estimated 1.6m 
customers use home 
credit in the UK  
(Source: FCA).
53%
Loans at Home grew its 
loan book before fair 
value adjustments by 
53% in 2017.
Our  
story:
People costs
Staff and self-employed agent costs are significant 
given the scale of our face-to-face networks through 
which we engage with our customers, either in a 
branch, or in their home. In home credit, temporary 
additional commission paid to newly-arrived agents 
is key to allowing them the time to build up a 
sufficient number of customers in order to earn 
their target level of income through our regular 
commission structure.
Other admin costs
Property, IT and other infrastructure and support-
related costs are significant for branch-based 
lending and home credit, requiring higher APRs. 
Business models with lower infrastructure costs  
may be able to charge lower APRs.
The size and term of loans being offered are also 
factors in driving APRs – smaller, short-term loans 
(like those in home credit) tend to attract higher APRs 
as many of the costs of delivery are the same, 
irrespective of the size or term of loan issued.
Cost of funds and taxes
Whilst we have sourced significant equity capital, the 
majority of our loan book is funded by debt facilities 
provided by third-party credit funds. After paying 
taxes due, the balance is used to reward 
shareholders through dividend payments, share 
buy-backs and/or by reinvesting funds to deliver 
future growth.

“I was looking for a loan to complete my Site 
Management qualification so that I could get back 
onto my feet after a rocky business experience that 
impacted my credit rating. Having an impaired 
credit history isn’t something I felt comfortable talking 
about, however everyone at the branch was fantastic 
and they never judged me. I told them my whole  
story and having explained everything in detail, they 
approved my loan so that I could rebuild my finances 
and my credit score. Since then I’ve been able to 
borrow small amounts from time to time to pay for  
my training courses. Whilst some say I might get a 
better rate if I shopped around, I will keep going 
back to the branch because the service is top notch.  
I have got stability back in my life and it is all due to 
the great and professional team at the branch in 
Newport. Thank you!”

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
Everyday Loans is the UK’s largest branch-based 
provider of unsecured credit to the credit impaired. 
With 53 branches at the end of 2017, we plan to open 
a further 12 branches in 2018. Unlike many of our 
competitors, we see meeting the customer as an 
essential part of our underwriting process as it helps 
us to make better lending decisions. 
As part of our cultural review (see Culture and 
Stakeholder Management on page 50), Everyday 
Loans defined its purpose as being ‘to help make 
people’s everyday lives better.’ We know that issuing 
a loan that a customer doesn’t want, or that won’t 
address their need, is not going to help them.
In 2017 Everyday Loans processed over one million 
applications but lent money to just 3% of those that 
applied – we are therefore highly selective about 
who we are prepared to lend money to. Of those we 
do lend to, on balance we tend to provide customers 
with slightly smaller loans than they originally ask for, 
particularly when serving a customer for the first 
time. Once we have built a good relationship with 
them and they have proven their ability to repay as 
planned, we may be prepared to extend further 
credit to them and, depending upon the 
circumstances, on better terms.

“My mum agreed to be my guarantor as she knew 
that improving my credit score would help to get 
myself straight. Having taken out a 24-month loan, 
which I paid off as due, I then found myself in a tight 
spot having been made redundant. While I was 
confident of being able to secure another permanent 
job, I needed some cash to tide me over in the 
meantime and went back to the team at George 
Banco who agreed to help me, again with my mum 
as guarantor. As I had kept up with my payments on 
my first loan, the team were able to offer me a new 
loan at a lower APR. Having sorted myself out, I now 
have a great full time job as a sales and customer 
services representative. Thank you George Banco!”

Formalising a process that has long been used to 
extend credit to those that might otherwise be 
unable to borrow on their own, guarantor loans have 
become one of the fastest growing segments of the 
UK’s non-standard finance market. Our Guarantor 
Loans Division, comprising the George Banco and 
TrustTwo brands, is the clear number two provider  
of guarantor loans in the UK. With a loan book of 
£48.2m (before fair value adjustments) and over 
17,000 customers at the end of 2017, our approach  
is always to ensure that by providing credit we are 
genuinely meeting the customer’s needs. 
Since assuming control of the UK’s consumer credit 
market in 2014, the FCA has raised standards across 
the non-standard finance sector through a rigorous 
licensing process as well as through ongoing 
supervision of all licensed lenders. Since acquiring

we have received all of the requisite permissions  
to operate from the FCA. However, we are never

great outcomes for our customers. This includes 
incorporating mechanisms into our employee 
incentives that reward best practice and ‘doing  
the right thing’ from the customer’s perspective.

Whilst there has been strong growth in 
consumer credit in the UK in recent 
years, the FCA has confirmed that this 
has been driven by prime customers,  
not those with lower credit scores
6
. We 
believe that non-standard customers 
have in fact been starved of credit since 
the financial crisis due to a number of 
factors, including:
• a reduction in the total amount of 
credit available to sub-prime 
borrowers following the financial 
crisis as many mainstream lenders  
left the market (see inactive loans  
in chart);
• reduced supply of high-cost short-
term credit (‘HCSTC’) following FCA 
intervention;
• barriers to entry have increased 
including strict regulatory 
requirements and the need for a 
robust compliance infrastructure;
• lending to this segment is highly 
specialised and there is a limited 
pool of managerial talent; and
• many non-standard lenders struggle 
to access long-term, low-cost funding 
to support future growth.

Business model
A relationship driven model
Our purpose What sets us apart
To help those who need  
credit but are either unwilling  
or unable to borrow from 
mainstream institutions. 
Building personal relationships  
is key and enables us to balance  
the delivery of great outcomes 
for our customers and attractive 
returns for shareholders.
Culture
Providing ‘a helping, but firm hand’, to our 
customers is an ethos that runs deep through 
each of our businesses. We are entrepreneurial 
and are not afraid to try new things. We listen 
carefully, learn fast and don’t blame others 
when we make mistakes. Instead, we learn 
from them so that we can improve outcomes 
for our customers and deliver greater long-
term returns for our shareholders.
 See Culture and stakeholder
 management section on page 50
Management
NSF is led by a highly experienced Board and 
senior management team with unrivalled 
knowledge of the sector and a proven track 
record of creating value for shareholders.
 See Governance section on page 54
Infrastructure
Our extensive branch and agent networks 
mean we are able to have face-to-face 
contact with our customers. We also develop 
sophisticated technology platforms which 
improve our customer service and collection 
capabilities. Whilst more expensive to operate 
then many other business models, our 
infrastructure is highly scalable.
Compliance 
and risk 
management
We have developed a robust risk management 
framework and established a Risk Committee 
which oversees risk assessment and advises 
the Board on the Company’s overall risk 
appetite, tolerance and strategy.
 See Principal risks section on page 36
Access to  
long-term  
funding
The Group is financed through a combination  
of long-term debt and equity and has sufficient  
funding to meet the current growth plans of 
each of our business divisions.

“ 2017 was a year of delivery with significant organic loan book growth whilst 
impairment reduced from 29% to 24% of normalised revenue. I am pleased to 
say that these trends have continued into the current year. With strong market 
positions in each of our chosen segments, a clear plan for growth and long-
term funding in place, we remain confident in the full year outlook and are 
pleased to recommend a final dividend of 1.70p per share making 2.20p for the 
year as a whole (2016: 1.2p), an increase of 83% over the prior year.”

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
These achievements contributed to strong 
loan book growth in all three divisions and 
the combined net loan book at 
31 December 2017 increased by 51% to 
£247.9m, before fair value adjustments 
(2016: £164.6m) and to £259.8m (2016: 
£180.4m) after fair value adjustments. 
Adjusting for the acquisition of George 
Banco, the year-on-year increase in the net 
loan book before fair value adjustments 
was 30% (2016: £191.4m). A summary of the 
key performance indicators for each of our 
businesses is shown on the previous page.
This strong growth increased normalised 
revenue by 48% to £119.8m (2016: £81.1m) 
and normalised operating profit, before 
£3.2m of temporary additional commission 
at Loans at Home, increased by 72%  
to £26.9m (2016: £15.6m). Normalised 
operating profit after these costs increased 
by 71% to £23.7m (2016: £13.8m) and 
normalised earnings per share increased 
by 31% to 3.44p (2016: 2.62p). Adjusting  
for the one-off nature of the temporary 
additional commission, normalised 
earnings per share was 4.25p (2016: 3.09p). 
The Group’s 2017 reported, or statutory 
results are significantly affected by the 
acquisition of George Banco, the full year 
impact of the April 2016 acquisition of 
Everyday Loans (including TrustTwo), fair 
value adjustments and the amortisation of 
acquired intangibles. 
Reported revenue after fair value 
adjustments, was up 48% to £107.8m (2016: 
£72.8m) while the sale of a non-performing 
loan portfolio generated other operating 
income of £1.9m (2016: £0.5m). A 40% 
increase in administration costs to £77.1m 
(2016: £54.8m) included £3.2m of temporary 
additional commission and £2.1m of other 
Loans at Home related expansion costs. 
Finance costs increased due to strong loan 
book growth and the impact of the Group’s 
new financing arrangements (see below) 
while exceptional items totalled £6.3m 
(2016: £0.6m) primarily reflecting the 
write-off of previously capitalised fees 
associated with prior period debt raising. 
The net result was that the Group delivered 
a reported loss before tax of £13.0m (2016: 
loss of £9.3m) and a reported loss per share 
of 3.26p (2016: loss per share of 2.60p).
Reflecting our confidence in the outlook, 
the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 1.70p making a total of 2.20p for the year 
(2016:1.2p). This represents a 50% payout 
ratio based on adjusted normalised 
earnings per share (before £3.2m of Loans 
at Home temporary additional commission) 
of 4.25p.
Acquisition of 
George Banco
Branch-based lending
Our largest business, Everyday Loans, 
delivered an outstanding performance with 
a particularly strong second half driven by 
increased loan volumes, higher yield and 
lower impairment. The change of pace and 
ambition was led by a revitalised senior 
management team under the stewardship 
of Miles Cresswell-Turner who took over the 
leadership of the business in May 2017. 
Normalised operating profit (before fair 
value adjustments, amortisation of 
acquired intangibles and exceptional items) 
was up 53% to £22.7m (2016 £14.8m). 
Contributing to this strong growth was the 
expansion of our branch network with 12 
new branches opened during the year and 
each new branch performing as expected. 
As a result, there were 53 branches open at 
the end of 2017, a 47% increase since we 
acquired the business in April 2016. We also 
extended our product range in 2017 with 
the launch of the ‘Selfy’ loan, a tailored 
product for self-employed customers, as 
well as a new 12-month loan that is 
particularly suited to new customers. 
Home credit
Davie Thompson was promoted to CEO of 
Loans at Home in January 2017 and has 
overseen a transformational period for the 
business. Our plan for growth was 
accelerated by the announcement of a 
major restructuring by the market leader in 
February 2017. This resulted in us being 
approached by large numbers of self-
employed agents and management staff 
that were keen to join Loans at Home. By 
31 December 2017 we had added over 440 
experienced self-employed agents as well 
as over 100 staff to our business; we had also 
opened 22 new offices. While there was an 
associated investment of £5.3m (comprising 
£3.2m of Loans at Home temporary 
additional commission and £2.1m of other 
expansion related costs), the collections  
and lending performance of the new agents 
has been particularly strong and helped to 
drive a 53% increase in the loan book, a 
reduction in the rate of impairment and an 
11% increase in the number of customers. 
Before temporary additional commission, 
normalised operating profit was up 73% to 
£6.3m (2016: £3.6m); after deducting these 
costs, normalised operating profit was up 
67% to £3.1m (2016: £1.9m). 
£30m net loan book
Having issued its first loan in 2014, 
George Banco grew quickly by 
leveraging its strong broker 
relationships and had a £30m loan 
book on acquisition.
NSF now clear #2  
in guarantor loans
Our guarantor loans division now has a 
loan book of £48.2m, up 35% versus the 
prior year on a pro forma basis.
Earnings enhancing  
in first full year
The acquisition remains on-track to 
deliver incremental earnings in 2018.
Strong growth potential
The UK’s guarantor loans market is 
growing strongly and we intend to 
increase our market share. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 26
Group Chief Executive’s report continued
Guarantor loans
The Group acquired George Banco on 
17 August 2017 to become the clear number 
two in the UK guarantor loans market. 
Under the leadership of Marc Howells, the 
CEO of George Banco, our Guarantor 
Loans Division enjoyed strong loan book 
growth in 2017, up 35% on a like-for-like 
basis. This helped to drive normalised 
operating profit that increased by 497% to 
£2.7m (2016: £0.5m).
Strategy
We provide unsecured credit to the 10-12 
million UK consumers who are unable or 
unwilling to borrow from mainstream 
institutions, either because they are on low 
or variable earnings, are credit impaired, 
have a thin credit file or have had an 
unsatisfactory experience of borrowing 
from mainstream lenders. With a net loan 
book of almost £250m (before fair value 
adjustments) and almost 169,000 customers 
at the end of December 2017, we represent 
an important source of credit for 
consumers, credit that many other lenders 
are not prepared to provide but which 
plays a meaningful part in helping to drive 
the UK economy.
Where we differ from many of our 
competitors is that when lending direct, in 
addition to conducting a digital credit 
check, we also aim to meet potential 
customers face-to-face. Whilst an 
expensive model to operate, this represents 
an important part of our underwriting 
process and helps us to better understand 
the customer’s circumstances and make 
better lending decisions. Having delivered 
annual loan book growth of more than 20% 
in 2017, we remain focused on reaching our 
second target of a 20% return on assets in 
each of our operating businesses. 
This will be achieved through the continued 
execution of our business strategy that 
comprises the following three elements:
1. Being a leader in each of our chosen 
business segments 
We subscribe to the view that leadership  
is a key driver of long-term success and  
are well-placed in all three areas of  
our business:
• Branch-based lending – Everyday Loans 
is the clear market leader in unsecured 
branch-based lending to the credit 
impaired with 47,000 customers. 
• Home credit – Loans at Home is ranked 
third in the market having grown 
strongly with over 104,000 customers in 
2017.
• Guarantor loans – Following the 
acquisition of George Banco, we are 
now the clear number two in the market 
with a loan book of close to £50m and 
over 17,000 customers. 
2. Investing in our core assets
Through suitable investment in people, our 
distribution networks, technology and 
brands, we are increasing our capacity to 
drive further loan book growth whilst at the 
same time managing operational risks 
through effective spans of control. 
People – establishing a good relationship 
with our customers through face-to-face 
contact is at the heart of our business 
model and in 2017 we increased the size of 
our workforce by 40% to over 750 full time 
employees. We also launched a sharesave 
scheme for all staff so they can participate 
in the future success of the Group. In home 
credit, we recruited over 440 experienced 
self-employed agents taking our total 
number to over 1,000. Such expansion 
required significant investment in training 
and incentives that are focused on 
rewarding both financial results and the 
delivery of good customer outcomes. 
Distribution networks – we opened 12 new 
Everyday Loans branches in 2017 taking the 
total number now open to 53 – we plan to 
open a further 12 in the first half of 2018. 
At Loans at Home we opened 22 new 
offices to support the rapid expansion of 
our self-employed agent network and we 
now have 69 locations (including the head 
office) across the UK. 
Technology – while face-to-face contact 
lies at the heart of both branch-based 
lending and home credit, all three of our 
business divisions rely heavily on 24/7 
access to scalable and robust technology. 
With thousands of customers up and down 
the country, effective data management 
and analysis ensures that we can process 
large volumes of transactions, conduct full 
credit scoring and lead management and 
can monitor and optimise our day-to-day 
business performance. 
Brands – securing the trust and confidence 
of our customers and other key stakeholders 
is vitally important, especially now that 
purchase decisions for financial services 
are increasingly made online or through 
remote channels. The quality of our service 
and size of our customer base means that 
continuing to invest in our brands and 
reputation is a source of substantial 
long-term value for the Group. 
3. Acting responsibly
As noted in the Chairman’s Statement on 
pages 4 to 5, how we behave as a 
business is not just defined by prevailing 
laws or regulations but also by our culture 
or ‘how we do things around here’. Right at 
the outset and at the very heart of our 
long-term strategic plan was the vision 
that Non-Standard Finance plc would 
represent the very best in consumer credit, 
with the highest standards of compliance 
and best practice. 
We monitor closely how our behaviour and 
conduct might impact our key stakeholders, 
whether they be customers, staff, self-
employed agents, suppliers, our 
environment or the communities where  
we have a physical presence. Through a 
number of initiatives across the Group, 
including a series of employee workshops, 
we have identified a number of core 
behaviours that we see as being vital if  
we are to achieve our strategic goals:
• Doing the right thing: we recognise our 
collective responsibility for delivering 
great outcomes for our customers,  
even when others are not looking.
• Integrity: we respect colleagues and 
other key stakeholders and always do 
what we say we will do. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 27
Corporate Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report Overview
• Shared purpose delivered through 
teamwork: we have clear goals and 
expect all of our people to share in that 
vision. By working together we are likely 
to solve problems more effectively than 
trying to do things on our own. 
• Clear communication: we are well-
informed and listen carefully to those 
dealing direct with our customers;  
we also speak up when something  
is not right; we celebrate success and 
don’t blame others when something 
goes wrong, always learning from  
our mistakes.
• Entrepreneurial leadership: we lead by 
example and use our initiative, trying 
new things so we can improve.
By embedding each of these into our 
employee review protocol we aim to 
formalise the process by which we 
recognise and reward these values and 
behaviours so that we can stand out from 
our competitors. 
Financing
On 3 August 2017 we announced the 
acquisition of George Banco, the number 
two provider of guarantor loans in the 
non-standard sector, for £18.6m 
(representing an enterprise value of 
£53.5m). To finance the acquisition and 
refinance all of the Group’s existing debt 
facilities, as well as to provide additional 
funding to support future growth, we 
secured a new £175m term loan facility (the 
‘Term Loan’), provided by a group of 
institutional investors, led by Alcentra 
Limited. The new six-year loan bears an 
interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.25% per year 
with interest payable every six months. The 
same investors also agreed to provide an 
additional committed facility of up to £50m 
under the same terms as the Term Loan 
taking their total commitment to the Group 
to £225m. In addition, the Group secured a 
new £35m revolving credit facility provided 
by Royal Bank of Scotland at an interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% per year. 
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had cash 
at bank of £11.0m (2016: £5.2m) and gross 
borrowings of £208.1m (2016: £87.3m) 
leaving total headroom on the Group’s debt 
facilities of £51.9m (2016: £12.9m). 
Regulation
With each of our three business divisions 
now fully authorised by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (‘FCA’), we believe we 
have established a constructive dialogue 
with the regulator at both an operational 
as well as at a more strategic level. 
The FCA published a number of documents 
regarding consumer credit in 2017 and 
while there appear to be no concerns 
regarding branch-based lending or 
guarantor loans, through its ongoing review 
of high-cost credit, the FCA is continuing to 
improve its understanding of certain 
segments, including home credit. 
Through our regular interactions with the 
FCA, as well as through formal consultations, 
we continue to inform the FCA’s understanding 
around home credit and its importance to 
over a million UK consumers.
In its response to ‘Good work: the Taylor 
Review of modern working practices’, the 
Government announced in February 2018 
its intention to consult widely on a variety  
of matters affecting the UK workforce, 
including employment status. With a 
network of over 1,000 self-employed 
agents, the majority of whom are women, 
we are monitoring these developments 
closely and will be contributing to the 
consultations in due course. 
A summary of some of the recent regulatory 
developments that may have a bearing  
on the Group’s business is set out in ‘An 
evolving regulatory landscape’ on page 28.
Final dividend
Having declared a half-year dividend of 
0.5p per share in August 2017 (2016: 0.3p), 
the Board is pleased to recommend a final 
dividend of 1.70p per share (2016: 0.9p), 
making a total of 2.20p for the year as a 
whole (2016: 1.2p). If approved by 
shareholders, based on normalised 
post-tax earnings before temporary agent 
commission, this would mean that we had 
exceeded our medium-term target of a 
payout ratio of 50%. 
If approved at the Company’s Annual 
General Meeting on 14 May 2018, the final 
dividend would be paid to those 
shareholders on the Company’s share 
register on 18 May 2018 (the ‘Record Date’), 
with payment being made on 15 June 2018.
Current trading and outlook
We have made a good start to the year 
with each of our business divisions 
continuing to deliver strong loan book 
growth whilst maintaining tight control on 
impairment. We therefore remain confident 
about the Group’s full year prospects.

An evolving regulatory 
landscape
During 2017/18 there were a number of 
regulatory developments that may have 
a bearing on the Group’s activities and 
business operations in the future. Some 
of the more pertinent developments are 
summarised below.
January 2017
• The FCA published its final guidance on 
how consumer credit firms should address 
the matter of default notices in respect of 
guarantor loans. This was a revision to 
previous guidance having taken into 
account a number of responses made. 
 February 2017
• The FCA closed its call for input into 
high-cost credit on 15 February 2017 . The 
review covered the payday lending cap, 
unauthorised overdrafts as well as a 
broader review of all forms of high-cost 
credit, including home-collected credit. 
April 2017
• The FCA published its Mission, Sector 
Views and Business Plan for 2017 . Each 
provides a valuable insight into the views, 
objectives and operating parameters 
adopted by the FCA in carrying out its 
duties. They also refer to some of the 
thematic reviews that the FCA expects to 
undertake in the future.
• The FCA published a consultation on its 
proposed measures to address persistent 
credit card debt and to require credit card 
firms to use their data to identify customers 
at risk of financial difficulties.
June 2017
• The FCA published its impact assessment 
on the amendments to the guarantor 
lending rules pursuant to PS15/23.
July 2017
• The FCA published its feedback statement 
following its call for input into high-cost 
credit and also issued a consultation into 
creditworthiness and affordability in 
consumer credit. 
• The FCA published ‘Occasional Paper 
No.28 – Preventing financial distress by 
predicting unaffordable consumer credit 
agreements: An applied framework’. 
Much of this research was used to support 
proposals in the creditworthiness and 
affordability consultation also issued on 
31 July 2017 (see above).
• The Taylor Review of Modern Working 
Practices was published, making  
a number of recommendations to 
government regarding the definition  
of workers and the principles which 
workers and employers should be 
expected to adopt. 
July 2017 continued
• The FCA published a consultation on staff 
incentives, remuneration and performance 
management in consumer credit. The 
review aims to help firms identify practices 
that may promote inappropriate behaviour 
by company representatives that in turn 
could result in poor customer outcomes.
• The Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, 
that creates the framework for a single 
financial guidance body, was introduced in 
the Queen’s speech and had its second 
reading in the House of Lords.
September 2017
• The FCA published an occasional paper on 
the ageing population and financial 
services including the FCA’s strategy for 
mitigating the potential harm arising.
October 2017
• HM Treasury launched a call for evidence to 
gain further insight from the debt advice 
sector and creditors about how best to 
design, implement, administer and monitor 
a six-week breathing space scheme and 
statutory debt management plan.
• The FCA published ‘Understanding the 
financial lives of UK adults – Findings from 
the FCA’s Financial Lives Survey 2017’, an 
extensive piece of research into how 
different segments of the UK population 
interact with regulated financial services. 
Based on nearly 13,000 face-to-face and 
online interviews, Financial Lives is the 
FCA’s largest tracking survey on consumers 
and finance.
November 2017
• The FCA published their findings on illegal 
lending in the UK in a paper titled: ‘Shining 
a light on illegal money lending: consumer 
experiences of unauthorised lending in  
the UK.’
• The FCA published a document detailing its 
approach to consumers which is intended to 
broaden the debate started in its Mission 
(published on 18 April 2017) by exploring its 
approach to regulating for retail consumers.
• The Information Commissioner’s Office 
published its updated guide to the General 
Data Protection Regulation which is due  
to come into force on 25 May 2018 including 
guidance on contracts and liabilities  
as between data controller and data 
processors and on obtaining, recording  
and managing consents.
December 2017
• The FCA published a document detailing 
its approach to promoting competition in 
the interests of consumers and not for its 
own sake. The FCA is focused on keeping 
markets open to entry and innovation, 
tackling anti-competitive conduct and 
intervening to ensure competitive forces 
drive good outcomes for consumers.
• The FCA published a document explaining 
the purpose of, and its approach to, 
authorisation, the public value it delivers 
and changes the FCA is making to improve 
its approach. The document describes how 
authorisation is a tool, primarily to prevent 
harm from occurring, by ensuring that all 
regulated firms and individuals meet 
common sets of minimum standards.
January 2018 
• The FCA published an update on progress 
on the High-Cost Credit Review and 
thoughts on the direction of travel, with 
indications on the further work it is 
undertaking and the planned timelines for 
that work.
February 2018 
• The Government published its response to 
the Taylor Review on Modern Working 
Practices (see above). At the same time, the 
Government launched four consultations 
on the following key areas: employment 
status; increasing transparency in the 
labour market; agency workers; and 
enforcement of employment rights. The 
consultations close on various dates in  
May and June 2018.
• The Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, 
that creates the framework for a single 
financial guidance body, completed the 
Committee Stage in Parliament and is 
expected to enter the Report Stage in the 
House of Commons in due course. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 29

Strategy
Our strategy and KPIs
We aim to be the best at what  
we do – not just from a customer’s 
perspective, but also from that of our 
employees, our regulator and each 
of our key stakeholders.
While technology and regulations 
have changed credit markets 
considerably, the core elements  
of what good lending looks like to  
us have not changed:
• know our customers really well
• tailor our products to suit  
their needs
• deliver great customer service 
• if they get into difficulty, work  
with them to achieve a satisfactory 
solution for both borrower  
and lender
Progress and outlook
Having the right procedures, policies 
and infrastructure can only get you 
so far – to deliver on each of the 
objectives above we must also  
have the right culture and ethos  
at all levels of our business. Our 
investment in training, improved 
communications and a refreshed 
incentives programme driven by 
good customer outcomes, have 
combined together to help us  
remain in a leading position in 2017 .
“ We may not be the biggest,  
but we certainly want to  
be the best at what we do, 
delivering great customer 
outcomes and long-term  
returns for shareholders.”

Strategy
Our strategy and KPIs continued
The nature of our business means 
that, other than the loans we make  
to customers, our core assets tend to 
be intangible in nature and include 
things such as distribution networks, 
our people, our technology and our 
brands. In 2017 we continued to 
invest in a number of key areas:
• Branch-based lending – 12  
new branches 
• Home credit – 22 new offices
• Guarantor loans – acquisition  
of George Banco
Progress and outlook
2017 saw us invest significant sums in 
our distribution networks with 34 new 
locations and over 650 additional 
staff and self-employed agents. The 
acquisition of George Banco in 
August 2017 positioned us as the 
clear number two in the UK’s 
guarantor loans market.
The investment made in 2017 will 
help to drive our performance in 2018 
that will also benefit from the 
opening of a further 12 new Everyday 
Loans branches and additional 
web-based applications in our home 
credit businesses. In guarantor loans, 
our main focus will be on integrating 
our two brands onto a single loan 
management platform.
“ We are determined to sustain our 
strong position in each of our 
chosen segments and continue to 
invest in our networks, people, 
technology and brands.”

Strategy
Our strategy and KPIs continued
‘Doing the right thing’ is one of our 
core behaviours that emerged from 
a series of culture workshops that we 
held across the Group in 2017. 
However, this philosophy goes much 
deeper than just our customer-facing 
activities – it also applies whenever 
we interact with any of our key 
stakeholders. We believe that staff 
engagement is a powerful measure 
of how we are conducting ourselves 
as a business.
Our KPIs are designed to help us 
measure our performance so that we 
can identify areas of potential risk 
and determine whether or not our 
working practices can be improved 
or need to change.
“ Being responsible lies at the 
heart of our business strategy. 
Not just because it is the right 
thing to do but also because it 
makes good business sense.”

Risk/definition Mitigation Change 
in 2017
Explanation
Conduct
Inappropriate or sub-standard 
behaviour by the Group’s 
representatives. 
• A strong culture committed to ‘doing the  
right thing’ and delivering great outcomes  
for customers
• Extensive training
• Close and active monitoring of customer 
complaints
• Balanced incentive programme
• Clear policies and procedures, including 
whistleblowing
• Diligent application of ‘Three Lines  
of Defence’:
 – policies, procedures and quality assurance 
in customer-facing roles;
 – compliance and conduct assurance; and
 – internal audit.
During 2017 we appointed new leaders for each 
of our three business divisions. Each are highly 
experienced in consumer finance and are 
passionate about ensuring that we have the right 
culture and customer focus.
In branch-based lending and guarantor loans 
we have appointed a new Chief Risk Officer with 
many years’ experience in consumer finance and 
have invested further resources in extending our 
risk and compliance function.
In home credit we have rolled-out handheld 
technology so that the entire customer 
application process can be conducted digitally, 
providing a full audit trail of all stages of the 
lending process. 
Regulation
All licensed firms are subject to a 
rigorous licensing process as well as 
strict ongoing supervision by the 
FCA. Non-compliance can result in 
fines or loss of approvals to operate. 
Key regulatory developments over 
the past year are summarised on 
page 28.
• Active engagement with the FCA as well as 
industry peers 
• Diligent monitoring/assessment of all 
regulations both in-house as well as through 
external advisers 
• An active regulatory affairs programme 
identifying and addressing the concerns  
of key stakeholders 
• A continuous process of investment, quality 
assurance and internal audit reviews ensures 
we meet all of our regulatory obligations
All of the Group’s business divisions have now 
received full authorisation from the FCA. While 
there appear to be no regulatory concerns 
regarding branch-based lending or guarantor 
loans, the FCA is continuing to examine the home 
credit industry and the regulatory framework is 
always subject to change.

A robust approach 
to risk management
The Group faces a number of potential risks that could have a material impact 
on its performance and that might cause actual results to differ materially from 
both expected and historic results.
The table below and overleaf highlights each of the principal risks identified by the Board, what we are 
doing to manage them, whether the risk has increased, decreased or stayed the same over the past year 
and where there has been a change, a brief explanation as to why the change has occurred.

Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Risk/definition Mitigation Change 
in 2017
Explanation
Credit
Any marked increase in the rates of 
impairments or defaults by the 
Group’s customers could impact the 
performance of the Group.
• Detailed weekly and monthly management 
information on historic and expected future 
credit performance 
• Continuous process of review and refinement 
of each business’s credit scorecard and 
lending criteria 
• Regular credit committee reviews of policies 
and outcomes 
The levels of impairment have either remained 
broadly flat or reduced in each of our three 
business divisions in 2017 .
Business strategy
A failure to execute and integrate 
acquisitions (including technology), 
or to execute the Group’s strategy as 
planned, may increase the risk of 
financial loss.
• Detailed due diligence is completed  
on all acquisitions with advice from  
specialists on legal, financial and regulatory 
aspects Detailed review of weekly and 
monthly management information on 
operating performance 
• Careful monitoring of market dynamics, 
competitor behaviour and performance 
• Annual review of all aspects of the  
Group’s strategy 
New leadership at all three businesses has been 
followed by strong loan book growth and falling 
rates of impairment.
Everyday Loans represented c.60% of the Group’s 
total loan book in 2017 (before fair value 
adjustments) and opened 12 new branches in 
2017 as planned and on schedule.
Loans at Home represented 21% of the Group’s 
total loan book in 2017 . While the decision to 
capitalise on the restructuring of a major 
competitor incurred £5.3m of additional cost, it 
also delivered loan book growth of 53%.
George Banco was acquired on 17 August 2017 
and (together with TrustTwo) represented c.19% 
of the Group’s total loan book in 2017 (before fair 
value adjustments). It has performed as expected 
since being acquired. No other acquisitions were 
made in 2017 .
Operational
Key areas of risk for the Group 
include:
• IT failure
• integration of George Banco 
and TrustTwo onto a single 
technology platform
• fraud
• changes in the self-employed 
status of home credit agents
• threats to agent safety
• failure to recruit and retain key 
staff
• underperformance by key staff
• disaster recovery
• IT policies are in place to mitigate risk 
including disaster recovery plans
• A detailed integration plan has been 
developed and is now being executed to 
move George Banco onto the existing 
Everyday Loans (including TrustTwo) loan 
management platform
• Policies and procedures are in place to 
identify, investigate and report fraud
• Careful monitoring with our advisers of the tax 
status of home credit agents
• Agents receive regular training about 
personal safety and any incident is carefully 
monitored to inform policy and procedures
• A series of recruitment, retention and incentive 
programmes are already in place
• Members of the NSF management team sit on 
and attend all board meetings of the 
operating subsidiaries
Technology integrations can be complex and 
can take longer than expected.
The Government has announced a series of 
consultations into working practices in the UK 
including one on employment status. As a result, 
the employment status of self-employed workers 
for a number of UK business models may change.
While agent-related incidents are rare, we are 
never complacent and continue to ensure that 
agents follow procedures to ensure they remain 
safe. A tight span of control ensures we retain 
appropriate oversight of all areas of our home 
credit business.
The Group is recruiting the people that it needs to 
execute its plans and while there is a degree of 
turnover , it is within the expected levels of tolerance.
Cyber risk
The Group may suffer data loss or be 
subject to an unauthorised change 
that causes a security issue, data or 
systems abuse, cyber-attack or 
denial of service to any of the  
Group’s systems.
• The Group has dedicated internal teams, 
supported by external providers that monitor 
and assess such risks
• Divisional and Group Risk Committees oversee 
cyber risks including monitoring and crisis 
management plans in line with industry  
best practice
• Internal audit and external third party review 
of cyber security status across all businesses
Increased connectivity in the workplace coupled 
with the increasing importance of data and data 
analytics in operating and managing consumer 
finance businesses means that this risk has been 
identified separately from operational risk. 
Many recent examples of where such risks have 
become reality means that the Group now views 
such risks as being greater than previously.  Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 38

Explanation
Liquidity
The Group may not be able to meet 
its financial obligations because it:
• is unable to borrow to fund 
lending by its operating 
businesses
• has failed to renew/replace 
existing debt facilities as they 
become payable
• cannot fund growth and  
further acquisitions
• The Group’s short-term loans to customers 
provide a natural hedge against medium-term 
borrowings
• The Group successfully refinanced all of its 
bank facilities in August 2017 and raised 
additional long-term debt funding from a 
range of different providers
• The new £225m loan facility is for six years and 
is supplemented by a £35m revolving credit 
facility
• Cash and covenant forecasting is conducted 
on a monthly basis as part of the regular 
management reporting exercise
With net debt of c.£197m and total debt facilities 
of £260m at 31 December 2017 , the Group has 
sufficient headroom on its existing facilities to 
fund the Group’s growth plans in 2018.
Reputational
Lending money at high rates of 
interest means that consumer finance 
can attract a higher level of media 
and political scrutiny than certain 
other business sectors.
Whilst the Group is committed to 
meeting all of its regulatory 
obligations, including the delivery of 
positive customer outcomes, its 
reputation may become tarnished by 
the activities of other businesses or 
the practices of others. This in turn 
could have an impact on the Group ’s 
operational or financial performance.
• As a PLC listed on the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange, the Group is highly 
transparent with full disclosure regarding its 
business and financial performance 
• The Group conducts an active regulatory 
affairs programme to ensure that all 
stakeholders, not just the providers of capital, 
have an accurate picture of what the Group is 
trying to achieve, our ethos, culture and 
business strategy 
• Whilst a relatively new company we have 
embarked upon a Group-wide exercise to 
ensure that ‘what we say is what we do’ and 
that our processes and procedures are 
consistent with our desired culture, values and 
behaviours (see Culture and stakeholder 
management on pages 50 to 53) 
We continue to engage actively with all of our 
key stakeholders, including the FCA, Members of 
Parliament, debt-related charities, other 
regulators, journalists, think-tanks, investors and 
debt-providers. 
Through this process of engagement we aim to 
demonstrate that not all consumer finance 
companies are the same – we explain why we 
are different and why we believe that NSF stands 
out from competitors. 
However, we remain vigilant, always ensuring that 
our reputation is both nurtured and protected.

Context for results
• The Group acquired George Banco  
on 17 August 2017; Everyday Loans, 
including TrustTwo, on 13 April 2016; and 
Loansathome4u (now Loans at Home) 
on 4 August 2015.
• The 2016 and 2017 reported results 
include fair value adjustments, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles 
and exceptional items relating to the 
acquisitions. Normalised results are 
presented to demonstrate Group 
performance before these items.
Given the unusual circumstances that 
prevailed in the home credit market during 
2017, we have broken out the temporary 
additional commission paid to newly 
signed-up agents during 2017. Normalised 
figures are before fair value adjustments, the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and 
exceptional items. 
Group 2017 full year results
The reported Group results for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 include a full 
period of Everyday Loans (including 
TrustTwo), that was acquired on 13 April 2016, 
and approximately four and a half months’ 
performance of George Banco that was 
acquired on 17 August 2017. The prior year 
reported figure included approximately 
eight months’ performance from Everyday 
Loans (including TrustTwo).

Normalised revenue was £119.8m (2016: 
£81.1m) reflecting just over four months’ 
contribution from George Banco that was 
acquired on 17 August 2017 and a full 
period of Everyday Loans (including 
TrustTwo). Figures for the prior year 
included just eight months’ of Everyday 
Loans (including TrustTwo). 
Normalised operating profit, before 
temporary additional commission of £3.2m 
(2016: £1.8m), was up 72% to £26.9m (2016: 
£15.6m). After deducting these costs, 
normalised operating profit was up 71% to 
£23.7m (2016: £13.8m). As a result, the 
reported operating profit was £3.8m (2016: 
loss of £5.2m). Exceptional costs of £6.3m 
(2016: £0.6m) included the write-off of 
previously capitalised fees incurred in 
connection with the Group’s previous debt 
raising as well as M&A-related costs. 
Finance costs increased to £10.5m (2016: 
£3.5m) due to the increased levels and 
higher cost of borrowing under the Group’s 
new debt arrangements resulting in a 
reported loss before tax of £13.0m (2016: 
loss of £9.3m). A tax credit of £2.7m (2016: 
£1.3m) meant that the loss after tax was 
£10.3m (2016: £8.0m) equating to a reported 
loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss per share 
of 2.60p).

Divisional overview
Everyday Loans is the largest branch-based provider of unsecured 
loans in the UK’s non-standard finance sector. With 53 branches 
across the UK, the business ended 2017 with over 47,000 active 
customers, an increase of 19% over the prior year (2016: 39,600) and 
a total net loan book of £148.5m, up 21% (2016: £122.4m).
Having made some management changes in May 2017, the business 
responded with newfound pace and ambition under the leadership 
of Miles Cresswell-Turner, supported by a strengthened senior 
management team. As well as increasing the expectations of what 
could be achieved, management also delivered against our key 
operational objectives for the year, including the opening of 12 new 
branches and the adoption of a new management structure, the 
introduction of eSignature and Faster Payments, increasing the 
volume and quality of leads coming into the network and extending 
our product range.
Network expansion – our branch opening programme was a key 
source of growth in 2017, further extending our customer reach as 
well as increasing our capacity to deliver additional loan book 
growth. By meeting our customers face-to-face we are able to build 
a relationship and improve our understanding of their needs, both  
of which form key elements of our underwriting process. Where a 
customer is unable to attend one of our branches, we may be 
comfortable to complete the loan by telephone. However, we have 
no plans to shift away from using our branch network that has 
proven its ability to deliver strong revenue growth whilst at the  
same time maintaining a tight control on impairment. 
Operational improvements – the introduction of eSignature and 
Faster Payments during 2017 helped us improve our service to 
customers through more timely execution. Having strengthened  
the senior management team, we also introduced a new structure 
for the branch network with six new area managers that are 
responsible for between two and four branches. This has improved 
knowledge across the network and increased the sharing of best 
practice, both of which have contributed to increased conversion 
and lower impairment.
Increased volumes – growth is a function of the number and quality 
of the leads we receive and our ability to convert those leads into 
loans. By expanding our capacity with 12 more branches during  
the year we were able to process more leads from financial brokers, 
through direct marketing and also from our existing customers.  
In 2017 we processed over 1 million leads (2016: 860,000) and 
converted these into 32,668 loans (2016: 26,535), with an 
improvement in conversion from new borrowers from 1.97% in  
2016 to 2.23% in 2017.
New products – other drivers of growth include the introduction of 
new products and in 2017 loan volumes of our new ‘Selfy’ loan 
continued to build on the back of an increased number of 
applications. The self-employed represent around 15% of the total 
UK workforce and we plan to grow lending volumes significantly to 
this large and growing segment of the UK economy. Our new 
12-month loan product was launched in August 2017 and provides 
branches with an opportunity to offer new customers a ‘starter loan’, 
that is typically smaller in size and so allows the customer to prove 
their ability to manage their repayments before moving on to a 
larger, longer-term loan. The success of this new product contributed 
to a small reduction in average loan size to £3,584 (2016: £3,842).

Overview Strategic Report
Results
Normalised revenue was up 64% to £60.9m (2016: £37.1m) reflecting 
strong loan book growth as well as the inclusion of Everyday Loans 
for a full period. Fair value adjustments increased to £11.9m (2016: 
£7.9m) reflecting a full period of the fair value unwind of the 
acquired loan portfolio and resulted in reported revenue of £49.1m 
(2016: £29.2m). Impairments increased to £11.7m (2016: £8.1m) but fell 
as a percentage of revenue, reflecting our continued focus on 
quality underwriting and collections. 
Administrative expenses increased to 47% of normalised revenue 
(2016: 40%) reflecting the substantial investment in new branch 
openings together with the associated costs of recruitment and 
training. We added 77 new staff during the year taking the total to 
307, an increase of 33% versus the prior year. As a result 
administration costs increased to £28.6m (2016: £14.7m) and the net 
impact of all of these movements was that normalised operating 
profit increased by 53% to £22.7m (2016: £14.8m). Exceptional costs of 
£5.3m (2016: nil) related to the refinancing of the Everyday Loans 
bank facilities and restructuring costs.
Finance costs increased to £7.1m (2016: £2.7m) reflecting the growth 
in the loan book as well as the increased average cost of the 
Group’s new debt arrangements that were put in place in August 
2017. As a result, normalised profit before tax increased by 29% to 
£15.6m (2016: £12.1m).

Key performance indicators
A modest increase in revenue yield to 45.8% (2016: 44.2%) reflected 
a small shift in business mix together with the flow-through effect of 
pricing changes from the previous trading period. Impairments at 
19.1% of revenue (2016: 21.0%) reflected the quality of our 
underwriting process as well as our continued focus on 
delinquency. The net result was that the risk adjusted margin 
increased to 37.0% (2016: 35.1%). Operating profit margin fell 
slightly to 37.2% (2016: 38.8%) reflecting the significant investment 
in new branches during the year, however the return on assets was 
broadly unchanged at 17.0% (2016: 17.1%).

Plans for 2018
We remain focused on driving loan book growth through increased 
volumes and better conversion, all whilst maintaining a tight control 
on impairment. This will be underpinned by the following initiatives 
in 2018:
Branch openings – we are on-track to open a further 12 locations in 
the first half of 2018 and have already opened new branches in 
Dudley, King’s Heath and Bootle. Ten out of the twelve new branch 
managers are internal promotions, helping to mitigate operational 
risk when opening a number of branches in a short space of time. 
The 37 new staff required were recruited in January 2018 and 
underwent an intensive training programme before being deployed 
across the network and ahead of joining their new branches. As 
previously announced, we expect this expansion to incur an 
additional £3m of costs in 2018 including the costs of new staff, 
training and premises.
Active lead management by channel – with over one million leads 
processed in 2017, we are actively reviewing all acquisition channels 
in order to ensure we maintain lead quality as well as volume and 
also manage carefully our customer acquisition costs. 
Product development – we remain optimistic about our new Selfy 
and 12-month products and continue to explore the potential for 
additional loan products that can be tailored to our customers’ 
circumstances.
Extending our relationship with customers – as well as attracting 
new customers every month, we also plan to improve our retention of 
existing customers, especially those that have performed well. With 
an established relationship in place, such customers tend to be 
lower risk and so can attract lower APRs, meaning we can improve 
our pricing for a better customer outcome.
Building on the momentum achieved in 2017, we plan to continue to 
grow our loan book at 20% or more and fully expect to achieve our 
target of a 20% return on assets in due course. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 44

February 2017 prompted a large number of highly experienced 
agents and staff to approach us, keen to continue working in home 
credit, but preferring our operating model of a network of self-
employed agents rather than employed customer experience 
managers. Recognising the significant opportunity this presented, 
we quickly established a rigorous on-boarding process including the 
development of an individual business plan for each agent which 
projected their expected weekly performance from their anticipated 
start date until the end of 2017. Once agreed, we committed to 
provide them with temporary additional commission to help support 
them financially as they built up their customer rounds over the 
coming months. 
Having added 229 agents in the first half of 2017, by 31 December 
2017 this had increased to 442 and our total number of agents had 
increased to 1,005, an increase of 28% (2016: 785). To accommodate 
this expansion we opened 22 new offices and added over 100 staff, 
at a variety of levels, including 55 new business managers and 23 
new area managers, thereby maintaining an effective span of 
control with six agents per business manager and three business 
managers per area manager. While this required a sizeable 
investment in infrastructure and temporary additional commission 
totalling £5.3m, it also delivered substantial loan book growth and 
improved the quality of our customer base – at 31 December 2017 the 
number of quality customers, who had paid 70% or more of their due 
payments over the previous 13 weeks, had increased to 66,000 or 
64% of the total (2016: 53%).
We rolled-out our collections app for agents in February 2017 and 
our lending app became fully operational during the fourth quarter 
of 2017. Both have been well-received by agents, removing the need 
for a paper-based process. They also provide managers with 
real-time performance data by customer and agent so that any 
issues can be quickly identified and acted upon. An additional 
advantage is that we now have a digital audit trail of lending and 
collecting and can easily perform quality assurance reviews on 
individual agents and customers.

Results
While 2017 normalised revenue of £50.7m (2016: £42.2m) was the 
same as reported revenue, in 2016 reported revenue was £0.4m 
lower than the normalised figure due to the final unwinding of the 
fair value adjustment made to the carrying value of the loan book at 
acquisition in 2015. 
Capitalising upon the considerable opportunity presented by the 
restructuring of a major competitor, we invested a total of £5.3m 
during the year comprising £3.2m in temporary agent commission 
(2016: £1.8m) and an additional £2.1m of additional staff, training 
and premises costs (2016: nil). Normalised operating profit before 
temporary additional commission increased by 75% to £6.3m (2016: 
£3.6m). The new agents that joined our network received temporary 
additional commission while they built up their customer numbers 
and the level of income earned through our normal commission 
structure. The exceptional number of new agents added in  
2017 meant that the total amount of additional commission was 
considerably higher than had been expected at the start of the 
year. Normalised operating profit after these costs was £3.1m 
(2016: £1.9m).
Exceptional costs of £0.5m related to the refinancing of the Loans at 
Home bank facility. Finance costs increased to £1.3m (2016: £0.3m), 
reflecting the strong loan book growth as well as the increased  
cost of funds of the Group’s new long-term debt arrangements. 
Before £3.2m of temporary additional commission (2016: £1.8m), 
profit before interest and tax increased to £6.3m (2016: £3.6m). After 
deducting these costs normalised profit before tax was up 20% to 
£1.8m (2016: £1.5m).

Divisional overview
Key performance indicators
The significant growth in our agent network had a knock-on effect 
on all of our KPIs. The increased number of customers taking out 
larger, longer-term loans meant that revenue yield reduced slightly 
to 147%. However, the increased quality of our loan book and strong 
collections performance of the recently joined agents is reflected in 
the marked reduction in impairment that fell to 31.1% of revenue 
(2016: 36.3%), in line with our previous guidance. Operating profit 
margins of 6.1% (2016: 4.4%) reflect the £5.3m additional investment 
(£3.2m of temporary additional commission and £2.1m of other 
expansion related costs) made in 2017. Before these expenses 
operating margin was 16.6% (2016: 8.6%) and return on asset was 
24.4% (2016: 13.1%).

Plans for 2018
Having invested in our infrastructure and grown our net loan book 
by 53%, our network of self-employed agents by 28% and our 
number of staff by 26% in 2017, we now have an excellent platform to 
deliver further growth in 2018, albeit at a more measured pace than 
in 2017. With a strong management team in place, we will seek to 
bed in all of the changes made over the past 12 months and in 
particular, we will focus on:
Maintaining our focus on delivering great outcomes for our 
customers – if we fall short on this objective then we will not be able 
to grow and sustain our business.
Completing the integration of recently joined agents – as each of our 
new agents reaches their target number of customers so we can 
then remove the need for temporary additional commission.
Augmenting our handheld technology further – we will continue to 
develop new applications for agents in the field and additional 
management information to help increase operational efficiency. 
Maintaining a tight span of control – whilst new technology and 
improved management information might present an opportunity 
to relax the current spans of control at some point in the future, we 
plan to maintain these at current levels in 2018 whilst we continue 
to grow. 
Selectively expanding our network – we will look to add more agents 
and field staff but only on a highly selective basis to ensure that any 
additions are profitable in 2018.
Continuing to improve the quality of our customer base – whilst we 
believe that there remains a significant opportunity for loan book 
growth, we are determined that this will not be at the expense of 
quality. We will continue to improve our underwriting and 
collections performance through the further deployment of 
behavioural scoring as well as through access to third-party 
datasets as they become available.
Each of these initiatives should help us to continue to drive loan book 
growth, albeit at a slower pace than in 2017 , and we still plan to 
achieve 20% per annum while maintaining a tight grip on impairment.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements

Strategic Report Overview
Guarantor loans 
The acquisition of George Banco on 17 August 2017 transformed our 
guarantor loans business that is now the clear number two in the UK 
market. Marc Howells, the CEO of George Banco, was appointed 
Managing Director of the newly named Guarantor Loans Division 
that now has a clearly defined management structure and in its first 
few months as a combined business has delivered strong growth in 
loan book, revenue and profit.
By retaining both the TrustTwo and George Banco brands, we are 
able to address complementary segments of the market, offering 
different customer journeys through different channels, but with a 
common underwriting approach. While TrustTwo is focused on price 
comparison websites and the direct channel, George Banco 
specialises in capturing leads from the financial broker community. 
We announced our receipt of full authorisation from the FCA for 
George Banco on 28 September 2017 and completed our 100-day 
plan for the enlarged business on schedule. Having been held back 
by funding constraints prior to acquisition, George Banco quickly 
returned to its previous levels of lending and TrustTwo responded 
positively to the change of leadership. As a result, the division 
reached record volumes in November and December 2017 and risk 
adjusted margin was over 30%.
Despite growing quickly, both brands continue to deliver great 
outcomes for our customers and score well on customer review 
websites such as Trustpilot.com and Feefo.com.
Results
The reported results for 2017 include a full period of TrustTwo and 
four and a half months’ of George Banco that was acquired on 
17 August 2017. The figures for 2016 comprise TrustTwo only from its 
acquisition on 13 April 2016 and there were no differences between 
normalised and reported results in 2016. 
As at 31 December 2017, the division had a net loan book of £48.2m 
(2016: £8.8m). The significant contribution from George Banco meant 
that normalised revenue increased to £8.1m (2016: £1.8m) and 
normalised operating profit to £2.7m (2016: £0.5m). 
Increased finance costs of £2.0m (2016: £0.2m) reflected both the 
strong loan book growth in the year as well as the terms of the new 
debt arrangements that were put in place at the time of the George 
Banco acquisition. As a result, normalised profit before tax more 
than doubled to £0.7m (2016: £0.3m). 
Exceptional items of £0.2m (2016: nil) comprised stamp duty on the 
purchase of George Banco and reorganisation costs post-
completion with the result that reported profit before tax was up 
33% to £0.4m (2016: £0.3m).

Key performance indicators
All of the KPIs were transformed by the acquisition of George 
Banco. The 2017 KPIs include George Banco for a full 12 months 
while the 2016 KPIs only reflect 12 months of TrustTwo emphasising 
the significant impact of George Banco on the division. In 
particular, the differential in pricing between George Banco and 
TrustTwo lifted revenue yield and also drove risk adjusted margin, 
which was over 30% in 2017. Rates of impairment remained within 
our target range and while return on asset is below our target of 
20%, we remain confident that this can be reached as the business 
continues to grow strongly.

Plans for 2018
There are a number of initiatives underway for 2018 including:
Move to a single loan management platform – this significant project 
is our number one priority in 2018. The project is well underway and 
we expect it to be completed before the end of the current year. 
Benefits include improved management information, reduced 
reliance on third parties and scale economies. 
Development of a more tailored customer journey – our objective is 
to be able to identify the best customer journey for an individual 
applicant depending upon a range of criteria including size of loan 
asked for, income, credit score and application channel. We are 
developing this capability in parallel with our move to a single loan 
management platform.
Maintain a well-balanced channel mix – whilst keen to capitalise 
on our strengths in order to drive down customer acquisition costs, 
we will also continue to diversify our acquisition channels and  
seek to increase significantly the volume of branch referrals from 
Everyday Loans as this represents a unique source of high quality 
traffic for the division.
Common underwriting approach – we are moving to a unified 
approach, one that will enable more dynamic, risk-based pricing 
and which should expand our customer reach.
Harmonised collections – where we have been unable to contact or 
take a payment from a customer for some time, we plan to move 
such loans into a centralised collections function, one that pools the 
division’s expertise and ensures a consistent approach and to 
free-up capacity.
We are excited about the prospects for our Guarantor Loans Division 
and given our strong position in the market we remain confident of 
being able to meet our target of 20% annual loan book growth and 
a 20% return on assets.

IFRS 9
The International Accounting Standard Board’s introduction of a 
new accounting standard covering financial instruments became 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. 
This standard replaces IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement. 
The new standard requires that lenders (i) provide for the Expected 
Credit Loss (‘ECL’) from performing assets over the following year 
and (ii) provide for the ECL over the life of the asset where that asset 
has seen a significant deterioration in credit risk. As a result, whilst 
the underlying cash flows from the asset are unchanged, IFRS 9 will 
have the effect of bringing forward provisions into earlier accounting 
periods. This will result in a one-off adjustment to receivables, 
deferred tax and reserves on adoption and will result in delayed 
recognition of profits.
To assist analysts and investors and in order to provide some 
illustrative guidance on the potential impact on future reporting 
periods, set out below is an estimate of the impact on the closing 
balance sheet for 2017 and the potential impact on the full year 
income statement in 2017, assuming IFRS 9 had been adopted for  
the full accounting period ending 31 December 2017.

The adoption of IFRS 9 results in an unaudited reduction in 
receivables of £13.2m at 31 December 2017, which net of deferred 
tax, results in an unaudited reduction in net assets of £10.7m. Whilst 
the particularly strong loan book growth in home credit means that 
it experiences the largest adjustment to receivables, net assets and 
earnings, it is important to note that cash flow remains unchanged 
and IFRS 9 only changes the timing of profits made on a loan. 
There will be no change to the Group’s underwriting process and 
our scorecards will be unaffected by the change in accounting. 
The ultimate profitability of a loan is the same under both IAS 39 
and IFRS 9 and the cash flows and capital generation over the life 
of a loan remain unchanged. The calculation of the Group’s debt 
covenants are unaffected by IFRS 9, as they are based on 
accounting standards in place at the time they were set.
Principal risks 
Save for the addition of cyber risk, the principal risks facing the 
Group, together with the Group’s risk management process in 
relation to these risks, are unchanged from those reported in the 
Group’s Annual Report for the period ended 31 December 2016 
(which is available for download at http://www.nsfgroupplc.com). 
The principal risks are summarised on pages 36 to 38.

Culture and stakeholder management
A business with  
strong values
Our approach
Our approach to culture and stakeholder 
management has been forged by the 
significant experience of the Group’s Board 
of Directors and senior management team. 
They view such an approach as being 
essential for long-term success and as 
being wholly consistent with our strategy to 
be a leader in each of our chosen markets 
(see Strategy on pages 29 to 35).
Our business model (see pages 22 to 23)  
is centred around building a strong 
relationship with our customers, normally 
face-to-face, and this forms a key part of 
our overall lending process. ‘Providing a 
helping, but firm hand’ is an ethos that is 
common across each of our three business 
divisions and we believe that by sustaining 
the values and behaviours that support it, 
we will remain on-course to deliver our 
goal of 20% annual loan book growth and 
a return of 20% on assets in each of our 
operating businesses.
NSF is a relatively young  
company but has chosen  
to adopt a cultural approach  
that is more akin to that of  
a much larger, long- 
established business. 
The acquisitions of Everyday Loans 
(including TrustTwo), Loans at Home and 
George Banco were each made after 
extensive legal, financial and operational 
due diligence, a process that also provided 
valuable guidance on the cultural values 
and behaviours that were embedded 
within each organisation. As a result, the 
Board was comfortable that all three 
businesses were guided by similar 
principles of business ethics.
Identifying and developing our own culture 
has been conducted in the context of the 
FCA’s own guidance for regulated firms 
regarding the cultural approach that it 
expects them to adopt.
We define culture as the ‘way we do things 
around here’ and are determined that the 
actions of our leaders, staff, self-employed 
agents or anyone authorised to represent

Our cultural approach
NSF’s culture 
Before our IPO back in February 2015, we 
set ourselves a vision of becoming a 
leading participant in the UK’s non-
standard finance sector. Over the past 
three years we have made great progress 
towards achieving this goal. However, 
leadership is something that cannot just be 
attained and then left to drift. It must also 
be sustained, perhaps over many years, if it 
is to have any real meaning and, in 
corporate terms, real value. By fostering the 
right cultural values and overall business 
approach we plan to do both. As a 
business we wholeheartedly subscribe to 
Peter Drucker’s sentiment that “culture eats 
strategy for breakfast”.
FCA guidance on cultural approach:
• develop strong, clear leadership 
and controls; 
• identify key risks in their strategies, 
business models and cultures that 
may prevent the delivery of positive 
market and consumer outcomes; 
• identify appropriate steps to 
mitigate such risks through 
appropriate systems and controls, 
including appropriate ways of using 
whistleblowing intelligence; 
• align strategies, business models, 
systems and controls with core 
values that ensure positive outcomes 
(market and customer); 
• ensure employee behaviours fall 
within a prescribed risk appetite 
using appropriate incentives; 
• develop a culture that supports the 
long-term interests of the firm, its 
customers and the long-term 
integrity of the markets in which the 
firm operates; and 
• demonstrate that the principles of 
good conduct towards customers 
and markets are embedded 
throughout their business and that 
these are working to deliver such 
outcomes and market behaviour. 
Having completed an extensive cultural 
review of each of our three business 
divisions during 2017, we have identified 
several common ‘cultural values’ or ‘target 
behaviours’. Whilst there are some subtle 
differences between each division, it is 
clear that as a Group we share a common 
business approach, founded upon the 
following key values and behaviours:
• Doing the right thing: we recognise our 
collective responsibility for delivering 
great outcomes – not just for our 
customers but also taking into account 
the impact on other stakeholders. We 
don’t cut corners and always seek the 
path that is right before the path that  
is easy. 
• Integrity: we expect our people to 
respect colleagues and other key 
stakeholders and to do what we say we 
will do. 
• Shared purpose delivered through 
teamwork: we have clear strategic and 
operational goals and expect all of our 
people to understand and share in that 
vision. Our businesses are complex, 
combining many different elements to 
achieve our overall objectives. By 
working together we are likely to solve 
problems more effectively than trying to 
do things on our own. 
• Clear communication: we listen carefully 
to those dealing with customers; we are 
well-informed and believe it’s our duty to 
speak up when we disagree, or believe 
something is not right; we celebrate 
success and don’t blame others when 
something goes wrong, always learning 
from our mistakes. 
• Entrepreneurial leadership: we lead  
by example, using our initiative and  
not just waiting to be told what to do; 
knowledgeable and inquisitive, we  
are prepared to try new things so we  
can perform better and be the best  
we can be.  Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 52
However, we also recognise that certain 
aspects of our business represent potential 
‘hot spots’ due to the presence of potentially 
conflicting objectives. One example is 
incentives that might be at risk of promoting 
poor behaviour in order that certain 
performance targets are met and personal 
rewards achieved. Managing such conflict 
is part of the day-to-day activity within 
each of our business divisions. Whilst we 
don’t profess to get everything right all of 
the time, the systems and controls we have 
in place, together with a keen focus on 
promoting our culture and target 
behaviours, help to ensure we meet all of 
our regulatory obligations and remain on 
course to achieve our long-term strategic 
and financial objectives.
This approach guides the way in which we 
address the needs and desires of each of our 
key stakeholder groups including customers, 
employees and contractors, regulators, the 
communities where we work and those who 
have provided us with the requisite equity 
and debt funding to succeed.
Customers
Delivering great customer outcomes is an 
objective that is embodied within all of our 
policies and procedures, our training 
programmes, our incentive arrangements 
and the way we run our business. However, 
we also recognise that it is ‘deeds not 
words’ that count and so we regularly 
survey our customers to find out how we are 
performing. We also monitor and take very 
seriously all complaints we receive in order 
that we can learn from our mistakes and 
hopefully improve our service.
Employees and self-employed agents
As a people business, we are determined to 
continue to invest in our human capital and 
this lies at the heart of our business 
strategy. As well as a proper induction 
process, we also invest in extensive and 
tailored training modules for all new joiners 
so that they can make a contribution as 
soon as they start work. We also invest in 
training for existing staff and self-employed 
agents. Online training programmes 
provide us with a perfect audit trail for 
each participant, providing analysis on 
which modules have been completed and 
the achievement level attained.
Gender mix
The following table sets out the breakdown by gender of the Directors and senior 
managers of the Company as well as the total number of employees:
Male Female Total
Number of Company Directors 5 1 6
Number of senior managers (excluding Executive 
Directors), Directors of subsidiary businesses and 
heads of function 36 12 48
Total number of employees 406 345 751
Gender Pay
As part of this year’s Annual Report and 
Accounts, we are disclosing for the first time 
our gender pay gap in accordance with the 
UK Government regulations for gender pay 
gap reporting. Our overall mean and 
median gender pay and bonus gap based 
on a snapshot date of 5 April 2017 (hourly 
pay) and bonus paid in the 12 months to 
5 April 2017 is as follows: 
Pay and Bonus – difference between males 
and females
1
Mean Median
Hourly pay gap 26.6% 12.6%
Bonus pay gap 35.6% (2.6%)
Proportion of males and females receiving 
a bonus payment
Male:  71.6%
Female:  66.4%
Why do we have a gap?
The calculation behind the gender pay gap 
is not the same as equal pay. The 
underlying reason behind the gap is 
predominantly due to the structure of our 
workforce where there is a lower 
representation of women in senior 
leadership roles within our business 
(approximately 78% of men and 23% of 
women were in senior management roles 
as at the snapshot date). 
As can be seen in the quartile graphs on 
page 53, the gender mix shifts as we move 
towards the upper (higher pay) quartiles 
indicating that our mean gaps are 
significantly impacted by these imbalances. 
We recognise that female representation is 
lower in the upper quartiles and are 
committed to increasing the number of 
women in these bands. 
Culture and stakeholder management continued
We are confident that we do not have any 
processes or practices where people are 
being paid differently due to their gender. 
The gap in our mean figure relating to 
bonuses is due to the same reasons that we 
have an hourly gender pay gap: our senior 
workforce, which has a different bonus 
structure from the rest of the workforce, also 
has a greater proportion of male 
employees. The equality of our pay 
structure is reflected in our median pay and 
median bonus figures which is not distorted 
by very large or small pay and bonuses – 
this shows a much smaller gap between 
males and females.
How are we addressing the gap?
The Office for National Statistics’ 2016 
numbers
2
 put the mean salary gap at 34% 
for the financial services industry. Whilst we 
understand our gender profile is typical of 
many financial services companies across 
the UK, we are committed to addressing this 
through a series of actions as follows:
• improving our recruitment targeting to 
ensure a diverse range of applicants are 
considered;
• reviewing the structure of our workforce, 
listening to our employees and 
improving our policies around diversity;
• actively reviewing decisions around 
performance, pay and bonuses;
• supporting employees through flexible 
working and professional development;
• delivering tailored plans to promote 
gender diversity across the Group; and
• supporting female progression into 
senior roles. 
1 A positive percentage figure indicates that typically 
female employees have lower pay or bonuses than 
male employees.

Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 53
Strategic Report Overview
As well as providing competitive 
compensation arrangements for both staff 
and self-employed agents, we also 
introduced a Save As You Earn scheme for 
all Group employees in 2017. This scheme 
enables staff to buy shares in Non-
Standard Finance plc in a tax-efficient way 
and thereby participate in the future 
success of the Company.
Regulators
We maintain a regular dialogue with the 
FCA, both as part of the ongoing 
supervision process as well as at a more 
strategic level, through periodic face-to-
face meetings and by responding to 
relevant FCA consultations, policy 
documents and research. We also continue 
to keep the FCA fully-informed regarding 
the Group’s broader strategic plans.
Communities and charity
As the vast majority of our business is 
conducted face-to-face, we recognise the 
importance of becoming a valued member 
of the towns and cities where we have a 
presence. With over 750 staff, 1,000 
self-employed agents and over 168,000 
customers that we serve through a network 
of over 120 offices across the UK, we are 
deeply ingrained within the fabric of a 
number of local communities. Whilst the 
introduction of a pro bono scheme to 
enable our staff to give up some of their 
time during office hours for good causes 
was delayed due to other business 
priorities, the Group did implement a 
Group-wide charity policy in 2017, 
formalising a process by which we can 
provide financial support, not just in local 
communities but also nationwide. Whilst 
only in place for part of the year, the Group 
made total donations totalling £45,262 to a 
range of charities including National 
Debtline (run by The Money Advice Trust), 
Loan Smart, Great Ormond Street Hospital 
and Cancer Research.
Environment
Whilst we are a relatively small company 
compared with many others, and given the 
nature of our business, we do not believe 
that we have a material impact on the 
environment. However, we are growing fast 
and are keen to minimise any impact that 
our activities might have. Therefore, during 
2017 we began to capture and record data 
on CO2 production from car mileage as 
well as the volume of water and electricity 
used during the year across all three 
business divisions. As such, the table  
below represents a starting point against 
which we plan to measure our impact in 
future years:
Kg of CO 2 
produced KW hours used
M

used
2017 53,413 667,253 29,389

● Male 64% 
● Female 36%
Quartile 4
Gender mix by pay quartile (each containing just over 134 employees and quartile 1 being the lowest and quartile 4 
being the highest).
Whilst we acknowledge we have a gender pay gap, we’re clear on why it exists and are focused on the steps we 
need to take to close the gap. 
Providers of capital
The Company keeps shareholders, 
credit funds and lending banks 
informed of business developments via 
its Annual Report, full-year and half-
year results as well as periodic trading 
update announcements. All other 
price sensitive information is publicly 
disclosed via a regulatory news service. 
All these items of information are also 
available on the Company’s corporate 
website, www.nsfgroupplc.com. The 
website also contains other information 
about the Group and its business.
Throughout the year, the Group Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Officer, and 
Director of IR and Communications meet 
with equity and debt investors on request or 
via organised investor roadshows 
supported by the Company’s advisers, as 
well as by attending and presenting at 
industry and investor conferences. The 
Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors may also meet with investors,  
as required. Governance

Dear Shareholder,
Introduction
I am pleased to present our 2017 Corporate Governance report for the 
Company which incorporates reports from the Chairs of each of the 
Audit, Nomination, Risk and Remuneration Committees on pages 61 to 
82. The Board is committed to applying the highest standards of 
corporate governance and although the Company does not have a 
premium listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, the 
Board has chosen to seek to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’) where practical throughout the year to 31 December 
2017 . A copy of the Code is available from the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website: www.frc.org.uk. Where there is non-compliance with 
the Code, this is included in the Audit Committee report on page 61, the 
Nomination Committee report on page 63, the Risk Committee report on 
page 64, and the Directors’ remuneration report on page 65. For the 
Company’s shareholders, our primary aim is to deliver significant growth 
and as a Board we believe that the development of a strong governance 
framework is key to that achievement.
The Board is responsible for and committed to maintaining and 
developing such procedures as are required to ensure that good 
standards of corporate governance operate across all levels of the 
Group, including each of its operating subsidiaries.
2017 saw the completion of the Group’s third major acquisition, one that 
involved a substantial debt financing exercise. Having broadened the 
operational base substantially, the Board has extended its governance 
framework so as to ensure that the Group’s values and behaviours are 
reflected in each of its businesses and that these tie back to the Group’s 
business strategy and management incentives.
Highlights of the financial year
During 2017 , we completed the successful acquisition of George Banco, 
strengthening our position in the fast-growth guarantor loans market. 
Our home credit business, Loans at Home, also experienced significant 
growth in the year following a major restructuring at a large 
competitor. Everyday Loans opened 12 new branches as planned, 
taking the total to 53 branches as at 31 December 2017 .
We continued to engage with our investors through a comprehensive 
programme of investor relations including one-on-one meetings, 
conference calls, analyst visits and an investor day held in London in 
November 2017 , during which analysts and investors received an 
in-depth review from the senior management of all three business 
divisions. The investor day was well-attended and we received positive 
and encouraging feedback and will continue to hold investor days in 
the future.
The Group’s funding position was strengthened in August 2017 with the 
agreement of new funding arrangements, giving the Group clear 
committed funding of £260m until 2023.
We were delighted to welcome Niall Booker, who joined the Board on 
9 May 2017 and was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee. Niall 
brings a wealth of experience gained over many years in a number of 
senior executive positions in financial services firms both in the UK and 
internationally.
Over the course of the year, we maintained our commitment to continue 
to develop the Company’s corporate governance framework despite 
there being no requirement to comply with the Code. Having completed 
an initial Board evaluation in 2016, a wider evaluation was undertaken in 
2017 and included the Group Board as well as each of the subsidiary 
boards, so allowing an evaluation of the effectiveness of the developing 
Group structure. The results were reviewed and assessed by an 
independent third-party that made a number of recommendations, 
drawing upon the themes and actions identified in both the 2016 and 
2017 evaluations. Having reviewed the recommendations made, the 
Board has updated its list of actions aimed at improving the Group ’s 
governance structure. During the year, the Board approved and 
implemented a series of Group-wide policies and has also committed to 
embedding and then evaluating a governance framework for the Group 
as a whole during 2018.
Recognising the Company’s fast rate of growth and appetite for 
acquisitions, the Remuneration Committee is focused on ensuring that it 
has the capability to both retain and incentivise existing management, 
as well as attract additional and complementary talent that may be 
required to fulfil the Group’s long-term strategic objectives. During the 
course of 2017 , Long-Term Incentives (‘LTIs’) for key executives in each of 
the Group’s three divisions were approved. To enable Miles Cresswell-
Turner to participate in the Everyday Loans LTI and to incorporate some 
other small changes, we are proposing to adopt a new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy, details of which are set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report on pages 65 to 82 and which will be put to 
shareholders for approval at the 2018 AGM.
As well as investing in the development and implementation of 
appropriate and suitably testing executive remuneration schemes, we 
also approved and launched a ‘Save As You Earn’ (‘SAYE’) share scheme 
for all eligible employees across the Group. Having even a small stake in 
the ultimate parent of the firm where they work ensures that participating 
employees are able to benefit directly from any future success and are 
more likely to be engaged and focused on contributing to that future 
success. To reduce the impact of dilution for existing shareholders, the 
Board initiated a limited share buy-back programme during 2017 in order 
to satisfy any future obligations under the Group ’s SAYE and long-term 
incentive share plans. As at 22 March 2018, the Group had repurchased 
a total of 3,401,089 shares that are held in treasury.
In 2018 we plan to improve our governance principles and processes 
further by continuing to embed our governance frameworks and 
corporate policies and by monitoring our progress through the 
evaluation process outlined above. The deployment of a Group-wide 
risk management system during 2018 will also help to ensure 
consistency and transparency of the active risk management activity 
taking place across the Group. The Board will continue to ensure that 
governance processes are documented and implemented and, where 
appropriate, improved.

Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 57
The Board does not consider Charles Gregson to be independent as he 
is a holder of Founder Shares. More details on the Founder Shares are set 
out in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 65 to 82. The Board 
determines that Charles Gregson would be an independent Non-
Executive Director in the event that he did not hold Founder Shares.
The Board and its Committees are considered to have an appropriate 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. The Directors have a wide range of 
backgrounds and extensive knowledge of a variety of relevant sectors:
• Accountancy
• Banking/lending/finance
• Home credit
• Insurance
• Law
• Media
• Private equity
• Equity research
• Executive search
• Education
Specific key decisions have been reserved for the Board and these are 
outlined in the Board’s terms of reference, a copy of which is available 
on the Group’s corporate website: www.nsfgroupplc.com. However, 
certain responsibilities have been delegated to the Board’s four 
committees so to assist the effective operation of the Board and to 
ensure the right level of attention and consideration is given to all 
relevant matters.
The Company has four different committees as outlined below:
Board of  
Directors
Audit 
Committee
Nomination 
Committee
Remuneration 
Committee
Risk  
Committee
The composition and role of each committee is detailed in their 
respective reports that follow. The Audit Committee report is on page 
61, the Nomination Committee report is on page 63, the Risk Committee 
report is on page 64, and the Directors’ remuneration report is on page 
65. The terms of reference for each committee can be observed at the 
Company’s registered office address and also on the Company’s 
website: www.nsfgroupplc.com.
The Board
Statement of compliance with the Code
During the financial year ended 31 December 2017 , the Company  
has not complied with all of the provisions of the Code.
Following the appointment of Niall Booker to the Board as an 
independent Non-Executive Director, the Board now has two 
independent Non-Executive Directors and therefore meets the 
requirements of B1.2, B2.1 and C3.1. The Company did not meet 
requirement D.2.1 of the Code as the Chairman is also the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. However, the Board considered this provision 
to not be appropriate due to the size and nature of the Company. 
The Board has not appointed a Senior Independent Director, and 
therefore does not comply with provision A.4.1 of the Code. This 
provision is not considered to be appropriate due to the relatively  
small size of the Board. 
Board operation
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive roles are fulfilled by 
separate individuals and their roles are set out in writing and agreed 
by the Board. The Chairman, Charles Gregson, is responsible for the 
leadership of the Board and the day-to-day executive responsibility is 
undertaken by John van Kuffeler, the Group Chief Executive, assisted by 
the Group’s Board of Directors.
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the Company in 
relation to its strategy, operations and values and for establishing a 
sustainable capital structure for the Group alongside a strong 
corporate governance structure and practices that support an 
effective decision-making process.
The Board sets annual objectives as well as the overall strategic 
direction of the Company. These objectives are reviewed regularly at 
Board meetings and are implemented through the approval and 
regular assessment of the Company’s strategy and business plan. At 
each Board meeting the Board discusses the financial, operational, 
strategic and governance issues that affect the Group.
Board composition and structure
The Board comprised five Directors through the year until 9 May 2017 
when Niall Booker was appointed to the Board. For the rest of the 
financial year, the Board comprised six Directors, all of whom have 
served throughout the financial year, including:
• Non-Executive Chairman 
• Group Chief Executive 
• Two Executive Directors 
• Two independent Non-Executive Directors 
Independence
In accordance with section B.1.1 of the Code, the Board determines 
Heather McGregor and Niall Booker to be independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Board’s assessment is based on the fact that Heather 
McGregor and Niall Booker receive no additional benefits from the 
Group, have not previously held an executive role within the Group and 
have served less than nine years on the Board. The Board believes that 
there are no current or past matters which are likely to affect Heather 
McGregor’s or Niall Booker’s independent judgement and character. Governance

The Board is responsible for the overall system of internal controls and 
risk management for the Group and for reviewing their effectiveness on 
an annual basis. The Company’s internal controls are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in pursuit of the Group’s 
overall business objectives. The risk management framework is 
embedded within our management and governance processes and 
can be adjusted, if and when required, in response to a material 
change in circumstances.
The Board discharges or intends to discharge its duties in this area 
through:
• the review of financial performance including budgets, KPIs, 
forecasts and debt covenants on a monthly basis; 
• the receipt of regular reports which provide an assessment of key 
risks and controls and how effectively they are working; 
• scheduling annual Board reviews of strategy including reviews  
of the material risks and uncertainties facing the business; 
• the receipt of reports from senior management on the risk and 
control culture within the Group; 
• the presence of a clear organisational structure with defined 
hierarchy and clear delegation of authority; and 
• ensuring there are documented policies and procedures in place. 
Through the Risk Committee, the Board reviews the risk management 
framework, the key risks facing the business and how they have 
changed since the previous review (see pages 36 to 38). The Finance 
Department is responsible for preparing the Group financial 
statements and ensuring that accounting policies are in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards. All financial 
information published by the Group is subject to the approval of the 
Audit Committee. 
The Board, with advice from the Risk and Audit Committees, is satisfied 
that a system of internal controls and risk management is in place which 
enables the Company to identify, evaluate and manage key risks.
Directors
Each of the Directors is committed to their respective roles and has 
sufficient time to fulfil their duties and obligations to the Company.  
The Non-Executive Directors’ other significant commitments were 
disclosed to the Board before their appointment.
Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for the proper function of the Company’s 
Board of Directors that oversees the strategic direction of the Group.  
To ensure that the Board devotes its attention to the right matters, he 
sets the Board meeting agendas with the Company Secretary, and 
facilitates and encourages active engagement and appropriate 
challenge by all Directors.
Role of Executive Directors
The Executive Directors are responsible for all matters affecting the 
performance of the Group and for the implementation of strategy, 
policies, budgets and the financial performance of the Group. Their 
responsibility also includes the development and direction of the 
Group’s culture, recognising that a healthy corporate culture can both 
generate and sustain long-term shareholder value. Executive Directors 
provide specialist knowledge and experience to the Board and lead 
and manage the risk and finance functions across the Group.
Role of Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors are responsible for providing constructive 
challenge and help develop proposals put forward by the Executive 
Directors on strategy and other matters affecting the Group’s 
operational and financial performance. They provide an external focus 
to the Board’s discussions and continually review the performance of 
the Executive Directors and the wider senior management team.
The Board has adopted a procedure for the appointment of new 
Directors by appointing a Nomination Committee to lead the process 
of appointment and to make recommendations to the Board. Non-
Executive Directors have been appointed for fixed periods of three 
years, subject to confirmation by shareholders. Their letters of 
appointment may be inspected at the Company’s registered office or 
can be obtained on request from the Company Secretary.
The Board has not appointed a Senior Independent Director, as this 
provision is not considered to be appropriate due to the relatively small 
size of the Board and the fact that the Board only includes two 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are 
available to shareholders if they have any concerns, which contact 
through the normal channels of Chairman or the Executive Directors 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. The 
appointment of a Senior Independent Director was reviewed as part of 
the 2017 Board evaluation and will continue to be considered annually. 
Should the Board find it necessary an appointment will be made.
Company Secretary
The role of Company Secretary is fulfilled by Sarah Day, who was 
appointed by the Board to the role on 27 November 2017 (prior to this 
date Nick Teunon performed the role of Group Chief Financial Officer 
and Company Secretary). With many years’ experience in consumer 
finance and having held a similar position at the consumer credit 
division of a major competitor, she ensures that all Directors have full 
and timely access to all relevant information to ensure that the Board is 
able to make informed decisions. She is responsible for ensuring that 
correct Board procedures are followed and for advising on 
governance matters and ensuring that there is a good flow of 
information within the Board and its Committees and between senior 
management and the Non-Executive Directors. The Company 
Secretary supports the Chairman in setting the agenda for each Board 
meeting. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole.
Board diversity
The Company recognises the importance of diversity both at Board 
level and throughout the whole organisation. The Board remains 
committed to increasing diversity. Consequently, diversity is taken into 
account during each recruitment and appointment process and the 
Company is determined to attract outstanding candidates with diverse 
backgrounds, skills, ideas and culture.
In last year’s report we indicated our plans to participate in The Future 
Boards Scheme, an initiative launched by The 30% Club UK, the UK 
Government and Board Apprentice, giving senior women a unique 
opportunity to get board experience to progress their careers to the 
next level. The Group believes the scheme has the potential to grow 
the talent pipeline of women executives significantly by giving women 
12 months’ experience on one of the Group’s subsidiary boards. 
Following consideration and selection of an internal candidate, the 
Group will participate in the scheme in 2018.

Election and re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the 
Code, the Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election 
annually at the Annual General Meeting. Each Director will offer 
themselves for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting taking 
place at 11.00am on 14 May 2018.
Induction and professional development
The Company has a policy in place to ensure that all new Board 
appointments receive a full, formal induction tailored to the needs and 
experience of the new Director. They are also provided with 
opportunities to meet major shareholders.
Following the appointment of Niall Booker during 2017 , he took part in 
a formal induction programme, including visits to subsidiary Boards as 
well as first-hand experience of subsidiary operational activities. 
Adhering to the requirements of the Code, during 2017 the Chairman 
reviewed and agreed with each Director their training and 
development needs, taking into account their individual qualifications 
and experience. The Board Evaluation exercise carried out towards the 
end of 2017 also gathered information from Directors to help facilitate 
the planning of ongoing training and development needs for 2018. The 
Directors have full access to a regular supply of financial, operational, 
strategic and regulatory information to help them discharge their 
responsibilities and keep themselves fully informed of developments 
affecting the Company and each of its operating subsidiaries.
Independent advice
All Directors have access to independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense and the Board and its Committees are provided 
with sufficient resources to undertake their duties.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board’s full responsibilities are set out in the matters reserved for 
the Board and its powers and duties are set out in the Company’s 
Articles of Association and the relevant regulations applicable to the 
Company as a public listed company registered in England and Wales.
The Board is primarily responsible for:
• the overall leadership of the Group and setting core  
values and standards; 
• determining the strategic direction of the Group, including the 
approval of the Group’s strategic aims and objectives; 
• approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure budgets 
and any material changes to them; 
• oversight of the Group’s operations; 
• reviewing the Group’s performance in light of the Group’s strategic 
aims, objectives, business plans and budgets and ensuring that any 
necessary corrective action is taken; 
• approval of the Group’s annual and half-year results; 
• ensuring adequate succession planning for the Board and  
senior management; 
• determining the Company’s Remuneration Policy; 
• approving major capital projects, acquisitions and divestment; 
• promoting good governance and seeking to ensure that the 
Company meets its responsibilities towards all stakeholders; 
• approval of the Group’s risk management and control framework 
and the appointment/reappointment of the Group’s external auditor 
(following recommendations from the Audit Committee); 
• approval of internal regulations and policies; 
• the Group’s finance, banking and capital structure arrangements; 
• the Company’s dividend policy; and 
• shareholder circulars, convening of meetings and stock  
exchange announcements. 
In addition, the Board has adopted formal authorisation limits which 
set out the levels of authority for the Executive Directors and employees 
below Board level to follow when managing the Group’s business on a 
daily basis.

Board and committee meetings
All Directors are required to attend Board meetings as well as 
committee meetings for which they hold membership alongside an 
additional two-day, off-site strategy meeting to review and agree the 
Group’s three-year business and financial strategy.
The strategy meeting in 2017 was attended by the Directors (although 
Nick Teunon was unable to attend) and senior management (where 
appropriate). The agenda for the strategy day included:
• a facilitated discussion of the Group’s future financial and funding 
strategy; 
• a presentation and consideration of the business strategy of each of 
the Group’s three divisions; 
• review and discussion of the non-standard finance consumer 
market in which the Group operates; 
• the macroeconomic outlook for the UK and possible impact on the 
Group’s businesses; and 
• a presentation on the investor relations, public affairs and 
communications plans for the Group. 
All Directors receive Board papers and minutes for all the meetings, 
which are circulated approximately one week in advance of scheduled 
meetings. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary and 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, as and 
when required. A table reflecting the Directors’ attendance at Board 
meetings is shown below.
Conflicts of interests
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, 
or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Directors. The Companies Act 
2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association require the Board to 
consider any potential conflicts of interest. The Board considers and, if 
appropriate, authorises each Director’s reported actual and potential 
conflict of interest, taking into consideration what is in the best interests 
of the Company and whether the Director’s ability to act in accordance 
with his or her wider duties is, or may be affected. All potential conflicts 
approved by the Board are recorded in a Conflicts of Interest Register, 
which is reviewed by the Board at least quarterly to ensure that the 
procedure is working effectively.
Relations with shareholders
The Company keeps shareholders informed of all material business 
developments via its public disclosures including its Annual Report,  
its half-yearly financial statements and periodic trading update 
announcements. In addition, other price-sensitive information is 
disclosed via a regulatory news service. All these items are available 
from the Company’s corporate website: www.nsfgroupplc.com.  
The website also contains other information about the Group and  
its business.
The Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer ensure that the 
views of shareholders are communicated to the Board and that the 
Company’s governance and strategy are discussed with major 
shareholders. The Board aims to foster close relations with its investors 
and sell-side analysts through a regular and comprehensive 
programme of investor relations activity.
Throughout the year, the Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Chief 
Financial Officer and Director of Investor Relations and Communications 
meet with shareholders on request or via organised investor roadshows 
supported by the Group ’s brokers, as well as by attending and 
presenting at industry and investor conferences. During 2017 there were 
over 80 such meetings.
Annual General Meeting
Shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (‘AGM’), where Board members and the Board’s advisers are 
available to answer any shareholder questions. The 2018 Annual 
General Meeting of the Company is to be held at the offices of The 
Maitland Consultancy, 13 King’s Boulevard, London, N1C 4BU at 11.00 
am on 14 May 2018. The Notice of Meeting, contained in a separate 
letter from the Chairman, includes a commentary on the business to be

Audit Committee report
for the year ended 31 December 2017
Membership
Following the appointment of Niall Booker as a Non-Executive Director 
in May 2017 , he was appointed as Chair of the Audit Committee. The 
Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’) now comprises three Non-Executive 
Directors, two of whom are independent. The provisions of the Code 
(C3.1) require that the Audit Committee for smaller companies 
comprises two independent Non-Executive Directors. Prior to the 
appointment of Niall Booker, the Company did not meet the 
requirements of the Code in this regard. 
The names of the Directors and their biographical details are set out on 
pages 54 to 55.
Role and responsibilities
The key objective of the Committee is to provide assurance to the Board 
as to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the 
integrity of its financial records and externally published results. In doing 
so, the Committee operates within its terms of reference that are also 
available on the Group ’s corporate website: www.nsfgroupplc.com. 
The primary functions of the Committee include:
• monitoring the integrity of the financial statements, including the 
annual and half-yearly reports of the Group and any other formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s financial performance 
and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained 
in them before these are submitted to the Board for final approval; 
• making recommendations to the Board concerning any proposed, 
new or amendment to an existing accounting policy; 
• advising the Board on whether the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable; 
• meeting with the external auditor at the reporting stage to discuss 
the audit, including any problems and/or reservations arising from 
the audit and any matters that the auditor may wish to discuss (in 
the absence of NSF management, where appropriate); 
• reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit review function and internal financial controls; 
• ensuring appropriate co-ordination between the internal audit 
function and the external auditor; 
• reviewing: (i) the adequacy and security of the Company’s 
arrangements for its employees and contractors to raise concerns 
about possible wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters; 
(ii) the Company’s procedures for detecting fraud; and (iii) the 
Company’s systems and controls for the prevention of bribery; 
• making recommendations to the Board in relation to the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of the Company’s 
external auditor, providing recommendations on their remuneration 
and approving the terms of engagement of the external auditor; 
• overseeing the relationship with the external auditor and assessing 
the external auditor’s independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process; and 
• developing and implementing policy on the engagement of the 
external auditor to supply non-audit services. 
Meetings and attendance
The Committee met on eight occasions during the year.
Attendance and total number of meetings 
that the Director was entitled to attend
Charles Gregson (Chairman until 
9 May 2017) 8/8
Heather McGregor 7/8
Niall Booker (appointed 9 May 2017 
when he became Chairman) 4/4
The Directors above met on two occasions for a discussion with the external 
auditor without executive management present.
Committee meetings are attended by both the Chief Financial Officer 
and the Company Secretary. The external auditor is invited to attend 
meetings of the Committee and other non-members are sometimes 
invited to attend all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate 
and necessary.
Significant issues and areas of judgement considered by the 
Committee
Throughout 2017 the Committee determined that the following areas of 
the financial statements were of significant interest.
1. Impairment of goodwill
Management performed a goodwill impairment assessment as at 
30 June 2017 and 31 December 2017 by determining the recoverable 
amount, based on a fair value less costs-to-sell of each of the cash 
generating units, and comparing these to the respective net asset values 
and carrying values of goodwill. The Committee challenged the 
appropriateness of management’s key assumptions and was satisfied 
with the conclusion that no impairment of goodwill was required. Further 
detail in respect of management judgements and estimates, along with 
the respective sensitivity of the headroom to those judgements and 
estimates is set out in notes 2 and 13 to the financial statements.
2. Impairment of customer receivables
The assessment of provisions for impairment losses against customer 
receivables requires management to make significant judgements. The 
Committee regularly challenges the appropriateness of management’s 
judgements and assumptions underlying the impairment provision 
calculations and concluded that the provisions held against the loan 
book are reasonable. Further detail in respect of the assumptions is set 
out in note 2 to the financial statements.
3. IFRS 9
During the course of the year, the Committee has reviewed and 
challenged the appropriateness of key assumptions made by 
management with regard to the interpretation and implementation of 
a new accounting standard, IFRS 9. The Committee was satisfied that 
the requirements of IFRS 9 have been appropriately implemented and 
that the transitional impact on the financial statements has been 
correctly outlined in note 1 to the financial statements.
4. Refinancing of the Group’s existing bank facilities 
To finance the acquisition of George Banco as well as to provide 
additional funding to support future growth, NSF announced that it 
had secured a new £175m term loan facility (the ‘Term Loan’), provided 
by a group of institutional investors, led by Alcentra Limited. The new 
six-year loan bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 725 basis points per 
year with interest payable every six months. The same investors also 
agreed to provide an additional committed facility of up to £50m  
under the same terms as the Term Loan. In addition, the Group also 
secured a new £35m revolving credit facility provided by Royal Bank of 
Scotland at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points per year. The 
Committee challenged management on the new arrangements and 
received advice from Lazard & Co. Limited regarding their suitability for 
the Group.
5. Acquisition accounting and intangibles
On 17 August 2017 , Everyday Loans Limited completed the acquisition  
of George Banco. IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires assets and 
liabilities acquired to be recognised initially at their fair values. 
Intangible assets must also be recognised at fair value if they are 
separable or arise from other contractual rights. The Committee 
challenged management’s identification and valuation of assets on 
acquisition and found the methodology used to be appropriate. 
Further detail in respect of management judgements and assumptions 
is set out in notes 2, 13, 14 and 24 to the financial statements. Governance
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 62
6. Review of the half-year results:
• Review of impairment of goodwill, intangibles and customer 
receivables valuation; 
• Review of acquisition accounting; 
• Review of half-year results; 
• Review and approval of the going concern paper which confirmed 
it was appropriate to prepare the half-year results for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 on a going concern basis; 
• Review of the report on the interim review from the external auditor; 
• Review of the half-year results announcement; and 
• Discussion with the external auditor without any Executive Director 
or employee being present. 
7 . Review of the Annual Report and financial statements:
• Review of impairment of goodwill, intangibles and customer 
receivables valuation carried out by management; 
• Review of the calculation of goodwill and intangibles assets on the 
acquisition of the Everyday Loans Group; 
• Review and approval of the going concern paper which confirmed 
it was appropriate to prepare the Annual Report and financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 on a going 
concern basis; 
• Review of full-year results and the form and content of the draft 
Annual Report and financial statements; 
• Discussion with the external auditor without any Executive Director 
or employee being present; 
• Review of the preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2016; 
and 
• Review of the statement on internal controls. 
8. Internal audit function
The internal audit function, which is provided by a third-party, regularly 
reports on internal audit activities to the Committee. A review of the 
internal audit activity is approved by the Committee. The internal audit 
activities encompass all divisions within the Group and therefore 
provide a consistent and balanced overview of the Group to the 
Committee. The Committee met with management separately to give 
management the opportunity to raise issues with the internal audit 
function directly to the Committee.
9. Non-financial audit fees paid to the external auditor for the year
A review of the non-financial audit fees is undertaken by the Committee 
and an analysis of the non-audit fees paid to the external auditor for 
the provision of non-audit services is provided on page 104 of the 
Annual Report.
These issues were discussed with management and the external 
auditor to ensure that the required level of disclosure is provided and 
that the appropriate level of rigour has been applied where any 
judgement may be exercised.
External audit
The Company’s auditor is Deloitte LLP , who have been in office since 
22 October 2014.
As noted above, the Committee is responsible for assessing the efficacy 
of the external auditor, for monitoring the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor, for considering the reappointment of 
the external auditor and for making recommendations to the Board.
The Committee also reviews the performance of the auditor taking into 
consideration the services and advice provided to the Company and 
the fees charged for these services. Details of the auditor’s total fees for 
the year can be found on page 104.
On the basis of the auditor’s performance, the Committee considers 
Deloitte’s selection to be in the best interests of the Company and has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte should be proposed for 
reappointment at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Committee has considered the independence of Deloitte and the 
level of non-audit fees and believes that the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditor are safeguarded and remain strong. 
The Committee will continue to review the qualification, expertise, 
resources and independence of the external auditor and the 
effectiveness of the audit process during the current financial year.
Non-audit work
The Committee monitors the level of non-audit work carried out by the 
external auditor and seeks assurances from the auditor that it 
maintains suitable policies and processes ensuring independence, and 
monitors compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements on an 
annual basis.
During 2017 the level of non-audit fees amounted to £192,000 (2016: 
£44,000). The non-audit work carried out during the year related to 
due diligence (2016: tax and VAT). The fees paid to the external auditor 
are set out in note 4 on page 104. The fees for non-audit work carried 
out by the auditor in 2017 represents 42% (2016: 13%) of audit fees.
During 2017 the Company had a formal non-audit work policy in place. 
In line with the non-audit policy, the Committee has challenged the 
appointment of the external auditor for non-audit work during the 
period and expects it to demonstrate clearly its independence on an 
ongoing basis through its work and at Committee meetings.
Internal audit
The Committee appointed KPMG, one of the UK’s leading accounting 
firms as Internal Auditor to the Group during 2016. The Internal Auditor 
reports directly to the Risk Committee which ensures the independence 
and effectiveness of the Internal Auditor.
The Internal Auditor provides regular reports to the Audit Committee as 
well as the Risk Committee and to the Board as a whole.

Nomination Committee report
for the year ended 31 December 2017
The principal purpose of the Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
is to monitor the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity 
on the Board and recommend any changes to the composition of the 
Board. This report gives more detailed information on how the 
Committee performed its duties.
Membership
The provisions of the Code require that the Nomination Committee 
comprises of independent Non-Executive Directors only. Following his 
appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 9 May 2017 , Niall Booker 
became a member of the Nomination Committee from that date. As 
only two Directors are considered to be independent, the Company did 
not meet the requirements of the Code in this regard. However, given 
the make-up of the Group and its current stage of development, the 
Board considers that despite not meeting this requirement, the 
Nomination Committee can fulfil its role effectively in its current form.

The Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary attended all 
Nomination Committee meetings.
The biographies of the members are set out on page 55.
Role and responsibilities
The Nomination Committee assists the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities relating to the composition and make-up of the Board 
and any other committees of the Board. To fulfil that role, the 
Committee’s primary functions include:
• following an evaluation of the balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Board, identifying and 
nominating candidates who are assessed as having such skills and/
or experience, as well as sufficient time to devote to their 
responsibilities to fill Board vacancies and making appropriate 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors; 
• reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
making recommendations to the Board with regard to any 
proposed changes; 
• reviewing and considering the performance and effectiveness of 
the Committee through the results of the Board evaluation process; 
and 
• considering and formulating succession planning for Directors and 
senior executives. 
Principal activities of the Committee during 2017:
• Reviewing the composition of the Board and the balance of 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors; and
• Reviewing the succession plans for the Board and the senior 
management within the Group.
Diversity
The Company and each of its operating companies seek to engage, 
train and promote employees on the basis of their capabilities, 
qualifications and experience. Discrimination or pressure to 
discriminate by any of the Group’s employees, contractors or customers 
in respect of age, sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnic origin, marital 
status or civil partnership, nationality, disabilities, political or religious 
beliefs is strictly forbidden. The Group seeks to pursue diversity, 
including gender diversity, throughout the business, and while the 
Board endorses the aspirations of the Davies Review on Women on 
Boards, the Board is not committing to any specific targets. Our Board 
currently has one female Director and the Committee will give due 
consideration to Board balance and diversity when recommending 
new appointments to the Board. The Board will also ensure that its own 
development in this area is consistent with its strategic objectives and 
enhances its overall effectiveness. 
Board induction
All Directors are required to undertake a formal and rigorous induction 
to the Group upon joining the Board. Niall Booker joined the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director on 9 May 2017 and underwent a thorough 
induction process following his appointment, including visits to 
subsidiary Boards as well as first-hand experience of subsidiary 
operational activities.
Board evaluation
During the year the Board completed an evaluation process of its 
effectiveness. The results of the evaluation were reviewed by the 
Committee and the list of planned actions has been updated and will 
be actioned over the coming year.
Areas of focus in 2018
The main area of focus for the Committee in 2018 is to conduct a further

Risk Committee report
for the year ended 31 December 2017
The principal purpose of the Risk Committee (the ‘Committee’) is to 
assist the Board in its oversight of risk within the Company, with 
particular focus on risk appetite, risk profile and the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk management systems.
Membership and attendance
The Committee consists of the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. 
Following his appointment as a Non-Executive Director on 9 May 2017 , 
Niall Booker became a member of the Risk Committee from that date. 
Both the Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary attended all 
Committee meetings. Other relevant parties are also invited to attend 
Committee meetings, as appropriate.
The Directors’ attendance at the meetings during 2017 is recorded in 
the table below:

Cross-membership between each of the Board’s committees ensures 
that all material risks and related issues are appropriately identified, 
communicated and taken into account in the decisions of each 
committee and that of the Board. The Committee met five times during 
the year. In addition, the Committee Chair attended meetings with 
both the Executive Directors and management at Everyday Loans and 
Loans at Home. 
Role and responsibilities
The Board has delegated the oversight of risk management to the 
Committee, although it retains overall accountability for the Company’s 
risk profile.
The Committee’s primary functions include:
• the assessment of material risks and the Company’s overall risk 
management framework. The Committee takes account of the 
current and prospective macroeconomic, financial and regulatory 
environment in order to advise the Board in respect of the most 
appropriate configuration of the Company’s overall risk appetite, 
tolerance and strategy. In doing so, the Committee considers the 
Company’s ability to identify and manage new risk types, reviews 
any material breaches of risk limits and reviews the effectiveness of 
the Company’s internal controls and risk management systems; 
• responsibility for overseeing and challenging stress and scenario 
testing, the provision of advice in relation to risk and for the 
formulation of the Company’s risk policies; and 
• working closely with the Audit Committee in order to review the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal 
control systems. 
Principal activities of the Committee during 2017
The Committee performed a comprehensive review of the Company’s 
risk management and internal control systems, including all material, 
financial, operational and compliance controls, identifying the key risks 
affecting the Company. These are set out on pages 36 to 38.
A key theme for the Committee has been to ensure that appropriate risk 
management strategies are monitored and implemented effectively. 
The Committee worked on the development of the Company’s risk 
management capabilities by creating an effective enterprise risk 
management framework and by undertaking regular and detailed 
analysis of the key risks faced by the business.
During the year to 31 December 2017 the Committee focused on the 
following matters:
• a detailed review of the lending and collections process was 
carried out by the Internal Auditor with the findings reported to the 
Committee; 
• a review of liquidity and credit risk; 
• the identification of Group risks with action plans put in place to 
mitigate such risks; 
• a review of the risk appetite status across the Group; and 
• a review of cyber security across the Group. 
Viability statement
In accordance with the 2014 FRC Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
for the next three years. The Directors’ assessment has been made with 
reference to the Group’s current position, strategy, as laid out in the 
Strategic Report (see pages 6 to 53) and the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties and how these are managed (see pages 36 to 38). In 
particular, noting the ability of the Group to reduce lending at the point 
of peak seasonal demand and the Company’s intention to raise 
additional debt funding to support its longer-term lending ambitions.
The Group’s strategy and principal risks underpin the Group’s three-
year plan and scenario testing, which the Directors review at least 
biannually. The review of the three-year plan is strengthened by 
regular updates from the divisional management teams.
The three-year plan is built on a divisional basis using a bottom-up 
approach. The plan makes certain assumptions about future economic 
conditions, the regulatory environment, divisional performance and 
growth and the ability to refinance existing debt facilities as they fall 
due. This plan is then stress-tested considering downside scenarios. 
These scenarios consider financial and regulatory downsides. The 
financial downside scenario uses the 2008/09 financial crisis as its 
basis and therefore reflects a number of principal risks of the business. 
The regulatory downside scenario is based on fundamental changes in 
the business model as a result of regulatory change.
Following the assessment, the Directors also considered it appropriate 
to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, as set 
out on page 85.
Areas of focus in 2018
The Committee intends to continue to improve and embed the 
Company’s risk management framework during 2018. Key tasks include:
• further review and enhancement of the Group risk management 
framework; 
• review of liquidity and credit risks; and 
• further development of the Group’s risk register.

Part A: Annual Statement
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you our Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
Non-Standard Finance plc (‘NSF’). The Group has delivered strong 
loan book growth in each of its three businesses whilst maintaining a 
tight control on impairment.
In May 2017 , Miles Cresswell-Turner took on the role of acting Chief 
Executive of the Everyday Loans Group (‘ELG’) following the departure 
of Danny Malone. Some of Mr Cresswell-Turner’s responsibilities as 
Chief Operating Officer and head of M&A were transferred to the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer in order to allow him to focus on 
ELG while remaining an Executive Director of NSF . On 12 September 
2017 , Mr Cresswell-Turner was appointed as the permanent Chief 
Executive of ELG.
In light of Mr Cresswell-Turner’s new role and the additional 
responsibilities now carried out by the CEO and CFO, changes have 
been made to their remuneration, specifically their base salary. In 
addition, it is proposed that Mr Cresswell-Turner should participate in 
the ELG Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘ELG LTI’). As Mr Cresswell-Turner 
also participates in the NSF Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘NSF LTI’), which 
rewards participants based on the growth of the whole Group, the 
total payment made to Mr Cresswell-Turner at vesting in December 
2020 under the two plans, which will be in the form of shares in NSF , 
will be limited to the greater of the payment calculated under the NSF 
LTI and the payment calculated under the ELG LTI. In other words, the 
ELG LTI will underpin Mr Cresswell-Turner’s award under the NSF LTI. 
Our new Directors’ Remuneration Policy
As noted above, it is proposed that Mr Cresswell-Turner will participate 
in the ELG LTI. As this participation was not included in the 
Remuneration Policy approved at the 2017 AGM, we are proposing a 
revised Remuneration Policy at the 2018 AGM. 
The terms of the new Remuneration Policy will be exactly the same as 
the current policy that was approved at the 2017 AGM apart from (i) the 
inclusion of Mr Cresswell-Turner in the ELG LTI; and (ii) a minor change 
in respect of our Non-Executive Directors, the details of which are  
given below. 
Under the ELG LTI adopted in March 2017 , participants share in a pool 
of 5% of the growth in ELG’s equity value above a hurdle of £267m. The 
hurdle is based on a base equity value of ELG at 1 January 2016 with a 
compound growth of 12% per annum to 31 December 2019. The value 
of the pool is subject to a cap of £6m. The structure of the award is a 
nil-cost option over NSF shares.
It is proposed that Mr Cresswell-Turner will receive an allocation of 15% 
of the pool, which will result in a 0.75% share of the growth in equity 
value of ELG above £267m at 31 December 2019, subject to a cap of 
£900,000. Mr Cresswell-Turner’s award will also be in the form of a 
nil-cost option over shares in NSF .
Performance will be measured against the hurdle at 31 December 2019, 
though the right to exercise the nil-cost option will be deferred until 
31 December 2020. Mr Cresswell-Turner will then be required to hold 
any shares acquired on the exercise of the nil-cost option for a period 
of one year, i.e. to the end of December 2021.
Awards under the NSF LTI vest on 31 December 2020 and participants 
are then required to hold their shares for a period of one year, i.e. to the 
end of December 2021. As Mr Cresswell-Turner holds an award under 
the NSF LTI, which was made during 2017 , the total value of the shares 
that may vest to Mr Cresswell-Turner under the ELG LTI and the NSF LTI 
at the end of December 2020 will be restricted to the greater of the 
value of the shares that can potentially vest under the NSF LTI and the 
value of the shares that can potentially vest under the ELG LTI. This is to 
prevent any element of double counting as the NSF LTI is based on the 
increase in the value of the NSF Group as a whole, including the value 
of ELG. If Mr Cresswell-Turner were to cease employment on or before 
31 December 2019, his award will either lapse or be restricted in value 
depending on the reason for his employment ceasing. The Committee 
will have an overriding discretion to limit the amount payable under the 
awards or claw back awards that have been made if it considers that 
the ELG results have been achieved in an inappropriate manner.
We consider it appropriate for Mr Cresswell-Turner in his role as Chief 
Executive of ELG to participate in the ELG LTI along with the other senior 
management of ELG with appropriate restrictions on his award to reflect his 
participation in the NSF L TI. Shareholder approval for the revised Policy will 
be sought at the AGM to be held at 11.00 am on Monday 14th May 2018. 
We have also taken this opportunity of revising the Policy to include 
within the Policy the ability to deliver Non-Executive Directors’ fees in 
NSF shares and the provision of reasonable travel and subsistence 
expenses to the Non-Executive Directors in respect of their duties. 
Business context and Committee decisions on remuneration
As described in the 2017 Financial Review and Divisional Overview on 
pages 39 to 49, the Group delivered against a number of operational 
and financial objectives including annual loan book growth of more 
than 20% in all three business divisions. The fact that this growth was 
achieved whilst maintaining a tight control on impairment was 
particularly encouraging and reflects the strength and skill of the senior 
management team, as well as the effectiveness of the Group’s risk 
management framework. The significant investment made in 
supporting infrastructure during 2017 not only de-risked the 
achievement of strong loan book growth in 2017 , it has also 
underpinned the Group’s current and future growth plans. Governance

Directors’ remuneration report continued
This significant investment in 2017 , as well as in 2016, has resulted in 
sustained growth for the Group. This is demonstrated in the chart 
below showing the Total Shareholder Return performance of the 
Group against the FTSE All Share Index – Financial Services from 
1 January 2017 . We consider this Index to be the most appropriate 
broad-based equity market for the Group to compare itself. 
The business has developed rapidly since it was incorporated as a 
small start-up cash shell and especially in 2017 . It is now at a key point 
where it can start to maximise the benefit of the acquisitions it has 
made and seek further opportunities by building upon the firm 
foundations it has established and drawing upon the Group’s 
considerable experience and reputation. While we continue to 
maintain a policy of minimising fixed costs, the size and complexity of 
the business has meant a substantial change and increase in 
responsibility of the Executive Directors. We therefore feel we need to 
reposition the Directors’ base salaries to ensure that these remain 
competitive and fairly reflect their contribution to this larger and more 
complex business as well as the additional responsibilities that they 
have each taken on as a result of Miles Cresswell-Turner becoming 
Chief Executive of ELG. This repositioning involves the increase of the 
base salary of John van Kuffeler to £325,000, Nick Teunon to £280,000 
and Miles Cresswell-Turner to £280,000. 
During the year, the Committee considered carefully Mr Cresswell-
Turner’s responsibilities as acting and now permanent Chief Executive 
of ELG. Having taken advice, we concluded that his salary should be 
increased by £50,000 from £230,000 to £280,000 in September 2017 to 
reflect his new position. In addition, a further £50,000 was paid to 
Mr Cresswell-Turner in respect of the period from May to September 
2017 when he took on additional responsibilities as acting Chief 
Executive of ELG, following the departure of Danny Malone, without at 
the same time reducing his NSF responsibilities. The increases to the 
base salary for the CEO and CFO were effective from 1 January 2018.
We have conducted benchmarking against a comparator group of 
companies in the same industry and of similar size and despite the 
increase in salaries, the Executive Directors’ remuneration continues to 
fall within the lower quartile of these comparator companies.
Turning to bonuses for 2017 , the Executive Directors had a maximum 
annual bonus opportunity of 100% of salary. For each Executive 
Director, the 2017 annual bonus determination was based on the 
achievement of financial and non-financial targets. 
The financial target, which equated to 70% of the maximum potential 
bonus, was £20.1m based on the profit of the Group before fair value 
adjustments, amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items 
(including temporary additional commission and other expansion 
related costs at Loans at Home) and tax. The actual profit on this basis 
was £18.5m, being 92% of target and above the 90% threshold for 
payment of the minimum 25% of the financial element of the bonus. 
The next 50% of the financial element accrued on a straight-line basis 
between 90% and 100% of target. Therefore, the financial element of 
the bonus vested at 35% of the maximum financial element of 70% i.e. 
24.5% of maximum bonus. 
The non-financial target was based on five key component targets 
equating to 30% of maximum potential bonus. These components were 
that: (i) and (ii) for each of the trading entities within the Group, positive 
reports from KPMG, the Group’s outsourced internal audit provider, on 
lending practices (including affordability assessment and policies for 
dealing with vulnerable customers) and collection practices (including 
forbearance and policies for dealing with vulnerable customers); (iii) a 
minimum cash/undrawn headroom being achieved of £5m at 
31 December 2017 with a dividend payment policy of 50% of post-tax 
profit before fair value adjustments, amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and exceptional items; (iv) full FCA authorisation being 
granted to Loans at Home not later than 31 December 2017; and (v) no 
material breaches of the Company’s Risk Appetite Policy. I am pleased 
to say that 87% of the non-financial targets vested i.e. 26% of maximum 
bonus, reflecting the importance the Executive Directors place on 
ensuring that the Group conducts its business in a compliant and 
responsible manner. 
The Remuneration Committee has therefore determined that the bonus 
vested at 50.5%, giving rise to bonuses awarded to the Executive 
Directors of £145,190 for John van Kuffeler, £116,150 for Nick Teunon and 
£123,800 for Miles Cresswell-Turner (50.5% of maximum applied to his 
base salary of £245,000 for 2017 but not to the additional salary of 
£50,000 paid in respect of his additional responsibilities when he was 
acting Chief Executive of ELG). The 2017 bonuses will be paid in cash. 
No part of the bonus will be subject to deferral.  Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 67
The Committee has determined that Mr Cresswell-Turner’s maximum 
bonus potential for 2018 will remain at 100% of salary but the 
performance measures should include financial and non-financial 
targets in relation to ELG.
Awards to Executive Directors were made during the year under the 
NSF LTI. Awards were also made during the year under the ELG LTI for 
key employees of ELG. A similar long-term incentive plan has been 
introduced, and awards made, at Loans at Home (‘LAH’) so that key 
employees can participate in the growth in value of LAH. 
Awards were also made, including to Executive Directors, under the 
all-employee Sharesave Plan (‘SAYE’).
Finally, in respect of the fees for the Non-Executive Directors, these are 
unchanged apart from those of the Chairman. The Board, without the 
Chairman present, decided that a repositioning was required to the 
fees paid to the Chairman in order to keep them competitive and to 
fairly reflect the increased scale and complexity of the Group, as well 
as to ensure an appropriate balance given the relative positioning of 
the fees paid to the other Non-Executive Directors. The Board, without 
the Chairman present, concluded that the Chairman’s fees should be 
increased to £125,000 with effect from 1 January 2018.

Ahead of the detailed Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the Annual Report on Remuneration, we have below summarised how key elements of 
the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for 2018 and the key decisions taken by the Committee in relation to base pay and incentives for the 
Executives in respect of 2017 .

Operation for 2018 • Performance measures are weighted as to 70% financial (profit before tax) and 30% non-financial (including 
conduct-based measures which seek to reward the delivery of good customer outcomes through appropriate 
affordability assessments and appropriate treatment of vulnerable customers together with appropriate 
collections, arrears and forbearance practices). 
• Threshold vesting will be set at 90% of target with on-target vesting at 100% and maximum vesting at 110%, with 
vesting on a sliding scale between these points.
• As Miles Cresswell-Turner is Chief Executive of ELG, one-third of his performance measures will be based on Group 
targets and two-thirds will be based on performance measures for ELG. The measures relating to ELG will carry 
the same weighting as for the Group measures, i.e. 70% on the financial performance of ELG and 30% on 
non-financial targets for ELG. 
• Bonus is payable in cash following the end of the financial year.
Malus and clawback Malus and clawback provisions will apply under the annual bonus at the discretion of the Committee in appropriate 
circumstances, such as a participant’s material underperformance, material misstatement of the accounts, gross 
misconduct and fraud, regulatory and similar failures or such other reason as determined by the Committee.

Operation for 2018 • Miles Cresswell-Turner will receive an award in the form of a nil-cost option, which he will hold during the 
performance period ending on 31 December 2019. Restrictions on the award will apply during the performance 
period and the ability to exercise the option will be deferred for a period of one year after the end of the 
performance period. There will then be a holding period of one year for the NSF shares acquired.
• The value total attributable to the award will be 0.75% of the growth in equity value (market capitalisation) of ELG 
above £267m, subject to a cap of £900,000, measured at the end of the performance period. 
• At the end of the performance period, participants’ awards will vest and the number of NSF shares available to 
be acquired under the option will be determined. However, the ability to exercise the option will be deferred for a 
year. Mr Cresswell-Turner must hold any NSF shares acquired for a further one year before being able to sell them.
Malus and clawback Malus and clawback provisions will apply under the ELG LTI at the discretion of the Committee in appropriate

Part C: Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the report contains details of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy that will govern the Company’s future remuneration payments. The 
Policy is intended to apply for three years from the approval of the Policy. The Policy described in this part is subject to approval by shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM on 14 May 2018. The Policy will be displayed on the Company’s website, in the Investors section, immediately after the 2018 AGM.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy contains two changes from the Policy that was approved at the 2017 AGM. These changes are to allow one of 
the Executive Directors to become eligible to receive an award under the ELG LTI and for Non-Executive Directors, the ability to receive fees in the 
form of NSF shares and the provision of travel and subsistence expenses.
The Committee has established the Policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman. The Board has established the Policy 
on the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors.
1. Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Remuneration strategy
The Company’s remuneration strategy is to provide a remuneration framework based on the following principles:
1 2 3 4 5
Attract, motivate and 
retain Executive and 
senior management in 
order to deliver the 
Company’s strategic  
goals and business 
outputs
Encourage and support a 
culture that delivers good 
customer outcomes and 
which adheres to FCA 
best practice
Reward delivery of the 
Company’s business plan 
and key strategic goals
Adhere to the principles  
of good corporate 
governance and 
appropriate risk 
management
Align employees’ interests 
with the interests of 
shareholders and other 
external stakeholders and 
encourage widespread 
equity ownership across 
the Group
We believe that the current and proposed remuneration structure will continue to support and motivate our Executive Directors in furthering the 
Company’s long-term strategic objectives including the creation of sustainable shareholder returns.
Furthermore, the Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivise 
undue risk-taking or reward underperformance. The table below sets out the key elements of the Policy for Executive Directors:
Remuneration Policy table
Element, purpose and 
link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures and assessment
Base salary
To provide 
competitive fixed 
remuneration that will 
attract and retain key 
employees and reflect 
their experience and 
position in the Group.
Salaries are reviewed annually, and 
any changes normally take effect from 
1 January. When determining the 
salary of the Executives the Committee 
takes into consideration: 
• the levels of base salary for similar 
positions with comparable status, 
responsibility and skills, in 
organisations of broadly similar 
size and complexity;
• the performance of the individual 
Executive Director; 
• the individual Executive Director’s 
experience and responsibilities; 
• pay and conditions throughout the 
Group, including the level of salary 
increases awarded to other 
employees; and
• the level of incentive compensation 
provided to the Executives under 
the annual bonus.
Annual percentage increases are 
generally consistent with the range 
awarded across the Group.
Percentage increases in salary 
above this level may be made in 
certain circumstances, such as a 
change in responsibility or a 
significant increase in the role’s scale 
or the Group’s size and complexity. 
The salaries payable to the 
Executive Directors from 1 January 
2018 are disclosed on page 78.
A broad assessment of individual and 
business performance is used as part 
of the salary review.
No recovery provisions apply. Governance

Benefits
To provide 
competitive benefits 
and to attract and 
retain high-calibre 
employees.
Reviewed periodically to ensure 
benefits remain market competitive.
Benefits currently include:
• Company car for John van Kuffeler.
• Life, private medical and income 
protection insurance.
• Other minor benefits as provided 
from time to time.
Benefit values vary year-on-year 
depending on premiums and the 
maximum potential value is the cost 
of the provision of these benefits.
No recovery provisions apply.
Pension
To provide a 
competitive Company 
contribution that 
enables effective 
retirement planning.
Pension is provided by way of a 
contribution to a personal pension 
scheme or cash allowance in lieu of 
pension benefits.

Annual bonus
Incentivises 
achievement of 
annual objectives 
which support the 
Group’s short-term 
performance goals 
and protects longer 
term interests of the 
Group.
Bonus awards are granted annually 
following the signing of the Annual 
Report and Accounts, usually in 
March of the year following the 
reporting period in question. 
Performance period is one financial 
year, with payout determined by the 
Committee following the year end, 
based on achievement against a 
range of financial and non-financial 
targets. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply 
at the discretion of the Committee 
where the Committee considers such 
action is reasonable and appropriate, 
such as a participant’s material 
underperformance, material brand or 
reputational damage, material 
misstatement of the accounts, gross 
misconduct and fraud, regulatory and 
similar failures or other reason as 
determined by the Committee.
Maximum awards under the annual 
bonus are equal to 100% of salary.
On-target bonus: 75% of salary.
Threshold bonus: 25% of salary.
Performance targets will be set 
annually by the Committee based on 
a range of interdependent financial 
and non-financial measures. 
Financial targets govern the majority 
of bonus payments, which may 
include those related to profit before 
tax. Non-financial measures will 
include conduct-based measures 
which ensure delivery of good 
customer outcomes through 
appropriate affordability assessments 
and appropriate treatment of 
vulnerable customers together with 
appropriate collections, arrears and 
forbearance practices. 
The Committee has the discretion to 
adjust targets or performance 
measures for any exceptional events 
that may occur during the year. 
As well as determining the measures 
and targets, the Committee will also 
determine the weighting of the various 
measures to ensure that they support 
the business strategy and objectives 
for the relevant year. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report

Long-Term Incentive
Non-Standard 
Finance LTI for 
Executive Directors 
and senior 
management.
The Long-Term 
Incentives support  
the long-term 
strategic objectives  
of the Group.
Participants will receive awards which 
may be structured as awards or 
options over Ordinary Shares in the 
Company which may then be 
exchanged for Ordinary Shares in the 
Company shortly after the end of the 
performance period on 31 December 
2020. In each case, participants will 
then be required to hold such shares in 
the Company for a period of one year.
The number of Ordinary Shares 
required to settle all such awards, 
together with any Ordinary Shares 
issued in connection with the 
Founder Shares (see below) will be 
subject to a cap on the maximum 
dilution possible of 5% in 10 years. 
There will also be a further cap so 
that, together with all other share 
incentive plans offered by the 
Company, the maximum dilution 
possible will not be greater than 10% 
in 10 years. Any awards earned in 
excess of either cap will be satisfied 
through market purchase of shares 
by the Company.
The total value of awards at 
31 December 2020 will be 
determined by the growth in the 
value of the Company to 
31 December 2020 above £1.10. 
If the average share price of the 
Company is greater than £1.10, the 
value of the awards in total will 
equate to 15% of the excess growth in 
value, based on market capitalisation, 
of the Company above £1.10.
Founder Shares 
awarded to Executive 
Directors on IPO.
Prior to the IPO the Executive 
Directors, Charles Gregson and 
Robin Ashton, were awarded 
Founder Shares in Non-Standard 
Finance Subsidiary Limited. Under 
the terms of these shares the holders 
of the Founder Shares have the 
option to require the Company to 
purchase some or all of their Founder 
Shares. The purchase price for the 
exercise of this option may be paid by 
the Company in Ordinary Shares or 
as a cash equivalent at the 
Company’s option.
The number of Ordinary Shares 
required to settle all such options is 
the number of shares that would 
have represented 5% of the 
Ordinary Shares of the Company on 
(or immediately after) Admission if 
such Ordinary Shares had been 
issued at the time of Admission.

senior management 
of ELG.
The Long-Term 
Incentives support the 
long-term strategic 
objectives of the 
Group.
In recognition of Mr Creswell-Turner 
becoming Chief Executive of ELG, he 
will receive an award under the ELG 
LTI which was implemented in 2017 . 
The structure of the award is a nil-cost 
option over NSF shares.
The maximum value of the award 
under the ELG LTI for Mr Creswell-
Turner is £900,000. 
Under the ELG L TI, participants share in 
a pool of 5% of the equity value above 
a hurdle equity value of ELG of £267m. 
The pool is subject to a cap of £6m. 
Mr Cresswell- T urner will receive an 
allocation of 15% of the pool, which will 
result in a 0.75% share of the growth in 
ELG’s equity value above £267m at 
31 December 2019 , subject to a cap  
of £900,000. 
Performance will be tested against the 
hurdle at 31 December 2019 , though the 
ability to exercise the option will be 
deferred for one year . Shares acquired 
on the exercise of the option will have to 
be held for a further year . 
Awards under the NSF L TI will vest at 
the end of December 2020. As 
Mr Cresswell- T urner holds an award 
under the NSF L TI, which was made 
during 2017 , the total value of shares 
received by Mr Cresswell- T urner under 
the ELG L TI and the NSF L TI at the end 
of December 2020 will be restricted to 
the greater of the value of the shares 
receivable under the NSF L TI and the 
value of the shares receivable under  
the ELG L TI.  Governance

Discretion with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative 
discretion under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend 
policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await 
shareholder approval.
Changes from the last approved Remuneration Policy
In recognition of Mr Cresswell-Turner’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of ELG, his participation in the ELG LTI has been added to the last 
approved Remuneration Policy. Senior management of ELG currently hold awards under that incentive plan. 
The Policy now includes the ability to deliver Non-Executive Directors’ fees in NSF shares and the provision of reasonable travel and subsistence 
expenses to the Non-Executive Directors in respect of their duties.
There have been no other changes to the last approved Remuneration Policy. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report

2. Illustrations of application of Remuneration Policy
The charts below seek to demonstrate how pay varies with performance for the Executive Directors based on the stated Remuneration Policy.  
The charts show an estimate of the remuneration that could be received by Executives Directors under the Policy set out in this report. Each  
of the bars is broken down to show how the total under each scenario is made up of fixed elements of remuneration, the annual bonus and the 
long-term incentive.
The charts indicate that a significant proportion of both target and maximum pay is performance-related.
Assumptions used in determining the level of payout under given scenarios are as follows:
Element Minimum Threshold On-Target Maximum
Fixed elements Base salary at 1 January 2018 
Estimated value of benefits 
provided under the Policy 
Pension – 10% of salary
Annual bonus Nil 25% of maximum 75% of maximum 100% of salary
NSF LTI Nil Nil 100% of the IFRS 2 value of 
the award
200% of the IFRS 2 value of 
the award
ELG LTI Nil Nil As for NSF LTI As for NSF LTI
Awards made under the NSF LTI and ELG LTI will be on a one-off basis. The on-target value displayed in the charts represents the expected IFRS2 
value of the NSF LTI award. The maximum value displayed represents twice the expected IFRS 2 value for the NSF LTI. The IFRS 2 value is 
considered to be a suitable basis for estimating the potential payouts of the NSF LTI. The ELG LTI award for Miles Cresswell-Turner underpins his 
NSF LTI award and therefore the on-target and maximum values of this award are effectively included within the NSF LTI award for him. Governance

3. Approach to recruitment and promotions
The Company will pay total remuneration for new Executive Directors that enables the Company to attract appropriately skilled and experienced 
individuals, but is not, in the opinion of the Committee, excessive. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the 
same principles as for the Executive Directors, as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
For a new Executive Director who is an internal appointment, the Company may also continue to honour contractual commitments made prior to 
the internal appointment even if those commitments are otherwise inconsistent with the Policy in force when the commitments are satisfied. Any 
relevant incentive plan participation may either continue on its original terms or the performance targets and/or measures may be amended to 
reflect the individual’s new role, as the Committee considers appropriate. The table below summarises our key policies with respect to recruitment 
remuneration:
Element Policy description
Base salary and benefits • The salary level will be set taking into account a number of factors, including market factors, the individual’s 
experience and responsibilities and other pay structures within the Company and will be consistent with the 
salary policy for existing Executive Directors.
• Benefits may be provided in line with the Company’s benefits policy as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Pension • An Executive Director will be able to receive either a contribution to a personal pension scheme or cash 
allowance in lieu of pension benefits in line with the Company’s Policy as set out in the Remuneration Policy table.
Annual bonus • An Executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus as set out in the Remuneration Policy 
table.
• Awards may be granted up to the maximum opportunity allowable in the Remuneration Policy table at the 
Committee’s discretion.
Long-term incentives • An Executive Director may participate in the NSF LTI, to the extent that awards are available, as set out in the 
Remuneration Policy table.
Maximum variable 
remuneration
• The maximum annual variable remuneration that an Executive Director can receive may be up to 100% of salary 
(i.e. annual bonus).
Share buy-outs/ 
replacement awards
• The Company may, where appropriate, compensate a new Executive Director for variable remuneration that has 
been forfeited as a result of accepting the appointment with the Company. Where the Company compensates a 
new Executive Director in this way, it will seek to do so under the terms of the Company’s existing variable 
remuneration arrangements, but may compensate on terms that are more bespoke than the existing 
arrangements where the Committee considers that to be appropriate.
• In such instances, the Company will disclose a full explanation of the detail and rationale for such recruitment-
related compensation. In making such awards the Committee will seek to take into account the nature (including 
whether awards are cash or share-based), vesting period and performance measures and/or conditions for any 
remuneration forfeited by the individual when leaving a previous employer. Where such awards had outstanding 
performance or service conditions (which are not significantly completed) the Company will generally impose 
equivalent conditions. 
• The value of the buy-out awards will broadly be the equivalent of, or less than, the expected value of the award 
being bought out.
Relocation policies • In instances where the new Executive is relocated from one work location to another, the Company will provide 
compensation to reflect the cost of relocation for the Executive in cases where they are expected to spend 
significant time away from their home location in accordance with its normal relocation package for employees.
• The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but will take into consideration any 
cost of living differences; housing allowance; and schooling in accordance with the Company’s normal relocation 
package for employees.
Legal fees • The Company may, where appropriate, compensate a new Executive Director for legal costs incurred as a result 
of termination of previous employment in order to accept the appointment with the Company.

4. Executive Director service contracts and payment for loss of office 
Service contracts
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. Executive Directors’ service 
agreements can be terminated by not less than 12 months’ prior written notice given by the Executive or by the employer. The table below 
summarises the service contracts and letters of appointment for our Executive Directors.
Date of contract Notice period
John van Kuffeler 19 February 2015
12 months (Executive and Company) Nick Teunon 19 February 2015
Miles Cresswell-Turner 1 January 2016
All service contracts are available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
The Executive Directors are permitted to sit as a Non-Executive Director on the Board of another company with the Company’s written consent.
Payments for loss of office
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company while 
complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee reserves the right to make 
additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach 
of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s 
office or employment. The table below sets out, for each element of total remuneration, the Company’s policy on payment for loss of office in 
respect of Executive Directors and any discretion available:
Element Approach Discretion
Base salary 12 months under contract None
Annual bonus None payable Pro-rata bonus may be awarded dependent on 
reasons for leaving
Founder Shares No forfeiture None
NSF LTI and ELG LTI None payable if loss of office is because of resignation or gross 
misconduct or if the departing employee is not considered to be a 
good leaver.
Otherwise, pro-rata award of shares payable at the end of the 
performance period and subject to the deferral period.
Pro-rata award of shares may be awarded 
dependent on the reasons for leaving.
5. Consideration of employee remuneration and shareholders 
Consideration of shareholder views
The Remuneration Committee takes the views of shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in setting remuneration policy and 
practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee commits to consulting with 
key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its Remuneration Policy.
All-employee remuneration
In setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of NSF are taken into account, including any base 
salary increases awarded. The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the Executive 
Directors, and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company.
Formal consultation on the remuneration of Executive Directors is not undertaken with employees.
The Remuneration Policy described above applies specifically to Executive Directors of the Company. The Committee believes that the structure of 
management and employee reward should be linked to the Company’s strategy and performance. The table below illustrates how the 
remuneration framework operates below the Executive Directors:

4. Long-term incentives were the grant of options at a 20% discount under the SAYE plan.
5. Awards were also made under the NSF LTI which will vest at 31 December 2020.
Annual bonus outcomes for the period ended 31 December 2017 – audited
For 2017 the Executive Directors had a maximum annual bonus opportunity of 100% of salary. For each Executive Director, the 2017 annual bonus 
determination was based on the achievement of the financial and non-financial targets. The annual bonus table below provides information on 
the resulting bonus payment for each Executive Director.
The financial and non-financial targets for the 2017 annual bonus and the extent to which they were met are as follows: 
The financial target, which equated to 70% of the maximum potential bonus, was £20.1m based on the profit of the Company before fair value 
adjustments, amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items (including temporary additional commission and other expansion related 
costs at Loans at Home) and tax. The actual profit on this basis was £18.5m, being 92% of target and above the 90% threshold for payment  
of the minimum 25% of the financial element of the bonus. The next 50% of the financial element accrued on a straight-line basis between 90% 
and 100% of target. Therefore, the financial element of the bonus vested at 35% of the maximum financial element of 70% i.e. 24.5% of 
maximum bonus. 
The non-financial element was based on five individual components representing 30% of maximum bonus in total. These non-financial targets, 
which are described below, were met as follows:
1. For each of the trading entities within the Group, positive reports from KPMG (the Group’s outsourced internal audit provider) on lending 
practices (including affordability assessment and policies for dealing with vulnerable customers). Met as to 71%.
2. For each of the trading entities within the Group, positive reports from KPMG on collections practices (including forbearance and policies for 
dealing with vulnerable customers). Met as to 71%.
3. A minimum cash/undrawn headroom of £5m for the Company at 31 December 2017 with a dividend payment policy of 50% of post-tax profit 
before fair value adjustments, amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items. Met in full.
4. The granting of full FCA authorisation to Loans at Home not later than 31 December 2017 . Met in full.
5. No material breaches of NSF’s Risk Appetite Policy. Met in full.
As a result, the non-financial element was met as to 87% i.e. 26% of maximum, resulting in a total award for Executive Directors of 50.5% of the 
maximum. The Remuneration Committee has therefore determined that the bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors are £145,190 for John van 
Kuffeler (50.5% of maximum), £116,150 for Nick Teunon (50.5% of maximum) and £123,800 for Miles Cresswell-Turner (50.5% of maximum, excluding 
the additional salary of £50,000). The 2017 bonuses will be paid in cash. No part of the bonus will be subject to deferral. 
Long-Term Incentive awards made in 2017
As stated in our Remuneration Policy, awards were made during 2017 under the NSF LTI.
Under the NSF LTI, participants have been awarded a right to share in a pool of 15% of the growth in value (based on market capitalisation) of 
the Company above a share price hurdle of £1.10, being 29% above the price at which the majority of the Group’s shares were issued. 
Performance is measured against this hurdle after four years starting from 1 January 2017 (i.e. 31 December 2020), though delivery of shares is 
deferred until the end of the fifth year (i.e. 31 December 2021). 
Awards held by participants who cease employment during the four-year performance period will either lapse or be restricted in value 
depending on the reason for employment ceasing. The Committee has an overriding discretion to limit the amount payable under the awards or 
claw back awards that have been made if it considers that the Group’s results have been achieved in an inappropriate manner. Governance
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 78
Directors’ remuneration report continued
The pool in which participants share will be diluted and adjusted for any new issue of shares. There is a cap on the maximum number of shares 
issued under the LTI such that, together with any shares issued under the Founder Share scheme, no more than 5% can be issued in any 10-year 
period and that, together with all other share incentive plans offered by the Company, no more than 10% can be issued in any 10-year period.  
Any awards earned in excess of this will be satisfied through market purchase shares by the Company. 
The following awards were made under the NSF LTI. The awards for John van Kuffeler and Nick Teunon were in the form of nil-cost options over 
NSF shares. The award for Miles Cresswell-Turner was in the form of shares in an intermediate holding company; these shares will be exchanged

Payments to past Directors or for loss of office – audited
During the year there were no payments to past Directors and no payments for loss of office.
2. Implementation of Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors for 2018 
Base salary
In setting salary levels for the 2018 financial year for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered a number of factors, including individual 
performance and experience, pay and conditions for employees across the Company, the general performance of the Company, pay levels in 
other comparable companies, other elements of remuneration and the economic environment. The salaries for 2018 and the relative increases are 
set out below.
Base salary £000
2018 2017 % change
John van Kuffeler £325 £288 13%
Nick Teunon £280 £230 22%
Miles Cresswell-Turner £280 £230 22%
Notes
1. The increase in Miles Cresswell-Turner’s base salary in September 2017 was made to reflect his additional responsibilities as Chief Executive of ELG while continuing to be an Executive 
Director. 
2. The additional salary for Miles Cresswell-Turner when he was acting Chief Executive of ELG has been excluded from the calculation of the relative increase.
3. The increases for John van Kuffeler and Nick Teunon are to ensure that these remain competitive and fairly reflect their contribution to the larger and more complex business undertaken by 
the Group as well as their additional responsibilities as a result of Miles Cresswell-Turner becoming Chief Executive of ELG. Despite the increase in salaries, the Executive Directors’ 
remuneration continues to fall within the lower quartile of comparator companies.
Pension and benefits
The maximum contribution to a personal pension scheme or cash in lieu is equal to 10% of base salary for all Executive Directors. None of the 
Executive Directors had prospective rights under a defined benefit pension scheme.
Benefits will be provided to the Executive Directors in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Annual bonus
Consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy the maximum and target bonus potentials for 2018 are:
Maximum 
bonus % of 
salary
On-target 
bonus % of 
maximum
Threshold 
bonus % of 
maximum
John van Kuffeler 100% 75% 25%
Nick Teunon 100% 75% 25%
Miles Cresswell-Turner 100% 75% 25%
For the 2018 financial year, performance measures include financial measures based on profit of the Company before fair value adjustments, 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, exceptional items and tax and non-financial measures including conduct-based measures which ensure delivery 
of good customer outcomes through appropriate affordability assessments and appropriate treatment of vulnerable customers together with 
appropriate collections, arrears and forbearance practices. Financial and non-financial measures are split 70% financial and 30% non-financial. 
Miles Cresswell-Turner’s performance measures will be based as to one-third on Group performance and two-thirds on performance of ELG.
Threshold vesting will be set at 90% of target with on-target vesting at 100% and maximum vesting at 110%, with vesting on a sliding scale 
between these points. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 79
The Board is of the opinion that the precise performance targets for the annual bonus are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental 
to the interests of the Company to disclose them before the end of the financial year. Actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will 
be published at the end of the performance period so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Long-term incentive awards
The following awards are to be made under the ELG LTI.

3. Consideration by the Committee of matters relating to the Directors’ remuneration for 2017 and 2018 
The Committee seeks to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code but does not meet requirement D.2.1 of the Code as the Chairman of the 
Company is also the Chair of the Committee. The Committee and the Board of the Company consider this provision to not be appropriate given 
the size and nature of the Company. The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on remuneration for 
the Executive Directors and has oversight of remuneration arrangements for senior management. The Committee’s full terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website at www.nsfgroupplc.com.

1. Niall Booker joined the Board on 9 May 2017 .
2. Niall Booker was unable to attend the meeting in September as he had a prior appointment made before he was invited to join the Board. 
All Committee members attended all Remuneration Committee meetings, unless otherwise stated, that took place while they were members of 
the Committee. The Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee, but are not present 
when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee received external advice in 2017 from PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’) during the year. PwC were appointed by the Committee in 
May 2015 as advisers after a tender process. PwC are considered by the Committee to be objective and independent. PwC are members of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operate under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in 
the UK. The Committee reviewed the nature of all the services provided during the year by PwC and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists 
or existed in the provision of these services. The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £28,200. Fees 
were determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee. PwC also provides valuation advice and 
assistance with implementation of the Group’s long-term incentive arrangements. Governance

4. Group Chief Executive and employee pay
The Committee believes that the current Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the supporting reward structure provide clear alignment 
with the Company’s performance. The Committee believes it is appropriate to monitor the Company’s performance against the FTSE All Share 
Index – Financial Services as this Index provides a measure of a sufficiently broad equity market against which the Company considers that it is 
suitable to compare itself..
The chart below illustrates our Total Shareholder Return performance against the FTSE All Share Index – Financial Services since the date of the 
IPO in February 2015 to 31 December 2017 .

Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 81
Despite having fulfilled most of the strategic objectives set out at the time of the Group’s Initial Public Offering, the Group’s shares have 
underperformed the FTSE All Share Financial Services Index during the period. Possible reasons for this underperformance include: limited 
liquidity in the Group’s shares; limited research coverage by sell-side analysts; softer than expected financial performance by Loans at Home in 
2016; and concerns over future market and regulatory conditions in the UK consumer finance segment.

4. John van Kuffeler and Nick Teunon also hold nil-cost options over NSF shares under the NSF LTI. Miles Cresswell-Turner also holds shares in a subsidiary company under the NSF LTI; these 
shares will be exchanged for NSF shares on vesting. In both cases, the number of NSF shares that these Executive Directors will eventually acquire (which could be nil) will only be 
determined at the vesting date of 31 December 2020 and will be based on the growth in value of NSF above the share price hurdle of £1.10. 
No changes took place in the interests of the Directors between 1 January 2018 and 22 March 2018.
Dilution
The Company funds its share incentives through a combination of new issue and market purchased shares. The Company monitors the levels of 
share grants and the impact of these on the ongoing requirement for shares. In accordance with guidelines set out by the Investment Association 
(‘IA’) the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period to employees under all its share plans and 
can issue a maximum of 5% of its issued share capital in a rolling 10-year period under executive (discretionary) share plans.

business are set out on pages 36 to 38 of the Strategic Report.

Company’s Articles of Association and relevant English law. The 
Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or in voting rights.

year ended 31 December 2017 (see further details below).

Report on the audit of the financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of 
the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Non-Standard Finance plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) which comprise:
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of financial position;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of cash flows; and
• the related notes 1 to 29.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, 
as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed, public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the Group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• acquisition accounting;
• carrying value of goodwill;
• provision for impairment losses against loans and receivables to customers; and
• revenue recognition.
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identified with  and any key audit matters which are the same as 
the prior year identified with  .
Materiality The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £660,000 which was determined on the basis of 
5% of profit before tax, fair value adjustments of £11.9m, amortisation of acquired intangible assets of £7 .9m, and 
exceptional items of £6.3m.
Scoping Our Group audit scope focused on the parent company and each of the trading subsidiaries within the Group which 
together account for 100% of the Group’s losses before tax. Whilst consistent with prior year, the current year scope 
includes the George Banco business acquired during the year. 
Significant changes in 
our approach
Our audit approach for the current year focuses on the additional key audit matter arising from the acquisition 
accounting for George Banco. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 87
Conclusions relating to going concern
We are required by ISAs (UK) to report in respect of the following matters where:
• the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of the financial 
statements is not appropriate; or 
• the Directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material 
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the Group’s or the parent company’s 
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least  
12 months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Our audit approach for the current year focuses on the additional key audit matter arising from 
the acquisition accounting for George Banco. In the prior year, we identified a key audit matter arising from the acquisition accounting for 
Everyday Loans.
Acquisition accounting  
Key audit matter 
description
In August 2017 , the Group acquired the George Banco group for £18.6m. Under IFRS 3: Business Combinations, where 
an acquirer obtains control of a business, such business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, 
which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at the acquisition date 
along with the recognition and measurement of identifiable intangibles and goodwill. 
 
The key risks of material misstatement are in the identification and valuation of intangible assets acquired and the 
valuation of the loan book on acquisition. 
 
As set out in note 24, the acquisition of the George Banco group resulted in the recognition of £7 .7m of intangible 
assets, an adjustment of £8.1m to recognise the acquired loan book at fair value and the recognition of £8.6m of 
goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets and 
liabilities.
 
The critical judgements and estimations involved in determining these balances are:
• the approach to identify intangible assets;
• the valuation approaches to intangibles and the loan book; and 
• the cash flow forecasts and the discount rate.
 
Further detail in respect of management judgements and assumptions is set out within the Audit Committee report on 
pages 61 to 62 and notes 1, 2, 13 and 14 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We assessed the design and tested the implementation of controls relating to the identification and valuation of 
intangible assets. We independently challenged management’s approach against the requirements of IFRS 3 by 
considering a list of other potential intangibles and whether they might be applicable in the context of this business 
combination.
 
We used our valuation specialists to assist us in assessing the appropriateness of the valuation models used by 
management to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and the loan book at acquisition. We independently 
challenged the inputs and assumptions in the valuation models used by comparing these to original loan 
documentation and other sources of evidence.
 
We also used our valuation specialists independently to calculate a range of discount rates and we used these to 
perform sensitivity analysis over the models to assess for evidence of management bias in the rates used.
Key observations We found management’s methodology and assumptions for the recognition and valuation of intangible assets arising 
from the acquisition, and the fair valuation of the loan book at acquisition, to be appropriate and in line with 
accounting standards. 
 
We found that the underlying assumptions of the models were reasonable and the models were working as intended. Financial Statements
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 88
Carrying value of goodwill  
Key audit matter 
description
The acquisitions of Everyday Loans Group, Loans at Home and George Banco has led to the recognition of £140.7m of 
goodwill (2016: £132.1m) in the consolidated statement of financial position.
 
Under IAS 36, impairment testing for goodwill should always be carried out in the context of a cash generating unit 
(‘CGU’) as goodwill does not generate cash flows independently of other assets. 
 
When goodwill has been allocated to a CGU, IAS 36 requires that unit to be tested for impairment at least annually 
and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
 
Management performed a goodwill impairment assessment as at 31 December 2017 by determining the recoverable 
amount, based on fair value less cost to sell for each CGU, and comparing this to the carrying value of the CGU. 
Management determined that there was no indication that any impairment was required to the carrying value of 
goodwill.
 
The critical judgements and estimates involved in management’s impairment assessment are:
• forecast profit after tax for the 2020 year end;
• the calculation and application of an appropriate price/earnings (‘P/E’) multiple to the forecast 2020 profit after 
tax; and
• the discount rate used on future cash flows. 
 
Further detail in respect of management judgements and assumptions is set out within the Audit Committee report on 
pages 61 to 62 and notes 1, 2 and 13 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We assessed the design and tested the implementation of controls relating to the goodwill impairment review. We 
challenged the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions used in the impairment assessment and our 
challenge considered the appropriateness of the methodology for compliance with IAS 36. Additionally, we 
performed a sensitivity analysis for each of the key judgements and estimates to assess the impact on the recoverable 
amount of each CGU. We focused our audit procedures on the areas to which the carrying value of goodwill is most 
sensitive. 
 
In relation to management’s forecast earnings we:
• challenged the reliability of management’s forecasting based on historical data;
• reviewed the consistency of management’s assumptions with management’s assessment of viability and going 
concern; and
• performed a sensitivity analysis over forecast and break-even growth rates to assess these for reasonableness in 
light of historic performance.
 
In relation to the discount rate used in management’s assessment, we:
• used our valuation specialists to assess the methodology used by management to determine their discount rate; 
and,
• used our valuation specialists to calculate a range of possible discount rates for the Group.
 
In relation to the P/E multiple, we used our valuation specialists to challenge the multiple by determining an 
independent benchmark.
Key observations We found management’s approach for the goodwill impairment assessment to be compliant with IAS 36.
 
All assumptions, including the discount rate, the P/E multiple and the forecast earnings, adopted by management are 
within an acceptable range. 
 
As disclosed in note 13 to the financial statements, the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the CGUs is highly 
sensitive to future forecast earnings.

Provision for impairment losses against loans and receivables to customers  
Key audit matter 
description
The Group holds an impairment provision of £24.5m against gross customer receivables of £284.3m (2016: impairment 
provision of £24.4m against gross customer receivables of £204.8m).
The assessment of provisions for impairment losses requires management to make significant judgements in respect 
of: 
• the determination of loss events;
• the quantum and timing of future cash flows; and
• the use of historical cash collection performance to determine expected future cash flows.
Given the significant level of management judgement involved, we have determined that there was a potential for 
fraud through possible manipulation of this balance.
Further detail in respect of management judgements and assumptions is set out within the Audit Committee report on 
pages 61 to 62 and notes 1, 2 and 17 to the financial statements.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We assessed the design and tested the implementation of controls relating to the identification, valuation and 
recording of impairment provisions. For each of the Group’s reportable segments, we evaluated whether the 
methodology applied by management is compliant with the requirements of IAS 39.
We challenged the appropriateness of management’s assumptions underlying the impairment provision calculations. 
This involved assessing the assumptions related to the timing and quantum of cash flows for appropriateness in 
comparison to current and forecast external market and economic data as well as to historical experience. 
We considered the appropriateness of impairment triggers under IAS 39 by comparing the Group’s loss event 
definition to entity specific experience of asset performance, as well as benchmarking to other businesses with similar 
asset classes.
Where relevant, our IT specialists tested the IT scripts and data flows from source systems to spreadsheet-based 
models to test the completeness and accuracy of the models.  
We also performed sensitivity analysis over the key assumptions of the models to assess the potential for management 
bias.
Key observations The provision models across the Group were found to be working as intended and the methodology is compliant with 
the requirements of IAS 39. We found that the underlying assumptions of the model are reasonable.
We found that the expected cash collections used in the models are materially consistent with recent performance 
and budgeted collections.
 
The impairment provisions held against the loan book are in line with current collections performance.
Revenue recognition  
Key audit matter 
description
The Group’s main revenue stream is interest income of £107 .8m which should be recognised based on the effective 
interest rate (‘EIR’) method in accordance with IAS 39. 
 
The EIR method spreads directly attributable revenues and costs over the behavioural life of the loan. The Group’s EIR 
models are heavily reliant on the quality of the underlying data flowing into the models.
 
The key judgements in determining revenue recognition include:
• the period over which forecast cash flows are modelled to determine the EIR, as changes to this assumption could 
significantly affect the revenue recognised in any given period.
• manual adjustments to revenue which pose a significant risk of material misstatement.
 
Given the significant level of management judgement involved, we have determined that there is a risk of fraud 
through possible manipulation of the revenue balance.
 
Further detail in respect of management judgements and assumptions is set out within the Audit Committee report on 
pages 61 to 62 and notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements. Financial Statements

How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We assessed the design and tested the implementation of controls relating to the recording of revenue, including 
manual adjustments. We considered the appropriateness of the methodology for compliance with IAS 39. We 
challenged management’s assumptions in respect of cash flow estimates by comparing to underlying data sources 
and benchmarks. We focused on the timing and level of early settlements which directly impact estimated 
behavioural lives. 
 
We also challenged whether all directly attributable costs and fees were identified and appropriately included in the 
EIR by considering the contractual terms of the loans under IAS 39.
 
We independently recalculated the effective interest rates for a sample of loans and compared these to the EIRs 
applied in the revenue models.
Key observations We found the models to be working as intended and the underlying assumptions to be reasonable and compliant 
with IAS 39.
 
From the evidence we obtained, the underlying data used were found to be complete and accurate.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality £660,000 (2016: £480,000) £219,000
Basis for determining 
materiality
We used 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit. Adjusted pre-tax 
profit is before fair value adjustments, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, and exceptional items as 
described in the financial statements.
 
For the year ended 31 December 2016 we used 5% of 
pre-tax profit, before fair value adjustments and 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets.
We used 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit. Adjusted pre-tax 
profit is before fair value adjustments, amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets and exceptional items as 
described in the financial statements.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
Profit-based measures are the financial measures most 
relevant to users of the financial statements. We 
considered the most relevant basis for materiality to be 
the profits earned from continuing business operations 
and have therefore excluded the fair value adjustments, 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets arising on 
acquisitions, and exceptional items as described in the 
financial statements. The use of 5% is to align materiality 
to that of comparable listed companies.
We considered the most relevant basis for materiality to 
be the profits earned from continuous business 
operations and have therefore excluded the exceptional 
items.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £33,000 (2016: £4,000) for the 
Group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We have increased this threshold 
based on our understanding of the business and the appetite of the Audit Committee. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatements at the Group level. Based on that assessment, our Group audit scope focused on the parent company and each of 
the principal trading subsidiaries within the Group which together account for 100% of the Group’s losses before tax. We have performed audit 
procedures over the Group consolidation and consolidation adjustments and we have audited all the subsidiaries using a materiality range of 
£122,000 to £520,000. Whilst consistent with prior year, the current year scope included the George Banco business acquired during the year. 
All entities within the Group have the same engagement partner.
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The Directors are responsible for the 
other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual 
Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the 
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in respect  
of these matters.
Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Financial Statements

Notes to the financial statements
General information
Non-Standard Finance plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 
5th Floor, 6 St Andrew Street, London EC4A 3AE.
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company financial statements, applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
prepared to 31 December. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration the 
existence and effect of potential voting rights that currently are exercisable or convertible.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date 
of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from publishing its individual statement of 
comprehensive income and related notes. The subsidiary Georgefinance.Com Limited has taken advantage of the exemptions under sections 
394A and 448A of the Companies Act 2016 from preparing or filing accounts.
Going concern
In adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered the activities of its principal 
subsidiaries, as set out in the Strategic Report, as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties as set out in the Governance Report.  
The Board of Directors has considered the Group’s latest financial projection from the most recent budget, including:
• Funding levels and headroom against committed borrowing facilities;
• Cash flow and liquidity requirements; and
• Forecast compliance against debt covenants.
Based on these forecasts and projections, the Board is satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, the Group has adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
New and amended Standards and Interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year ending 31 December 2017
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new and amended Standards and Interpretations are in issue but not yet 
mandatorily effective and are expected to have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group when they are adopted:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
The International Accounting Standard Board’s introduction of a new accounting standard covering financial instruments became effective from 
1 January 2018 and replaces IAS 39: Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 prescribes: (i) classification and measurement of 
financial instruments; (ii) expected loss accounting for impairment, and (ii) hedge accounting. The only area which materially affects the Group is 
expected loss accounting for impairment. Under this approach, impairment provisions are recognised on inception of a loan based on the 
probability of default and the typical loss arising on default. 
The expected credit loss impairment model has three stages: (1) on initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised and maintained equal to 12 
months of expected credit losses; (2) if credit risk increases significantly relative to initial recognition, the loss allowance is increased to cover full 
lifetime expected credit losses; and (3) when a financial asset is considered credit-impaired, the loss allowance continues to reflect lifetime 
expected credit losses and interest revenue is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than its gross 
carrying amount. Provisions are calculated based on an unbiased probability-weighted outcome which takes into account historic performance 
and considers the outlook for macro-economic conditions. The impairment approach under IFRS 9 differs from the current incurred loss model 
under IAS 39 where impairment provisions are only reflected when there is objective evidence of impairment, typically a missed payment. The 
resulting effect is that impairment provisions under IFRS 9 are recognised earlier. This will result in a one-off adjustment to receivables, deferred 
tax and reserves on adoption and will result in delayed recognition of profits. Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 99
The Group will adopt the standard in line with the mandatory effective date of 1 January 2018. Based on current estimates, the adoption of IFRS 9 
results in an unaudited reduction in receivables of £13.2m at 31 December 2017 , which net of deferred tax, results in an unaudited reduction in net 
assets of £10.7m. The primary impact is attributable to increases in the level of provisioning under the new impairment requirements. Despite the 
adjustments required to receivables, net assets and earnings, it is important to note that cash flow remains unchanged and IFRS 9 only changes 
the timing of profits made on a loan. There will be no change to the Group’s underwriting process and our scorecards will be unaffected by the 
change in accounting. The ultimate profitability of a loan is the same under both IAS 39 and IFRS 9 and the cash flows and capital generation 
over the life of a loan remain unchanged. The calculation of the Group’s debt covenants are unaffected by IFRS 9, as they are based on 
accounting standards in place at the time they were set. 
Management will continue to monitor and refine certain elements of our impairment process in advance of H1 2018 reporting.
IFRS 16 Leases 
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and provides a single lease accounting model for the identification and treatment of lease arrangements in the 
financial statements of both lessees and lessors. The standard distinguishes between services and leases on the basis of whether there is the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time. The standard requires that upon commencement of a lease a lessee recognises a 
lease liability, being present value of the lease payments, and a right-of-use asset which is measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any 
initial direct costs incurred. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the standard and will adopt it from the expected effective date 
of 1 January 2019.
The effect of all other new and amended Standards and Interpretations which are in issue but not yet mandatorily effective is not expected to be 
material. Management will continue to assess the impact of new and amended Standards and Interpretations on an ongoing basis.
Revenue recognition
Interest income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for all loans and receivables measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method (‘EIR’). The EIR is calculated using estimated cash flows, being contractual payments adjusted for the impact of 
customers repaying early but excluding the anticipated impact of customers paying late or not at all. Under IAS 39, interest income on loan 
products continues to accrue at the EIR on all impaired capital balances throughout the life of the agreement, irrespective of the terms of the loan 
and whether the customer is actually being charged arrears interest. This is referred to as the gross-up adjustment to revenue and is offset by a 
corresponding gross-up adjustment to the loan loss provisioning charge to reflect the fact that this additional revenue is not collectable. 
Other operating income
Other operating income relates to amounts received as a result of debt sales made during the year. Due to the size and nature of the item, this has 
been disclosed as a separate line item in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2017 . This was included within 
impairment in the 2016 Annual Report, however has now been shown separately for comparative purposes.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker as required 
by IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. The chief operating decision-maker responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments has been identified as the Board of Directors. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with the accounting policies of the Group as a whole. Segment profit represents 
the profit earned by each segment. This is the measure of profit that is reported to the Board of Directors for the purpose of resource allocation 
and the assessment of segment performance.
When assessing segment performance and considering the allocation of resources, the Board of Directors review information about segment 
assets and liabilities. For this purpose, all assets and liabilities are allocated to reportable segments with the exception of intangible assets and 
current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
Fair value of acquired loan book
The fair value of the acquired loan portfolio of Loans at Home, Everyday Loans, and George Banco on acquisition has been estimated by 
discounting expected future cash flows. The difference between fair value and carrying value of the loan portfolio on acquisition will be unwound 
to revenue in the statement of comprehensive income on an effective interest rate basis over the expected life of the acquired loans. The Board of 
Directors will assess the fair value adjustment, using the same assumptions, to the remaining cash flows from the loans that were in place at the 
time of acquisition, at each future accounting date.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Directors consider should be disclosed 
separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results. The Group’s exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2017 are costs 
associated with acquisitions, refinancing and restructuring (2016: costs associated with acquisitions). Financial Statements

1. Accounting policies continued
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and any deferred tax. 
The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the year-end date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred 
tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised 
if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised. Deferred tax is 
charged or credited to comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.
Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred 
to the Group. 
Goodwill is an intangible asset and is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (‘CGUs’) for the purposes of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of 
CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. 
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment is tested by comparing the 
carrying value of the CGU with the discounted forecasted earnings from the relevant CGU. Expected future earnings are derived from the Group’s 
latest budget projections and the discount rate based on the Group’s cost of equity at the balance sheet date. 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets include acquired intangibles in respect of the customer list and agent relationships at Loans at Home (formerly Loansathome4u) 
and acquired intangibles in respect of the customer list, broker relationships and credit decisioning technology at Everyday Loans, together with 
the Everyday Loans and TrustTwo brands. Intangible assets also include acquired intangibles in respect of the customer list, broker relationships, 
and brand at George Banco.
The fair value of the customer lists of Loans at Home, Everyday Loans and George Banco on acquisition has been estimated by calculating the 
Net Present Value (‘NPV’) of the discounted cash flows from each new loan to be provided to this discrete set of known customers. The Board of 
Directors will test the assumptions for reasonableness at each future accounting date, limited to the original known customer lists.
The fair value of Loans at Home’s agent relationships on acquisition has been estimated by valuing the cost to set up a similar network of  
trained agents.
The fair value of Everyday Loans’ broker relationships on acquisition has been estimated by calculating the NPV of the discounted cash flows from the 
cost avoided each year due to having the broker relationships in place on new loan volumes written by existing brokers. The fair value of George 
Banco’s broker relationships on acquisition has been estimated by calculating the NPV of the discounted cash flows from each new loan sold as a 
result of the strength of the broker relationship and reputation of George Banco, limited to three years of loan origination from the date of acquisition. 
The Board of Directors will test the assumptions for reasonableness at each future accounting date, limited to the then existing brokers.
The fair value of Everyday Loans’ credit decisioning technology on acquisition has been estimated by assessing the likely commercial level of 
royalties that would be payable to a third party were the technology licensed rather than owned, calculated as a percentage of forecast 
revenues and discounted to the date of the transaction. The Board of Directors will assess the technology for impairment using the same 
methodology at each future accounting date.
Notes to the financial statements continued Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 101
The fair value of Loans at Home’s brand (which at acquisition was loansathome4u), Everyday Loans, TrustTwo and George Banco brands on 
acquisition has been estimated by assessing the likely commercial level of royalties that would be payable to a third party were the brand licensed 
rather than owned, calculated as a percentage of forecast revenues and discounted to the date of the transaction. Due to rebranding, the 
loansathome4u brand to Loans at Home, the associated intangible asset was written off in 2016. The Board of Directors will assess each of the 
Group’s remaining brands for impairment using the same methodology at each future accounting date.
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income, over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Customer lists Between 3 and 7 years
Agent network 3 years
Broker relationships 2 to 3 years
Credit decisioning technology 4 years
Brand Between 1 and 5 years
The useful economic life and amortisation method of intangible assets are reviewed at least at each balance sheet date. Impairment of intangible 
assets is only reviewed where circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on the cost of valuation of property, plant and equipment in order to write such cost or valuation over the expected useful 
lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% straight-line
Leasehold improvements shorter of life of lease or 7 years
Computer and other equipment 20% to 33% straight-line
Fixtures and fittings 10% straight line or 20% reducing balance
Motor vehicles 25% reducing balance
Software 3 to 5 years
Project costs relate to capitalised IT expenditure in relation to developing software. They are not depreciated.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  
EIR method. 
Amounts receivable from customers
Customer receivables originated by the Group are initially recognised at the amount loaned to the customer plus directly attributable costs. 
Subsequently, receivables are increased by revenue and reduced by cash collections and any deduction for impairment. The Directors assess on 
an ongoing basis whether there is objective evidence that customer receivables are impaired at each balance sheet date. 
Recognition of incurred losses
An impairment loss is calculated by reference to arrears stages and is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the loans and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate. The assumptions for estimating future cash flows are 
based upon observed historical data and updated as management considers appropriate to reflect current and future conditions. All 
assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash flows on impaired debt and the 
eventual losses. Financial Statements
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 102
1. Accounting policies continued
For Loans at Home, objective evidence of impairment is based on the payment performance of loans in the previous 13 weeks as this is considered 
to be the most appropriate indicator of credit quality. Loans are deemed to be impaired when between two to four contractual weekly payments 
(depending on length of relationship with the customer) have been missed in the previous 13-week period. 
For Everyday Loans and George Banco, the criteria that the Company uses to determine that there is objective evidence of impairment loss 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Delinquency in contractual payments of principal or interest;
• Cash flow difficulties experienced by the borrower; and
• Initiation of bankruptcy proceedings.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method.
EIR method
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and allocating interest income or expense over the 
relevant period. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset or liability, or, 
where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Leases 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. The Group grants options under employee savings-related share 
option schemes (typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes (SAYE)) and makes awards under the Long-Term Incentive schemes.  
All of these schemes are equity-settled.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-
settled share-based payments is expensed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The corresponding credit is made to a share-based payment reserve 
within equity. The grant by the Company of options and awards over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings is treated 
as an investment in the Company’s financial statements. At the end of the vesting period, or upon exercise, lapse or forfeit (if earlier), this credit is 
transferred to retained earnings. Further information on the Group’s schemes is provided in note 23 and in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Repurchase of share capital (own shares)
Where the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company’s share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders’ 
equity as treasury shares until they are sold or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is 
included in shareholders’ equity.
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and 
judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the year-end 
date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimated are revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical accounting judgements: 
Determination of Cash Generating Units (‘CGUs’) 
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CGUs). 
The Board of Directors consider Loans at Home, Everyday Loans and George Banco as three CGUs. No goodwill was attributable to TrustTwo 
upon acquisition of Everyday Loans.
Notes to the financial statements continued Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 103
Key sources of estimation uncertainty: 
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the fair value less cost-to-sell of the CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated. The fair value calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and apply a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value. 
The assessment of impairment of goodwill reflects a number of key estimates, each of which can have a material effect on the carrying value of 
the asset. These include:
• earnings forecasts which have been extracted from the budget, which involves inherent uncertainty, particularly in respect of gross loan 
values, collections performance and the cost base of the business; 
• estimates made on the disposal costs of the business; and
• the discount rate applied to determine the net present value (‘NPV’) of future cash flows.
The nature and inherent uncertainty relating to the above judgements and estimates means that the forecast cash flows may be materially 
different from actual cash flows. A material future reduction in forecast surplus cash flows would necessitate a full impairment review and the 
possibility of a material impairment charge in future years.
The Group has produced a three-year forecast to 31 December 2020 and applied three valuation approaches to establish the recoverable 
amount of the CGU. These were:
1. A price/total net asset value (‘TNAV’) multiple based on the return on TNAV of the business, with the multiple calculated by using a regression 
analysis for comparable speciality finance company valuations over the last two years.
2. A price/earnings multiple based on the forecast earnings growth of the business in the following two years, with the multiple calculated by 
using a regression analysis for comparable speciality finance company valuations over the last two years.
3. A ten-year average price/earnings multiple for comparable speciality finance companies.
Under IAS 36 we have compared the carrying value of goodwill to the recoverable amount which is the higher of value of use or fair value less 
costs-to-sell. The lowest of the valuations was used by the Group to compare with the CGU’s carrying value. This has not resulted in any 
impairment of the carrying value at 31 December 2017 as the CGUs’ recoverable amounts exceed their carrying values. Refer to note 13 for the 
sensitivities around the carrying value of the goodwill.
Amounts receivable from customers
The Group reviews its portfolio of loans and receivables for impairment at each balance sheet date. For the purposes of assessing the impairment 
of customer loans and receivables, customers are categorised into arrears stages as this is considered to be the most reliable indication of 
payment performance. The Group makes assumptions to determine whether there is objective evidence indicating that there has been an 
adverse effect on expected future cash flows. 
Once a loan is deemed to be impaired, judgement is required to determine the quantum and timing of cash flows that will be recovered, which 
are discounted to present value based on the EIR of the loan. 
Customer accounts in Loans at Home are deemed to be impaired when two to four contractual weekly payments (depending on length of 
relationship with the customer) have been missed in the previous 13 weeks. In the weekly home credit business, receivables are deemed to be 
impaired when the cumulative amount of two or more contractual weekly payments have been missed in the previous 13 weeks, since only at this 
point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate significantly. 
Customer accounts in Everyday Loans and George Banco are impaired with reference to arrears stages and are measured as the difference 
between the carrying value of the loans and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.  
The assumptions for estimating future cash flows are based upon observed historical data and updated as management considers appropriate 
to reflect current and future conditions. All assumptions are reviewed regularly to take account of differences between previously estimated cash 
flows on impaired debt and the eventual losses.
Intangible assets – customer lists 
Loans at Home’s, Everyday Loans’ and George Banco’s customer lists have been allocated a fair value on acquisition as the existing customer 
base is an important influence on the future prospects of the business.
The customer lists have been valued by calculating the NPV of the discounted cash flows from each new loan forecast to be sold to this discrete 
set of known customers. The methodology is in-line with the Group’s existing valuation model used for budgeting purposes.
The calculation of the value of the customer lists reflects a number of key estimates, which have a material effect on the carrying value of the 
assets. These include:
• cash flow forecasts which have been extracted from the budget produced by Loans at Home, Everyday Loans, and George Banco which 
involve inherent uncertainty, particularly in respect of gross loan values, collections performance and the cost base of the business; 
• estimates made on the propensity to re-loan to the customer base; and
• the WACC applied to determine the NPV of each new loan. Financial Statements
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 104
2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
The nature and inherent uncertainty relating to the above judgements and estimates means that the forecast cash flows may be materially 
different from actual cash flows. A material future reduction in forecast surplus cash flows would necessitate a full impairment review and the 
possibility of a material impairment charge in future years.
Intangible assets – broker relationships 
Everyday Loans and George Banco’s broker relationships have been allocated a fair value on acquisition to recognise the additional volume of 
new loans resulting from existing broker relationships. The fair value of the broker relationships on acquisition for Everyday Loans has been 
estimated by calculating the NPV of the discounted cash flows from the cost avoided each year due to having the broker relationships in place on 
new loan volumes written by existing brokers. The fair value of George Banco’s broker relationships on acquisition has been estimated by 
calculating the NPV of the discounted cash flows from each new loan forecast to be sold as a result of the strength of the broker relationship and 
reputation of George Banco, limited to three years of loan origination from the date of acquisition.
The calculation of the broker relationships reflects a number of key estimates, which have a material effect on the carrying value of the assets. 
These include:
• Cash flow forecasts which have been extracted from the budget Everyday Loans and George Banco which involve inherent uncertainty, 
particularly in respect of gross loan values, collections performance and the cost base of the business. 
• Estimates made on the percentage of new loans which are as a result of the broker relationships. 
• The WACC applied to determine the NPV of each new loan.
3. Revenue
Revenue is recognised by applying the EIR to the carrying value of a loan. The EIR is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly 
discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under the loan, plus directly attributable issue costs. In 
addition, the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.

Exceptional items and costs related to long-term incentive plans are included within ‘expenses not allowable for taxation’ due the nature of the 
transactions. Exceptional items disallowed include costs in relation to the acquisition of George Banco totalling £0.6m (2016: £0.6m in relation to 
the acquisition of Everyday Loans). Long-term incentive plan items disallowed relates to set-up costs and the fair value of the schemes at the date 
of grant totalling £0.4m (2016: £nil). 
Reductions in the UK corporation tax rate from 20% to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. A further 
reduction in the rate from 19% to 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) was substantively enacted on 6 September 2016. This will reduce the Company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on the rate of 19% substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
12. Dividends
A half-year dividend of 0.5 pence per share (2016: 0.3 pence per share) was paid in October 2017 . The Directors have recommended a final 
dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017 of 1.7 pence per share (31 December 2016: 0.9 pence per share) which will amount  
to an estimated dividend payment of £5.4m. This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 as it is subject to 
shareholder approval.

Acquisition of subsidiary (George Banco) 8,598
At 31 December 2017 140,668
The goodwill recognised represents the difference between the purchase consideration and the net assets acquired (including intangible assets 
recognised upon acquisition). Total goodwill as at 31 December 2017 comprises £40.2m related to the acquisition of Loans at Home, £91.9m related 
to the acquisition of Everyday Loans, and £8.6m related to the acquisition of George Banco (refer to note 24). 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The assessment of 
impairment of goodwill reflects a number of key estimates, each of which can have a material effect on the carrying value of the asset. 
These include:
• earnings forecasts which have been extracted from the budget, which involves inherent uncertainty, particularly in respect of gross loan 
values, collections performance and the cost base of the business; 
• the price earnings multiple applied to the cash flow forecasts;
• estimates made on the disposal costs of the business; and 
• the discount rate applied to determine the NPV of future cash flows.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a fair value less cost-to-sell calculation. That calculation uses earnings projections 
based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period to 31 December 2020, disposal costs have been estimated at 
2% and a discount rate of 12% has been used for the Group. The Directors have estimated the discount rate using post-tax rates that reflect 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the market. None of the goodwill is tax deductible.
Considering the key estimates above, the Group has identified that it would require a movement in all of the judgements and estimates of greater 
than 33% (Loans at Home), 10% (Everyday Loans) and 35% (George Banco), to give rise to a potential impairment charge to the carrying value of 
goodwill recognised for each CGU. Furthermore, it would require the following percentage decreases in 2020 forecast earnings to necessitate an 
impairment charge to the carrying value of goodwill: 61% at Loans at Home, 21% at Everyday Loans and 54% at George Banco. 
The Group considers that there is no reasonably foreseeable reduction in the assumptions which would give rise to impairment and therefore no 
further sensitivity has been presented.

The Group provides for its best estimate of redress payable in respect of historical sales of PPI by considering the likely future uphold rate for claims 
in the context of confirmed issues and historical experience. The likelihood of potential new claims is projected forward to 29 August 2019, which is 
in line with the deadline provided by the Financial Conduct Authority for customers to make claims. The accuracy of these estimates would be 
affected were there to be a significant change in either the number of future claims or the incidence of claims upheld by the Financial 
Ombudsman Service.

The Group entered into arrangements for the provision of two financing facilities during the year. These comprised a £225m term loan provided by 
institutional investors, and a £35m revolving loan facility provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. As at 31 December 2017 , £175.0m was drawn 
under the term loan facility and £33.1m was drawn under the revolving loan facility (2016: £77 .3m drawn under the Everyday Loans banking facility 
and £10.0m drawn under the Loans at Home facility). The term loan facility has a six-year term and the revolving loan facility has a five-year term. 
Borrowings are recognised at amortised cost. The carrying value of other payables due in more than one year is not materially different to the fair 
value. The facility arrangements have the benefit of (i) guarantees from, and fixed and floating security granted by, the following entities: NSF 
Finco Limited, Non-Standard Finance Subsidiary II Limited, Non-Standard Finance Subsidiary III Limited, S.D. Taylor Limited, Everyday Loans

Notes to the financial statements continued Corporate Governance Financial Statements Overview Strategic Report
Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 117
a) Movements in the period
Founder Shares scheme
The Founders have committed £255,000 of capital in NSF Subsidiary Limited in the form of 100 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares grant each 
holder the option, subject to the satisfaction of both the significant acquisition condition and the performance condition (which can be satisfied, 
under certain circumstances, if a Founder is removed from the Board), to require the Company to purchase some or all of their Founder Shares.
The conditions which must be met in order for the participants to receive any future payout can be summarised as follows:
• the Company must achieve an admission to the London Stock Exchange; 
• the Company must make an acquisition of at least £50 million within two years of the admission date; 
• the Ordinary Shares must achieve an internal rate of return of 8.5% per annum from the market capitalisation at the admission date; and 
• the Company’s market capitalisation must increase by 25% from the market capitalisation at the admission date. 
The last two conditions must both be met for a period of 20 out of 30 consecutive days, during the same 30-day period within five years of 
an acquisition.
The purchase price for the exercise of this option may be paid by the Company in Ordinary Shares or as a cash equivalent at the Company’s 
option. The number of Ordinary Shares required to settle all such options is the number of shares that would have represented 5% of the Ordinary 
Shares of the Company on (or immediately after) listing if such Ordinary Shares had been issued at the time of listing. The equivalent cash value is 
calculated on exercise of the option as the estimated total price of the Ordinary Shares that would have been issued if the option had been settled 
in Ordinary Shares rather than cash, based on the mean of the closing middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share on the London Stock 
Exchange over the 30 business days prior to the exercise of the option.
The fair value of the share options was assessed to be £255,000 and therefore the Company recognised total expenses of £nil relating to this share 
option scheme in the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil).
No shares were issued to the Directors during the year ended 31 December 2017 (2016: nil). 
Non-Standard Finance plc Long-Term Incentive Plan
During the year, awards were made under the Non-Standard Finance plc Long-Term Incentive Plan. The awards were in the form of nil-cost 
options and the issue of C Ordinary Shares in Non-Standard Finance Subsidiary Limited. 
The vesting date for awards is 31 December 2020. On vesting, participants will share in a ‘pool’ equal to 15% of the growth in value, based on 
market capitalisation, of the Company at 31 December 2020, above a share price of £1.10 per share. 
In respect of awards made in the form of nil-cost options, on exercise a participant will receive shares in the Company equal in value to their 
proportion of the pool at vesting. In respect of awards made in the form of shares in Non-Standard Finance Subsidiary Limited, on vesting a 
participant can exchange these shares for shares in the Company equal in value to their proportion of the pool.

28. Financial Instruments – Group
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Directors have delegated 
the responsibility of monitoring financial risk management to the Risk Committee.
The Group ’s objectives are to maintain a well-spread and quality-controlled customer base by applying strong emphasis on good credit 
management, both through strict lending criteria at the time of underwriting and continuously monitoring the collection process.
The average effective interest rate on financial assets of the Group at 31 December 2017 was estimated to be 109% (2016: 111%).
The average effective interest rate on financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2017 was estimated to be 7% (2016: 4%).
Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse market movements caused by active trading positions taken in interest rates, foreign exchange 
markets, bonds and equities. 
The Group does not undertake position taking or trading books of this type and therefore market risk is not a concern.
Interest rate risk
The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates. The Group monitors interest rates but has not chosen to hedge 
this item given the much greater effective interest on financial assets as compared to the effective interest rate on financial liabilities.
A 1% movement in the interest rate applied to financial liabilities during 2017 would not have had a material impact on the Group’s result for 
the year.
Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk inherent in amounts receivable from customers is reviewed under impairment as per note 17 . This risk is minimised by the use 
of credit scoring techniques which are designed to ensure the Group lends only to those customers who we believe can afford the repayments. It 
should be noted that the credit risk at the individual customer level is managed by strict adherence to credit control rules which are regularly 
reviewed. No individual customer contributed more than 10% of the revenue for the Group. Trade and other receivables and cash at bank are not 
considered to have a material credit risk as all material balances are due from highly rated banking counterparties. 
Capital risk management
The Board of Directors assess the capital needs of the Group on an ongoing basis and approve all capital transactions. The Group’s objective in 
respect of capital risk management is to maintain a conservative loan to value ratio level with respect to market conditions, whilst taking account 
of business growth opportunities in a capital-efficient manner.
Liquidity risk
This is the risk that the Group has insufficient resources to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth. The Group’s short-term loans to 
customers provide a natural hedge against medium-term borrowings. The Group has in place sufficient long-term committed debt facilities which 
are sourced from a number of different providers. Cash and covenant forecasting is conducted on a monthly basis as part of the regular 
management reporting exercise. The risk of not having sufficient liquidity resources is therefore low.
The Group monitors its levels of working capital to ensure that it can meet its debt repayments as they fall due.
