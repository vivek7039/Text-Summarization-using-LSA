The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Our Market Drivers
Responding to a changing environment
The Group’s diverse markets, including leadership positions  
in mining and shale energy, mean it is positioned to benefit 
from some of the major structural changes taking place in  
the global economy. 
Global population and migration trends Climate-driven change Socio-economic environment Technology acceleration
The world’s population was estimated to be 7.4 billion 
people in 2017, with the latest analysis from the United 
Nations suggesting it could grow to 8.3 billion by 2030
1
 
– a growth rate of 83 million people annually. 
While the pace of growth has slowed in recent years,  
the upward trend continues. As a result, and supported  
by increased urbanisation, demand for natural resources  
and energy, which drives the Group’s primary markets,  
is expected to continue to rise.
Concerns over climate change has led a number of countries 
to set long-term targets to ban the sale of cars powered only 
by fossil fuels. The UK and France have said any ban would 
take place after 2040, while China has not set a specific date. 
Moves to reduce emissions and increase the use of electric 
vehicles is likely to have a long-term impact on commodities 
such as oil, while also increasing demand on other sources  
of energy, from natural gas to wind and solar. 
The global policy environment is evolving with increased 
political uncertainty in some regions as the benefits of 
globalisation are questioned and trade pacts are renegotiated.
Global economic growth continues to increase with emerging 
economies such as India and China experiencing the largest 
percentage increases. Meanwhile, many governments have 
made infrastructure investment, both domestically and 
internationally, a priority.
The digitisation of industrial products and services is a  
major technology trend. It includes the so-called ‘Internet  
of Things’ (IoT) that combines sensors, cloud computing  
and big data analysis to offer opportunities to increase 
productivity and create new solutions. 
At the same time, advanced manufacturing techniques, 
including 3D printing, continue to improve offering 
opportunities for factories and other industrial facilities  
to become more efficient in the future. Innovation in  
materials science also offers the potential to provide 
alternative production methods. 
Our response
As the global population grows, and more people move  
from the countryside to cities, demand increases for the 
commodities produced by our mining, oil and gas and  
power customers.
As infrastructure investment increases, there will be 
additional demand for commodities processed by Weir’s 
equipment. The Group has also expanded into adjacent 
markets, such as sand and aggregates, that have a more 
direct relationship to infrastructure-led demand.
As consumption increases in emerging economies, there  
will also be additional demand for commodities supported  
by the Group’s equipment.

Our response
The Group operates in a diverse range of markets that  
have the potential to be impacted in different ways by  
the growth in electric transportation and efforts to tackle  
climate change.
While there is uncertainty about when demand for oil may 
peak, it is likely to play a major role in the global energy  
mix for decades to come. Meanwhile, natural gas, which 
produces significantly lower emissions of carbon dioxide 
than coal, is becoming an increasingly popular source of 
energy in both advanced and emerging markets. Increased 
use of solar energy and electric vehicle adoption will also 
increase demand for metals such as copper, with solar 
energy and electric vehicles requiring significantly more 
copper, lithium and cobalt than traditional alternatives.
Our response
The Group operates in more than 70 countries allowing  
it to pursue opportunities on a global scale. We have an 
established presence in many of the fastest-growing 
economies, such as China and India, and are actively 
engaged with key stakeholders in these countries to 
understand the opportunities ahead. The diversity of  
our operations also mitigates political risk more widely. 
Our response
The Group has developed a new technology strategy that 
incorporates how we will adapt and succeed using these 
emerging technologies. Working in partnership with fellow 
technology leaders Microsoft and Dell, we have developed 
our own IoT platform that utilises sensor technology, cloud 
computing and machine learning. Trials of Synertrex
®
 are 
currently underway in a number of global markets. 
We are also committed to extending our capabilities in 
advanced manufacturing, materials science and increasing 
the sustainability of our markets through improving energy 
and water efficiency. More details on our technology 
strategy can be found on page 18.

Generating value for all our stakeholders
While 2017’s market trends provided  
a welcome tailwind, they were  
anticipated by the Group and Weir  
was well positioned to act quickly  
and take full advantage of the upturn  
in both North American oil and gas  
and global mining markets. 
This led the Group to outperform these 
markets and in doing so reaffirmed the 
strength of its business model, the clarity 
of its strategy and quality of our near 
15,000 people around the world. The 
Board experienced this directly on a visit 
to South Africa, where the benefits of 
Weir’s culture and commitment to being 
an active partner in local communities  
was a real highlight. 
You can read more about the Board’s  
visit on page 81.
On behalf of the Board, I wish to record 
our gratitude to all Weir employees  
for their efforts throughout the year  
in delivering for our shareholders, 
customers and communities.
Financial results
I am pleased to report a strong year  
of growth for your Company. Reported 
revenues increased to £2,356m, up 28%. 
On a constant currency basis, revenues 
were 19% higher year-on-year. Pre-tax 
profits from continuing operations,  
before exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation, of £250m represent  
a 47% increase on the previous year. 
Reported profit after tax of £162m  
was up 274% from 2016.
You can read more in the Financial 
Review on page 24. 
Shareholder returns
We are proposing a final dividend 
payment of 29.0p per share, making 
44.0p for the full year. 
Sustainable growth
By definition, Weir, with its heritage 
stretching back to 1871, has proven  
itself to be a sustainable business.  
This has been achieved, amongst other 
things, by aligning the interests of the 
Group with those of the communities  
in which we operate. 
Dear Shareholder,
2017 saw the Group take full 
advantage of the improvement  
in our main markets by leveraging 
our business model and effectively 
delivering our strategy to produce 
increased value for our stakeholders.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Charles Berry
Chairman The Board recognises that the business 
will be more successful if it partners  
with stakeholders and makes a positive 
contribution to society. The Group does 
this in a variety of ways from supporting 
local employment and suppliers to 
working with governments and local 
communities to help educate the next 
generation of engineers. 
In the UK, this includes the Primary 
Engineer programme that aims to 
encourage young pupils from all 
backgrounds to consider a career 
in science, technology, engineering  
or mathematics. 
The Group is also promoting greater 
diversity and inclusion in a sector that  
has traditionally been male-dominated. 
The best ideas come from a variety of 
perspectives and, as a company that  
relies on the innovation and ingenuity of 
all our people, we need to be a workplace 
that allows everyone’s talent to flourish. 
The Board will reach its aim of ensuring 
that at least a third of its members are 
female following the 2018 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), two years ahead of our 
original 2020 target. 
While this is welcome progress, we  
must increase diversity throughout the 
organisation, from those starting out in 
their careers to senior leaders, and each 
business has plans in place to help them 
achieve this aim. 
Governance and Board changes
As previously announced, there were 
some significant changes to the 
composition of your Board in 2017. 
On 30 September, Melanie Gee stood 
down as a Non-Executive Director and 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
having served for six years. John Mogford 
and Alan Ferguson also announced during 
the year that they would not be seeking 
re-election at the 2018 AGM, having 
served ten and seven years respectively. 
I would like to formally record the  
Group’s thanks to Melanie, John and  
Alan for their exceptional service to  
Weir during their terms. 
Clare Chapman and Barbara Jeremiah 
joined the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors in August of 2017. Clare is  
the former Group People Director of  
BT Group plc and succeeded Melanie 
Gee as the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. Barbara, who is a former 
Executive Vice-President of Alcoa, joined 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
In January 2018, Stephen Young, former 
CEO of Meggitt plc, joined the Board and 
he will succeed Alan Ferguson as Audit 
Committee Chairman from 28 April 2018.
Looking ahead to the rest of 2018, the 
Board will focus on continuing to support 
CEO Jon Stanton as he executes our 
strategy and builds an even more 
sustainable business.

The Weir Group PLC

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 2017 saw the Group deliver strong 
growth and strategic progress by 
being proactive and leveraging our 
leadership positions in increasingly 
attractive markets.
Strategic progress
People
Safety is our number one priority and  
I am pleased to report excellent progress 
in the past year. The Group’s total incident 
rate (TIR), our primary measure of safety 
performance, reduced from 0.66 to 0.53, 
a 20% improvement. This has been 
achieved by a clear commitment from the 
top of the organisation through the Chief 
Executive’s Safety Committee and other 
initiatives, but more importantly by the 
widespread adoption of a bottom-up 
behavioural safety culture that focuses  
on reducing harm and ensuring our 
people have a safe start, safe finish and 
safe journey home. There are parts of  
the Group that consistently achieve zero 
harm, but we won’t be satisfied until that  
is consistent across all our businesses. 
In addition to improving safety, we  
have also re-invested in our people 
development programmes. This was  
an area where the business cut  
back during the downturn and it was 
important to rebuild in order to maintain 
our strong record of execution. Having 
leaders who can mentor and develop  
the potential of their teams is vital. The 
quality and passion of our people is a real 
differentiator for Weir and ensuring we 
have a highly skilled and fully engaged 
workforce is critical to our future success. 
Going forward, safety will continue to be 
our number one priority. We have also 
developed a new people strategy aimed 
at strengthening our culture and inspiring 
our people to reach their potential and 
build a personal legacy. It includes  
a new approach to strategic workforce 
planning and reviewing the employee 
experience to ensure it aligns with  
our culture and allows us to recruit and 
retain a diverse and vibrant workforce.
To help ensure our performance is fully 
aligned to the interests of our investors 
we’ll introduce an all-employee share 
ownership plan in 2019. The success of 
the Group depends on the efforts of all 
our people and it is right that we give 
them a real stake in our future. You can 
read further details of our proposed plan 
in our Remuneration Committee report 
from page 95.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Delivering sustainable long-term performance
we have a good sense of where we  
want to go as a business and how we  
are going to get there. That includes 
agreeing new key performance indicators 
to be delivered over the medium term, 
starting in 2018. They are: 
• Improved sustainable engagement  
and organisational effectiveness
• Increased market share
• Improved percentage of revenues  
from new solutions
• Sustainably higher margins through  
the cycle
These indicators will guide our short-  
to medium-term progress and will  
require excellent execution of our 
strategy, building on the good  
progress delivered in 2017.
This time last year I set out our new 
‘We are Weir’ strategic framework. 
It gave the Group a clear future 
direction and articulated the distinctive 
competencies – People, Customers, 
Technology, and Performance – that 
will help Weir achieve our vision of 
being the most admired engineering 
business in our markets.
As 2017 progressed, ‘We are Weir’ gained 
real traction across the business with 
teams from all over the world contributing 
to a vibrant debate about how best to 
execute our new strategy and deliver 
strong returns for all our stakeholders. 
That passion and shared sense of 
purpose is extremely important and 
powerful. As we look to the future,

Executive 
Officer Customers
Our customers are the reason we exist 
and thrive. Every Weir colleague should 
wake up each day thinking how we can 
do more to help our customers do better. 
Traditionally, we have taken a product-led 
approach, but as part of the We are Weir 
strategic framework, we are moving to an 
integrated solutions mindset in which our 
people spend more time on site, listening 
to customers’ operational challenges and 
then designing a package of solutions to 
help them achieve their goals. 
This approach helps embed Weir  
even further into the operations of our 
customers and differentiates us more 
clearly from competitors. In Minerals, it 
helped increase orders ahead of global 
mining and sustaining capital spending. Oil 
& Gas also outperformed North American 
rig count growth, leveraging their key 
account management programme to build 
even closer relationships with leading 
oilfield services companies. Flow Control 
grew aftermarket orders in tough markets 
and reshaped its sales and marketing 
structure to increase its customer intimacy.
We will continue to build even closer 
customer relationships in the future, 
building on the competitive advantage 
provided by our comprehensive service 
network and seeking to continue to take 
early advantage of market trends. We  
will also work closely with customers  
to jointly develop new technologies  
that help them achieve their objectives 
and further embed Weir at the heart  
of their operations. 
You can read more in our divisional 
operational reviews beginning on  
page 28.
Technology
The Group delivered revenues of  
£168m from new solutions in 2017, a 
53% increase, as we continued to benefit 
from our commitment to research and 
development (R&D) during the downturns 
that affected both mining and oil and gas 
markets. We also made progress towards 
our aim of investing 2% of revenues in 
R&D with 2017 expenditure of £40m 
(2016: £27m) representing 1.7% of  
sales, up from 1.5% in 2016. Our next 
generation frac pump, the SPM
®
 QEM 
3000, is on trial with a number of the 
larger oilfield services companies, 
positioning the Group to benefit from  
any capital replacement cycle as frac 
fleets are upgraded in the future. 
The Group’s Internet of Things (IoT) 
technology, Synertrex
®
, was also 
successfully trialled in a number of 
regions, allowing customers to easily 
monitor the performance of their 
equipment and giving Weir valuable  
data to support future innovation. 
Alongside our established process of 
product development, the Group has 
developed a new technology strategy  
that will ensure we continue to lead  
the change in our markets and build  
on our legacy of innovative engineering.  
It includes increasing the digitisation  
of our solutions and operations, 
integrating advanced manufacturing into 
our factories, reinforcing our materials 
science leadership and developing ways 
to reduce our customers’ energy and 
water consumption; helping underpin  
the sustainability of our end markets.
Performance
Operational excellence has been a 
traditional strength of the Group and  
in 2017 we took important steps to 
reinvigorate our Value Chain Excellence 
(VCE) initiatives across the business. 
Reviews were conducted to assess  
the potential of every business unit  
to make improvements. 
More than 80 VCE projects were  
initiated, supported by extensive training 
programmes, and targeted at increasing 
on time delivery and reducing inventory 
turns. While overall working capital 
increased during the year as the business 
grew quickly, there was progress on 
increasing inventory turns. 
In 2018, we expect that progress to 
accelerate as we see some of the 
benefits of our renewed focus on 
operational excellence come through.  
In the longer term, we aim to significantly 
improve working capital performance 
supporting the Group’s ability to invest  
in further growth opportunities.
Capital allocation
In July, the Group acquired leading  
South East Asian wellhead manufacturer 
KOP Surface Products for an equivalent 
enterprise value of US$114m to support 
growth of our pressure control offering  
in the eastern hemisphere. KOP’s 
technology complements Weir’s  
existing Oil & Gas portfolio and will  
help accelerate progress in attractive 
Middle East and Asian markets. 
2017 markets and business review
The Group’s financial performance in 2017 
reflects the proactive approach taken by 
the business to act early and invest in 
extending our competitive advantages. 
This, coupled with rapid improvement  
in market conditions in North American  
oil and gas and increased investment  
by miners on brownfield assets, 
contributed to a 20% increase in  
constant currency orders.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The performance of the Oil & Gas  
division in particular was excellent. It 
moved from a £9m operating loss in  
2016 to an operating profit of £92m in  
2017. As the oil price and North American 
rig count recovered through the year, the 
division’s main manufacturing facility in  
Fort Worth, Texas, flexed its operations 
and significantly increased capacity, 
moving from one shift to three. As a 
result of previous reductions in fixed  
costs, the facility delivered excellent 
operating leverage that contributed  
to its overall performance.
Minerals delivered double-digit order 
growth as it captured opportunities  
in global mining markets. Alongside  
its integrated solutions strategy that 
delivered £67m in revenues, the division 
invested in additional sales and project 
engineers to support future growth,  
as confidence and quotation activity  
in mining markets increased. 
As orders grew there were some  
limited operational issues in the  
division as a result of plant and  
supply chain reconfigurations.  
While these were short-term, they, 
alongside the additional investment  
and some project delays, had an  
impact on the division’s operating  
margin, but it remained within its  
normal long-term range. 
Flow Control turned a corner in the 
second half of the year after its first  
half performance was impacted by  
tough market conditions in power and 
downstream oil and gas, while the 
division also recorded a one-off charge  
of £13m resulting from legacy contract 
challenges in its Gabbioneta business.  
This resulted in the division recording  
a small operating loss of £3m for the  
full year. As 2017 progressed, there  
were early signs of recovery in mid  
and downstream oil and gas markets 
while nuclear activity in China and  
South Korea continued to progress,  
with the division delivering good  
growth in its valves aftermarket  
business. After a restructuring of  
its sales and marketing capability,  
the division is now clearly focused on 
capturing future growth opportunities.

Investment by exploration and production 
companies in upstream North American 
markets is also expected to increase, 
supported by commodity prices and 
increased efficiencies in the industry. 
Power, mid and downstream oil  
and gas markets are showing initial  
indications of improvement. 
To fully benefit from these trends,  
the Group will leverage the four  
distinctive competencies at the  
heart of our strategic framework;  
People, Customers, Technology  
and Performance. 
Looking to 2018, assuming market 
conditions remain supportive, we  
expect to deliver strong constant  
currency revenue and profit growth  
and further balance sheet deleveraging.

Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive Officer’s Q&A
Building a stronger legacy
Q 
What are your reflections on 
your first full year as Weir CEO?
The main highlight for me was the 
adoption of the We are Weir strategy. 
I’ve spoken to hundreds of our people  
in the past year and there has been 
great enthusiasm from across our  
global operations. This is a Group with  
a strong culture, great optimism and  
a clear view of the role we all have to 
play in building a stronger legacy for 
future generations. 
Another highlight is the decisiveness 
we showed in responding to the rapid 
improvement in our core markets. We 
were aggressive during the downturn 
and we were determined to be equally 
proactive in the upturn. I think we’ve 
done that well, particularly in Oil & Gas, 
where the recovery was steepest. We 
did that while at the same time making 
good strategic progress that will deliver 
value over the long term.
In terms of improvements, I think we 
still have work to do to optimise our 
operations. 2017 was about identifying 
opportunities and the years ahead will 
be about seizing those opportunities to 
become more efficient and better serve 
our customers.
Q 
How has the Group’s strategy 
developed in the past year?
We’ve made good progress in defining 
our technology strategy during the year. 
The appointment of our new Chief 
Technology Officer, Geetha Dabir,  
whose career has been spent in Silicon 
Valley, has brought a new perspective 
and focus to the business, as we 
increasingly digitise our offering. We’re 
also developing a new people strategy 
led by our new Chief People Officer, 
Rosemary McGinness, to ensure we 
promote a high-performance culture  
and have the capabilities we will need  
to succeed in the years ahead. We’ll  
do more work to refine that strategy 
throughout 2018. We are also further 
integrating sustainability throughout the 
business and we’ll establish baselines  
in the next year in terms of our own 
performance, in addition to helping our 
customers operate more sustainably.
Q 
The Group operates in cyclical 
markets, how sustainable are 
current conditions?
Industry expectations are also for a 
multi-year upturn in the mining capital 
cycle supported by anticipated demand 
for commodities like copper as the world 
invests more in infrastructure and the 
move towards electric vehicles. 
In oil and gas we’ve clearly seen a 
structural change with shale oil and  
gas becoming very competitive and 
maturing into a dependable source of 
global energy supply. North America and 
the Middle East are the most attractive  
oil and gas markets in the world and  
they also happen to be where most of  
our activity in this industry takes place.  
So I think we are in the right places, with 
good market positions.
Finally, conditions in mid and downstream oil 
and gas and power – both served by Flow 
Control – are showing some green shoots 
of recovery after a prolonged downturn. 
Overall, our markets are increasingly 
attractive and we are well positioned  
to take advantage of those improved 
conditions.
Q 
What are the other main trends 
you see impacting the Group  
in the future?
As a truly global business that serves 
natural resources and energy customers, 
there are many issues we look at. Firstly, 
the health of the global economy, which 
improved in 2017 as growth picked up  
in advanced and emerging economies, 
driving demand for commodities. 
Secondly, tackling climate change is 
clearly a priority and we are investigating 
how we can help customers reduce 
their energy and water usage as well  
as reducing our own environmental 
impact. And thirdly, technology is 
changing rapidly, with ‘big data’ and 
advanced manufacturing increasingly 
important in the markets we serve. 
This is a Group with  
a strong culture, great  
optimism and a clear  
view of the role we all  
have to play in building  
a stronger legacy for  
future generations.
That is why we have a new technology 
strategy to take advantage of these 
changes. There are many more issues  
I could highlight, but uniting them all  
is the importance of being proactive  
and agile as a business so that we can 
respond to changes quickly and capture 
opportunities wherever they are.
Q 
And how does this impact your 
view on allocating capital?
We have some really strong market 
positions and we are focused on using 
those as a platform to grow in what are 
increasingly attractive markets. 
Take comminution (crushing, grinding 
and screening), where we increased 
capability with the acquisition of  
Trio Engineered Products in 2014.  
This allowed us to offer our mining 
customers a wider portfolio of  
products while also giving us access  
to sand and aggregates markets. 
Since the acquisition, the Minerals 
division has applied its materials  
science knowledge to develop new 
crusher technologies and leveraged  
its comprehensive service network to 
globalise the Trio brand in both mining 
and sand, and aggregates, markets. To 
give a sense of the progress, in 2017, 
comminution revenues for original 
equipment increased by a third. 
So where there are opportunities  
to accelerate our strategy through 
disciplined mergers and acquisition 
activity, we’ll take them.

The Group is committed to delivering 
a zero-harm workplace for all our 
people. Everyone has the right and 
responsibility to stop operations if 
they have any safety concerns.
Keeping our people safe 
Overview
The Group is committed to delivering  
a zero-harm workplace for all our people. 
This means ensuring they have a safe 
journey to work, care for each other  
and return to their families safe and 
healthy each day. A safe Weir is 
ultimately a more efficient and 
productive organisation generating  
value for all our stakeholders.
To achieve this we have a comprehensive 
strategy based around our Weir Zero 
Harm programme, which started in 2011 
and since then has continually evolved, 
delivering year-on-year improvements  
in safety for all our people. 
Progress achieved in 2017 was 
enhanced by a focus on behaviours.  
This saw a concerted Group-wide effort 
to encourage people at every level of 
the organisation to look for, demonstrate 
and promote the behaviours that keep 
them and their colleagues safe. 
Overall, this emphasis on behavioural 
safety helped achieve a 20% 
improvement in total incident rate 
to 0.53.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Changing behaviours
In 2017, our new health and safety charter 
and programme was rolled out across  
all businesses. One of our units, Weir 
Pressure Pumping, based in Fort Worth, 
Texas, is our largest facility and over the 
course of the year they have delivered 
marked improvements across a number 
of areas.
This was achieved by moving to a  
more proactive approach when dealing 
with health and safety issues, with all 
employees empowered to call out safety 
concerns to colleagues and managers.
To achieve a change in behaviour and 
attitude within the business, it was 
essential that all employees were  
given the training and tools needed  
to improve their safety and the welfare  
of their colleagues.
Sharing best practice
In early February 2017, Weir Pressure 
Pumping rolled out initial pilot training 
across a number of functional areas 
including Supply Chain and Operations, 
with the aim of embedding a new 
behavioural approach within the 
business towards health and safety 
and hazard perception. 
It was seen as critical that every person  
in the business unit understood the 
Company’s health and safety roadmap 
and what role they could play in improving 
their own working space and environment. 
Part of this training included teaching 
managers to seek mentoring opportunities 
that are designed to enable comfortable 
conversations between colleagues about 
reducing risk. 
Around 90% of the workforce were 
trained in 2017, and by the end of the 
year, 694 mentoring opportunities had 
been recorded, each one providing a 
unique opportunity for management to 
speak with an employee and discuss 
potential improvements. The more of 
these discussions that take place, the  
less likelihood there is of an injury or 
accident occurring. The business is also 
ensuring that all observations are shared 
globally online to allow the wider Group 
visibility and the opportunity to learn  
from these procedures.

Part of the Group’s strategy has been to 
extend into adjacent markets where we 
can leverage our technology leadership 
and materials science expertise. 
Comminution (crushing, grinding and 
screening) is a process common to both 
mining and sand and aggregates markets. 
Since the acquisition of Trio Engineered 
Products in 2014, the Minerals division 
has developed new crusher products  
and globalised Trio’s offering, leveraging 
its customer relationships in markets 
around the world. 
This approach, combined with the 
division’s integrated solutions strategy to 
focus on helping customers improve the 
productivity of their existing or brownfield 
assets, has increased Weir’s installed 
base of original equipment in markets 
that generate significant aftermarket 
demand for spares and services. 
16
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Crusher and screen performance 
are now predictable, maintenance 
is predictable and future planning 
is possible without running 
operations from day to day. 
Working with Weir was one 
of the best things I have ever 
done and I should have done 
this a long time ago.
CNC owner
Carl Crous
The challenge
Weir Minerals customer CNC 
Crushers  (Pty) Ltd operates a crushing  
and screening plant in the North West 
province of South Africa. The aggregates 
plant, which has been operating since 
2006, used older model crushers and 
screens with outdated technology.  
This led to high wear on crusher  
liners, increased oil consumption  
and costly unplanned downtime,  
that all impacted productivity.
Our solution
The Weir Minerals team proposed 
upgrading the secondary cone crusher 
from an old technology to a new Trio
®
 
TC51 standard hydraulic cone crusher.
The tertiary cone crusher was also 
changed to a Trio
®
 TC36 standard 
hydraulic cone crusher. The new 
technology Trio
®
 cone crushers feature  
a hydraulically adjusted closed side 
setting and relief, allowing for quick 
adjustment and providing added 
protection by preventing uncrushable 
material from entering the crusher and 
causing damage. In addition, three Trio
®
 
inclined screens were installed. 
To support the future operations of  
the plant, a service agreement was 
signed between Weir Minerals and  
CNC Crushers. Regular inspections  
are now conducted by a Trio
®
 product 
support specialist and all machines are 
well maintained. The service agreement 
ensures best practice is adhered to in 
operating and maintaining the equipment. 
This helps the plant achieve maximum 
availability and long operational life of 
its equipment. 
The results
Since the Weir team deployed an 
integrated solutions approach: 
• Plant production has improved by  
60% as a result of the maximum 
availability of equipment.
• Downtime for liner changes has 
reduced by 13%.
• Start-up procedures are quick and 
simple, while adjustment of the 
crusher takes only 5 minutes 
compared to 90 minutes with the 
old technology crushers.
• Socket liner life has extended from  
two months to over 12 months due  
to the lubrication power unit system 
used with the Trio
®
 equipment.
• The payback period for the package  
of solutions was just 24 months.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Our new technology roadmap
Overview
In 2017, the Group developed a new 
technology roadmap aimed at ensuring 
we continue to maintain and enhance 
our market leadership positions to 
take full advantage of emerging 
technology trends. 
These include improving customers’ 
digital experience and the increasing 
digitisation of industrial products  
through the so-called Internet of Things 
(IoT). IoT deploys sensors on machines 
and extracts and transmits the data 
using cloud software. It also involves  
the use of machine learning to analyse 
the vast amount of ‘big data’ produced 
by industrial products. 
The strategy includes opportunities to 
develop and deploy software platforms 
that enhance Weir’s own operations 
enabling the Group to achieve future 
efficiencies. These include smart 
factories and advanced manufacturing, 
where we have already seen initial 
benefits from the 3D printing of some 
component parts.
And to enhance the sustainability of 
our main markets such as mining, we  
are examining how we can help our 
customers reduce their energy and water 
consumption using our engineering  
and materials science expertise.
 
Strategy in Action: 
Technology
The Group’s technology leadership in its 
main markets is a significant competitive 
advantage. As our markets evolve, we 
are committed to leading the technology 
change in our industries.

gain detailed insights into the equipment’s 
behaviour. This data can be captured by 
computers placed in close proximity to 
our equipment and analysed to determine 
whether an alarm should be raised. This 
alarm will notify one of our local engineers 
who can go to the site and solve the issue 
at hand, in many cases preventing 
unplanned and expensive downtime.
Helping optimise assets
Synertrex

 will enhance our product  
and service offering, enabling our 
customers to better understand how  
our products operate in real-time.  
From the data collected, we can  
advise our customers on how they  
can make better use of our products.
Readings and critical extracts of the 
real-time data are sent to the cloud  
where it can be displayed on our 
customers’ performance dashboard,  
sent as an alert to their mobile device  
or stored for further analysis using 
analytical tools. Integrating data directly 
into our customers’ existing operational 
systems ensures ease of access anytime, 
anywhere for operators, maintenance 
teams and process engineers, to optimise 
operational performance and reliability.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Continuous improvement
Overview
VCE is a vital component in optimising 
our business performance and delivering 
improved efficiencies to our customers. 
VCE uses a structured framework and 
set of tools to drive change across the 
organisation to add value, eliminate 
waste and improve our bottom line. 
There are five themes in our VCE 
process: customer, procurement, 
engineering, planning and lean 
management. These look at ways to 
eliminate all types of waste or non-value 
added activities. By analysing and 
evaluating our performance in each of 
these areas against key performance 
indicators, we are able to drive 
improvements for customers. 
In 2017, we took steps to re-focus  
our VCE strategy, attempting to  
improve our performance in three  
key areas: increasing on-time delivery, 
improving inventory turns and reducing 
the cost of poor quality. 
Strategy in Action: 
Performance
Utilising Value Chain Excellence (VCE) 
to deliver improved efficiencies for  
our customers and drive change  
across the organisation. 
20
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Utilising a variety of Value Chain 
Excellence methods, Weir Malaysia  
has consistently managed to improve 
the on-time delivery rate of its rubber 
sheet products. VCE relies on our people, 
customers and technology 
working together to drive 
improved performance at  
the heart of our business. 
Adopting VCE in operations
Weir Malaysia identified an opportunity 
to use VCE methods to increase 
efficiency and customer satisfaction.
The business, which delivers rubber 
sheets to customers’ specific 
requirements, focused its efforts 
on improving machine performance  
to deliver higher output and reduce 
waste. By adopting lean manufacturing 
tools such as value stream mapping, 
‘kaizens’ and a daily ‘war room’ for team 
meetings, they identified opportunities  
to increase productivity. 
The opportunities were digitally  
simulated to test the results of this 
approach and analyse the potential  
to reduce machine downtime and 
increase throughput. The business 
constantly evaluated performance  
and focused on any deviation, putting 
corrective actions in place quickly. 
In addition, the business trained staff 
to have the essential skills they need 
to work across a set of machines, 
all underpinned by appropriate safety 
and risk assessments.
The value of VCE
By using VCE tools to identify and 
improve operations, the business  
has increased machine efficiency  
and productivity. This has translated  
into greater velocity and ultimately 
improved on-time-delivery, which  
has led to greater customer demand.
Weir Malaysia is now focusing on 
maintaining its new standards and 
achieving continual improvements. 
The VCE lessons of 2017 are now 
being shared across departments.
Key lessons include the value of  
engaging a wide variety of stakeholders 
to increase collaboration and deliver 
improved performance for the business 
and better outcomes for customers.

Description Description Description
The Group delivered strong order 
growth in both its Oil & Gas and 
Minerals divisions as demand for its 
solutions increased. Flow Control 
orders were impacted by tough 
market conditions in both power and 
downstream oil and gas markets. 
Profit before tax increased significantly 
principally reflecting a return to growth 
by the Oil & Gas division. Profitability in 
Minerals was impacted by investment 
in growth initiatives, project phasing 
and plant reconfigurations. Flow 
Control was impacted by one-off 
charges in the first half.
Cash flow from operations reduced  
as a result of increased investment  
in working capital to support strong 
growth, particularly in the Minerals  
and Oil & Gas divisions. Flow Control’s 
cash flow performance reflected its 
reduced profitability.

2017 has been a year of significant 
turnaround driven by our Oil & Gas 
division which, against an improving 
market backdrop, demonstrated great 
execution to deliver a 67% increase in 
revenues and a £101m increase in 
operating profit without faltering on 
customer commitments. With Minerals 
markets at the beginning of a positive 
upcycle, after a tough few years, we took 
the opportunity to invest in people and 
facilities to ensure that our Minerals 
division is optimally placed to build upon 
its market leading position and maximise 
the opportunities for growth through the 
upcoming market cycle. 
Financial highlights
Order input and revenue (on a constant 
currency basis) increased by 20% and 19% 
respectively, primarily as a result of the 
significant upturn in North American oil 
and gas markets together with a strong 
Minerals performance. Aftermarket input 
growth was 22% and original equipment 
orders grew by 16%. On a reported basis, 
revenues grew by 28%, supported by a 
£127m foreign exchange translation benefit. 
Profit before tax, amortisation and 
exceptional items of £250m was up by 
47%, primarily driven by our Oil & Gas 
division. Operating exceptional charges of 
£13m were incurred, mainly in right-sizing 
operations in later cycle markets. The 
reported profit before tax from continuing 
operations of £181m compares to £43m 
in 2016. A £119m investment in working 
capital to support current and future year 
growth resulted in a free cash outflow of 
£24m, leaving net debt £8m higher than 
2016 at £843m with net debt to EBITDA 
improving to 2.5 times. 
Excellent Oil & Gas performance
Oil & Gas showed great operational 
execution to respond to the improving 
market conditions in North America by 
delivering a 67% increase in constant 
currency revenues and a 36% flow through 
to profits, which resulted in operating 
margins of 13% compared to a small loss 
in 2016. This was achieved by leveraging 
a significantly reduced overhead base 
compared to the previous cycle which, 
along with other industry players, is 
contributing to the establishment of  
shale as a highly cost-competitive  
source of oil and gas for global markets.
Overview
Having delivered strong revenue and  
profit growth in 2017, the positive outlook 
for our Minerals and Oil & Gas markets, 
together with our disciplined investment 
in strategic priorities and improving 
leverage ratios, mean that we look  
forward with confidence.

Officer Order input
Order input at £2,395m increased 20% 
on a constant currency basis. Original 
equipment orders were £722m. 
Aftermarket orders were £1,673m. 
Minerals order input increased by 11%  
to £1,347m (2016: £1,215m). Improved 
commodity prices continued to support 
the industry’s drive to increase production 
and improve efficiency of current mining 
operations. Original equipment orders 
were up 14% year-on-year reflecting 
increased brownfield wins driven by  
our strong service and engineering 
network in close proximity to mine  
sites as well as a small number of initial 
greenfield and major expansion projects. 
Aftermarket orders, at 70% of total  
input (2016: 71%), increased by 9%.  
The division showed positive book  
to bill of 1.05 for the full year.
Oil & Gas input at £732m (2016: £438m) 
was 67% higher (64% on a like for like 
basis) reflecting the recovery in North 
American upstream activity as oil prices 
and technological advances supported 
increased activity. These factors resulted 
in an improving oil price throughout the 
year and saw a 74% increase in North 
American rig count, principally through  
the first part of the year before stabilising. 
International markets were more subdued 
although showed some initial signs of 
increased quotation activity towards  
the end of the year, especially in the 
Middle East. A positive book-to-bill ratio 
for the division of 1.04 for the full year 
demonstrates the momentum that  
we carry into 2018.
Flow Control order input decreased by 
6% to £316m (2016: £336m), principally 
driven by continued weakness in mid and 
downstream oil and gas markets, with 
input across the Power sector broadly 
stable and Industrial markets showing 
initial growth. Original equipment orders 
were down 16% driven by lower project 
activity while aftermarket input improved 
by 6% due to increased focus and the 
end of destocking activities by a number 
of customers. 
Group revenue
Revenue of £2,356m showed growth  
of 19% on a constant currency basis 
mainly reflecting the improvement in 
orders in the Oil & Gas division and 
continued strong input performance in 
Minerals. Aftermarket accounted for 69% 
of revenues, remaining consistent with 
prior year. Reported revenues increased 
28%, supported by a foreign exchange 
translation benefit of £127m. 
Minerals revenue was 7% higher on  
a constant currency basis at £1,287m 
(2016: £1,201m). Both original equipment 
and aftermarket revenues were 7%  
higher with strong growth across  
South America, Africa and Asia Pacific. 
Reported revenues increased by 16% 
(2016: £1,112m), supported by a foreign 
exchange translation benefit of £89m.
Oil & Gas revenue increased by 67%  
to £704m on a constant currency basis 
(2016: £421m) and 64% on a like-for-like 
basis, reflecting order input trends. 
Reported revenues increased by 75%, 
after a £20m foreign exchange translation 
benefit. North American revenues 
increased sequentially throughout  
the year, reflecting input trends while 
International revenues stabilised during 
the second half of the year.
Flow Control revenue increased by  
4% on a constant currency basis to 
£365m (2016: £350m), with aftermarket 
revenues unchanged from the prior year 
and original equipment revenues up 7% 
driven by delivery of a large part of the 
legacy order book for downstream oil

The Financial Review includes a mixture of GAAP measures and  
those which have been derived from our reported results in order  
to provide a useful basis for measuring our operational performance. 
Operating results are for continuing operations before exceptional  
items and intangibles amortisation as provided in the Consolidated 
Income Statement. Details of other non-GAAP measures are  
provided in note 2 of the financial statements.
1.  Continuing operations excludes American Hydro Corporation  
and Ynfiniti Engineering Services, which were disposed of  
during H1 2016 and are reported as discontinued operations.
2.  2016 restated at 2017 average exchange rates.
3.  Adjusted to exclude exceptional items and intangibles amortisation. 
Reported operating profit and profit before tax from continuing 
operations were £223m (2016: £90m) and £181m (2016: £43m) 
respectively. Reported earnings per share from total operations were 
73.5p (2016: 17.8p).
4.  Cash from operations includes both continuing and 
discontinued operations.
5.  Calculation is at covenant basis with net debt at average rates.
6.  Continuing operations EBIT before exceptional items (excluding  
KOP EBIT) divided by average net assets (excluding KOP net assets) 
excluding net debt and pension deficit (net of deferred tax asset).

Net finance costs
Total net finance costs, including 
exceptional items, were £43m (2016: 
£48m). There were four components of 
this net charge, the most significant being 
the interest cost of £38m (2016: £41m)  
on  the Group’s borrowings (including 
amounts in relation to derivative financial 
instruments). The other elements were 
a charge of £4m (2016: £3m) in relation  
to the Group’s defined benefit pension 
plans and an exceptional cost of £1m 
(2016: £4m) being the unwind of the 
discount on contingent consideration 
liabilities. The overall decrease of £3m 
compared to 2016 was principally due to 
the favourable impact of foreign exchange 
on US$-denominated interest payments.
Net finance costs (excluding retirement 
benefit related amounts and exceptional 
items) were covered 7.7 times (2016: 5.3 
times) by operating profit from continuing 
operations, before exceptional items and 
intangibles amortisation.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax from continuing 
operations (before exceptional items  
and intangibles amortisation) increased  
by 47% to £250m (2016: £170m).  
The reported profit before tax from 
continuing operations of £181m  
compares to £43m in 2016. 
Exceptional items and  
intangibles amortisation
Exceptional items resulted in a reduced 
charge of £13m (2016: £74m) with 
intangibles amortisation at £55m 
(2016: £50m).
Restructuring and rationalisation charges 
of £13m in the current year predominantly 
represent the continuation of programmes 
to right-size operations and realign certain

rose by 10% reflecting an £18m foreign 
exchange translation benefit.
Operating profit
Operating profit from continuing 
operations (before exceptional items  
and intangibles amortisation) increased 
by £78m (36%) to £292m on a reported 
basis. Excluding an £18m foreign 
currency translation benefit, the 
constant currency increase was £60m. 
Oil & Gas delivered an excellent 
operating performance, increasing 
operating profits by £101m through 
successfully leveraging workforce and 
supply chain requirements to meet 
increased North American demand. The 
Minerals constant currency operating 
profit reduction of £7m reflects strong 
underlying growth offset by a £25m 
investment in growth initiatives including 
one-off costs of £10m associated with 
reconfiguring operational capacity as 
volumes increase. Flow Control saw  
a £35m year-on-year constant currency 
reduction primarily due to £13m of 
one-off costs related to legacy contracts 
in downstream oil and gas and associated 
under-recoveries in that business. 
Second half operating margins in Flow 
Control returned to mid-single digits 
following the one-off charges incurred  
in the first half of the year. 
Unallocated costs were unchanged  
from the prior year at £24m. 
Operating profit (including exceptional 
items and intangibles amortisation) for 
the year of £223m was £133m higher 
than the prior year due to the £78m 
increase in underlying operating profit 
and a £55m reduction in exceptional 
items and intangibles amortisation. 
activities, including the later cycle 
international markets in Oil & Gas  
and the downstream oil and gas  
pump business in Flow Control. 
The remaining elements of the 
exceptional charge in the year are £2m 
of costs associated with the finalisation 
of historical legal claims, a £10m gain 
on sale of our 49% share in the Energy 
Products LLC joint venture and a fair 
value adjustment of £9m to contingent 
consideration, reflecting the final 
settlement for the acquisition of the 
remaining 40% of Weir International, 
our Korean valves business. 
The exceptional tax credit of £41m 
includes £17m of tax on the exceptional 
operating items and amortisation 
described above. In addition it includes  
a one-off £24m credit in respect of the 
impact of US tax reform following the 
signing into law on 22 December 2017 of 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The one-off 
credit arises from revaluing US deferred 
tax assets and liabilities at the reduced US 
federal corporate income tax rate of 21% 
(previously 35%) and from the release of 
previously held tax provisions for US tax 
on unremitted overseas earnings which 
will no longer be required.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year of £60m 
(2016: £38m) on profit before tax  
from continuing operations (before 
exceptional items and intangibles 
amortisation) of £250m (2016: £170m) 
represents an underlying effective tax  
rate (ETR) of 23.9% (2016: 22.5%).  
Our ETR is principally driven by the 
geographical mix of profits arising in  
our business and, to a lesser extent,  
by the impact of Group financing and 
transfer pricing arrangements.
26
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 The Group has a robust framework  
to mitigate tax risks, together with a 
prudent and consistent approach to  
tax provisioning. This is discussed  
further in note 2.
In terms of cash tax, the Group paid 
income tax of £61m in 2017 across all  
of its jurisdictions compared to £16m  
in 2016, the increase principally driven  
by the non-repeat of cash tax refunds 
received in the prior period in respect  
of tax losses in the US. 
Capital expenditure
We were able to increase investment  
in our strategic priorities with net capital 
expenditure increasing from £62m to 
£81m, reflecting a return to previous 
expenditure levels. 
Cashflow and net debt
Free cash flow from continuing operations 
was an outflow of £24m (2016: inflow 
£130m), before cash exceptional items  
of £29m. Cash from operating activities 
reduced by £72m from £293m in 2016  
to £221m in the current year which  
mainly reflected the upturn in Oil &  
Gas operating profit, offset by a £119m 
investment in working capital in the  
year mainly across Oil & Gas and  
Minerals to support increased activity 
levels in current and future years. 
The reduction in free cash flow is further 
explained by a £45m increase in cash tax 
as noted above and a £28m increase in 
cash dividends paid as a result of lower 
uptake for the scrip dividend compared  
to the prior year. 
Our working capital efficiency was 
demonstrated by working capital as a 
percentage of sales reducing from 27.1% 
to 25.7% and inventory turns improving 
from 2.2 to 2.7. 
Exceptional cash items include a 
restructuring and rationalisation cash 
outflow of £29m (2016: £58m outflow 
offset by £36m proceeds relating to the 
2016 asset disposal programme). Cash 
proceeds of £32m from the disposal of  
our 49% share in Energy Products LLC, 
our non-core North American Oil & Gas 
distribution joint venture, were offset by 
our £37m purchase of the remaining 40%  
of Weir International, our Korean valves 
business. Our acquisition of KOP Surface 
Products was financed via the issue of 
share capital totalling £90m during the year.
The above movements resulted in closing 
net debt of £843m (2016: £835m), which 
includes a favourable foreign exchange 
movement of £49m. On a lender covenant 
basis, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 
2.5 times (2016: 2.8 times) compared to a  
covenant level of 3.5 times.
Pension
The Group has four defined benefit 
pension plans, the largest of which are 
the two UK plans. During the course of 
the year, the Trustees of the UK Executive 
Scheme entered into a full buy-in 
transaction with Scottish Widows, with  
all of the benefit payments due from that 
scheme now covered by an insurance 
policy. As a result, insurance policy assets 
held now cover 43% (2016: 40%) of the 
Group’s total funding obligation across all 
schemes, reducing the Group’s exposure 
to actuarial movements.
The net deficit in the plans of £138m 
represents a minor increase from £137m 
in 2016. The increase in deficit is mainly 
due to actuarial losses of £35m (following 
a reduction in the UK discount rate to 
2.4% from 2.6%), offset by actuarial gains 
of £17m due to updated life expectancy 
assumptions, gains of £15m on pension 
scheme assets and £4m of Group 
contributions. The remaining balance of 
£2m comes primarily from experience 
adjustments on liabilities. 
Asbestos provision
Certain of the Group’s US-based 
subsidiaries are co-defendants in lawsuits 
pending in the United States in which 
plaintiffs are claiming damages arising 
from alleged exposure to products 
previously manufactured which contained 
asbestos. At the end of 2017, there  
were 1,657 asbestos-related claims 
outstanding in the US (2016: 1,477). 
During the year, and with the assistance 
of external advisers, we completed  
our triennial review of estimated future 
indemnity and defence costs. As a  
result of this review a US asbestos 
provision of £53m (2016: £48m) has  
been recognised. The Group has 
comprehensive insurance cover for  
these cases and as a result recognises  
a corresponding insurance asset. 
In the UK, there are 16 (2016: 18) 
outstanding asbestos-related claims 
which are not the subject of insurance 
cover. The expected settlement costs  
of these and anticipated future claims  
in the UK are fully provided for.
Full details of the US and UK provisions, 
plus related insurance receivable, are 
provided in note 22.
The key accounting and policy judgements 
are contained within note 2 to the Group 
financial statements on page 131.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share from continuing 
operations (before exceptional items  
and intangibles amortisation) increased  
by 42% to 86.7p (2016: 61.2p). Reported 
earnings per share including exceptional 
items, intangibles amortisation and profit 
from discontinued operations was 73.5p 
(2016: 17.8p). The weighted average 
number of shares in issue increased to 
219.9m (2016: 215.6m) following the 
issue of 6.2m shares during the year  
in respect of the KOP acquisition and 
scrip dividends.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 29.0p resulting in a total 
dividend of 44.0p for the year, in line  
with 2016. Dividend cover (being the ratio 
of earnings per share from continuing 
operations before exceptional items  
and intangibles amortisation, to dividend 
per share) is 2 times. If approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, on 26 April 
2018, the final dividend will be paid on 
4 June 2018 to shareholders on the register 
as at 27 April 2018 with a scrip dividend 
alternative continuing to be offered.

What we do
Mission-critical solutions
Our pumps, valves, hydrocyclones, rubber,

processing of mined rock into valuable ore.
Comprehensive global support
The division has more than 140 service 
centres close to customers in the world’s 
main mining regions.
Intensive aftermarket care
Operating in highly abrasive 
environments drives demand  
for spares and services.
28
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Market review
In mining, ore production increased 
slightly by 1% while average ore yields 
continued to fall, requiring greater  
levels of processing to maintain the  
same volume of refined commodity to 
support aftermarket demand growth. 
While overall mining capital spending  
was stable, sustaining expenditure 
increased by 5% as miners sought to 
optimise production from existing assets.
Regionally, Australasia saw increased 
activity driven by gold and lithium  
markets while coal remained challenging. 
Similarly, Africa benefited from increased 
activity in gold and copper, although there 
was some disruption from government 
actions in East Africa in the second half  
of the year. North America and Europe 
benefited from improved sentiment  
and activity in hard rock mining markets, 
although North American general industrial 
and coal markets were relatively subdued. 
In Latin America, mining activity  
remained robust despite the impact  
of industrial relations’ issues in the  
first half for some of our customers.
In non-mining markets, aggregates 
demand remained supportive in most 
regions, with the US, in particular, 
increasing its investment in infrastructure. 
While there was no significant new 
investment in oil sands projects, production 
increased overall, supporting demand for 
aftermarket spares and services.
Operational review
As part of its continued focus on 
developing a broader solutions mindset, 
more time was spent by all levels of  
the organisation on customer sites.  
This close customer intimacy gave the 
division improved insight, allowing it to 
anticipate additional demand, particularly 
for integrated solutions that optimise 
production of existing assets. 
Ricardo Garib
Division President of Weir Minerals
The division invested early to take advantage 
of increased market confidence and leverage 
its technology leadership and extensive 
service network.
Highly engineered equipment
Through its technology leadership,  
the division has built up a significant 
installed base of original equipment.
29
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information To take full advantage of these  
positive trends the division was 
proactive, investing in additional sales, 
engineering and project management 
capability. It also extended its global 
service centre network with new 
facilities in Canada, France, Poland, 
Sweden, the Dominican Republic and 
Russia, taking our total number of 
service centres to approximately 100. 
The division encountered some short-
term operational challenges in North 
America and Europe as a result of plant 
and supply chain reconfigurations to 
meet demand growth, but these had 
been substantially remediated by the 
end of the year. Good progress was 
made globalising newer product lines 
such as the comminution offering and 
Delta Valves while new technology 
introductions included advanced spools 
for oil sands applications.
Key priorities in 2018
• Safety – continue our strong 
performance on safety and  
embed next phase of Weir Zero 
Harm programme.
• Strengthen our engineering  
presence at service centres  
and customer sites. 
• Fully capture comminution, 
brownfield, tailings and spares 
opportunities.
• Execute operational excellence  
and internal efficiency projects.
Outlook for 2018
Miners are expected to increase 
sustaining capital expenditure in 2018, 
supporting global ore production growth. 
Assuming supportive market conditions 
continue, it is anticipated the division  
will deliver moderately higher constant 
currency revenues and slightly higher  
full year operating margins, with 
performance supported by both the 
strong order book and investment in 
growth initiatives in 2017.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Market review
Activity in North American upstream 
markets was supported by increasing 
oil prices through the year. This led to 
increased industry investment, with 
the US land rig count averaging 852, a 
74% increase on 2016. Oilfield service 
companies responded by refurbishing 
frac fleets with effective utilisation of the 
active US fleet running at approximately 
80%. Production methods continued to 
intensify with the number of frac stages 
and volume of proppant used increasing 
and driving increased demand for 
aftermarket spares and services. As the 
market tightened during 2017 there was 
a modest improvement in pricing. 
Later cycle international markets entered 
the downturn after North America and 
conditions remained challenging. While 
the international rig count increased  
2%, new investment was subdued,  
with continued pricing pressure and 
project delays. 
Paul Coppinger
Division President of Weir Oil & Gas
The division delivered excellent financial  
and operational performance as demand for  
our solutions increased significantly.
Operational review
The division delivered an excellent 
operating performance as demand  
for its solutions increased rapidly in  
North America. The divisional workforce 
grew by approximately 1,000 with  
its main manufacturing facility in Fort 
Worth, Texas, moving from one shift  
to three. Operating leverage benefited 
from previous cost reductions and  
good supply chain management. The 
division continued to innovate including 
introducing the simplified frac system, 
which reduces the amount of iron 
required on a frac site, improving 
safety and uptime. 
Internationally, the division continued  
to develop its pressure control offering  
in challenging market conditions  
with the acquisition of KOP Surface 
Products extending its geographical  
reach into South East Asia and 
accelerating its Middle East wellhead 
penetration strategy.

Reducing complexity 
to increase safety 
and productivity
Increased safety and productivity are key 
priorities for our customers and so, after 
extensive consultation, we designed the 
Simplified Frac System which significantly 
reduces the amount and complexity of iron 
on a frac site.
Our solution provides a more streamlined, 
fit-for-purpose system that can be tailored  
to any condition or basin. In addition to 
improving site safety, its linear flow-path 
design also prevents directional fluid changes 
that create accelerated wear, resulting in 
longer product life and extended productivity.

What we do
Mission-critical solutions
Our pumps and valves help power, 
mid and downstream oil and gas,  
and industrial customers process 
liquids and chemicals efficiently.
Intensive aftermarket care
Given their importance to the  
successful and safe operation  
of our customers’ sites, our  
solutions are regularly maintained, 
supporting aftermarket demand.
40
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Market review
Customers continued to be cautious  
in both power and downstream oil  
and gas markets. There was limited 
project activity with competitive  
market conditions and pricing pressure  
a common feature. Nuclear projects in 
China and South Korea continued to make 
progress, but sentiment in the United 
States and Europe was more subdued. 
Aftermarket demand was supported by 
ongoing maintenance schedules. 
David Paradis
Division President of Weir Flow Control
The division is moving towards a more  
global structure where we can better leverage 
our niche positions and build even closer 
relationships with customers around the world.
Highly engineered equipment
We have a significant installed base  
of original equipment including 
safety valves used in more than half of 
the world’s nuclear power plants, where 
reliability and performance are crucial.
Comprehensive global support
The division captures attractive 
aftermarket opportunities through 
its comprehensive service capability.
Downstream oil and gas markets,  
which were later to enter the downturn, 
remained challenging for original 
equipment and aftermarket demand, 
although there were signs of improvement 
towards the end of the year. Industrial 
markets were more positive, in line with 
global economic growth.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Operational review
In challenging market conditions,  
the division successfully maximised 
aftermarket opportunities and  
expanded the geographic reach of  
its wider product portfolio. Sales  
and marketing operations were 
reconfigured to support new global  
and application-based initiatives while 
competitiveness was enhanced by 
Value Chain Excellence initiatives  
and best-cost sourcing. While one-off 
charges in the first half of £13m,  
relating to legacy contract challenges  
at Gabbioneta, impacted overall 
performance, the division delivered a 
better second half supported by higher 
volumes and good operating leverage. 
The division also made good strategic 
progress in the development of new 
technologies and the expansion of its 
e-commerce offering. 
Key priorities for 2018
• Improve safety performance  
and embed safety culture.
• Globalise product portfolio.
• Expand aftermarket sales  
and capabilities.
• Continue to drive Value  
Chain Excellence.
Outlook for 2018
The division’s main power and 
downstream oil and gas markets  
have stabilised with some early signs  
of improvement. The division entered 
the year with a lower order book, but  
is expected to deliver broadly stable 
constant currency revenues for the full 
year as it benefits from its new sales 
and marketing structure. Operating 
profits and margins are expected to 
increase, with a return to mid single-digit 
operating margins for the full year.

Providing solutions 
for the most extreme 
conditions in record-
breaking time
Weir Flow Control was recently awarded  
the contract to engineer and supply critical 
service safety valves for Yamal LNG, a major 
LNG project in northern Russia. The project 
will develop one of the largest natural gas 
reserves in the world which, following the 
construction of an LNG plant, will supply 
energy to Europe and Asia. The valves 
developed by Weir for this project are 
amongst some of the most advanced designs 
ever produced by the business. A total of  
638 highly specialised fast-track safety  
valves were supplied, 185 of which were 
‘superfast-track’ deliveries, to meet critical 
installation and start-up schedules.
Starflow Spring Loaded Valves
These safety relief valves feature 
a wide range of material options 
and trim designs to meet the 
demands of many processes and 
applications. They are used in 
vapour, gas, liquid or steam 
applications in the oil and gas 
industry as well as cryogenics 
and the power industry. The 
valves are designed to provide 
high integrity performance.
Sarasin-RSBD™ 76 Series
The Sarasin-RSBD Pressure 
Relief Valve is designed to meet 
the rigorous process conditions 
which are mandated by the power 
industry. The valves are designed 
to operate in high pressure and 
high temperature environments.

Risk Review
Managing risk effectively
We operate in a complex global 
environment, where opportunities  
come with corresponding risks.  
Our objective is to allow our people  
to be decisive, so we can take  
advantage of attractive opportunities 
whilst ensuring we are not exposing  
the organisation to excessive risk.
The risk agenda
During the year, the Board has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the systems of risk 
management and internal control and 
conducted a robust assessment of the 
principal risks affecting the Group in line 
with the Risk Appetite Statement. These 
activities meet the Board’s responsibilities 
in connection with Risk Management  
and Internal Control set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The aim of the Risk Appetite Statement 
remains to highlight the risks that we 
should be willing to take, as well as those 
which are unacceptable. The statement 
includes a series of risk assertions which 
are aligned to our strategy, together  
with the risk parameters within which  
we expect our people to work. The risk 
appetite is all of the risk assertions and 
the parameters taken together. The 
parameters can apply to more than  
one risk assertion, and therefore the 
individual risk assertions should not be 
read in isolation. Compliance with the 
Risk Appetite Statement is monitored 
through the Group’s functional and front 
line controls including oversight and 
reporting mechanisms. The Board will 
continue to review and update the Risk 
Appetite Statement on an annual basis. 
Details of the review of the internal control 
and risk management systems undertaken 
during the year are contained in the  
Audit Committee Report on page 88.
Risk management 
The management of risks is at the  
core of the internal control framework.  
We have a risk management policy  
which defines how we expect risks to  
be identified, assessed and managed 
throughout the organisation. 
Risks are assessed, and quantified,  
in terms of impact and likelihood of 
occurrence, both before and after  
control mitigation. Assessing the gross 
risk before control mitigation allows the 
business to review the relative impact  
of the existing controls by comparing  
the gross and net risk assessment.  
This also allows the business to avoid 
wasting resources on mitigating controls 
and actions which have a negligible 
impact on the risk assessment. 
Risk management cycle
46
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Risk Appetite Statement
The Weir Group is strategically positioned in markets with good long-term growth prospects. 
We will pursue ambitious growth targets, and we are willing to accept a higher level of risk  
to increase the likelihood of achieving or exceeding our strategic priorities, subject to the 
parameters below. 
Risk assertions Risk parameters
1.  Organic growth
We will rigorously pursue divisional organic growth 
strategies to meet our market growth objectives. 
Investment of resources will be consistent 
with divisional strategies and expected 
divisional compound annual growth rates 
over five year plans.
2.  Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
We will actively pursue M&A opportunities that 
enhance our strategic platform subject to meeting 
investment criteria.
Post-tax returns should exceed our cost of 
capital within three years of the acquisition.
3.  Returns and profitability
We will not pursue growth at all costs, and expect  
high margins, strong returns on capital and working 
capital discipline together with cash generation.
Short term margin dilution is acceptable in 
gaining market entry but over the cycle we 
aim for top quartile operating margins and 
returns on capital.
4.  Capital allocation
We will encourage capital expenditure in pursuit  
of our growth ambitions subject to Internal Rate  
of Return (IRR) hurdles and capital structure targets.
Local country cash flow projections for 
investment appraisal purposes discounted 
at country specific rates to account for  
risk weighted returns.
5.  Capital structure
We are prepared to use leverage in pursuit of our 
growth agenda and will actively seek low cost debt  
to fund the Group but, recognising cyclicality in our  
end markets, will maintain significant headroom  
against our financial covenants.
We will seek to maintain the ratio of net 
debt/EBITDA below two times (current 
financial covenants 3.5 times) and will 
retain adequate headroom within our  
debt facilities at all times.
6.  Reputation and brand image
We will avoid/manage situations or actions that could 
have a negative impact on our reputation and brands. 
We aim to be transparent with all of our stakeholders 
unless prejudicial to our collective interests.
No tolerance for breaches of:
• Legislative/statutory requirements.
• Weir Code of Conduct.
• International sanctions.
• Delegated authority levels.
• Group and divisional policies.
7.  Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
We will not undertake or pursue activities that  
pose unacceptable hazard or risk to our people,  
the communities in which we operate, or the  
broader environment.
• No tolerance for breaches of Weir Group 
Safety, Health and Environment Charter. 
• Active community and environmental 
engagement is expected.
8.  Country presence
We are prepared to enter new countries which  
offer opportunities for growth consistent with  
our overall strategy. We will not enter, or will exit, 
countries which present a high risk of harm to  
our people, damage to our reputation, or breach  
of international sanctions.
No tolerance for breaches of:
• Legislative/statutory requirements.
• Weir Code of Conduct.
• International sanctions.
• Delegated authority levels.
• Group and divisional policies.

The specific risks identified 
across the business generally  
fall under one of the categories 
within the ‘Risk Universe’ as 
shown below.

to such risks is having controls 
which lessen the impact to our 
business should they occur. For 
example, in the case of natural 
disasters, we have controls  
in place to reduce the risk of 
harm to our people, as well as 
response planning protocols,  
with clear accountability,  
to minimise disruption to 
operations and our customers.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Risk Review continued
The impact of risks is quantified across  
a range of factors including: financial; 
strategy; reputation; people and property; 
ability to perform services; regulation; 
safety, health and environment; and 
investors and funding. The risk 
management policy includes defined 
criteria for each risk impact factor, 
supporting a consistent measurement 
approach. Risk management takes place 
at the grassroots level, for example in 
individual projects, all the way up to 
Group level assessments, thereby 
providing an integrated bottom-up and 
top-down approach to risk management.
Ultimately, the Board is responsible for 
the Group’s risk and internal control 
framework. It has set out the decisions, 
and hence the level of risk, which can  
be delegated to the Group Executive, 
divisional and operational company 
management without requiring 
escalation. This is articulated in a  
series of Group policies and delegated 
authority matrices, as well as the 
parameters within the approved Risk 
Appetite Statement. The Board and 
committee structure can be viewed  
on page 76. 
The bottom-up risk reporting approach 
requires key risks identified, and reported, 
at project level to be escalated to the 
operating company management, which 
in turn may be escalated to divisional 
management, and ultimately to the  
Risk Committee and the Board. This is 
achieved through risk dashboard reports, 
which are maintained at operating 
company, divisional and Group levels.  
The dashboards provide a summary of 
the major net risks at each respective 
level, as well as a summary of the key 
mitigating controls and actions, and 
further control actions required. 
The Risk Committee monitors quarterly 
risk dashboard reports from the divisions. 
In addition, the Risk Committee has 
oversight of the Group Risk Dashboard, 
along with a routine review of key controls 
identified to manage each risk and the 
sources of controls assurance, providing 
an update to the Board at each Board 
meeting. The Board obtains assurance 
over risks and risk management through 
the internal control framework. More 
information on the internal control 
framework can be found within the 
Corporate Governance Report on  
page 68 and within the Audit  
Committee Report on page 88.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
As in any business, there are risks and 
uncertainties which could impact the  
Group’s ability to achieve its objectives  
in the future. The Group’s risk management  
and assurance framework is designed to  
make this less likely by clearly identifying  
and seeking to mitigate key risks.
The Board has conducted a robust 
assessment of the principal risks, 
alongside the Risk Appetite Statement  
set out on page 47, meeting the  
Board’s responsibilities in connection  
with Risk Management and Internal 
Control detailed in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Each of the principal 
risks is assigned an owner from amongst 
the Board or Group senior management 
team and is either a standing agenda  
item at each Board meeting or subject  
to formal periodic review by the Board.  
A summary of principal risks and the 
Group’s mitigating controls is presented  
at every Board meeting.
The Directors reviewed the Group’s  
risk register, reassessed the validity of  
the principal risks identified in the prior 
year and considered whether any new 
principal risks have emerged or a risk  
is no longer considered a principal risk.  
The identified principal risks were 
subjected to a detailed assessment  
based on the following considerations:
Strategy
People
Customers
Technology
Performance
Risk Trend
Increasing
Decreasing
No change
Viability Statement
• Severity of each risk;
• Existence and effectiveness of  
actions and internal controls  
which serve to mitigate the risk;
• The overall effectiveness of the 
Group’s control environment,  
including assurance and any identified 
control weaknesses or failings; and 
• The extent to which each of the 
principal risks could impact upon  
the Group’s viability, in financial  
or operational terms, due to their 
potential effects on the business  
plan, solvency or liquidity.
The principal risks set out on pages 51 
to 55 are those which we believe to 
have the greatest potential to impact our  
ability to achieve the Group’s strategic 
objectives or which have the greatest 
potential impact on the Group’s 
solvency or liquidity.

Risk Review: Principal risks and uncertainties
Technology and innovation
 
Failure to innovate or to react to emerging technology developments, and 
therefore fail to ensure that the business continues to deliver sustainable  
and attractive solutions for our customers.
Impact on strategy
    
Why we think this is important
The strength of our business is built upon  
a history of delivering innovative and 
sustainable solutions for our customers.  
If we fail to keep abreast of market needs  
or to innovate solutions, we are at risk of 
losing market share to our competitors and 
lowering margins as demand will reduce.
How we are mitigating the risk
Our existing research and development 
initiatives within the business, at Weir 
Advanced Research Centre, are enhanced 
through partnerships with certain leading 
universities around the world. These 
partnerships are designed to help the  
Group develop game-changing solutions  
to our customers’ challenges.
We devote skilled resource to reviewing  
and responding to developing technologies, 
with our agreements with specialist  
external parties to develop Internet  
of Things (IoT) technology.
Engineering strategies are in place at  
Group and divisional levels with strategic 
innovation arenas defined as part of the 
innovation strategy.
Changes during 2017
The pace of technological innovation 
continues to increase as we and our 
competitors seek to provide customers  
with solutions that improve the efficiency  
of their operations.
Recognising the strategic importance of 
technology and innovation we recruited  
a Chief Technology Officer during the year  
to define the Group’s Technology Vision  
and Strategy.
Further information on progress made  
in this area is set out in the Products and 
Technology section of the Sustainability 
Review on page 57.
Risk trend
Mapping our risks
As part of the risk dashboard assessments 
we map our risks in terms of likelihood  
and impact, based on a defined rating of  
1 (unlikely or minor) to 4 (almost certain  
or critical). Likelihood ratings are defined 
based on the period in which we expect  
that a risk could materialise; impact ratings 
consider factors including strategic; financial; 
reputational; regulatory; people and property; 
and safety, health and environment.
All risks are assessed, including an 
assessment of any emerging risks, each  
time the risk dashboards are reviewed. 
The risk trend is monitored over time and 
further mitigating controls identified where 
appropriate. Consideration is also given to  
the relative priority of each risk in the overall 
risk dashboard.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Risk Review: Principal risks and uncertainties continued
IT security and continuity 
Failure to maintain business systems or technical infrastructure that serves the 
business needs.
Failure to successfully execute changes to these business systems or technical 
infrastructure; together with failure to minimise disruption and maintain business 
as usual activity during technical infrastructure or business system changes. 
Failure to adequately protect the business operations from cybercrime.
Impact on strategy
  
Why we think this is important
Up-to-date data allows us to make informed 
decisions about our business. Therefore,  
we require reliable and efficient IT systems 
and infrastructure to provide our data 
requirements. Breaches of our IT security 
could have serious consequences for our 
business, including: interruption to business 
operations; and loss of intellectual property 
and other sensitive data.
The Group is investing in a significant IT 
transformation programme. If this is not 
managed effectively, the consequences could 
include interruption to business operations  
if data is unavailable due to unsuccessful 
execution of change, impacting our ability  
to compete and our reputation in the market.
At present, the Group’s principal exposures  
to cybercrime relate to the misappropriation 
of cash and data. Our revenue streams are 
largely protected as our products are not 
currently electronic in nature and we do not, 
as a rule, transact over the internet.
How we are mitigating the risk
We have an IT Governance Framework  
with a focus on structured change 
management techniques, including setting 
project governance levels in line with risk.
Policies, procedures and baseline standards  
in relation to cyber risk and IT security more 
generally are continuously updated and rolled 
out to operations. A programme of user 
training in relation to cyber risk is in place.
All security related incidents are reported  
to the Group Executive.
Changes during 2017
IT security and continuity continues to be  
a matter of strategic priority for the Group  
in an environment of ever increasing cyber 
security threats. Progress to strengthen the 
Group’s defences in this respect is being 
made through our IT Next programme.
We continually review the effectiveness of 
our key IT security controls in consultation 
with external experts. There is regular 
reporting of unplanned outages and potential 
security breaches, with lessons learned 
across the Group.
Security Incident Responder teams monitor 
our various security systems.

Value Chain Excellence
 
Failure to achieve Value Chain Excellence improvements and the associated 
reduction in costs and enhanced flexibility.
Impact on strategy
  
Why we think this is important
If we fail to improve our value chain 
management, we risk:
• Losing the opportunity to invest  
capital into alternative value  
creating opportunities;
• Damaging our reputation and as a 
consequence losing customers and 
market share;
• Losing market position if the Group  
fails to demonstrate to customers the 
value of our products and services;
• Incurring penalties as a result of late 
delivery contractual clauses;
• Reducing margins by incurring unnecessary 
additional costs associated with late 
remedial actions taken to avoid missing 
delivery targets; and
• Failing to respond to market upturns or 
downturns quickly enough to respond  
to market demand or manage costs.
How we are mitigating the risk
Regular KPI monitoring of the value chain 
throughout the organisation.
The Group’s operations are implementing 
Value Chain Excellence initiatives amongst 
other business improvement objectives.
Established Centres of Excellence drive cost 
savings, efficiencies and enhance delivery 
standards whilst maintaining quality.
The Group’s forward purchase commitments 
are being closely monitored to manage 
inventories at levels appropriate to market 
conditions.
Our credit risk management procedures are 
under continuous appraisal and review.
We regularly monitor market activity to  
ensure we remain competitive.
Changes during 2017 
Value chain remains an area of strategic 
focus for the Group. Value chain 
improvements continue to be recognised 
year on year as the Group realises benefits 
from its focused approach to these matters.
An updated and more focused VCE model  
has been successfully introduced.
A programme of Value Chain Excellence 
initiatives has been operating throughout the 
Group to drive value chain improvements.
All businesses now complete VCE  
self-assessments, including value  
stream segmentation, model design  
and improvement project identification.
Initiatives to expand production in  
best-cost locations are reviewed and  
the procurement function continues  
to drive cost and quality improvements 
through the Group’s supply chain.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Ethics, governance and control
Interactions with our people, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders are not 
conducted with the highest standards of integrity which devalues our reputation.
Impact on strategy
 
Why we think this is important
We are unwilling to accept dishonest  
or corrupt behaviour from our people,  
or external parties acting on our behalf, 
whilst conducting our business. If we fail  
to act with integrity, we are at risk of:
• Reputational damage leading to a loss  
of customers;
• Increased scrutiny from regulators;
• Legal action from regulators including 
fines, penalties and imprisonment; and
• Exclusion from markets important for  
our future growth.
We expect all areas of the business to do  
the right thing and conduct business in 
compliance with procedures, applicable  
laws, Weir Group operating policies and  
the highest ethical standards.
How we are mitigating the risk
The Code of Conduct, supplemented with 
Group policies on related topics, provides  
a clear benchmark for how we expect our 
business will be conducted.
Regular training is provided using a range  
of mechanisms including Town Hall style 
sessions, online and induction training.
The financial control framework is continually 
monitored for effectiveness.
Internal Audit’s remit includes regular review  
of the anti-bribery and corruption and financial 
controls across the Group. The Group Legal 
team is responsible for monitoring compliance 
with the Code of Conduct.
A Whistleblower hotline is available to all 
members of staff. Reports are investigated on 
a timely basis and summary reports provided 
to Group Executive and Board.
Changes during 2017
The governance and legislative environment 
in which the Group operates continues to 
evolve and become more complex. We 
routinely review operations in geographies 
where ethical standards may not be as well 
established as in other countries.
The Group has reinforced its commitment  
to high standards of ethics and governance 
through the Code of Conduct and completed 
a programme of training for key individuals.

Adverse political action, or political and social instability, in territories in which 
we operate may result in strategic, financial or personnel loss to the Group.
Impact on strategy
   
Why we think this is important
We operate across the globe and therefore 
have to work within a wide range of political 
and social conditions. Adverse events may 
occur in the territories in which we operate 
that may require us to act swiftly to protect 
our people and our property and regulatory 
changes could impact our competitiveness. 
We need to be flexible and able to anticipate 
such issues.
Expansions into new territories are only 
undertaken after rigorous assessment of  
the risks, including the social and political 
situation within the territory.
How we are mitigating the risk
Regular review of market attractiveness.
Monitoring travel by Weir employees  
to higher risk locations in accordance  
with the Weir Group travel policy.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Risk Review: Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Market volatility 
Changes in key markets, including commodity prices affecting mining and oil  
and gas, have an adverse impact on customers’ expenditure plans. This may 
include delaying existing expenditure commitments. As markets improve  
we may fail to effectively upscale operations to meet customer needs.
Impact on strategy
   
Why we think this is important
We need to remain sufficiently flexible to 
allow us to anticipate downturns, to allow  
us to adjust our operations accordingly,  
and equally to meet growth in demand  
when our customers’ markets are buoyant 
and therefore capital investment is high. 
Otherwise, we are at risk of incurring 
unnecessary costs during downturns,  
and not maximising our potential for  
growth in buoyant markets.
In challenging market conditions, our  
value chain risks are increased. These  
are described in more detail on page 52.
How we are mitigating the risk
We maintain regular engagement with our 
customers to understand their needs and 
challenges, and ensure our business is 
appropriately aligned.
Improved demand planning and forecasting

Value Chain Excellence to meet increasing 
demand from our key sectors.
Risk trend
Staff recruitment, development  
and retention
Failure to recruit, develop or retain key management and staff may lead to 
disruption to the Group’s operations, functions and processes.
Impact on strategy
 
Why we think this is important
Our people represent our biggest asset  
and failure to attract, develop and retain  
key management and staff would have a 
detrimental impact on the Group’s ability  
to deliver our key strategic objectives.
As markets improve we need to continue  
to recruit high quality staff building on 
existing capability while recruiting skilled 
expertise in the right areas of the business 
and at the right time.
How we are mitigating the risk
Promotion of the Weir Group Values & 
Behaviours, Code of Conduct and HR Policies 
sets the standards and expectations for all our 
staff, reinforcing our stated commitment to 
attracting and retaining the very best people.
High performer assessments are undertaken 
to identify and develop our very best talent.
Succession plans are in place and periodically 
reviewed for all of our key management.
Personal Development Plans are set and

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Contract risk 
Failure to adequately manage contract risk and, as a result, commit  
to obligations which the Group is unable to meet without incurring  
significant unplanned costs.
In addition, failure to follow Group policies and procedures may lead  
to commitments without the desired level of contractual protections.
Impact on strategy
  
Why we think this is important
We operate in an increasingly complex and 
competitive environment where customers 
are not only highly focused on price and 
service but are also more challenging in 
contract negotiations.
As we offer a broader range of products and 
services to our customers, including those 
that are more technologically advanced, we 
risk exposing the Group to reputational and 
financial loss should our contract acceptance, 
negotiation and approval processes fail to 
protect the Group accordingly.
How we are mitigating the risk
The Group has policies and procedures for 
contract acceptance and approval.
These are under continuous review and 
improvement to ensure they are adequate  
for current and future circumstances.
The tools and training available to employees 
responsible for contract management are 
similarly under continuous review.
Changes during 2017
Contract management continues to  
be an area of focus for the Group, given  
the competitive environment. Group

be reviewed and refreshed to provide 
employees with improved tools to  
assist them in their contract training  
and management activities.

Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
 
Failure to adequately protect our people and other stakeholders from harm 
associated with a breach in SHE standards.
Impact on strategy
  
Why we think this is important
We operate in hazardous environments, 
and therefore have a fundamental duty to 
protect our people and other stakeholders 
from harm whilst conducting our business. 
As well as the personal impact on our 
people resulting from a failure to meet this 
obligation, we would also be at risk of: 
• Reputational damage leading to a  
loss of customers;
• Legal action from regulators, including  
fines and penalties; and
• Exclusion from markets important for  
our future growth.
How we are mitigating the risk
The Weir Behavioural Safety system is in  
place to reduce the risk of safety incidents.
In addition, there are initiatives to prevent  
the most common accident types. The Weir 
global SHE standards are continually reviewed.
The SHE Excellence Committee is responsible 
for monitoring performance and compliance 
with Group objectives, policies and standards 
relating to SHE.
The Chief Executive’s Safety Committee  
met 12 times during the year, committed  
to achieving the highest of SHE standards.
There is a formal SHE assurance programme 
with issues escalated as required through the 
reporting structures.
Changes during 2017
The Group continues to set higher 
benchmarks for SHE compliance and  
roll out cohesive programmes to address 
SHE risks and drive safe and sustainable 
working practices. 
Improved SHE incident reporting tools  
have been piloted and rolled out across the 
Group to provide visibility and responsive

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2014, the Directors have assessed the 
viability of the Group over a three year 
period, taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact 
of the principal risks documented on 
pages 50 to 55 of the Annual Report. 
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 31 December 2020. 
The Directors have determined that  
a three-year period to 31 December 
2020 is an appropriate period over  
which to provide the viability statement. 
The Group’s key markets are by nature 
cyclical and therefore, while the Group 
operates a five-year strategic planning 
process, market cyclicality and the 
related lack of visibility over commodity 
prices, in particular, indicate that a period 
of three years is appropriate. We believe 
that this approach presents the Board 
and readers of the Annual Report with  
a reasonable degree of confidence over 
this longer term outlook.
The strategic plan is a bottom up analysis 
prepared annually and submitted to the 
Board for consideration. The output of 
this plan is used to perform central debt 
and headroom profile analysis, which 
includes a review of sensitivity to 
‘business as usual’ risks, such as 
profit growth, working capital variances 
and return on capital investment. This 
analysis, in conjunction with the current 
year results and 2018 Budget, provides 
the basis for the viability model on 
which we have overlaid a number of 
severe, but plausible events, to reflect  
our risk assessment.
In making this statement, the Board 
carried out a robust assessment of  
the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that could threaten its 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. 
While the review has considered all  
the principal risks identified by the  
Group, the following risks were focused 
on for enhanced stress-testing: market 
downturn, major site and customer 
shocks, significant loss of market share  
in key markets and regulatory shock.  
The resulting scenarios were modelled  
as a series of individual one-off ‘shocks’, 
in combination with commodity price 
based market downturn scenarios. Refer 
to page 50 for the Group’s principal risks, 
specifying those risks considered during 
this review. 
The geographical and sector diversification 
of the Group’s operations helps minimise 
the risk of serious business interruption  
or catastrophic damage to our reputation. 
While the Group remains exposed to  
the cyclicality of the markets in which it 
operates, it continues to have a strong 
balance sheet that provides capacity in 
which to operate. In addition, our ability  
to flex our cost base to reflect our existing 
markets – as evidenced by our recent 
cost reduction programmes – protects  
our viability in the face of adverse 
economic conditions and / or additional 
risks highlighted.
While this review does not consider  
all of the risks that the Group may  
face, the directors consider that this 
stress-testing based assessment of  
the Group’s prospects is reasonable  
in the circumstances of the inherent 
uncertainty involved.

Inspiring our people to flourish
People are at the heart of the  
Group’s ‘We are Weir’ strategy with  
our commitment to caring for our 
colleagues, our neighbours and  
the environment and inspiring  
them all to flourish.
The quality and commitment of our 
people has always been a competitive 
advantage for the Group, from the 
engineers that design our equipment to 
the operations staff who manufacture it 
and the on-site experts who support 
our customers around the world.
As a business that relies on a high-
performance culture, we appreciate  
the importance of offering our people 
the opportunity to fulfil their potential 
and provide a workplace that keeps 
them safe, engaged and inspired to  
do the best work of their lives.
To achieve that, we invest in  
safety programmes, learning and 
development opportunities and 
leadership. We are also committed  
to developing a new sustainable 
engagement score to measure  
our progress in developing an  
even more effective organisation. 
In addition to developing our 
employees, the Group takes its 
responsibility to developing the next 
generation of employees seriously.  
This includes supporting programmes 
that encourage more young people  
to consider engineering as a career. 
Chief Executive Officer’s  
Safety Committee
The CEO’s Safety Committee was 
established in 2016 to give Board-level 
leadership to the Group’s ambition of 
becoming a zero-harm workplace. The 
Committee consists of senior leaders 
from across the Group, including the 
three divisional presidents and the 
Chief People Officer and embodies 
the priorities of our Safety Charter. 
The Committee oversees Safety, Health 
and Environment (SHE) performance, 
ensuring the Group systems and 
processes are best set up to deliver 
our Zero Harm vision.
SHE Excellence Committee
The Safety, Health and Environment  
(SHE) Excellence Committee supports 
the Board and provides leadership, 
co-ordination and support for the delivery 
of the Group SHE objectives set by the 
CEO’s Safety Committee. It is tasked by 
the Board to drive continuous SHE 
improvement across the Group through 
setting and assessing rigorous standards 
that are comprehensive, risk-based, 
deliverable and built on the best practice 
of our peers, customers and professional 
bodies. The progress towards an 
increasingly behavioural safety culture has 
been the priority of the SHE Excellence 
Committee and is evident in the focus 
on the engagement elements of our 
Zero Harm strategy.
SHE performance 
2017 is a year that the Group should feel 
proud of when it comes to SHE. Having 
challenged ourselves to make a material 
reduction in the number of lost-time 
incidents as well as maintaining our 
continuous positive trend regarding  
overall recordable injuries as represented 
by the Total Incident Rate, we delivered 
an excellent performance. All three 
Divisions made significant improvements 
and contributed to a 33% reduction in 
Lost Time Incidents from 30 to 20 and  
a 20% reduction in the broader Total 
Incident Rate to 0.53. In addition, the 
injuries associated with the lost time 
incidents were much less severe. 
Introduction
Bringing safety and 
operations even 
closer together
Weir Valves & Controls USA Inc.  
(WVC USA) is proud of their current 
safety record, but that doesn’t stop  
the team from constantly looking for 
areas for improvement.
The company based in Ipswich, 
Massachusetts, has always had a 
safety-centric culture and, in 2017  
its President (Mark Claffey) and its 
Director of Operations (Bert McGrath) 
implemented a system which is 
designed to capitalise on their 
employees’ passion for safety and 
empower them to implement change.
WVC USA took elements of the famed 
Japanese system, Kaizen, and applied 
it to areas of their business operations. 
Kaizen translates as ‘continual 
improvement’ and is a system which is 
often used within lean manufacturing. 
Weir Valves and Controls USA, taking 
the key elements of Kaizen, now 
encourages cross-functional teams to 
review existing processes, products 
and services to look for new, safer 
methods and solutions.
The system has been successful 
throughout its first year, with teams of 
employees from different fields feeling 
empowered to find solutions through 
innovation and ‘out of the box’ thinking. 
Mark Claffey stated: “I am proud of the 
Ipswich plant employees who have 
embraced and actively participated in 
this safety process. As we continue  
on the path to Zero Harm, a true safety 
culture shift is only successful with 
education, awareness and participation 
of all shop and office employees.”
Bert McGrath added: “I am very 
impressed with how everyone has 
reacted to the safety Kaizens and the 
results we have seen so far. Our 
business has always been safety 
focused and this new system 
generates real enthusiasm for  
safety and a mindset to innovate.”
The Weir Group’s vision is  
a zero-harm workplace for 
people and an environment 
where everyone goes home 
safe and healthy.

Contributing to this performance  
was a refresh of our Weir Zero Harm 
strategy to reflect a more behavioural 
approach to safety and our drive to  
make safety a part of every conversation 
within the third element of Weir Zero 
Harm. Everywhere in the Group, people 
are engaging with safety in a way that  
is giving everyone the opportunity to 
identify safer ways of working and 
sharing the responsibility of looking  
after each other in the workplace.
Strategic developments in SHE 
2017 saw the introduction of the  
Group’s Global e-management system, 
SHIELD, dedicated to SHE. SHIELD 
gives the Group a platform on which 
every single employee has a presence. 
It has streamlined the recording, 
investigating and reporting of all 
SHE-related activity across the whole 
Weir footprint and it provides a timely 
and accurate analytical tool to help 
inform the wider SHE strategy.
Delivering our duty of care
Many of the Group’s employees travel 
regularly and we have a comprehensive 
process to ensure they stay healthy and 
safe at all times. This includes offering 
advice before, during and after any trip. 
This provides our significant travelling 
population with the reassurance that 
wherever they are going and whatever 
they may encounter, there is a world- 
class system supporting them. 
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
As a global company operating in over  
70 countries, we benefit from a wide 
diversity of talents and aim to ensure 
everyone is given the opportunity to 
flourish regardless of their gender,  
race, beliefs or background.

Our commitment to becoming a more

significant progress in 2017: 
• A project team was re-formed to  
work on Group-wide D&I initiatives.
• D&I plans were developed by every 
business unit and there has been  
good initial progress.
• Groups from our Senior Management 
Team have worked on ‘D&I’ initiatives 
throughout the year.
• Open innovation challenges have  
been held throughout 2017, which 
bring diverse teams together to 
develop innovative solutions to 
business challenges and opportunities. 
• Weir Gabbioneta, based in Italy, took 
part in a diversity day event, to 
promote the diversity and inclusion of 
disadvantaged people within the labour 
market. People dealing with impaired 
vision, deafness, motor disability and 
Down syndrome were keen to seize 
the opportunities that the world of 
work can offer them.
Weir University, our online learning 
platform, continues to offer a range  
of modules to help our people  
increase their knowledge and skills.
In 2017, we continued to encourage  
more young people to consider STEM-
related careers in many of the countries in 
which we operate. In the UK, for example, 
we have continued our support and 
involvement with Primary Engineer and 
the Arkwright Scholarship Trust. As part  
of our continued commitment to the 
Arkwright Scholarship Programme,  
we provided one week summer work-
experience placements in Canada and  
the Netherlands for one scholar from  
our 2015 intake and two scholars from 
our 2016 intake respectively. The students 
spent time learning about our businesses 
in both countries, visiting the engineering, 
operations and commercial teams. The 
students reported on all aspects of their 
trips and met with Jon Stanton at the end 
of the year to share their experiences 
with him. Weir has been supporting 
Arkwright since 2012.

In 2017, Weir Minerals Africa was 
delighted to participate in the annual 
Take-a-Girl-Child-to-Work Day
®
 for the 
second year in a row. Weir hosted 
53 female learners and eight teachers, 
from nine different schools, at both our 
Isando and Alrode facilities. The event 
had several objectives, including 
providing an insight into the “world of 
work” to give female students positive 
role models; helping them achieve  
their aspirations by motivating them  
to reach their full potential; providing  
a platform to discuss the needs of 
female students and their role in South 
Africa’s socio-economic development;  
as well as to showcase the exciting 
opportunities within the engineering  
and manufacturing environments. 
The event supports our ongoing 
commitment to the development 
of STEM programmes and attracting 
talent into manufacturing and 
engineering, in particular. 
Employee engagement
Employee engagement enables our 
employees to realise their potential  
and contribute to improving  
business performance. 
During 2017, we embedded ‘We are 
Weir’ throughout the Group including 
hosting the first ever global CEO ‘Town 
Hall’ meetings. These enabled employees 
from every part of the Group’s operations 
to gather and question the CEO on  
any issue of their choice. The level of 
engagement was high and the feedback 
was very positive. This was followed  
by regular CEO briefings and the 
introduction of a direct ‘AskJon’ email 
address via which employees can raise  
any issues they may have.
In addition, the Group launched an internal 
social network to allow employees to 
share best practice across operations. 
There was a strong uptake, with more 
than 4,000 members regularly sharing 
stories and collaborating across the world.
Weir Leadership 
Programme
In 2017, we launched the Weir Leader 
4.0 Programme with 26 leaders from 
across Weir coming together to embark 
on a nine-month learning journey. 
The programme has been designed  
to build Weir Leaders’ capability and 
commitment to deliver ‘We are Weir’ 
against the background of Industry 4.0. 
The core of the programme is centred 
around two four-day sessions where 
the focus is on understanding ‘We are 
Weir’ and leaders’ role in delivering 
it successfully, being clear on the 
expectations of them as a Weir Leader 
and about the legacy they want to 
create for Weir. 
Through a framework that incorporates 
strategic, performance, inclusive and 
change leadership dimensions, the 
participants completed a ‘360 feedback’ 
that will allow them to continue to work 
on the capabilities and behaviours they 
will need to achieve impact and success.
Further details of our people  
development programmes can  
be found at www.careers.weir
These innovations were in addition  
to more established communications 
channels such as the Group intranet  
and bulletin newsletter.
A communications survey of employees 
received more than 1,400 responses  
with the majority indicating they felt 
employee engagement across the  
Group had improved in 2017 and they  
had a good understanding of the  
We are Weir strategic framework.
Leadership capability
We continue to invest in our leadership 
development programmes, including  
Weir Leader 4.0 and the Weir Business 
Management and MBA programmes.  
To complement this, we have introduced  
a new Weir Leader framework which is 
aligned with ‘We are Weir’. 
The senior leadership of the Group has 
been strengthened through a mix of 
internal and external hires and a number of 
key roles have been introduced in support 
of our technology agenda, in particular.

continue to deliver opportunities for 
women to develop their careers. By 
2020, we have committed to ensuring 
that one-third of the Board, the Group 
Executive and their direct reports will 
be female. In addition, the Board will 
annually review our progress against 
gender pay D&I initiatives.
The requirements and our outcomes
The UK Government’s Gender Pay Gap 
Regulation requires legal employing 
entities with 250 or more employees  
to publish details of their gender pay  
and bonus gap. In Weir, there are two 
employing entities required to publish 
this data, but we have taken the 
opportunity to publish the consolidated 
data for our four UK companies as this 
covers our entire UK workforce.

Understanding our pay gap
There is a definite move to make 
Weir more diverse and inclusive, 
which is great. Personally, I have 
found the Group to be a good 
place to build a career irrespective 
of gender, but of course we’d all 
like to see more female role 
models across the business.
Jenny McGeough
Manufacturing Director,  
Weir Minerals Netherlands
We need to encourage and 
attract more women at all levels 
of the organisation. Here in Peru 
we have a female Managing 
Director and Finance Director, 
which I believe is unique in Weir, 
but I am sure it will become 
increasingly common.

Gender pay and equal pay
The gender pay gap is different from 
equal pay, which relates to men and 
women being paid the same for similar 
roles or work of equal value. Our pay 
policies are designed to ensure equal  
pay for equal jobs and we have  
processes in place to ensure pay  
levels are reviewed consistently.
Understanding our background and 
what our pay gap tells us
In common with other companies within 
the engineering sectors, the majority  
of our employees are men (86.5% as at 
31 December 2017). Although we are 
taking actions to bring more women into 
our companies and to promote internally, 
they are currently under-represented in 
our senior roles which is reflected in the 
upper pay quartile outcomes. Globally,  
we are making progress on increasing  
our female leadership, but we need to 
build more opportunities for women  
in our UK businesses.
As regards the bonus gap, only our 
leadership roles are eligible for 
participation in our LTIP programmes  
and these roles are male dominated.  
It is expected that over the next few 
years, the bonus gap will increase in line 
with the vesting of our LTIP awards for 
the leadership group, and also to reflect 
the vesting outcomes of awards held by 
our Executive Directors and UK-based 
Group Executive Members.
Improving diversity and working  
to close the gap
As a global company, we aim to reflect 
the diversity of our customers, and we 
seek to recruit, develop and promote 
people regardless of background and 
personal circumstances.
We are committed to making Weir  
a more diverse and inclusive place to 
work because we believe it improves 
the performance of our teams and we 
are committed to delivering current and 
new initiatives to make Weir a more 
diverse and inclusive place to work.
• Driving best practice: a cross-
business group working on Group-
wide D&I priorities including diversity 
training. During 2017, we established 
#Weirunitedindiversity, on Yammer, 
which is being used by our 
employees to share knowledge, 
learning and best practice.
• On a regular basis, our businesses 
undertake diversity audits against our 
diversity maturity model. This enables 
us to identify areas of best practice 
and to develop action plans to address 
areas needing improvement. Progress 
of resulting actions and initiatives is 
monitored by our Group Executive.
• Encouraging women into STEM: Weir 
Flow Control France is working with 
the French Ministry of Education to 
promote diversity and inclusion in the 
engineering sector, partnering with 
the government on an initiative which 
aims to boost the number of women 
pursuing careers in mechanical 
engineering. We have also founded 
the Association of Female Engineers 
to support and promote successful 
women in engineering to students  
in colleges and university.
• Weir Wise: we have partnered with 
the University of Strathclyde to 
inspire young female students to 
become the next generation of 
engineers. On a two-day programme, 
participants learn about the benefits 
of studying maths and physics, 
participate in team-based challenges 
and gain awareness of the university 
and Weir.
• Targeting 50% female intake on  
our global graduate programme.
• Primary Engineer – Weir Group  
is supporting Primary Engineer 
2017–2020 with funding towards  
two programmes: 1) Leaders’  
Awards and 2) Institution of  
Primary Engineers and Institution  
of Secondary Engineers. Leaders’ 
Awards is a free-to-schools 
programme, where pupils from  
both primary and secondary schools 
engage with engineers. As part of 
the programme, pupils interview an 
engineer and then, inspired by them, 
use engineering to solve a problem. 
They illustrate their invention and all 
entries are marked by engineers or 
those working in the industry. 
Students at the Faculty of Engineering 
at the University of Strathclyde then 
select a winning entry to be turned 
into a prototype each year. Through 
the Institution of Primary and 
Secondary Engineers, it is Primary 
Engineer’s aim is to develop the  
skills and confidence in teachers first 
and then extend from this secure 
foundation into the classroom,  
with programmes focusing on skills 
delivery and development. Weir’s 
own engineers are also working with 
Primary Engineer in schools where 
they have a presence, attending 
some of these sessions.
• Leadership development: we are 
looking to expand our learning and 
development programmes to provide 
more support for women with the 
establishment of mentoring groups. 
As we roll out this initiative, we  
will also pilot a reverse mentoring 
programme to build awareness, 
knowledge and empathy.
• Flexible working: we are working 
with our local business leadership 
teams to investigate ways we  
allow employees to work to suit  
their personal responsibilities  
and circumstances.
• We are a member of Opportunity 
Now which empowers employers  
to accelerate change for women  
in the workplace.
• We are a member of Race for 
Opportunity which is committed to 
improving employment opportunities 
for ethnic minorities across the UK.
• Charles Berry, our Chairman, is on 
the steering group of the Hampton-
Alexander Review which aims to 
improve the representation of 
women in leadership positions  
of FTSE 350 companies.

Ethics
Committed to business integrity
At Weir, we are proud to be a business 
which strives to achieve the highest 
ethical standards and sound business 
principles. This is firmly reflected in  
our corporate values and in our Code 
of Conduct. We understand our role  
in the communities we work in, and 
beyond, and the influence we can  
have to drive change. 
We also recognise the responsibilities 
that we share with our suppliers and 
we remain committed to establishing 
open and transparent relationships 
with them.
We are committed to business 
integrity and high ethical standards. 
We operate under a Code of Conduct 
which promotes honest and ethical 
behaviour and our aim is to ensure  
that our customers, suppliers, 
investors, employees, and the 
communities where we operate  
have the confidence to trust us.
FTSE4Good
We have been a member of FTSE4Good 
for seven years, an equity index series  
that is designed to facilitate investment in 
companies that meet globally recognised 
corporate responsibility standards. The 
Company is proud to have been able  
to consistently meet the stringent 
environmental, social and governance 
criteria set by FTSE4Good and we  
remain committed to continuously 
improving our performance in 2018.
Transparency International
We are a member of Transparency 
International UK’s Business Integrity 
Forum, the UK’s leading anti-corruption 
forum for businesses in all sectors.  
This membership enables us to support 
Transparency International’s global 
movement of seeking a world free from 
corruption. We have signed up to a set  
of principles and remain committed to 
fight against corruption and ensure that 
we are honest and accountable in the 
business that we do and that we strive 
to respect fundamental human rights 
and freedoms. 
Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct sets out the Weir 
values in a clear and concise manner.  
It promotes compliance with applicable 
laws, rules and regulations and provides 
details on how we expect our people  
to conduct themselves on a day-to-day 
basis, both internally and externally. 
The Code of Conduct provides a clear 
framework for decision-making in line 
with our values and behaviours. It applies 
to all Weir employees, agents and 
suppliers. Various measures are taken to 
ensure that we only enter into business 
relationships with third parties who are 
committed to applying similar standards. 
We not only stress the importance of 
complying with the Code of Conduct 
but also encourage our employees to 
promptly report any concerns or apparent 
breaches that they may become aware 
of without fear of retribution. Employees 
can also choose to report concerns 
anonymously through our Ethics Hotline. 
Our current Code of Conduct is available 
to download, in 13 languages, from  
our website.
We provide targeted mandatory 
e-learning training in respect of the  
Code of Conduct to employees who are 
deemed to have a potentially higher risk 
of exposure to bribery and corruption as a 
consequence of their geographic location 
and/or decision-making responsibilities.
To date, 4,700 employees have completed 
the anti-bribery and corruption compliance 
training. All new employees who are 
deemed to fall into the higher risk 
category must undertake the training as 
part of their induction. After completion  
of the training, all participants are asked to 
confirm that they have read, understood 
and will comply with the Code of Conduct.
The Code of Conduct is reinforced 
through various means of communication 
with our employees, such as Town Hall 
meetings, conferences, training courses 
and our integration process in respect of 
new acquisitions. We have an established 
training programme in place and the Weir 
legal team continues to provide face-to-
face training to employees of various 
operating companies worldwide. In 2017, 
the team conducted training in Trio USA, 
Trio China, Weir Minerals Europe, Weir 
Minerals Africa, Weir Gabbioneta and 
Weir Dubai. 
Any employee found in breach of  
the Code of Conduct may be liable  
to disciplinary action, up to and  
including termination of employment  
or cancellation of contract. We also 
ensure that we have a right to  
terminate any agency agreement in  
the event that any agent is found to  
be in breach of its ethical obligations. 
Information on the Code of Conduct and 
its application in the Company’s supply 
chain can be found in the Suppliers and 
third parties section below.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Conflicts of interest
Our Conflicts of Interest Policy places 
particular emphasis on outlining  
what may constitute a conflict and  
the correct process for disclosing any 
perceived conflict to management.  
The policy provides clear guidance  
to all of our employees to assist them 
with understanding the mandatory 
requirements for the identification, 
reporting and management of actual  
or potential conflicts of interest. 
Anti-bribery and corruption
As part of our commitment to continually 
monitoring and improving anti-bribery  
and corruption practices throughout our 
global operations, we have reviewed  
our anti-bribery policy and expect to 
implement the update of this policy  
in 2018. In addition, our internal audit 
department regularly undertake anti-
bribery and corruption reviews. They 
maintain a cyclical, risk-based plan with 
four Code of Conduct reviews specific  
to anti-bribery and corruption undertaken 
during 2017 in addition to our standard 
internal audit programme of both full  
and limited scope reviews. No indicators 
of any bribery or corruption were found  
in 2017. 
Gifts and hospitality 
A review of our Gifts and Hospitality 
Policy was undertaken in 2017 and the 
focus in 2018 will be on training and 
raising continued awareness of the  
Gifts and Hospitality Policy.
Modern Slavery Act
We understand our role in eradicating 
slavery of any kind. Following a review  
of our existing policies and practices  
and in light of the introduction of the 
Modern Slavery Act in the UK, we 
published our first annual Modern  
Slavery Statement in March 2017 and 
have subsequently developed a training 
programme for specific employees on 
this issue. A copy of our statement can  
be found on our website at www.global.
weir/site-information/modern-slavery-
statement.pdf. This statement details  
the steps we are taking to ensure that 
slavery and human trafficking do not  
take place in any of our supply chains  
or in any part of our business.
We have a number of measures in  
place to protect human rights including 
the Code of Conduct, Weir Supply  
Chain Policy, Weir SHE Standards and  
a programme of supplier audits and 
reviews. Our Human Rights Policy has 
also been updated to ensure it reflects 
recent legal developments in this area.  
In addition, a mandatory e-learning 
training programme has been developed 
and is, in the first instance, aimed at 
employees who are located in identified 
high-risk jurisdictions. The e-learning 
programme aims to increase awareness 
and compliance with the Modern Slavery 
Act and Weir’s responsibilities. 
General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR)
With GDPR being applicable from  
May 2018, we have been reviewing and 
updating existing policies and procedures 
and, where applicable, implementing new 
practices to ensure compliance with the 
new legislation.
Suppliers and third parties
We source raw materials, components 
and services across the globe. Our 
suppliers play a critical role in our 
business and our relationships with them 
are based on achieving best performance, 
product, delivery, service and total cost  
in an ethical and sustainable manner. 
Embracing a closer relationship with  
our key suppliers is fundamental to our 
Value Chain Excellence initiative.
We recognise that our responsibilities 
extend to our supply chain. We have  
a Supply Chain Policy which sets out  
the minimum standards we expect our 
suppliers to abide by with respect to:
• business ethics;
• how they treat their workforce;
• legal and regulatory compliance;
• health and safety; and
• environmental standards.
Weir is a member of the UK government-
sponsored Prompt Payment Code (PPC), 
which sets standards designed to support 
on-time payment to small and medium 
sized enterprises (SMEs) as well as wider 
payment procedures. Best practice is 
administered by the Chartered Institute  
of Credit Management and compliance 
with the principles of the PPC is closely 
monitored and enforced by the PPC 
Compliance Board.
In addition, the Group is committed to 
working only with third parties, including 
customers, sub-contractors, suppliers  
and joint venture and strategic alliance 
partners, whose business ethics and 
behaviours are consistent with our own 
Code of Conduct.
Our Code of Conduct is issued to all  
of our key suppliers. Assessments are 
undertaken with regard to compliance 
with Group standards and Group policies 
as part of the vetting process for new 
suppliers. In addition, key suppliers are 
audited regularly to ensure ongoing 
compliance. We are also implementing  
a mandatory training programme for  
our employees to improve their 
understanding and ability to identify  
signs of Modern Slavery within supply 
chains to promote fair and honest 
business practices. Wherever possible, 
we work with our suppliers to support 
them to address weaknesses identified.
Conflict Minerals Policy
We continue to monitor guidance and 
legislation in relation to conflict minerals 
and in particular the responsible sourcing 
of tungsten, tantalum, tin and gold (the 
‘3TG’ minerals). Along with internal 
briefings and updates, we have prepared 
a Conflict Minerals Policy in order to 
ensure compliance as necessary. We 
continue to work with our customers  
to provide the supply chain information 
when required.

Our Communities
Building relationships with  
our local communities
Weir is a global business which 
operates in over 70 countries. We set 
clear expectations for how each of our 
businesses should interact and engage 
with people and other organisations. 
Wherever we operate in the world, 
we aim to:
• enhance the local community 
by running our operations safely, 
ethically and responsibly;
• respect the communities we 
operate in; and
• invest in the communities for 
the long-term mutual benefit of 
the community and Weir.
We strive to build close relationships  
in our communities by keeping local 
people informed about projects which 
might affect them. If issues arise, we 
listen and do our best to help to find a 
solution. Our Ethics Hotline is available 
for any individual to use if they wish  
to raise concerns about ethical and 
compliance-related conduct involving 
any Weir Group company. 
In addition to approaching community 
relations in an open and transparent 
manner, we seek to support charitable 
organisations through donations and 
volunteering.
We recognise that as an organisation  
with a global reach, our influence is not 
insignificant, particularly in developing 
countries. Our charitable and philanthropic 
work focuses on the key priorities of 
improving the health and education of  
our employees and the local community. 
We recognise that contributing to these 
important areas can have an enduring 
positive effect on the local area.
In addition to supporting charitable 
organisations, Weir contributes to local 
communities by being a source of 
employment, education and training; 
through the payment of taxes; and, in 
many instances, the contribution to local 
supply chains. This can make a substantial 
positive contribution to the communities 
in which we operate.
The Group supports the health of its 
employees, their families and communities 
through various programmes and 
initiatives, which are often run in 
partnership with local service providers.
Weir is a 147-year-old engineering 
company, and our commitment to  
training is as strong in the 21st century  
as it was in the 19th. We are dedicated  
to developing engineering excellence and 
we were the first company in Scotland  
to set up an apprentice school. Weir  
is a founding member of the Institute  
of Primary and Secondary Engineers,  
an institution which seeks to promote 
science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics subjects to school children 
of all ages in the UK.
Weir provides experience and training to 
develop the next generation of engineers. 
Although our focus is on engineering,  
we also provide work placements and 
internships across all sectors. Our 
placements give young people from 
around the world the opportunity to 
experience working for a global business.
Charitable giving
In 2017, the total amount of charitable 
donations made by Group companies  
was £533,603 (2016: £456,000). We  
do not make political donations. Our 
charitable donations include cash and 
non-cash items such as services, 
materials, employee time and use  
of corporate facilities.
In 2017 the Group continued to support 
Newlands Junior College, a vocational 
school that provides career opportunities 
to young people who have become 
disengaged from the traditional education 
system. The College provides vocational 
training and helps young people to 
develop and reach their potential The 
Group donated £100,000 to Newlands 
Junior College in 2017.
The Group continues to support The 
Arkwright Scholarships Trust following 
initial engagement in 2012. Partnering 
with organisations in industry and 
professional engineering institutions, 
the programme identifies and nurtures 
high-potential students in UK schools, 
encouraging them to pursue engineering 
or technical design at university or 
through a higher-level apprenticeship. 
In 2017, the two scholars who were 
recruited in 2016 undertook a five-day 
summer placement at our facility in Venlo, 
the Netherlands. We were delighted to 
welcome another two scholars onto the 
programme at an awards ceremony in 
Edinburgh in October 2017.
The Group continued to support Primary

the Group will support Primary Engineer 
with the Scottish Engineering Leaders 
Awards and continues to support the 
Institute of Primary Engineers and 
Institute of Secondary Engineers.
Employee activities
We are very proud of the charitable work 
that our people undertake. Our businesses 
operate their own policies for supporting 
these, whether by matching donations, 
providing support or equipment or by 
allowing employees to participate in 
charitable activities during working hours.
During 2017, our employees 
undertook many charitable projects. 
A small selection of these projects 
is highlighted below.
Weir Minerals Peru tree planting
In August 2017, Weir Minerals Peru held 
its second volunteer initiative, ‘Hands  
of Solidarity – Tree Planting Campaign 
2017’. The objective was to highlight 
the importance of environmental care 
and preservation by planting trees and 
shrubs, while improving the appearance 
of the park adjacent to the Weir Minerals 
facility in Lima. More than 100 employees 
volunteered and participated with great 
enthusiasm and team spirit. Three groups 
were organised: Air, Water and Land.  
The ‘Air’ group participated in planting  
90 trees and shrubs in the park. The 
‘Water’ group planted more than 300 
shrubs to create a hedge, and the ‘Earth’ 
group sowed more than 250 m

Environment
Creating opportunities to improve the 
environmental performance of our 
operations and those of our customers.
We are committed to doing business 
responsibly and sustainably. How we 
operate is just as important as how  
we deliver financial success.
We believe that acting in an 
environmentally sustainable way 
protects and creates long-term value, 
not just for our shareholders, but for 
all our stakeholders, and supports  
the long-term future of our business.
In a competitive world with finite 
resources, managing the environmental 
performance of our operations makes 
good business sense.
We actively invest in research and 
development through our central 
research and development hub as  
well as through its network of 
academic research partners in some  
of the world’s leading universities.
This enables us to develop and 
exploit emerging technologies to 
create new products for our end 
markets and provide competitive 
advantages to our customers  
through leading edge technology,  
with improved operational efficiency 
and environmental management, 
reduced energy consumption, 
emissions, water use and  
waste production.
2017 performance highlights
Operational control
The Weir SHE Management Standards set 
our expectations and provide a framework 
for environmental risk management, 
incorporating key elements such as 
regulatory compliance, risk assessment, 
self-audit, and employee engagement.
Our continued commitment to robust 
environmental protection is well reflected 
in the performance of our facilities.
We are pleased to report a 2.5% increase 
in overall compliance with environmental 
standards across our businesses during 
2017, compared to that assessed in 2016.
Environmental protection
No environmental incidents, penalties or 
fines were reported at sites under the 
operational control of the Group during 
the year ended 31 December 2017.
Operational resilience
As a business with global reach we 
can be exposed to a wide range of 
extreme weather events in different 
geographic locations.
In 2017 ‘Hurricane Harvey’ landed in the 
US, the most powerful hurricane to hit 
the state of Texas in more than 50 years, 
and one of the country’s costliest natural 
disasters with damage estimated at 
$125 billion (£90 billion).
Introduction
Creating a more sustainable future
Our role in the circular economy
We are proud to play a role in helping 
our partners and customers move 
towards a more circular economy.
A circular economy seeks to design  
out waste and pollution, keep resources 
in use for as long as possible, extract 
maximum value whilst in use, then 
recover and regenerate at the end of 
service life.
Circularity has clear environmental and 
social benefits, reducing pressure on 
natural finite resources by rethinking and 
redesigning beyond the traditional linear 
economy of ‘Take, make, and dispose’.
During 2017, Weir Minerals Europe 
secured the perfect opportunity to support 
regional ambitions for greater circularity 
through a new waste recovery facility in 
the Netherlands. The facility is being 
built by ACCN (Ash Cleaning Company 
Netherlands), a joint venture between 
Boskalis Environmental and Inashco.

interests through our technical support 
and innovative products.
For example, the total mine dewatering 
solutions provided by Weir Minerals, 
drawing on extensive engineering and 
application expertise.
It is important, particularly where water  
is in short supply that we continue to 
develop technology to ensure that the 
water drawn out by dewatering systems 
becomes a resource for mining or even 
for other uses by communities surrounding 
the mine sites. Rather than it going to 
waste, it is increasingly important to 
manage and reuse the water effectively, 
improving the resilience of mine site 
processes and activities in increasingly 
harsh environments.
Resource efficiency
Our foundries and manufacturing 
facilities continually seek to improve 
resource efficiency and to reduce costs; 
delivering real results for our Value Chain 
Excellence initiative.

We report on all emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 2013. These sources fall within our consolidated financial statement. We do not have 
responsibility for emission sources that are not included in our consolidated statement.
We have referred to the ‘GHG Protocol: Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (revised edition) and used emission factors from the UK Government’s ‘GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2017’  
and other region-specific emissions factors where available.
Over 15,100 tonnes of scrap metal were 
reused within our foundry operations 
during 2017, comprising 42% of all metal 
poured in the foundries (2016: 34%).  
This was a notable increase on 2016 
figures and a great outcome from 
efficiency-focused initiatives, such  
as the Foundry Best Practice Forum.
CDP climate change initiative
We submit annual CDP reports to 
share our risk management approach 
to climate change and our greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions performance.
In 2017, we achieved a score of ‘C: 
Awareness’ for changes implemented  
to business strategy and the reductions  
in GHG emissions achieved. 
2017 CDP score
C
Greenhouse gas emissions
As an energy and carbon intensive 
business, operating seven foundries 
worldwide, the Group recognises the 
importance of measuring and minimising 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
from operations over which it has control.
The Group’s total annual GHG emissions 
in tCO
2e for the year ended 31 December 
2017 were 133,737 tCO 2e (2016: 136,167 
tCO 2e). This comprises a 2% decrease  
in total absolute GHG emissions for the 
Group when compared with 2016 figures.
During 2017, total GHG emissions for  
our seven foundries decreased by 3%. 
Carbon intensity of the metals poured 
improved marginally with the use of  
lower carbon fuels.
With the Weir Minerals Europe (WME) 
total solutions approach and its excellent 
cross-team collaboration, we secured an 
order for a range of equipment, including 
Warman Slurry Pumps, submersible 
Screw Flow Pumps, Cavex Cyclones,  
a Linatex Dense Medium Separator,  
Trio Coarse and Fine Material Washers 
and a TRIO Impact Crusher. 
Once built, our equipment will enable  
the advanced washing installation to 
recycle up to 500,000 tonnes of bottom 
ash, a by-product from the incineration  
of household waste in nearby waste-to-
energy plants, into valuable raw materials, 
including metals, sand and gravels. 
This follows technical advice and specialist 
equipment provided by WME for the HVC 
WASH facility in the same region, the 
world’s first large-scale fully integrated 
washing plant for incinerator bottom ash. 
The facility diverts bottom ash from 
landfill, provides recycled raw materials 
for road construction and concrete 
products, and also separates valuable 
metals for reuse. 
With expertise in innovative equipment 
and industry-leading knowledge of waste 
recovery and recycling, WME is proud  
of the critical role it plays in solutions for  
a more circular economy.

The UK Corporate Governance Code
The UK Corporate Governance Code  
(the ‘Code’) is published by the Financial 
Reporting Council and sets out the 
standards of good practice in relation  
to matters such as Board composition 
and effectiveness, the role of Board 
Committees, risk management, 
remuneration and relations with 
shareholders. The Code can be  
obtained from the Financial Reporting 
Council via its website at frc.org.uk.
As a listed company, we are required  
to explain how we have complied with 
the Code and applied its principles and 
provisions. We must also provide an 
explanation of any instances where we 
have not. This Corporate Governance 
Report, together with the Nomination, 
Audit and Remuneration Committee 
Reports, details how the Company has 
applied the main principles of the Code  
in 2017. For the year ended 31 December 
2017 to the date of this Annual Report,  
the Board considers that the Company  
has complied fully with the Code.
The Financial Conduct Authority’s 
Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 
(“DTR 7.2.6”) requires the corporate 
governance statement to contain certain 
information required by Schedule 7 to  
the Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (SI 2008/410). This 
information relates to significant interests 
in the securities of the Company, 
securities carrying special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company, 
restrictions on voting rights, rules 
regarding the appointment and 
replacement of Directors, rules regarding 
changes to the Company’s Articles of 
Association and the Directors’ powers in 
relation to the issuing or buying back by 
the Company of its shares. The relevant 
information can be found in within the 
Directors’ Report on pages 116 to 118.
The following Corporate Governance 
Report, including the Committee Reports 
and the Directors’ Report, sets out how 
we apply these governance standards 
in practice and demonstrates our 
compliance with the Code.
Leadership 
The Board sets the tone of the Company 
with regards to corporate governance

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance Report
Chairman’s introduction to governance 
Driving performance through culture
Charles Berry
Chairman
Q 
As Chairman, what is your view 
on the role of governance?
As Chairman, I focus on ensuring that  
the Board delivers effective leadership  
in order to ensure the long-term success 
of the Company. The Board sets the tone 
from the top by defining and demonstrating 
the Company’s values and standards. The 
Board recognises that a robust corporate 
governance framework is essential to 
deliver the strategy of the Group and 
ensure the highest standards of integrity. 
Q 
What role does the Board play in 
setting the culture of the business?
The Board leads by example and works 
diligently to ensure that the Weir values, 
corporate strategy and business model 
are embedded within our culture and at all 
levels and aspects of our business. This 
approach allows us to establish a culture 
which is resilient and adaptive to change. 
The Board remains committed to driving 
the culture of the business and ensuring 
that this is reflected in our Code of 
Conduct and commitment to our people.
Q 
Sustainability is integral  
to the business. What role  
does the Board play in managing this? 
Every member of the Board views 
themselves as stewards of the business 
with a clear responsibility to ensure its long-
term success. That long-term approach 
defines how we develop the strategic 
direction of the Group, assess risks and 
opportunities and ultimately deliver 
sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
Q 
The Board Effectiveness  
Review was led externally  
this year. What did it identify?
It identified that further enhancement of 
the Non-Executive Directors’ engagement 
with various levels of the business and  
a more structured schedule of informal 
site visits would be valuable. A review  
and possible refinement of the annual 
programme and schedule of meetings 
was also recommended.
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for 2017. As 
Chairman, I continue to focus on  
ensuring our governance structure 
remains appropriate, whilst supporting 
our strategy and culture and ensuring  
that the Board delivers prudent and 
effective leadership in order to discharge 
its duties responsibly and effectively.  
 
Good corporate governance is critical  
to building a successful and sustainable 
business and enabling us to create 
long-term value more effectively. The 
focus on corporate governance is forever 
increasing and the Board is committed  
to maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance as this is the key  
to the continued long-term success of 
your Company.
In the Corporate Governance Report,  
I describe our governance structure,  
how the Board works and areas that  
your Board has focused on during  
the year as well as the work of the  
Board Committees.
Statement of Compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code
I am pleased to report that the  
Company has fully complied with all  
the principles of the Code for the year 
ended 31 December 2017, and from  
that date to the date of approval of  
this Annual Report.
Q 
The Board is accountable for  
the Group’s management of risk.  
How does the Board monitor this?
The Board reviews the Group Risk 
Dashboard at each Board meeting and 
receives presentations from Executive 
Directors, Divisional Presidents, Group 
Executive members and functional 
leaders which include aspects of the 
Group’s principal and other risks together 
with how they are being controlled or 
otherwise mitigated. The Risk Committee 
reports bi-annually to the Board with a 
detailed assessment of each principal 
risk, internal audit and compliance 
scorecard results, developments in  
risk management approaches and  
any significant matters for the Board’s 
consideration. On an annual basis,  
the Board will also review the Group’s 
Risk Appetite Statement.
Q 
What engagement with 
shareholders has the Board  
had during the year?
The Board is responsible for ensuring  
that satisfactory dialogue with shareholders 
takes places throughout the year. In order 
to establish and maintain good relationships 
with the shareholders of the Company, 
the Directors meet with major shareholders 
in order to keep them informed of 
significant developments and to listen  
to their views. You can read more about 
how the Board members engaged with 
shareholders during 2017 on page 83.

Compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’)
The Company has fully complied with all the principles of the Code  
for the year ended 31 December 2017, and from that date to the date  
of approval of this Annual Report.
• Corporate Governance Report  
on page 68.
Going concern basis The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue to operate for a period of at least 
12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.  
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. In forming this view, the Directors 
have reviewed the Group’s budgets, plans and cash flow forecasts, 
including market downturn sensitivities. In addition, the Directors have 
considered the potential impact of credit risk and liquidity risk detailed  
in note 30 to the Group financial statements on pages 177 to 183.  
Each of these items has been considered in relation to the Group’s 
banking facilities described in note 20 on pages 160 and 161.
• Directors’ Report on page 116.
Viability statement In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over  
a three-year period, taking into account the Group’s current position  
and the potential impact of the principal risks documented on pages 50 
to 55 of the Annual Report. Based on this assessment, the Directors 
confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the period to 31 December 2020.
• Risk review: How We Manage 
Risk on page 46.
Robust assessment  
of the principal risks  
facing the Group and 
annual review of systems  
of risk management  
and internal control
During the year, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
systems of risk management and internal control and conducted a  
robust assessment of the principal risks affecting the Group in line  
with the Risk Appetite Statement. These activities meet the Board’s 
responsibilities in connection with Risk Management and Internal  
Control set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
•  Risk review: How We Manage 
Risk on page 46.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide  
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

responsibilities on page 119.
Modern Slavery Statement As a Company, we understand our role in eradicating modern slavery. 
Following an extensive review of our existing policies and practices

prepared an annual Modern Slavery Statement and has subsequently

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Q 
What do you feel your role  
as a Non-Executive Director  
is at the Weir Group? 
It can best be described as a mixture  
of counsel and constructive challenge.  
As a Non-Executive Director, my job is  
to bring my experience, objectivity and 
independence to the Board and use it  
to offer unbiased scrutiny and guidance, 
particularly on matters such as strategy, 
risk, remuneration, succession and 
assessing the overall performance of  
the business. To do that you need a  
good understanding of the Group and,  
in a very global business such as Weir, 
that means getting out to operations  
and meeting employees, customers  
and other stakeholders. Ultimately, each 
of us has a responsibility to contribute to 
building a stronger Weir, just as previous 
generations did for over a hundred years.  
I know every member of the Board, 
Non-Executive and Executive, takes  
that responsibility very seriously. 
Q 
The composition of the Board 
has changed in the past year, 
what difference has that made? 
Naturally you miss colleagues who have 
stepped down, but change opens the 
door to new perspectives and input from 
different experiences, which is beneficial 
and refreshing. Melanie Gee, who left in 
September, was a great Board member 
and made very positive contributions  
to our discussions, particularly on 
remuneration and portfolio decisions. 
Since they joined late in 2017, both  
Clare Chapman and Barbara Jeremiah 
have already made a significant impact. 
Ultimately, a successful Board depends 
on a balance of experienced points of 
view. I think Weir has a good mix of  
skills and abilities and, most importantly,  
a shared understanding of responsibility 
and purpose.
Q 
There is an increasing focus  
on diversity and inclusion  
on UK Boards. How important  
an issue do you think this is? 
I am passionate about equality of 
opportunity and about the benefits  
to businesses and society of diverse  
and inclusive workplaces. This doesn’t 
mean gender alone, but ethnicity,  
race, age, personality, nationality and 
experience. A well-functioning Board  
– and company – is a blend of different 
skills and perspectives operating in an 
inclusive environment. That’s why I’m 
delighted to see that building greater 
diversity at all levels of the business  
is a priority for the Group.
Mary Jo Jacobi 
Non-Executive Director
A view from the 
Boardroom table 
Corporate Governance Report
Leadership continued
Q 
You serve on both the 
Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees; what does membership 
of these Committees entail?
The Board has several committees 
dedicated to aspects of the Company, 
and they require the same approach  
in terms of scrutiny and support. The 
Remuneration Committee seeks to 
determine and recommend to the  
Board the framework for the rewards 
and incentives to Executives to 
encourage them to enhance the 
Company’s performance and ensure 
delivery of sustainable value over the 
long term. We do this by assessing  
Weir against its peers, ensuring legal 
and regulatory compliance, analysing 
risk and consulting with shareholders 
and other stakeholders to be sure there 
are stretching targets for Executives  
to meet. The Nomination Committee 
consists of only Non-Executive  
Directors and considers the structure 
and composition of the Board and 
ensures that the processes of 
succession planning and nomination, 
evaluation and selection for both  
Board and senior management roles  
are robust and inclusive, something  
Weir has always taken very seriously. 
Q 
You have Board and corporate 
governance experience  
in both the UK and USA. How  
do the two regimes compare?
Traditionally, the US model has been 
more “regulator led” while the UK  
has been more “shareholder led”.  
The financial crisis generated an array  
of legislative and regulatory changes  
in the US to make companies more 
accountable and transparent. In the  
UK, the Financial Reporting Council  
is considering major changes to the 
Corporate Governance Code to improve 
the quality of governance of the UK’s 
largest companies. The hallmark of both 
approaches is the recognition of the 
important impact that companies have 
on the full array of stakeholders and on 
society. I think that Weir is well placed 
with its UK headquarters and extensive 
US operations to build long-term value 
for its stakeholders in both countries.

responsibilities to these committees  
and utilise the areas of expertise 
contained within them. The Excellence 
Committees report to the Group 
Executive and to the Board as required.
The composition of the various committees 
along with their accompanying Terms  
of Reference, the matters reserved to  
the Board for approval and delegated 
authority matrices combine to create a 
clear authority matrix across the Group  
for timely and effective decision-making. 
This structure provides the Board with 
confidence that important decisions are 
being taken at the appropriate levels, and 
ensures that information flows both up 
and down the reporting lines.
Board meetings
The Board meets regularly in order  
to effectively discharge its duties.  
Board meetings are held in person  
or by video-conferencing. During 2017, 
there were eight scheduled meetings  
and two additional unscheduled Board 
meetings. In October 2017, the Board 
meeting was held in South Africa and 
full details can be found on page 81. In 
addition to the formal Board meetings, 
the Board maintains an open dialogue 
throughout the year and contact by 
telephone occurs whenever necessary. 
As encouraged by the Code, the Non-
Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, met once during the year 
without Executive Directors present. 
The table below details the attendance  
at Board meetings of each of the 
Directors during their term of office  
for the year to 31 December 2017.
The Board’s annual timetable is  
discussed at least 12 months prior to  
its commencement to allow the Directors 
to plan their time accordingly. The 2018 
annual timetable was discussed at the 
Board meeting in April 2016 and January 
2017 and circulated as soon as it was 
finalised. This process ensures that the 
Chairman is comfortable that each 
Director is able to devote the time and 
resources required. The Board agenda 
process ensures that the Board has the 
confidence that all items are scheduled 
at the most appropriate time of the year 
and there is sufficient time for discussion 
by the Board, allowing the Directors to 
discharge their duties effectively. 
Matters reserved to the Board
The Board recognises that in order to 
ensure the long-term success of the 
Company, certain matters should be 
reserved for the consideration and 
decision of the Board alone. Other 
matters may be delegated by the  
Board to its Committees or executive 
management. In accordance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, these 
decisions are formally recorded in a 
document entitled Matters Reserved to 
the Board for Approval. This document  
is reviewed annually to ensure that  
it remains appropriate and that there  
is an effective framework in place to 
support the Board’s decision-making 
process. The document is available  
on the Company’s website at  
www.corporategovernance.weir.
Board activities during 2017
During the year, the Chairman, supported 
by the Chief Executive Officer and  
the Company Secretary, maintained a 
rolling 12-month agenda for Board and 
Committee meetings. At each meeting, 
the Board received reports from the Chief 
Executive Officer and other members  
of the Group Executive. This included 
updates and information on safety, 
strategy, legal and financial matters. The 
Board also receives updates from each 
Committee Chairman on items from the 
most recent committee meeting as well 
as periodic updates as required. Standing 
items also included reviewing the Group’s 
risk dashboard and internal controls, 
safety, strategy and succession planning.
In order to effectively discharge their 
duties, the Non-Executive Directors met 
regularly with senior management and 
received presentations by members of 
the Group’s senior management team 
and other external advisers as required. 
The Board also received an annual review 
on the following matters: asbestos, 
insurance and risk management, the 
Ethics Hotline, Value Chain Excellence, 
HR, tax, treasury and agents.

External Board Effectiveness Review
The Board Effectiveness Review 
operates on a three-year cycle. 2017’s 
review will be followed by two years of 
internal evaluation carried out using an 
on-line confidential online questionnaire.
This year, the external Board 
Effectiveness Review was undertaken 
by Independent Audit Limited, who 
have no other connection with the 
Company. The process is detailed 
in the table below.
The Company Secretary is responsible  
for ensuring all new Directors  
receive a comprehensive tailored 
induction programme. 
When a new Director is appointed  
to the Board, they are provided with 
information on the Group’s structure, 
operations, policies and other relevant 
documentation. The induction process 
also includes meetings with senior 
Executives in the Company, a formal 
briefing on legal and governance  
matters from the Company Secretary  
and visits to the Company’s operations.
Directors are informed of important 
changes to laws and regulations affecting 
the Group’s business and their duties as 
Directors. The Company Secretary advises 
the Board on governance matters and is 
available to all Directors for advice as 
required. In addition, the Board meets 
once a year or more at one of the  
Group’s operational sites, occasions 
which include presentations from key 
senior employees and the opportunity  
to meet employees. 
The Chairman regularly reviews and 
agrees with each Director their training 
and development needs. Additional 
induction and training is also available  
to new committee members as  
required. Training is also built into  
the Board meetings, with relevant  
topics being covered.
Stage 1
Review of Board and  
Committee papers.
Stage 2
Interviews held with 22 individuals, namely:  
the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer,  
Chief Financial Officer, Senior Independent 
Director, all Non-Executive Directors, 
Company Secretary and General Counsel, 
all members of the Group Executive 
Committee, Group Financial Controller,  
Head of Internal Audit, PwC Audit Partner, 
Remuneration Advisers EY and Deloitte.
The areas that were covered  
in the interviews included: 
• Board composition.
• The focus of the Board. 
•  Non-Executive Directors’ interaction with 
the business.
• The practical arrangements.
• Risk and controls.
Stage 3
Observation of the  
Board meeting held  
in September 2017.
Review of the 
Chairman carried  
out by the Senior 
Independent Director.
Stage 4
Dedicated discussion analysing what  
was learned and sharing of results at 
the Board meeting in December 2017 
with the reviewer present. Followed  
by one-to-one discussions between  
the Chairman and Directors.
Findings
• It was noted from the observation of the Board meeting 
held in September that the Board is functioning well and 
the composition sets the Board up well for good meeting 
dynamics and debate. Overall, the atmosphere is collegiate 
and collaborative.
• Succession planning for the Board is a well established 
process and a strength of the Company.
• There is a thorough induction process for Directors.
Outcomes
• Further enhancement of Non-Executive Directors’ 
engagement with various levels of the business and 
a more structured schedule of informal site visits.
• Continued increased focus of the Board on people  
and culture, as the new Chief People Officer works  
with the Executive team on succession planning, talent 
management and employee engagement as well as 
enhanced reporting to the Board in these areas.
• A review and possible refinement of the annual calendar 
and schedule of meetings. 
External Board Effectiveness Review cycle
The Effectiveness Review operates on a three-year cycle. 2017’s externally led review will be followed by two years of internal 
review carried out using an on-line questionnaire facilitated by an external provider.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Induction programme
During 2017, tailored induction 
programmes were designed for our two 
newly appointed Non-Executive Directors,  
Clare Chapman and Barbara Jeremiah.
The Company Secretary delivered  
the induction programme which was 
designed to reflect the Non-Executive 
Director’s background, experience, 
knowledge and their appointment  
to the relevant Committee.
The inductions covered the Company’s 
history, culture, strategy, structure and 
operations, as well as Corporate 
Governance framework and policies, 
Board and Committee process, calendars, 
Code of Conduct and Directors’ Duties 
It also included meetings with the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, Non-
Executive Directors, Group Executive 
Members, Group’s operation and 
functional leaders, advisers and brokers. 
Inductions in action 
Clare Chapman and Barbara Jeremiah
Training and professional development
Following on from the induction period, 
there are other training and development 
opportunities at regular intervals 
throughout the year as indicated here.
As part of their inductions, both  
Clare and Barbara attended a briefing 
session with external legal counsel  
on Directors’ Duties. 
Site visits are arranged to ensure that 
newly appointed Directors have an 
understanding of our business as early 
as possible following appointment.
Barbara visited our operation in Fort 
Worth, USA, and will undertake further 
visits in 2018, including to Dubai.
Clare has a planned visit for Todmorden 
with further site visits during the year.
Following the delivery of the induction

Effectiveness continued
The Board considers that it has the  
right combination of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge to be 
effective in meeting the needs of  
the Group. More than half of the  
Board are Non-Executive Directors  
who are considered by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement.
This combination of individuals and  
skills ensures that the Board is 
sufficiently balanced and that no 
individual or group of individuals can 
dominate the decision-making process. 
It also allows for an effective division  
of responsibilities within the Board  
and its Committees. The positions of 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are held separately and are clearly 
defined in writing. Each Director devotes 
sufficient time and attention in order  
to perform their duties effectively.
The Board is supplied in a timely manner 
with the appropriate information to enable 
it to discharge its duties. The Chairman 
ensures that Non-Executive Directors 
are properly briefed on any issues arising 
at Board meetings and Non-Executive 
Directors have the ability to communicate 
with the Chairman at any time.
Re-election
In accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and good 
practice, Barbara Jeremiah and Clare 
Chapman will offer themselves for 
election at the Company’s AGM on 
26 April 2018. As previously announced, 
John Mogford and Alan Ferguson will 
step down from the Board in April 2018 
after the AGM. All other Directors on 
the Board will seek re-election at the 
Company’s AGM in compliance with 
the Code. Stephen Young joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director and 
member of the Audit Committee from 
1 January 2018. Stephen will succeed 
Alan as Audit Committee Chairman  
from 26 April 2018. 
The Executive Directors have contracts  
of service with one year’s notice, whilst 
Non-Executive Directors’ appointments 
can be terminated with six months’ 
notice. The letters of appointment of  
the Chairman and the Non-Executive 
Directors are available for inspection  
at the Company’s registered office and 
set out the required commitment to the 
Company. Further details can also be 
found in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on pages 95 to 115. Details  
of the Directors’ service contracts, 
emoluments, the interests of the 
Directors in the share capital of the 
Company and options to subscribe for 
shares in the Company are also disclosed  
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors and their other interests
Under the Companies Act 2006, a 
Director of a company must avoid  
a situation in which he or she has, or  
can have, a direct or indirect interest  
that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, 
with the interests of the Company. The 
Company has a formal procedure in place 
to manage the disclosure, consideration 
and, if appropriate, the authorisation of 
any such possible conflict. Each Director 
is aware of the requirement to notify  
the Board, via the Company Secretary,  
as soon as they become aware of any 
possible conflict or a material change to 
an existing authorisation. Upon receipt  
of any such notification, the Board, in 
accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association, will consider the situation 
before deciding whether to approve the 
perceived conflict. At the outset of every 
Board meeting, the Chairman checks that 
no new conflicts have arisen. Only those 
Directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered are able to take 
part in the relevant decision and Directors 
are able to impose limits or conditions 
when giving authorisation if they think  
this is appropriate. The Director in 
question will then be notified of the 
outcome. Overall, the Board is satisfied 
that there are appropriate procedures  
in place to deal with conflicts of interest 
and that they have operated effectively.
None of the Non-Executive Directors 
have any material business or other 
relationship with the Company or its 
management. Sir Jim McDonald is the 
Principal and Vice Chancellor of the 
University of Strathclyde, but he has  
no direct involvement on a day-to-day 
basis in relation to the Weir Advanced 
Research Centre (WARC) which is 
operated by the Company in conjunction 
with the University of Strathclyde. 
Nevertheless, he will offer to recuse 
himself from any discussions regarding  
the relationship between the Group and 
the University of Strathclyde, whether  
in relation to WARC or otherwise.

Board visit to South Africa
Africa is home to some of the world’s 
finest ore grades and consequently has  
a vibrant mining market that is supported 
by Weir from our regional headquarters in 
South Africa. The business is also using 
its technology to expand into adjacent 
markets, such as sand and aggregates, 
and the Board met and toured a customer 
site to get direct input on the challenges 
being faced by the industry and the 
opportunities for Weir to help customers 
meet their objectives.
In addition to serving its customers,  
Weir Minerals Africa has made a positive 
contribution to both developing its people 
and improving safety and has taken a 
very active role in its local communities. 
This includes programmes to encourage 
more young women in South Africa to 
consider engineering as a future career. 
You can read more about this initiative 
on page 59. 
As part of its regular programme of  
site visits to get first-hand experience  
of the Group’s operations, the Board 
visited Weir Minerals Africa, which is 
based in Johannesburg. During the  
visit, the Board received presentations 
on the business and its prospects  
from local management and met, and 
listened to views from, employees at  
its manufacturing facilities in Isando and 
Alrode. This included officially opening  
a new moulding carousel at our foundry 
which will support future growth.

Accountability
The Audit Committee and auditors
Details on the roles and responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee, and its 
members can be found in the Audit 
Committee Report on pages 88 to 94. 
Information on the Company’s external 
auditors is contained within the Audit 
Committee Report.
Internal control and risk 
management
In accordance with the Code and  
the accompanying Guidance on Risk 
Management and Internal Controls,  
the Group has an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing  
the significant risks through an internal 
control framework. This process has 
been in place throughout 2017. More 
information on how the Group seeks  
to manage risk can be found on pages 
46 to 49.
The Board, in seeking to achieve the 
Group’s business objectives, cannot 
offer an absolute guarantee that the 
application of a risk management 
process will overcome, eliminate or 
mitigate all significant risks. However,  
by further developing and operating an 
annual and ongoing risk management 
process to identify, report and manage 
significant risks, the Board seeks to 
provide a reasonable assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee conducted a 
review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s systems of internal control  
and risk management during 2017,  
as detailed on page 89.
Functional and front line controls
This includes a wide spectrum of controls 
as seen in most organisations, including, 
for example: standard operating 
procedures and policies; a comprehensive 
financial planning and reporting system, 
including quarterly forecasting; regular 
performance appraisals and training for 
employees; restricted access to financial 
systems and data; delegated authority 
matrices for review and approval of key 
transactions; protective clothing and 
equipment to protect our people from 
harm; IT and data security controls; 
business continuity planning; and 
assessment procedures for potential 
new recruits.
Monitoring and oversight controls
There is a clearly defined organisational 
structure within which roles and 
responsibilities are articulated. There  
are monitoring controls at operating 
company, regional, divisional and  
Group level, including standard key 
performance indicators, with action  
plans to address underperforming areas.
A compliance scorecard self-assessment 
is completed and reported by all operating 
companies twice per annum. The 
scorecard assesses compliance with 
Group policies and procedures.
Financial monitoring includes comparing 
actual results with the forecast and prior 
year position on a monthly and year-to-
date basis. Significant variances are 
highlighted to Directors on a timely basis, 
allowing appropriate action to be taken.
Assurance activities
We obtain a wide range of assurance  
to provide comfort to management and 
the Board that our controls are providing 
adequate protection from risk and are 
operating as we would expect. Following 
the Board and Committee structure set 
out on page 76, various internal and 
external sources of assurance report 
to the Board and management. These 
sources of assurance were reviewed 
by the Board during the year and are 
principally external audit, internal audit, 
SHE audits, legal and intellectual property 
audits, engineering audits, Value Chain 
Excellence and procurement audits, IT 
audits and production system lean audits.
The various audit teams plan their 
activities on a risk basis, ensuring 
resources are directed at the areas 
of greatest need. Issues and 
recommendations to enhance 
controls are reported to management  
to ensure timely action can be taken,  
with oversight provided from the  
relevant governance committees, 
including the Audit Committee and  
the Excellence Committees.
Ethical and cultural environment
We are committed to doing business  
at all times in an ethical and transparent 
manner. This is supported by the Weir 
values which are the core behaviours  
we expect our people to live by in their 
working lives. The Weir Code of Conduct 
also contributes to our culture, providing  
a high benchmark by which we expect 
our business to be conducted. Any 
examples of unethical behaviour are  
dealt with robustly and promptly.
The Ethics section on page 62 within 
the Sustainability Review provides 
more details on the Group’s activities 
to promote ethical behaviour.
The Group’s internal control procedures 
described on page 89 of the Audit 
Committee Report do not cover joint 
venture interests. We have Board 
representation on each of our joint 
venture companies where separate,  
albeit similar, internal control frameworks 
have been adopted.
Our internal control framework has four key layers:
Risks
Functional and front line controls
Monitoring and oversight controls
Assurance activities
Ethical and cultural environment

Director and Remuneration Committee 
Chairman have met or had contact with 
analysts and institutional shareholders to 
keep them informed of significant

opportunity to attend meetings with 
major shareholders and would do so if 
requested by any major shareholder.
Our brokers, Goldman Sachs International 
and UBS, and public relation advisors 
undertake investor roadshow feedback 
which is shared with the Board. The 
Company Secretary is also charged with 
bringing to the attention of the Board  
any material matters of concern raised  
by the Company’s shareholders.
The primary means of communicating 
with the Company’s shareholders are the 
Company’s Annual Report and Financial 
Statements and the Interim Report. Both 
are available on the Company’s website 
and the Annual Report is sent to  
all shareholders who elect to receive it

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Board composition and skills
The Nomination Committee considers 
that the Board consists of individuals  
with the right balance of skills, diversity, 
experience and knowledge to provide 
strong and effective leadership of  
the Group. During the year the Board 
consisted of the Chairman, up to eight 
Non-Executive Directors and two 
Executive Directors, who together  
bring a diverse and complementary  
range of backgrounds, personal  
attributes and experience.
The Committee reviews the tenure of 
individual Non-Executive Directors on  
a regular basis in the context of length  
of service, experience, independence, 
contribution and skills. This is not only 
from a current strategy perspective but 
also takes into account potential future 
strategic needs.
The Board skills and experience  
matrix, based primarily on professional 
background and executive roles held, 
is detailed below. Detailed biographies 
can be found on pages 70 and 71.
Board appointments
The Committee was responsible  
for leading the process in appointing 
three new independent Non-Executive 
Directors in 2017.
The considerations to be taken into 
account in each appointment to the 
Board are stipulated in the Terms of 
Reference of the Nomination Committee. 
Specifically, the Nomination Committee 
must consider candidates on merit 
against objective criteria, and with due 
regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board, including gender, in identifying 
and recommending candidates. The 
Nomination Committee recommends 
appointments to the Board based on 
the existing balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board, on the 
merits and capabilities of the nominee 
and on the time they are able to devote 
to the role in order to promote the 
success of the Company.
The Board acknowledges the benefits 
that a diverse pool of talent can bring  
to a boardroom. Among other things, a 
diverse board encompasses diversity of 
experience, social background, education 
and training, life skills, personal attributes, 
as well as differences in age, nationality, 
race and gender.
The recent focus on Board diversity  
has centred on gender following the 
2016 report of the Hampton-Alexander 
Review on improving gender balance in 
FTSE companies. We have committed 
to ensure that a third of the Board, 
Group Executive members, and their 
direct reports are female by 2020. The 
current levels are 27%, 29% and 20% 
respectively. I continue to be a member  
of the steering group of the Hampton-
Alexander Review.
Details of the recruitment process  
are below.
Appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors Barbara Jeremiah, 
Clare Chapman and Stephen Young
External search advisers JCA Group

were engaged in the recruitment process 
and assisted the Nomination Committee 
in its search for suitable candidates.
The Committee was informed of possible 
candidates, put forward by JCA Group. 
The selected candidates met with myself, 
the Chief Executive Officer and two 
Non-Executive Directors. Feedback was 
provided to the Committee and it was 
agreed that the preferred candidates 
should proceed to the next stage. The 
preferred candidates then met with the 
remaining Directors.
Following the satisfactory conclusion of 
the process, the Committee recommended 
to the Board that Barbara Jeremiah and 
Clare Chapman be appointed to the Board 
on 1 August 2017.

and have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct on 
matters such as diversity for executive search firms. 
During 2017, JCA Group provided no other services to 
the Company.
Independence and re-election  
to the Board
The Nomination Committee reviewed  
and confirmed the independence of all 
Non-Executive Directors. The continued 
service as Directors of both Rick Menell 
and John Mogford was specifically 
reviewed in light of their respective 
lengths of service. During 2016, the 
Committee invited John Mogford to 
continue for a further year through  
2017, given the nature of his sector and 
management experience. He will step 
down after the 2018 AGM. Rick Menell’s 
experience is of particular importance  
to the Company at this time of change 
and it was therefore recommended that 
his term should be extended for a further 
year (subject to re-election by shareholders 
at the 2018 AGM). This year’s review also 
enabled the Committee to confirm its 
support for the election of Barbara 
Jeremiah, Clare Chapman and Stephen 
Young, and for the re-election of all other 
members of the Board, at the Company’s 
forthcoming 2018 AGM. The Directors 
biographies can be found on pages 70 
and 71 and in the Notice of Meeting.
Processes are in place to identify 
any business relationships held by 
Non-Executive Directors or additional 
directorships or significant links with 
other companies or bodies which may 
be of relevance in determining their 
independence. The Board still considered 
all of its Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent in character and judgement.
Committee effectiveness
The Committee’s areas of responsibility 
were reviewed during the year through 
an external Board Effectiveness Review, 
undertaken by Independent Audit 
Limited. Their report was presented in 
December 2017. I am pleased to confirm 
it concluded that the areas of responsibility 
of the Nomination Committee continued 
to be performed well.
You will find more information on the 
Board Effectiveness Review cycle and 
process on page 78. 
Diversity and Inclusion
We recognise that Diversity and  
Inclusion is a key element of our  
strategic framework. To remain 
competitive we need to further  
develop a diverse and inclusive  
workplace including the development  
of our approach to increasing ethnic 
minority representation at leadership  
level in line with recommendations  
of the Parker Review. 
Our objective is to diversify thought  
in The Weir Group and provide an 
environment where values-based 
inclusion prevails. You can read more 
about Diversity and Inclusion and the 
details of the initiatives that the Company 
has been involved in on pages 58 to 61.

Membership
After six years this will be my final report 
as the Chairman of the Committee. 
The members of the Committee,  
other than myself, are Sir Jim McDonald,  
John Mogford and Barbara Jeremiah, all 
of whom are independent Non-Executive 
Directors. With the exception of Barbara 
Jeremiah, all have been members of the 
Committee for the full year and to the 
date of this report. Melanie Gee served 
during the year prior to standing down 
from the Board in September. Stephen 
Young, who will take over as Chair when 
I step down, joined the Committee in 
January 2018.
The Committee members have,  
through their other business activities, 
significant experience in financial 
matters. They have been selected with 
the aim of providing the wide range  
of financial and commercial expertise 
necessary to fulfil our responsibilities. 
Summary biographies have been 
presented on pages 70 and 71.
Introduction 
As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I am pleased to present our report to 
shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2017. This report will outline  
how the Committee has fulfilled its key objective of providing effective  
governance over the appropriateness of the Group’s financial reporting.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Meetings
We met four times during the year  
and have met twice since the year end.  
Each Committee meeting normally takes  
place prior to a Board meeting, during 
which I provide a report on our activities. 
There is at least one meeting each  
year when we meet with each of  
the Head of Internal Audit and the 
external auditors separately, without  
any executive management present.  
This provides us with the opportunity  
for any issues of concern to be raised  
by, or with, the auditors. 
We have the ability to call on Group 
employees to assist in our work and  
to obtain any information required from 
Executive Directors in order to carry out 
our roles and duties. We are also able  
to obtain outside legal or independent 
professional advice if required. 
The table above details the Board 
members and members of senior 
management who were invited  
to attend meetings as appropriate  
during the calendar year. In addition, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) 
attended the meetings by invitation 
as auditors to the Group.
Main activities 
Over the course of the year since  
the last Annual Report, our work was 
focused in the following areas:
(i) financial reporting; 
(ii) internal control and risk management;  
(iii) internal audit; and 
(iv) external audit.
The following sections provide more 
detail on our specific items of focus  
under each of these headings, explaining 
the work we, as a Committee, have 
undertaken and the results of that work.
(i) Financial reporting
Our principal responsibility in this area is 
the review and challenge of the actions 
and judgements of management in 
relation to the interim and annual financial 
statements before submission to the 
Board, paying particular attention to:
• critical accounting policies and 
practices, and any changes therein;
• decisions requiring significant 
judgements, areas of significant 
estimate, or where there has been 
discussion with the external auditor;
• the existence of any errors, adjusted  
or unadjusted, resulting from the audit;
• the clarity of the disclosures and 
compliance with accounting standards 
and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements, including an 
assessment of adoption of the going 
concern basis of accounting and a 
review of the process and financial 
modelling underpinning the Group’s 
Viability Statement; and
• the processes surrounding the 
compilation of the Annual Report  
and Financial Statements with regard 
to presenting a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the 
Group’s position and prospects.
We received formal reports from  
the Chief Financial Officer and the 
external auditor, summarising the main 
discussion points for both the Interim 
Report in our July 2017 meeting and 
Annual Report during our January  
and February 2018 meetings. 
The financial reporting matters discussed 
in the current year and recurring agenda 
items are summarised in the table on 
pages 90 to 92. 
(ii) Internal control and  
risk management
Overall responsibility for the Group’s  
risk management and internal control 
frameworks rests with the Board.  
Further details on accountability  
for Risk Management are provided 
in the Corporate Governance Report 
on page 82.
Our role with regard to risk management 
has been delegated by the Board and is  
to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
risk and internal control frameworks. 
Our work in this area was supported  
by reporting from the Head of Internal 
Audit on the results of the programme  
of internal audits completed; the overall 
assessment of the internal control 
environment; and in addition, reporting, 
either verbal or written, from senior 
management covering any investigations 
into known or suspected fraudulent 
activities. We also noted the additional 
work undertaken for the Board on a 
review of the sources of assurance which 
were mapped against the principal risks 
(see (iii) Internal audit below).
The Committee also receives regular 
reporting on the Group’s compliance-
related activities from the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and 
Head of Internal Audit. This includes 
reviewing compliance with the Group’s 
Ethics Helpline programme which 
provides a mechanism for employees 
with serious concerns about the conduct 
of the Group or its employees to report 
their concerns. The Committee ensures 
that appropriate arrangements are in  
place to receive and act proportionately 
upon a complaint about malpractice.  
The Committee takes a particular interest 
in any reports of possible improprieties  
in financial reporting. 
Since the last Annual Report and  
Financial Statements, there have been 
presentations from the three Divisional 
Finance Directors (DFDs) which included 
a review of the divisional risk dashboards, 
the significant findings from the internal 
audit visits and the Compliance Scorecard 
process over the last 12 months, as well 
as an overview of their divisional finance 
teams. Focus is given to:
1.  the strength and depth of the finance 
team’s capability;
2.  the quality and efficiency of responses 
to findings of internal audit visits, 
including whether learning has been 
shared more widely across the Group 
to mitigate the risk of recurrence and 
share good practice to; and 
3.  the quality of the discussion around 
divisional risk dashboards. 
In addition, we received a presentation on 
the progress of the Minerals SAP rollout 
and related controls.
The Compliance Scorecard is a control 
mechanism whereby each operating 
company undertakes self-assessments, 
every six months, of their compliance  
with Group policies and procedures, 
including key internal controls across a 
range of categories including finance, 
anti-bribery and corruption, tax, treasury, 
trade and customs, HR, IT and legal. As  
far as the elements relating to finance  
are concerned, these cover (but are not 
limited to) management accounts and 
financial reporting, balance sheet controls, 
employee costs and other financial policies. 
Each operating company is expected  
to prepare and execute action plans to 
address any weaknesses identified as  
part of the self-assessment process.

Exceptional items – 
restructuring costs 
and related provisions
(see notes 5 and 22 of 
the financial statements)
Management 
exercises judgement 
on the classification 
of certain items as 
exceptional.
We have received detailed reporting from the Chief 
Financial Officer covering the following aspects of  
the exceptional charges: 
(i)  charge/credit by Division, including the nature  
of the items;
(ii)  accounting treatment adopted in relation to 
recognition of provisions and impairments; and
(iii)  disclosure of the amounts and related  
narrative reporting.
Our work has focused on ensuring that these items were 
exceptional due to their size, nature and/or frequency, 
taking cognisance where appropriate of multi-year 
restructuring programmes. We also received confirmation 
from PwC that management’s treatment was acceptable.
Consideration was also given to the classification of  
the one-off charges incurred within the Flow Control 
Division during the year as trading items rather than 
exceptional.
Finally, consideration was given to the current  
balance sheet position of the remaining restructuring 
provisions, with a specific focus on the China provision 
(created in 2016), with management providing details of 
the remaining liabilities.
The Committee agrees 
with the accounting 
treatment and disclosure  
of these items in the 
Annual Report.
Acquisition  
accounting for KOP
(see note 13 of the 
financial statements)
Management 
exercises judgement 
on the type of 
intangible assets 
acquired and 
estimates are made 
of the fair value of all 
assets and liabilities.
We received a summary report from management  
which outlined: 
(i)  the purchase price allocation exercise which identified 
and valued separately identifiable intangible assets;
(ii)  the assessment of acquisition fair values, with a 
particular focus on inventory carrying values; and
(iii)  the related disclosures in the financial statements 
displayed in note 13
We reviewed the resulting valuations, understood 
the reasons behind the changes made and looked 
at a comparison to other recent acquisitions where 
appropriate. We also received confirmation from 
PwC that management’s assumptions and calculation 
methodology were acceptable.
The Committee agrees 
with the acquisition 
accounting treatment  
and disclosure of the  
KOP acquisition in the 
Annual Report.
US Tax Reform
(see notes 7 and 23 of 
the financial statements) 
Management 
exercises judgement 
on the potential 
impact on the  
Group tax assets, 
liabilities and 
corporate tax rate.
An assessment of the transitional impact of the recently 
enacted US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was presented by  
the Group Head of Tax to the Committee, summarising 
the key judgements underpinning the estimated financial 
impact on the Group tax assets, liabilities and corporate 
tax rate for the current year and potential tax implications 
on future years, recognising that the practical application 
and impact of parts of the Act remain unclear. 
We reviewed this in light of input from both Deloitte and 
EY. PwC also provided confirmation that management’s 
assumptions, calculation methodology and treatment of 
transitional credits as exceptional items were acceptable.
The Committee  
agrees with  
Managements’ 
judgements and  
related disclosures.

and macroeconomic assumptions underlying the valuation 
process;
(ii)  long-term growth rates and discount rates used in the  
cash flow models for all of the CGUs; and
(iii)  the rationale for the allocation of KOP to the Oil and Gas 
EMEA Cash Generating Unit.
Business plans and budgets were Board-approved and  
underpin the cash flow forecasts.
We have considered the sensitivity analysis supplied  
by management.
We have reviewed the relevant disclosures in the financial 
statements and the related narrative.
We are satisfied that  
the impairment analysis 
supports the carrying  
value of the underlying 
assets in each CGU.
Provisions
(see note 22 
of the financial 
statements)
Significant balance 
sheet provisions  
are underpinned  
by management’s 
key judgements  
on obligating events 
and timeframes  
over which a  
reliable estimate  
for provision values 
can be made.
The focus of the Audit Committee was on the restructuring 
provisions including the linkage to the exceptional charges 
recorded in the Income Statement, and the employee-related 
provisions, specifically the element in respect of US asbestos-
related claims.
The Committee’s work in relation to exceptional items is 
discussed in the previous section. 
With regard to the US asbestos-related provision, the 
Committee noted the updated external advice in respect  
of the actuarial assumptions underpinning the provision  
and related insurance asset.
Our review and challenge was centred on gaining an 
understanding of:
(i)  the claims and settlement assumptions that underpin  
the discounted cash flow model and their relation to  
recent historic experience;
(ii)  the period over which the liability can be reasonably 
estimated,
(iii)  the position with regard to availability of insurance cover; and
(iv)  the adequacy and transparency of the disclosures in note 22.
We challenged management on the assumptions underpinning 
the liability assessment and the recording of a matching 
receivable on the basis of the insurance asset. PwC also 
provided confirmation that management’s assumptions 
were reasonable.
With regard to other provisions (other than inventory – see 
below), we examined the key movements between the  
opening and closing provision balances and challenged 
management on the commercial drivers which caused them. 
We are satisfied that  
the current provisioning 
levels and approach  
are appropriate, as is  
the recognition of a 
matching insurance  
asset in relation to the  
US asbestos provision.
Pensions
(see note 24 
of the financial 
statements)
The valuation of 
pension liabilities  
can be materially 
affected by the 
assumptions utilised 
by management  
on areas such  
as discount and 
inflation rates. 
We challenged management on the key assumptions 
underpinning the valuation, taking assurance from the  
fact that external advice had been taken by the Company  
and that PwC had benchmarked these assumptions to their  
own internal ranges.
The Committee was 
satisfied with the 
assumptions and related 
pension disclosures.

Tax charge and 
provisioning
(see notes 7  
and 23 of  
the financial 
statements)
The tax position  
is complex, with  
a number of 
international 
jurisdictions 
requiring 
management’s 
judgement with 
regards to effective 
tax rates, tax 
compliance and  
tax provisioning.
The Audit Committee receives a detailed report from the  
Chief Financial Officer every six months, which covers the 
following key areas: 
(i)  status of ongoing enquiries and tax audits with local  
tax authorities;
(ii)  the Group’s effective tax rate for the current year; and
(iii)  the level of provisioning for known and potential liabilities, 
including significant movements on the prior period. 
In addition, the Committee takes comfort from the annual 
presentation to the main Board on tax strategy and risk, 
given by the Group Head of Tax, and the work done by, 
and conclusions of, PwC in this area.
Based on the work we 
have undertaken, we are 
satisfied that the position 
presented in these financial 
statements, including the 
disclosures, is appropriate. 
Inventory 
valuation
(see note 16 
of the financial 
statements)
Management applies 
estimates on 
inventory valuation 
and provisioning.
Given the significant investment in inventory within both the 
Minerals and Oil & Gas Divisions, both of which are impacted  
by commodity cycles, this remains a judgement for specific 
consideration. Reporting has been received from management 
on the business drivers behind movements in both gross 
inventory and the related slow-moving and obsolete provision. 
Specific consideration was given to a review of the accuracy  
of inventory provisioning. 
Based on the information 
provided, the Committee 
concluded that 
management action had 
been effective and that  
the level of provisioning 
appeared adequate.
Fair, balanced and 
understandable
The Board is 
required to state  
that the Group’s 
external reporting  
is fair, balanced and 
understandable.
The Audit 
Committee is 
requested by the 
Board to provide 
advice to support 
the assertion.
The Committee received a report from management 
summarising the detailed approach that had been taken to 
ensure that the Group’s external reporting is fair, balanced  
and understandable. This covered, but was not limited to,  
the following:
(i)  involvement of a cross section of management across  
the organisation during the preparation of the external 
reporting, including the Group Executive, Divisional Finance 
Directors, Group Communications, Group Finance (including 
Group Tax and Group Treasury) and Company Secretariat;
(ii)  input and advice from appropriate external advisers, including 
the Company’s brokers and public relations agency;
(iii)  use of available disclosure checklists for both corporate 
governance and financial statement reporting;
(iv)  regular research to identify emerging practice and guidance 
from relevant regulatory bodies;
(v)  regular weekly meetings (from December to February 
inclusive) involving the key contributors to the document, 
during which specific consideration was given to the fair, 
balanced and understandable assertion; and
(vi)  use of three ‘cold’ readers; two employees independent of the 
preparation process (one a member of the senior management 
group) and an external, independent proofreader.
The successful completion 
of this work has been 
reported to the Board.
Viability 
Statement
The Committee’s 
role, as delegated  
by the Board,  
is to review  
the underlying 
processes and  
key assumptions 
underpinning the 
Viability Statement 
and report to the 
Board accordingly. 
We fulfilled our responsibilities in this area through the review 
and discussion of reporting received from management, which 
covered the following areas:
(i)  overview of the construct of the financial model and base 
case data underpinning the sensitivity and stress-test 
scenarios;
(ii)  results of financial modelling which reflected the 
crystallisation of those principal risks identified by the  
Board as having the greatest potential impact on the  
Group’s viability, both individually and when taken  
together in a severe but plausible stress-test scenario;
(iii)  extent of mitigating actions included in the financial 
modelling, relative to the population of such actions that  
had been identified as within the control of management  
and the Board; and
 (iv)  banking covenant calculations and assessment of facility 
headroom in each of the downside and stress-test scenarios.
The successful completion 
of this work has been 
reported to the Board.  
The Group’s viability 
statement is reported

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Operating companies are required to 
retain evidence of their testing in support 
of their self-assessment responses. 
Internal audit has responsibility for 
confirming the self-assessment during 
planned visits. Any significant variances 
are reported to local, divisional and  
Group management. Any companies 
reporting low levels of compliance are 
required to prepare improvement plans to 
demonstrate how they will improve over  
a reasonable period of time. The overall 
compliance scores (as a percentage) are 
tracked over time and reported to the 
Audit Committee twice a year, with the 
Committee paying particular attention  
to the variances between self-assessed 
and internal audit assessed scores as  
well as trends and the performance of 
newly acquired companies. 
(iii) Internal audit
Twice annually, the Head of Internal  
Audit reports to the Committee on audit 
activities, progress against the internal 
audit plan and the results of audit visits, 
with particular focus on high priority 
findings and the action plans, including 
management responses, to address 
these areas.
Private discussions between myself  
and the Head of Internal Audit are held 
during the year and once a year with  
the full Committee. I also receive  
copies of all internal audit reports  
issued during the year. 
This gives us broad coverage of the 
activities of the function and a good  
sense of the control environment.  
This also allows us to ensure the  
function is effective (which includes 
assessing the independence of the 
function), adequately resourced and has 
appropriate standing within the Company. 
One of the main duties of the Committee 
is to review the annual internal audit plan 
and to ensure that internal audit remains 
focused on providing effective assurance. 
We undertook a deeper review of the 
proposed scope and approach for the 
2018 Annual Plan. This was helped by  
an exercise which was conducted during 
the year to map the key sources of 
assurance against the Group’s core 
processes. Whilst this demonstrated 
good coverage, it was concluded that 
there could be stronger linkage between 
the conclusions from these assurance 
outputs and the scope of work for internal 
audit. The 2018 Internal Audit Annual Plan 
has been developed considering these 
wider internal assurance risk indicators 
and in addition internal audit’s scope  
and remit has been increased to allow  
for the provision of additional assurance 
over some non-financial areas.
The factors considered when deciding 
which businesses to audit and the scope 
of each audit, including consideration of 
the number of visits to each operating 
company in the Group on a cyclical basis 
are, amongst other things, the volatility  
of end markets, critical system or senior 
management changes in the year, financial 
results, the timing of the most recent 
internal audit visit, assessments from 
other assurance reviews undertaken and 
whether the business is a recent acquisition. 
In addition, the emergence of any 
common themes or trends in the findings 
of recent internal audits or compliance 
scorecard submissions (see previous 
section) is taken into consideration. 
An information technology risk profiling 
exercise was also undertaking during  
the year and forms the basis of the  
IT risk assurance programme for the  
2018 Annual Plan. This includes the 
further development and utilisation  
of data analytics techniques. 
Also as part of the Annual Plan,  
reviews are to be undertaken to assess 
compliance with Weir’s Code of Conduct 
procedures, including anti-bribery and 
corruption. This includes areas such as 
policy and procedures, employee training, 
relationships with agents, accounting  
for employee expenses and corporate 
hospitality and gifts. Finally, an element of 
the Annual Plan is reserved for assurance 
coverage of any emerging risk areas.
The Committee considered and approved 
the 2018 Internal Audit Annual Plan 
including the resource model, which 
shows a significant increase over that 
for 2017, in line with the broader 
scope agreed. 
(iv) External audit
Auditor effectiveness
The effectiveness of the external  
audit process is highly dependent on 
appropriate audit risk identification at  
the start of the audit cycle and the quality 
of planning. PwC present their detailed 
audit plan to the Committee each years 
identifying their assessment of the key 
risks, amongst other matters, and this 
gets the appropriate degree of attention.
Our assessment of the effectiveness  
and quality of the audit process covers  
a number of other matters, including a 
review of the reporting from the auditors 
to the Committee, a review of the latest 
FRC Audit Quality Inspection report on 
PwC and also by seeking feedback from 
management on the effectiveness of the 
audit process. Overall, management were 
satisfied that there had been appropriate 
focus and challenge on the primary areas 
of audit risk and assessed the quality of 
the audit process to be satisfactory. 
The Committee holds private  
meetings with the external auditor  
each year to provide additional 
opportunity for open dialogue and 
feedback from the Committee and  
the auditor without management being 
present. Matters typically discussed 
include the auditor’s assessment of 
business risks and management activity 
thereon, the transparency and openness  
of interactions with management, 
confirmation that there has been no 
restriction in scope placed on them  
by management and how they have 
exercised professional scepticism.  
I also meet with the lead audit partner 
outside the formal committee process  
as necessary throughout the year.  
These interactions are also important  
in our assessment of audit quality.
Based on the work carried out, we  
are of the view that the quality of the 
audit process is satisfactory and that  
our expectations set, when awarding  
the audit to PwC in 2016, have been 
largely met.

Audit Committee Report continued
Independence policy and  
non-audit services
The Audit Committee is responsible  
for the appointment and role of the 
auditor. This includes keeping under 
review the auditor’s independence  
by issuing guidelines on any non-audit 
services that are to be provided by 
them. A formal policy exists (see  
www.global.weir) which ensures  
that the nature of the advice to be 
provided cannot impair the objectivity  
of the auditor’s opinion on the Group’s 
Financial Statements. The policy makes 
it clear that only certain types of service 
are permitted to be carried out by  
the auditors. All permitted non-audit 
services require the approval of the  
Chief Financial Officer and, where the 
expected cost of the service is in excess 
of £75,000, the approval of myself, the 
Audit Committee Chairman. If non-audit 
fees approach £0.5m during a calendar 
year, the Committee will consider 
imposing additional restrictions on 
non-audit services. The auditor confirms 
their independence at least annually.
Fees payable to PwC in respect of  
audit and assurance services for 2017  
of £2.6m (2016: £2.2m) were approved 
by the Committee after a review of  
the level and nature of work to be 
performed and after being satisfied  
by PwC that the fees were appropriate 
for the scope of the work required.
Non-audit fee work conducted by PwC  
in the year of £0.3m represented 10%  
of the audit fee. We are of the view that 
the level and nature of non-audit work 
does not compromise the independence 
of the external auditor.
Having considered the relationship  
with PwC, their qualifications,  
expertise, resources and effectiveness, 
the Committee concluded that they 
remained independent and effective 
for the purposes of the 2017 year  
end. As a result, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that PwC 
should be reappointed as auditor at 
the next AGM.
Committee evaluation
The Committee was subject to an 
evaluation process in 2017, as part  
of the Board’s triennial review process 
conducted externally by Independent 
Audit Board Review.
The evaluation concluded that the 
Committee was performing well, with  
a particular strength being the quality  
and frequency of the Committee’s 
interaction with the DFDs. No significant 
areas of concern were noted. However, 
with the impending change in the 
Committee’s chair and other Board 
changes, managing change should 
be a focus for the Committee.
Our focus for 2017
In last year’s report we said that, in 
addition to our routine business, we 
would increase our focus on three areas: 
1.  Following the exceptional item arising 
from issues in China, we will review 
with management what we can do  
to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence 
of such exposures in the future; 
2.  We will increase our focus on the  
IT control environment given that  
the rollout of SAP in Minerals is 
underway; and
3.  In conjunction with the Board, we will 
increase our focus on the matching of 
our overall assurance structure against 
our principal risks. 
We have made good progress. With 
regard to China, for example, we ensured 
that internal audit will be involved with the 
KOP acquisition at a much earlier stage 
and we focused on management actions 
to assess the control environment straight 
after completion. The other two points 
were covered by our work with internal 
audit in the year (and are discussed above 
in sections (ii) and (iii)).
Our focus for 2018
In addition to our routine business in 
2018, we will focus on two main areas. 
The first will be to manage the significant 
change in the members of the Committee 
since September, including John Mogford 
and my impending departures. I will hand  
over the Chair to Stephen Young at the 
conclusion of the AGM. The second will 
be to review how the broadened internal 
audit approach has bedded down within 
the business.

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce our  
Directors’ Remuneration Report for  
the year ended 31 December 2017.  
This is my first report as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee having 
succeeded Melanie Gee in August 2017. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to thank Melanie for her significant 
contribution whilst in the role. 
As committed to in our Report last  
year, we have invested time during  
this past year looking at how to align  
our remuneration arrangements to  
the Weir strategy so their design best 
recognises the cyclical and volatile  
nature of the sectors in which we 
operate. The management team 
emphasises creating long-term value  
for customers in our end markets and  
for shareholders: behaviours and a  
culture which we also seek to reward. 
The current LTIP suffers from ‘all or 
nothing’ characteristics, so to move  
from this, we have considered the best 
evidence to help us evaluate alternative 
reward constructs. This included 
considering the recommendations from 
the Investment Association Working 
Group which called for Boards to explore 
alternative solutions in markets where 
traditional LTIPs do not work. Academic 
evidence has also indicated that simpler 
pay packages, with less reliance on 
short-term performance conditions  
and requiring large shareholdings,  
have a positive impact on investment, 
innovation, long-term decision making 
and long-term value creation. 
Based on the outcome of this review,  
we are proposing changes to our 
remuneration framework, notably the 
replacement of our current LTIP with 
Restricted Share awards under our  
Share Reward Plan. We are unanimous  
as a Board that this is the right thing  
to do for the long-term interest of  
the business and we lay out below  
our rationale and how the parameters  
of the award have been calibrated.
Rewarding performance in cyclical 
and volatile markets 
Given the exposure of our sectors to the 
commodity markets, it makes it extremely 
challenging to set robust and stretching 
financial targets. As a result, we have 
seen ‘all or nothing’ vesting outcomes 
from our LTIP over the past ten years. 
These outcomes are more reflective of 
where the business is in the cycle than of 
the underlying performance. The up-cycle 
leads to vesting ‘windfalls’ and the 
down-cycle penalises LTIP participants. 
The potential for a negative impact on 
executive pay is clear. Incentives are 
unlikely to engage executives or motivate 
the right behaviours if outcomes are 
considered arbitrary. Windfall outcomes 
will rightly appear unreasonable to 
investors and unfair to employees and 
other stakeholders. Penal outcomes  
can disengage executives and, when 
applicable over a number of cycles, 
prevent the build-up of meaningful 
shareholdings, which is one of the primary 
objectives of share-based reward plans. 
The Committee’s view is that this makes  
a conventional LTIP inappropriate as a 
mechanism for incentivising, retaining and 
engaging the executives in the long-term 
stewardship of the business. After testing 
various alternatives, we concluded that 
the best fit for the business was a 
redesigned annual bonus and the 
implementation of a Restricted 
Shares Plan. 
“We are refocusing remuneration  
on long-term value creation by  
using substantive equity holdings  
to expose executives to both upside 
and downside risk. Over the cycle,  
this will best promote the value of  
our company for shareholders and  
the society in which we operate.”
Rewarding long-term  
value creation
One of the strengths of ‘We are Weir’  
is that it takes our strategic framework 
and identifies how we will create value 
from it for all our stakeholders.
People Caring for our 
colleagues, our 
neighbours and  
the environment  
and inspiring  
them to flourish.
Customers Working in 
partnership to 
provide distinctive 
solutions that  
deliver compelling 
value for money.
Technology Driving the 
development of  
new technologies  
and capabilities 
that lead the 
market.
Performance Delivering  
excellence for all 
our stakeholders 
through strong 
leadership, 
accountability and  
a lean mindset.
The Committee realised that to reinforce  
the delivery of ‘We are Weir’, we needed  
to be clear with our reward principles and 
ensure these informed the design of the 
new executive reward arrangements. These 
principles have been refreshed and are 
shown in the ‘Reward principles’ table.

The Committee concluded that 2018  
is the right time to be making the move 
to Restricted Shares. The expected 
vesting for ‘in-flight’ awards (using 
publicly available market expectations) 
as we head into the up-cycle is over 
80% this year and over 60% next year. 
Switching to Restricted Shares at this 
point in the cycle is likely to be less 
beneficial to management, but is 
recognised as the right thing to do to 
incent the delivery of long-term value.
Under the Restricted Shares proposal, 
executives will receive a significantly 
smaller award each year than under  
the current LTIP , and these awards will 
vest subject to an ‘Underpin’ as outlined 
in the table below. Further details on  
the underpin are set out on page 99.
The key parameters of the Restricted 
Share awards are in line with best  
practice guidance: 
• Significant reduction in award 
size. Annual Restricted Share awards 
will be 125% (CEO) and 100% (CFO), 
half the current LTIP awards (250% 
and 200% respectively). The 
Committee carefully considered what 
this ‘discount’ should be. Our starting 
point for the conversion was to confirm 
that the total compensation is positioned 
around median against similarly sized 
companies so it was clear we were not 
embedding any excessive quantum. 
To understand what a fair expectation  
for LTIP pay-outs would be, we analysed 
vesting outcomes over a long-term period 
(ten years, being more representative 
than just two or three recent years).  
The average outcome has been 61%  
of maximum and therefore a reasonable 
expected value of the current LTIP  
would have been 153% of salary  
(CEO) and 122% (CFO) – current award 
size multiplied by 61%. Therefore the 
Committee concluded that setting  
the discount at 50% is more than 
sufficient. This is also consistent  
with investor guidance.
• Extended time horizons – shares 
released between five and seven 
years from grant. For each award, 
50% will be released to participants 
after five years, 25% after six years 
and the final 25% after seven years 
from grant. This represents one of the 
longest holding periods for Restricted 
Share plans in the UK and is in excess 
of the five years recommended in 
investor guidance. Awards will vest as 
follows – 50% after three years, 25% 
after four years and 25% after five 
years. In order to address a one-off 
transitional risk of moving from an LTIP 
to Restricted Shares, the first tranche  
of awards made under the 2018  
Policy will vest 25% after two years 
(rather than three). These transition 
arrangements will not apply to new 
hires. We will also confirm in our Policy 
statement in 2021 that we will revert 
to a three-year vest for tranche one 
since, by then, the transition issues  
will largely be managed. 
• Underpin – safeguarding against 
payment for failure. Restricted  
Share awards do not have conventional 
performance conditions which might 
apply to an LTIP, reflecting their 
different purpose and design. 
However, the framework includes 
safeguards which can adjust vesting  
in circumstances of significant 
under-performance, in line with 
investor best practice. The underpin 
includes a set of key metrics with 
pre-disclosed performance thresholds. 
If any of these thresholds are not met, 
or if an adjustment is required to better 
reflect underlying performance, the 
Committee retains discretion to reduce 
the vesting outcome. The key metrics 
for the underpin for 2018 awards are  
as laid out in the ‘Underpin metrics’ 
table (with the detailed underlying 
thresholds disclosed on page 99)  
and it is our current intention that  
this framework remains unchanged  
for the forthcoming policy period.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 • Enhanced shareholding guidelines, 
including extending into post-
employment. The shareholding 
guidelines for the CEO and CFO  
will be doubled to 400% and  
300% of salary, respectively. The 
shareholding guidelines will also be 
extended into a post-employment 
period (at 50% of the normal level, 
tapering to 0% after two years).
In developing these proposals, we have 
engaged extensively with our major 
shareholders, many of whom invest  
in our business over the long term. We 
have valued the consultation and the 
Committee’s proposals on the elements 
such as the discount, underpin, time 
horizons and shareholding requirements 
have been proposed to reflect the 
messages we heard. I am conscious, 
however, that programmes based on 
Restricted Shares are not commonplace  
in the UK market. I hope that I have 
demonstrated in this letter why this 
programme is appropriate for the 
business and how the design of the 
awards have been calibrated to address  
the concerns of some shareholders  
who are yet to build confidence in 
Restricted Share programmes. 
Going forward the Committee commit  
to evolving these plans over time so  
they stay aligned to business strategy. 
When the Committee next reviews the 
incentive framework ahead of our next 
Policy approval in 2021, we will undertake 
a similarly thoughtful and collaborative 
review process as described in this letter 
which would involve engaging early with 
our major investors.
Changes to bonus framework
We are also proposing changes to  
our annual bonus framework for 2018,  
to better align with the reward principles  
and delivery of our strategy. 
The key change is the introduction of 
strategic measures to represent 30%  
of the bonus. This replaces the 40% of 
the bonus that was driven by order input 
and personal objectives, so we are also 
simplifying the framework from four to 
three measures. The strategic measures 
will align to the strategic framework 
(People, Customers, Technology, and 
Performance). We will set stretching 
targets aligned to a balanced scorecard 
and use externally verified industry 
standard measures wherever possible, 
in particular around core operational 
metrics and the Voice of the Customer 
(VoC) and Employees. This will enable 
benchmarking and facilitate learning. The 
key measures for 2018 are disclosed on 
page 98 and we will continue to provide 
full retrospective disclosure of the 
underlying targets in next year’s report. 
Payment of any strategic component will 
be subject to a discretionary underpin 
(including individual performance). 
Having listened to shareholders, the 
remainder of the bonus will continue  
to be assessed against key financial 
measures for the year. PBTA
1
 will remain 
the primary metric (with the weighting 
increased from 40% to 50% for 2018). 
Our cash-based measure will change  
for 2018 from operating cash flow to 
working capital as a percentage of sales, 
better reflecting our growth agenda.  
The weighting will remain at 20%.

There are no changes to bonus

do not represent a policy change but 
since they are important to how the 
whole reward package works, I wanted  
to give investors full sight of them. 
2017 bonus and LTIP outcomes
When determining the bonus pay-outs  
in respect of 2017, the Committee took 
into account the overall performance of 
the business as well as the Executive 
Directors’ performance.
80% of the bonus was based on 
performance against three financial 
measures: profit, order input and cash 
flow. Profit increased significantly 
reflecting a return to growth by our Oil  
& Gas Division. We also delivered strong 
order growth in both our Oil & Gas and 
Minerals divisions as demand for their 
solutions increased. Flow Control was 
impacted by tough market conditions.  
We had a disappointing performance 
against the cash flow measure, with  
cash flow from operations reducing as  
a result of increased investment in 
working capital to support strong growth, 
and reduced profitability in Flow Control.
Although we failed to achieve the  
cash flow measure, the performance 
achieved against the profit and order  
input measures was 98% and 76% of 
maximum respectively. This resulted  
in a total contribution to payout of 54%  
of maximum for the financial measures. 
Full details of achievement as well as 
details of the performance of each 
Executive Director are provided on  
pages 111 and 112.
The 2015 LTIP awards lapsed as the 
performance targets measured over the 
three-year period to 31 December 2017 
were not met.
2018 decisions
In addition to the key policy changes 
outlined above, I can confirm the 
following for 2018: 
• With effect from April 2018, the 
salaries for the Executive Directors  
will increase by 2.8% in line with the 
average increase for UK employees.
• Pension contributions will remain  
at 12% of salary, in line with our  
Policy. The Committee is aware  
that a number of UK investors remain 
concerned about executive pensions 
which are significantly higher than 
those in the wider workforce. At  
Weir, the pension contribution of  
12% is very much at the lower end  
of market practice and aligns with 
senior roles within the UK. I therefore 
believe strongly that our pension 
practice is in line with good practice. 
2018 AGM
To implement the proposed changes we 
will be seeking shareholder approval for a 
new Remuneration Policy and this is set 
out in pages 102 to 107 of this report. We 
will also be seeking approval for the new 
Share Reward Plan and new All-Employee 
Share Ownership Plan, the full details of 
which are included in the Notice of 
Meeting. This is an important step 
forward. One of the principles which has 
guided our thinking as a Committee is a 
commitment to a principle of ‘employees 
as shareholders’ so we are keen to make 
it possible for all colleagues to build up 
long-term share ownership. 
I would like to thank those who engaged 
extensively on the proposals over recent 
months and I look forward to receiving 
your support at the AGM. As ever,  
we remain committed to an open and 
ongoing dialogue and I would be very 
happy to hear the views of investors  
on our proposals.

Long-term 
share awards
Replacement 
of LTIP with 
Restricted 
Shares
Long Term Incentive Plan  
(LTIP) awards: 
• CEO 250% of base salary
• CFO 200% of base salary
Vesting based on performance 
over three years: 
– One third EPS 
– One third ROCE 
– One third TSR
Two-year holding period.
Replacement of LTIP with Restricted Share awards, with the first awards 
to be made following the approval of the Share Reward Plan at the 2018 
AGM. Award parameters in line with best practice and investor guidance.
Maximum award size significantly reduced by 50% from previous LTIP 
award levels (the rationale for this discount is discussed in more detail  
in the next section): 
• CEO 125% of base salary
• CFO 100% of base salary
Vesting phased over a five-year period, with vested shares released 
between five and seven years from grant. 
Vesting subject to the underpin. Prior to vesting, if any of the thresholds 
set out below have not been met, it would trigger the Committee to 
consider whether a discretionary adjustment was required.
Balance sheet health
• Dividend
 – Maintain average absolute dividend per share over the vesting  
period at least in line with the 2017 declared dividend per share.
• Breaching covenants
 – No breach of debt covenant or renegotiation of covenant terms 
outside of a normal refinancing cycle.
Investor returns
• Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
 – Maintain average ROCE over the vesting period above the average 
Weighted Average Cost of Capital for that period.
Corporate governance
• Major governance failure
 – No material failure in governance or an illegal act resulting in 
significant reputational damage and/or material financial loss  
to the Group.
Restricted Share awards will also be subject to malus and  
clawback provisions.
The Committee will also retain discretion to determine the grant level 
each year.
Other Shareholding 
guidelines
Significant 
enhancement
• CEO – 200% of base salary
• CFO – 150% of base salary 
Shareholding guidelines will be doubled from current levels: 
• CEO – 400% of base salary
• CFO – 300% of base salary
In addition, shareholding requirements will continue post-employment. 
NED fees Fees reflect responsibilities and 
time commitments for the role.
Fees will increase broadly in line with the wider employee average as 
follows, effective 1 April 2018:
• Chairman’s fee by 2.8% to £306,500
• Non-Executive Director base fee by 2.9% to £61,200 
• Chairman of Committee fee by 2.6% to £15,900
• Senior Independent Director fee by 2.4% to £12,800

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
In developing the proposals set out in 
this report, we engaged extensively 
with major investors and shareholder 
bodies. A number of common themes 
which emerged in discussion are set  
out below. 
Q 
Why are changes being  
made at this time? 
As flagged in last year’s report, during  
the course of 2017, a comprehensive 
review of our remuneration philosophy 
and framework was undertaken to ensure 
it continued to best support the delivery 
of our strategy. 
Q 
In the context of the difficulty  
of setting robust long-term 
targets, could other solutions have 
been considered (e.g. relative TSR  
or a ‘hybrid’ with the existing LTIP)? 
It is correct that relative targets can  
be a solution to the challenge of setting 
absolute targets. Most commonly, this 
would be done via relative TSR. This relies 
on the ability to construct a robust and 
relevant peer group, which for a number 
of reasons, the Committee considers is 
not possible for Weir (given our exposure 
to a range of different commodity end 
markets and an insufficient number of 
direct UK peer companies). Relative TSR 
could also incentivise higher leverage as  
a means of generating differential equity 
performance against peers, which could 
penalise companies looking to safeguard 
a strong balance sheet through the cycle. 
The Committee believes that a  
‘hybrid’ approach (i.e. introducing 
restricted shares whilst also maintaining 
a performance-based LTIP) lacks a 
coherent rationale and was the approach 
which our investors strongly rejected  
at our 2016 AGM. 
Q 
How else does this proposal 
differ from 2016? 
Other key differences from 2016 are:
• Significantly enhanced shareholding 
guidelines (including extending the 
guideline into post-employment).
• This proposal has a much more 
substantial underpin.
• Extended time horizons.
Q 
What is the change to  
maximum total compensation? 
As shown below, the maximum value  
of the packages has been reduced by 
over 20% as a result of the change in 
award structure. 
Q 
If the performance element  
is removed from long-term  
share awards, how will you  
motivate performance? 
The Committee is firmly of the view  
that the Restricted Shares will act as  
a more powerful driver of performance 
than the LTIP. By increasing the direct 
exposure to shares both during and post 
employment, executives have wealth 
at risk. This very visible exposure to 
the share price, which is easily monitored 
by executives, is therefore far more 
motivating than long-term plans based 
on relative TSR (which is seen as a 
“lottery” so has little incentive effect). 
With Restricted Shares, executives are 
strongly incentivised to take actions that 
will enhance long-term performance 
rather than short-term shareholder 
value given the phased vesting and 
release profile. 
In addition, the annual bonus will 
continue to act as a powerful tool 
to drive annual performance against 
stretching targets built around our 
annual financial and strategic objectives. 
Engaging with our investors
Change in maximum total compensation
100
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Q 
How did you arrive at  
the 50% discount from  
LTIP award levels? 
We recognise that the conversion rate 
between LTIP and Restricted Shares is  
a key issue for investors. Our ‘starting 
point’ for the conversion was to confirm 
that total compensation is positioned 
around median against similarly sized  
UK companies and therefore we were 
not embedding any excessive quantum. 
To understand LTIP payout expectations, 
we analysed LTIP outcomes over a 
long-term period (ten years) to provide  
a robust view on the vesting outcomes 
which executives might expect ‘through 
the cycle’. This showed that the average 
vesting has been 61% over that period 
and therefore a reasonable ‘expected 
value’ of the current LTIP would be 
153% of salary (CEO) and 122% (CFO) 
– being the current market competitive 
award size multiplied by the long-term 
expected vesting of 61% of maximum. 
The proposed award sizes represent a 
20% reduction to that expected value 
and the Committee therefore believes 
that 50% is a more than sufficient discount. 
As shown in the chart on page 96,  
recent vesting outcomes have been  
zero. However, the expected vesting  
for ‘in-flight’ awards (using publicly 
available market expectations) as we 
now head into the up-cycle is over  
80% this year and over 60% next  
year. Therefore, management will be 
more financially disadvantaged under 
the Restricted Shares proposal than they 
would be under an LTIP if those types  
of vesting levels continued through the 
coming years. Switching to Restricted 
Shares at this point in the cycle is likely 
to be less beneficial to management, 
but is recognised as the right thing to  
do to incent delivery of long-term value. 
Q 
Why does the first tranche  
vest after two years? Is this  
just a transitional solution?
Yes, the primary reason for this is to 
address a sizeable ‘transition’ issue  
as we shift from LTIPs to Restricted 
Shares. The Committee modelled the 
future release of shares which illustrated 
a significant potential fall-off in released 
value in 2023 (as the LTIP switches to 
Restricted Shares) which could create  
an unintended retention risk at a critical 
stage in the execution of the business 
strategy. Recognising the need to be 
mindful of the continuity of talent, the 
Committee’s preferred solution was to 
shorten the vesting of the first 25% 
tranche from three to two years which 
would allow executives to perceive a 
greater build up in the vested value of 
their awards over that critical period  
of 2021 to 2023 as the transition from 
LTIP to Restricted Shares occurs.
However, it should be noted that: 
• This has no impact on when executives 
receive any shares from the holding 
period, which will continue to be  
from five to seven years from grant.  
It therefore does not compromise  
the principle of long-term focus. 
• In our 2021 Policy, we will revert to  
three-year vesting for tranche one. 
• New executives in the 2018 Policy 
period will have three-year vesting. 
Q 
How will the underpin work? 
Does it provide the Committee 
with the necessary tools in the  
event of poor performance? 
The Board considered the metrics  
and the mechanics of the underpin  
at length in developing the proposal.  
The underpin provides investors with 
transparency on a number of clearly 
identified ‘failure scenarios’ which  
would trigger the Committee to  
consider, ahead of the vesting of  
each tranche of each award, whether  
a downward adjustment was required. 
Full disclosure would be made at the  
time should the underpin be invoked. 
A number of additional safeguards and 
discretions also exist in circumstances  
not explicitly referenced in the underpin 
framework. For example: 
• General discretion. As included  
in the Policy Table on page 104,  
the Committee retains a general 
discretion to adjust vesting outcomes 
downwards for each tranche of the 
Restricted Share awards if it believes 
this will better reflect the underlying 
performance of the Company over  
the period.
• Malus and clawback. These remain  
in place in line with the provisions 
which already existed in our LTIP. 
Malus allows a reduction of awards 
prior to vesting and clawback is the 
ability to reclaim vested amounts 
prior to the end of the holding period. 
• Discretion on future award sizes.  
In addition to the above, the 
Committee would also retain full 
discretion on future award sizes. 
Although the maximum levels of  
award are set for the Policy period  
at 125%/100% of salary for the  
CEO/CFO, these grant levels would 
not be ‘automatic’ each year and the 
Committee retains the discretion to 
make a lower award if appropriate. 
These additional provisions provide the 
Committee with a wide range of ‘tools’ 
within the remuneration framework  
which could be applied to ensure 
appropriate outcomes. 
Q 
Under the new bonus 
framework, how will you  
ensure the strategic objectives are 
stretching and robustly assessed? 
The strategic objectives will operate 
under a robust architecture. For  
each of the strategic priorities  
(People, Customers, Technology, and 
Performance), the Board has agreed  
the key underlying headline metric to  
be achieved over the next three to five 
years, as well as the target priorities for 
2018. Targets will be stretching and 
assessed using a robust framework 
comprising objective, measurable and, 
where possible, externally referenced 
targets. Underlying targets will be 
fully disclosed in next year’s report.

Future policy table
Base salary
Purpose
To provide a salary which takes into account an individual’s role, skills and 
responsibilities and enables the Group to attract and retain talented leaders.
Operation
Reviewed annually, with increases normally taking effect from 1 April. 
Salaries are set by reference to market practice for similar roles in  
companies of similar size and complexity. The Committee also takes  
into account personal performance, the wider employee context,  
and economic and labour market conditions.
Maximum value
While there is no stipulated maximum salary  
increase, increases will not normally be greater  
than the average salary increase for UK employees  
(or the relevant jurisdiction if an Executive Director  
is based outside the UK).
Different increases may be awarded at the 
Committee’s discretion in instances such as where:
• there has been a significant increase in the size, 
complexity or value of the Group;
• there has been a change in role or responsibility;
• the individual is relatively new in the role and  
the salary level has been set to reflect this; and
• the individual is positioned below relevant  
market levels.
Pension
Purpose
To encourage long-term saving and planning for retirement.
Operation
A contribution into the Company’s defined contribution pension plan or  
an equivalent cash allowance, or any other arrangement the Committee 
considers has the same economic benefit.
Maximum value
12% of base salary per annum in line with other 
senior UK employees.
Benefits
Purpose
To provide cost-effective benefits valued by individuals. 
Operation
Benefits include, but are not limited to, health care, car allowance, liability 
insurance and death in service insurance. 
Other benefits may be provided from time to time if considered reasonable 
and appropriate, such as relocation benefits or long-term disability insurance. 
.
Maximum value
• Car allowance – no greater than £20,000 per annum
• Life assurance – 5 x base salary
The cost of providing insurance and health care 
benefits varies according to premium rates, so  
there is no formal maximum monetary value.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The policy will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM to be held on 26 April 2018. Subject to approval, the policy  
is intended to apply for three years from the AGM. 
There are three major differences between the proposed and the current policy approved in 2017: (i) replacement of the  
Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) with the Share Reward Plan (SRP), (ii) increased shareholding requirements and extension  
of the requirement post-employment, and (iii) implementation of an all-employee share plan.
102
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Annual bonus
Purpose
To incentivise the delivery of our strategic plan and to reward the 
achievement of stretching performance on an annual basis.
To focus incentives on team performance to create collective accountability.
Operation
Measures, targets and weightings are reviewed and determined annually  
at the start of each financial year to ensure they are appropriate and  
support the Company’s strategy.
30% of any bonus will be deferred into an award of Weir Group shares  
which will normally be released after three years. 
Malus and clawback provisions may be applied in the event of a  
material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group or a 
subsidiary/division, the discovery that information used to determine  
an award was materially incorrect, mistaken or misrepresented, gross 
misconduct (leading to termination for cause), or reputational damage  
causing significant damage to the Company and clearly attributable  
to the individual.
Maximum value
• CEO 150% of base salary
• CFO 125% of base salary
Performance assessment
Annual bonuses will be subject to such targets  
as the Committee considers appropriate each year. 
Financial measures will normally be used to  
calculate at least 50% of the bonus, with  
the remainder being based on strategic and/or 
personal objectives.
The performance targets for financial measures  
are set in the context of the internal budget taking  
into account other relevant factors such as  
external forecasts.
All financial measures are calibrated with payment  
on a straight line basis between threshold (up to  
20% of maximum bonus payable) and stretch.
Payment of any strategic component will be  
subject to a discretionary underpin (including 
individual performance).
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee  
has discretion to alter the measures and/or  
targets during the performance period if it  
believes the original measures and/or targets  
are no longer appropriate.
The Committee has discretion in exceptional 
circumstances to amend the payout level if  
it believes this will better reflect the Company’s 
underlying performance.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Share Reward Plan
Purpose
To encourage and enable substantial long-term share ownership.
To reward the delivery of sustainable value over time in a cyclical business.
Operation
The Committee may grant awards under the SRP on an annual basis. 
Vesting
Vesting of awards will be phased in four equal tranches over a five-year 
period. This will normally be split into four equal tranches of 25% (of the  
total award) which vest after two, three, four and five years following grant. 
For any Executive Director appointed after the effective date of this Policy 
and from 2021 onwards for incumbent executives, 50% will vest after three 
years, 25% after four years and 25% after five years. 
Vesting will be subject to continued employment and assessment  
of the underpin. 
Following vesting, an additional two-year holding period will also apply  
to each tranche, such that 50% of vested shares in an award are released  
five years from grant, 25% are released after six years and the final 25%  
is released after seven years.
Awards will normally be made in the form of conditional share awards,  
but may be awarded in other forms if appropriate (e.g. as nil cost options).
Malus and clawback (applicable for three years from vesting) provisions  
may be applied in the event of:
• A discovery of a material misstatement in the audited consolidated  
accounts of the Group or audited accounts of any Group company;
• Action or conduct which can be considered as gross misconduct;
• Events or behaviour which have a significant detrimental impact on  
the reputation of any Group company and which can be attributed  
to the individual award holder;
• The information used to determine the number of shares over which  
an award is granted or vests is found to be materially incorrect,  
mistaken or misrepresented to the advantage of the award holder.
Maximum value
The Committee will determine the grant level  
each year. The maximum value of an award which 
may be granted in respect of a financial year is:
• CEO 125% of base salary
• CFO 100% of base salary
Performance assessment
No performance measures are associated  
with the awards.
The underpin will consist of a ‘basket’ of  
pre-determined key metrics which will best  
reflect overall business health over the vesting  
period. For each metric, a clearly defined and,  
where relevant, quantifiable ‘threshold’ will be  
set at the time of grant. Thresholds will be  
disclosed on a prospective basis.
Prior to vesting, if any of the thresholds have  
not been met, it would trigger the Committee  
to consider whether a discretionary downward 
adjustment was required.
In addition, the Committee will have general 
discretion to reduce vesting levels if it believes  
this will better reflect the underlying performance  
of the Company over the period.
Shareholding requirements
Purpose
To ensure Executive Directors build and hold a significant  
shareholding long term.
To align Executive Directors’ interests with shareholders.
Operation
Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding in the  
Company over a five-year period.
All beneficially owned shares, deferred shares and unvested Restricted  
Share awards count towards an individual’s shareholding (on a net  
of tax basis, where relevant). 
Until the shareholding requirement is met, an Executive Director must  
retain 50% of net Restricted Share awards, Performance Share awards  
and deferred bonus awards.
Shareholding requirements continue post-employment:
• The requirement will fall to half the normal level on leaving.
• The requirement would taper down to zero after two years.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 All-employee share plans 
Purpose
To enable long-term share ownership for all employees, and to increase 
alignment with shareholders.
To provide one common benefit to all employees.
Operation
Employees will be awarded free shares in 2019 and 2020. From 2021 
onwards, only new employees will be eligible to receive free shares. For all 
other employees, awards of free shares will be contingent on the employee 
purchasing shares with their own funds. Shares purchased using employees’ 
own funds will be matched by the Company. 
Shares will vest no later than three years after grant.
Executive Directors will be excluded from receiving any free shares in 2019 
and 2020, but they will be eligible to purchase and receive matching shares 
from 2021 on the same terms as other employees.
In 2016, shareholders approved a Save As You Earn scheme for all employees 
but this plan is not currently operated.
Maximum value
The maximum amount of shares that can be 
purchased will be £200 per month. The maximum 
share match basis will be one share for every three 
shares purchased.
 
Legacy arrangements
Purpose
To honour payments and other remuneration related items due to  
Executive Directors.
Operation
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments  
and/or payments for loss of office, this includes exercising any discretions 
available to it in connection with such payments (notwithstanding that they 
are not in line with this policy) where the terms of payment:
• Came into effect before this policy was approved and implemented 
(including where such payments are in line with a previously approved 
policy);
• Were agreed at a time when the individual was not a Director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment is not  
in consideration for the individual becoming a Director.
This will include the vesting of any awards granted under the LTIP.
Maximum value
In line with existing commitments and arrangements.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Purpose
To attract and retain experienced and skilled Non-Executive Directors  
and to reflect the responsibilities and time commitment involved.
Fees are reviewed annually by reference to companies of similar size  
and complexity, economic and labour market conditions.
Additional fees may be made available to Non-Executive Directors where 
appropriate to reflect any additional time commitment or duties.
The Company may reimburse Non-Executive Directors for any business 
related costs (such as travel and accommodation costs incurred in connection 
with their duties) and any associated tax on these costs.
Maximum value
Fees as prescribed in the Articles of Association.
Planned increases in fees will take into account 
general increases across the Group, along with 
market practice.
Notes to the future policy table
Dividends
Executive Directors are entitled to receive the value of dividends payable on any deferred bonus awards under the Annual  
Bonus or awards under the SRP and LTIP up the point of vesting This value may be calculated assuming that the dividends  
were notionally reinvested in the Company’s shares.
Common award terms
Awards granted under the share plans may be adjusted in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or any 
demerger, special dividend or other event that may affect the current or future value of the awards.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Recruitment policy
The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of an Executive 
Director is to take account of all relevant factors, such as the individual’s remuneration package in their prior role and the  
positioning of the package against the local market. We will not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment.
Component Policy and operation
Remuneration The salary level, benefits, pension, annual bonus and annual SRP participation will be in line with the policy table. 
Buy-Out Awards The Committee will consider whether any buy-out awards are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment 
of an Executive Director, and if there are any other compensation arrangements that would be forfeited on 
leaving the previous employer. 
The Committee will seek to structure any buy-out award taking into account relevant factors including any 
performance conditions, the form in which it is to be paid and the timeframe of the award.
Buy-out awards will generally be made on a like-for-like basis and will be no more generous in quantum and 
timeframe than the awards being forfeited.
Other The Committee may agree to meet certain mobility or relocation costs including, but not limited to,  
temporary living and transportation expenses. The Committee may also agree to meet the costs of  
relevant professional fees.
Reasonable expenses and associated tax incurred as part of their recruitment will be reimbursed to the  
Executive Director.
Internal promotion  
to Executive Director
The Committee will honour existing remuneration arrangements made prior to and not in contemplation of 
promotion. The arrangements will continue to pay out in accordance with the respective rules and guidelines.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
It is the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering 
payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, 
contractual obligations of both parties as well as incentive plan and pension scheme rules.
In the event that an Executive Director’s service contract is terminated other than in accordance with its terms, the Committee 
will give full consideration to the obligation and ability of the individual to mitigate any loss they may suffer as a result of the 
termination of their contract.
Service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Provision Policy
Unexpired term The unexpired term of Executive Directors’ contracts is 12 months. Executive Directors have rolling contracts.
Change of control No provisions in service contracts relate to a change of control. Refer to the relevant sections below for annual 
bonus and share plans provisions.
Notice period Current Executive Directors have 12 months’ notice by either the Company or the individual. This would be the 
normal policy for new appointments.
Contractual 
payments
Termination with contractual notice or termination by way of payment in lieu of notice (PILON) at the  
Company’s discretion.
Neither notice nor PILON will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
The calculation of PILON will be at 1.2 x gross salary to reflect the value of salary and contractual benefits.
PILON will be made where circumstances dictate that Executive Directors’ services are not required for their full 
notice period. Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination which provides for mitigation, including 
remuneration from alternative employment.
The Committee may authorise:
• payments for statutory entitlements in the event of termination;
• reasonable settlement of potential legal claims;
• payment of reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
106
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Provision Policy
Annual bonus  
and deferred  
bonus awards
At the discretion of the Committee, a pro-rated payment (payable in such proportions of cash and shares as the 
Committee may determine) may be earned if employment ceases during the year. Any payment will be subject to 
the assessment of bonus targets.
Dismissal for gross misconduct – all entitlements will be forfeited, including any unvested deferred bonus awards.
All other departure events – existing rights are normally retained in respect of any deferred bonus awards. Vesting 
will take place at the normal vesting date unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
Malus and clawback provisions will continue to apply.
Change in control – any bonus will normally be determined by the Committee up to the expected date of change  
in control taking into account both performance and the period of the financial year which has elapsed. Deferred 
bonus awards will vest on change in control.
Outstanding share 
plan awards
The treatment of share awards will be governed by the rules of the relevant plan.
Where an individual leaves as a Good Leaver (which includes for reasons of death, retirement, ill-health, injury or 
disability, redundancy, the sale of employing company or business, or other circumstances that the Committee 
determines) unvested awards will normally continue and vest on the normal vesting date, taking into account the 
assessment of any applicable underpins and pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the vesting period of each tranche 
which has elapsed. For LTIP awards, vesting would also take into account any applicable performance conditions 
over the normal performance period.
The Committee may exercise its discretion to apply a different pro-rata methodology or to dis-apply time  
pro-rating completely.
Awards subject to a holding period will continue to be subject to that holding period as if employment had not 
ceased, except in the case of death, or in such other circumstances as the Committee may determine, when  
the holding period will end at that time.
The rules provide flexibility that in the case of the participant’s death (or such other exceptional circumstances  
as the Committee considers appropriate), tranches will vest (and awards in the holding period will be released)  
at the time of death/leaving.
If an individual leaves for any reason other than as a Good Leaver, any unvested awards will lapse on termination.
Leavers have a period of three months to exercise any options unless this period is extended by the Committee.  
In the event of death, an option can be exercised for a period of 12 months by the deceased’s estate.
Awards will remain subject to the operation of malus and clawback provisions.
Change in control – the extent to which unvested awards vest will be determined by the Committee, taking into 
account the performance conditions and/or underpins as applicable and the proportion of the vesting period that 
has elapsed. Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquiring company. The 
holding period applicable to any awards will end at the time of change in control.
All-employee plans The rules of any all-employee share plans will apply in the event of termination of employment or change in control.
Relocation The Committee may determine that share plan awards or deferred bonus awards should vest early if an Executive 
Director is relocated to a country where they would suffer a tax or regulatory disadvantage by holding the award.
Chairman and 
Non-Executive 
Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment. The letters do not contain any contractual entitlement to a 
termination payment and the Non-Executive Directors can be removed in accordance with the Company’s Articles 
of Association.
With the exception of the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors appointed prior to 2011, notice periods are six 
months from the Company and no notice from the individual.
There are no change in control provisions in the letters of appointment.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group
As per our terms of reference, the Committee monitors the level of remuneration of employees below the Group Executive and 
is regularly updated on pay and conditions across the Group. When determining remuneration for the Executive Directors, the 
average salary increases and performance ranges applicable to all employees are taken into account as well as economic trends. 
The wider employee group was not consulted when setting the remuneration policy. 
Consideration of employee engagement 
Meaningful engagement with customers and employees play a crucial role in both innovation and the continuous improvement  
of the Weir business. 
The Board recognises the importance of culture and effective employee relations to the creation of good work and good 
workplaces. The role of the Board therefore is to ensure that mechanisms are in place, and monitored, for effective employee 
engagement and that there is governance of the process for management standards and training to continue to assure  
ourselves of the leadership skills required to do engagement well. Given the multi-national nature of our business, the 
management team also recognise that their approaches to insight-gathering and dialogue need to reflect country practices  
so that engagement can be led well locally and be mindful of circumstances and culture. 
As a Board, we recognise the importance of a Group-wide framework for employee dialogue which is why the focus in 2018/19 
(as reflected earlier in the Directors’ Remuneration Report in the section on Strategic Objectives) will be to ensure that we 
broaden our Group-wide practices for gathering workforce views and engaging in meaningful dialogue and for measuring  
and further strengthening employee engagement. Monitoring of progress will take place at the Board.
Consideration of shareholder engagement
Shareholders and their representative bodies have played a very active role in the development of the remuneration policies 
outlined in this Report. An extensive consultation process has been undertaken in both the second half of 2017 and the beginning 
of 2018. This began with meetings with our major shareholders to shape the proposals and then consultation was extended more 
broadly to other large shareholders. 
As demonstrated in the Q&A earlier in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, shareholders asked a broad range of questions 
including how the underpin would work and how the Committee will avoid ‘paying for failure’. We were also asked about how  
the Committee could be sure that the arrangements would aid motivation and retention. This engagement provided valuable 
insight into issues of concern for shareholders and enabled the Committee to make adjustments to win support for our new reward 
construct. The Committee Chair has also made it clear that she remains committed to open and transparent reporting against these 
new remuneration arrangements and is available for continuous dialogue.

Notes
The performance targets and achievements are set using January 2017 average exchange rates and are increased or decreased to reflect the impact of any acquisitions or disposals made  
in the year that are of a size requiring Board approval. For acquisitions, targets are increased by the expected performance from the acquired business. For disposals, the target is reduced  
by the expected performance from the business which was disposed.
Financial measures
Our performance against our financial measures was as follows:
Profit – profit before tax increased significantly principally reflecting a return to growth by the Oil & Gas division. Profitability  
in Minerals was impacted by investment in growth initiatives, project phasing and plant reconfigurations. Flow Control was 
impacted by one-off charges in the first half.
Cash flow from operations was reduced as a result of increased investment in working capital to support strong growth, 
particularly in the Minerals and Oil & Gas divisions. Flow Control’s cash flow performance reflected its reduced profitability.
Order input – the Group delivered strong order growth in both its Oil & Gas and Minerals divisions as demand for its solutions 
increased. Flow Control orders were impacted by tough conditions in both power and downstream oil and gas markets.
Personal objectives
The personal objectives were chosen as they supported and reinforced our business strategy. The Committee assessed performance 
using metrics where appropriate, but it also took into account the Executive Director’s overall performance in his job.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 During the year a total of 6,249,373 
ordinary shares with an aggregate 
nominal value of £781,171.63 were  
issued and allotted. 
The Weir Group has two Employee 
Benefit Trusts (EBT): one with the 
trustees SG Kleinwort Hambros Trust 
Company (CI) Ltd (the ‘Kleinwort EBT’) 
and one with the trustees Estera Trust 
(Jersey) Limited (the ‘Estera EBT’).
During the year, the trustees of the 
Kleinwort EBT transferred 1,787 ordinary 
shares to satisfy a one-off conditional 
award. During the year, the trustees of 
the Estera EBT transferred 246,184 
ordinary shares to employees to satisfy 
the vesting of LTIP awards.
Both EBTs have agreed to waive any  
right to all dividend payments on shares 
held by them, with the exception of 
shares held in respect of awards which 
have a dividend entitlement. Details of  
the shares held by the EBTs are set out in 
note 25 to the Group financial statements 
on page 170. The 42,875 shares held in  
the Estera EBT for the LTIP bonus share 
awards are the shares in respect of which 
dividends have not been waived. The 
Kleinwort EBT holds, through its nominee 
account K.B. (CI) Nominees Limited, 
0.002% of the issued share capital of the 
Company, as at 31 December 2017. The 
Estera EBT holds through its nominee 
account CGWL Nominees Ltd, 0.03%  
of the issued share capital of the 
Company as at 31 December 2017. 
Of this, 0.02% is held in trust for the 
benefit of certain senior executives of  
the Group, and 0.01% is held in trust on 
behalf of the Company for satisfaction of 
any future vesting of the awards granted 
under the LTIP. With the exception of  
the shares held for the benefit of certain 
senior executives, the voting rights in 
relation to these shares are exercised  
by the trustees. The EBTs may vote or 
abstain from voting with the shares or 
accept or reject any offer relating to 
shares, in any way they see fit, without 
incurring any liability and without being 
required to give reasons for their decision.
Repurchase of shares
At the 2017 Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders renewed the Company’s 
authority to make market purchases  
of up to £21.7m ordinary shares 
(representing approximately 10% of  
the issued share capital excluding 
treasury shares). No shares were 
purchased under this authority  
during the year ended 31 December 2017  
and at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, the Board will again seek 
shareholder approval to renew the annual 
authority for the Company to make 
market purchases at the same level.

provide that on a show of hands at a 
general meeting of the Company, every 
holder of ordinary shares present in 
person and by proxy and entitled to vote 
shall have one vote and on a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote shall have one vote

other evidence as the Directors may 
reasonably require to prove title of

Corporate Governance Report
Directors’ Report continued
Confirmations
So far as each of the Directors is aware, 
there is no relevant audit information  
(as defined by section 481 of the 
Companies Act 2006) of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware.
Each of the Directors has taken all of the 
steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a Director to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors  
are aware of that information.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue to operate for a 
period of at least 12 months from the date 
of approval of the financial statements. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. In forming this view, 
the Directors have reviewed the Group’s 
budgets, plans and cash flow forecasts, 
including market downturn sensitivities. 
In addition, the Directors have considered 
the potential impact of credit risk and 
liquidity risk detailed in note 30 to the 
Group financial statements on pages 
177 to 183. Each of these items has  
been considered in relation to the  
Group’s banking facilities described  
in note 20 on pages 160 and 161.
The Directors’ Report has been approved 
by the Board of Directors in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Corporate Governance Report
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements in accordance  
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors  
to prepare financial statements for  
each financial year. Under that law,  
the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union and the Company 
financial statements in accordance  
with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law.
In preparing those financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies  
and then apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates  
that are reasonable and prudent.
• State that the Group financial 
statements have complied with IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union, 
subject to any material departures 
being disclosed and explained.
• State for the Company financial 
statements whether the applicable  
UK Accounting Standards have  
been followed, subject to any  
material departures being  
disclosed and explained.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Group financial 
statements comply with the 2006 Act 
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for  
the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of accounts may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements  
in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors consider that the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements,  
taken as a whole, are fair, balanced  
and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders  
to assess the Group’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, as at the date  
of this report, confirms to the best  
of their knowledge that:
• The financial statements, prepared  
in accordance with the applicable  
set of accounting standards, give  
a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit  
of the Group.
• The Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report include a fair review of the 
development and performance of  
the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.

statements of changes in equity for  
the year then ended; and the notes  
to the financial statements, which 
include a description of the significant 
accounting policies.
Our opinion is consistent with our 
reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK)  
are further described in the Auditors’ 
responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for  
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the  
Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our  
audit of the financial statements in the 
UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard, as applicable to listed public 
interest entities, and we have fulfilled  
our other ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and  
belief, we declare that non-audit  
services prohibited by the FRC’s  
Ethical Standard were not provided  
to the Group or the Parent company.
Other than those disclosed in note 4  
to the financial statements, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the 
Group or the Parent company in the year 
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
The Group is organised into three 
operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas  
and Flow Control, with each having 
businesses in a number of locations 
around the world. Many of the businesses 
are of similar size, so we scoped our audit 
to ensure we had appropriate coverage of 
the Group covering all three divisions. We 
included components which accounted 
for the largest share of the Group’s results 
or where we considered there to be areas 
of significant risk. We also considered  
the markets in which the Group operates 
when we performed our assessment of 
scope and areas of significant risk.

• Overall Parent company materiality: 
£1.5m (2016: £1.5m), based on an 
allocation of Group materiality.
• We conducted audit work in  
20 components in 11 countries,

We conducted full scope audits on  
10 of these components and the  
audit of specified balances and  
classes of transactions for the 
remaining components. 
• The Group audit engagement team

Italy, covering four components.  
In addition, members of the Group 
engagement team performed the  
audit of the six components based  
in the UK.
• The 20 components where we 
performed audit work accounted for 
approximately 84% of Group revenue

The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we 
determined materiality and assessed  
the risks of material misstatement in  
the financial statements. In particular,  
we looked at where the Directors made 
subjective judgements, for example  
in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future 
events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal 
and regulatory framework applicable  
to the Group and the industries in which  
it operates, and considered the risk of 
acts by the Group which were contrary  
to applicable laws and regulations, including 
fraud. We designed audit procedures  
at Group and significant component  
level to respond to the risk, recognising 
that the risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement due to fraud is higher than 
the risk of not detecting one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve deliberate 
concealment by, for example, forgery  
or intentional misrepresentations, or 
through collusion. We focused on laws 
and regulations that could give rise to a 
material misstatement in the Group and 
Parent company financial statements, 
including, but not limited to, the Companies 
Act 2006, the Listing Rules, Pensions 
120
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 legislation, UK tax legislation and 
equivalent local laws and regulations 
applicable to significant component 
teams. Our tests included, but were  
not limited to, review of the financial 
statement disclosures to underlying 
supporting documentation, enquiries  
of management, review of significant 
component auditors’ work and review  
of internal audit reports in so far as  
they related to the financial statements. 
There are inherent limitations in the  
audit procedures described above and  
the further removed non-compliance  
with laws and regulations is from the 
events and transactions reflected in  
the financial statements, the less likely 
we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters 
relating to irregularities, including fraud. 
As in all of our audits, we also addressed 
the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, 
and the risk of management override  
of internal controls, including testing 
journals and evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the Directors  
that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, 
in the auditors’ professional judgement, 
were of most significance in the audit of 
the financial statements of the current 
year and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement 
(whether or not due to fraud) identified by 
the auditors, including those which had 
the greatest effect on: the overall audit 
strategy; the allocation of resources in  
the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. These matters, and 
any comments we make on the results of 
our procedures thereon, were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. This  
is not a complete list of all risks identified 
by our audit. All key audit matters are 
relevant to the Group only. None of them 
apply to the parent Company. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for asbestos-related claims
Refer to page 88 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 131 Accounting Policies and page 162 (note 22).
Provision has been made for future asbestos-
related claims as at 31 December 2017 of £58.0m 
(2016: £52.7m). This consists of a provision of 
£53.3m (2016: £47.5m) for the Group’s liabilities 
arising from asbestos-related damages claims  
in the US and £4.7m in the UK (2016: £5.2m).
The valuation of the liability involves significant 
estimation. In arriving at the estimate of the 
liability, management is required to make 
assumptions including the number and value  
of claims and the time period over which the 
liability can be reliably measured.
As a result there is a high degree of uncertainty  
in this estimate.
The Group has insurance cover in place to offset 
the US provision (£53.3m included in other 
receivables between non-current and current 
assets – note 17, page 158). This was also 
considered in our work.
We have performed procedures on both the UK and US asbestos 
liabilities. The US provision is the more significant and uncertain and 
therefore involved more judgement.
During the year, management obtained an updated actuarial estimate of 
the asbestos liability from an independent expert. We involved our PwC 
actuarial specialists to assess the reasonableness of the methodology 
used by management’s expert.
Management used the updated actuarial data to calculate the provision 
required at 31 December 2017. We evaluated management’s underlying 
assumptions used in their calculation. This included testing of:
• the mathematical accuracy of the underlying calculations in 
management’s model;
• the input data to management’s model, such as the average cost  
per claim and the number of settled claims to source data which  
we verified directly with the Group’s external lawyers; and
• the reasonableness of forecast settlement numbers and amounts  
to data provided by the Group’s external actuarial experts.
We evaluated the appropriateness of management’s assessment of the 
timescale over which a liability can be reliably measured, which remains 
at ten years.
We also examined the insurance cover held by the Group and modelled 
the likelihood of the cover in place being sufficient to cover the period 
and amount of the estimated liabilities.
Finally, we tested the disclosures in the financial statements and checked 
for compliance with IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Liabilities’ and IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’.
We considered the assumptions used by management to be appropriate 
in arriving at a reliable estimate of the provision. We also assessed the 
recognition of an offsetting insurance asset in the financial statements 
and considered it to be appropriate.

Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Carrying value of goodwill and intangibles
Refer to page 88 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 131 Accounting Policies and page 155 (note 14).
The Group has £869.5m (2016: £876.0m) of  
goodwill on the balance sheet. We focused  
on this area because the assessment of the  
value in use of each Cash Generating Unit  
(‘CGU’) involves judgement.
The key assumptions in management’s impairment 
model are the forecast results of the business,  
long-term growth rates and discount rates applied 
to future cash flow forecasts.
The ongoing uncertainty in the Oil & Gas market 
and the loss recorded by the Flow Control division 
could suggest a higher risk of impairment in the 
carrying value of goodwill.
We performed detailed testing over management’s Value in Use model 
which included:
• assessing the integrity and mathematical accuracy of the model;
• utilising PwC valuations specialists to assess the key assumptions  
of growth rate and discount rate.
We also assessed the composition of CGUs, ensuring that these 
accurately reflect the structure and operations of the business and  
that the CGUs met the requirements of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’.
We assessed the headroom in each CGU, performing sensitivity 
analyses for each, focusing in particular on the Flow Control CGU  
where the headroom is lowest. We tested the disclosures in the 
Financial Statements and checked compliance with IAS 36 and IAS 1.
From the procedures performed, we did not identify any material 
misstatements.
Accounting for exceptional items
Refer to page 88 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 131 Accounting Policies and page 144 (note 5).
The Group incurred £13.3m (2016: £73.5m)  
of exceptional charges in the year.
The accurate presentation of costs and income  
as exceptional items was considered an area of 
focus for all reporting units. This was to check  
the consistency and accuracy of the Group’s 
underlying earnings as reported to shareholders.
The Group commenced a significant restructuring 
plan during 2015 and this continued in 2016 and 
2017. Further, there were other non-recurring, 
material items which were significant in nature  
and therefore required a higher level of focus. 
We obtained a listing of the exceptional costs and income incurred  
by both component and category and tested a sample to supporting 
documentation.
We checked the nature of the costs and income to assess whether they 
were treated appropriately and consistently as exceptional items within 
the income statement. We checked the disclosures in the annual report 
relating to exceptional items.
We considered whether there were other significant costs or income 
which should have been included in exceptional items using our 
knowledge of the business.
We assessed the appropriateness of the classification of items as 
exceptional for compliance with both the Group’s accounting policy  
and IAS 1.
We also verified that provisions made in the prior year were 
appropriately utilised during the year.
Finally, we checked the disclosure in note 5 for consistency with  
our understanding and for compliance with IAS 1.
From the audit work performed, we did not identify any material 
misstatements.
Valuation of uncertain tax provisions
Refer to page 88 (Audit Committee Report), 
page 131 Accounting Policies and page 164 (note 23).
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions  
and has a number of ongoing discussions  
and investigations with tax authorities where 
uncertain tax provisions and treatments may  
be challenged. There is judgement in assessing  
the level of provisions required to cover the risk  
of successful challenge over certain of the  
Group’s tax provisions.
We read the Group’s documentation of uncertain tax provisions and 
tested the more significant provisions for appropriateness by: 
• confirming the basis of provision;
• understanding the movements on the provision during the year; and
• reading correspondence with relevant tax authorities in the assessment 
of management’s calculation. 
This is an area which requires significant management judgement and 
has a range of possible outcomes. However, the evidence we obtained, 
including our testing of assumptions, was materially consistent with the 
overall level of provisioning in respect of tax.
In addition, we assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the 
disclosure of tax provisions for compliance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’.
122
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls,  
the industries in which the Group operates and the areas of audit risk. 
The Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Flow Control with additional centralised Head 
Office functions. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of a large number of components which make up the 
Group’s operating businesses within these divisions and centralised functions. In establishing the overall approach to the Group 
audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the components either by us, as the Group engagement 
team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction.
The Group’s components vary significantly in size and we identified ten components that, in our view, required an audit of their 
complete financial information due to their relative size or risk characteristics. Of these full scope component audits, six were UK 
based and were performed by members of the Group engagement team. These covered trading components, central functions 
and head office managed balances including treasury, uncertain tax provisions, post-retirement benefits, goodwill and intangibles. 
The remaining four full scope component audits were performed by other PwC network firms. Other PwC network firms also 
performed specific scope audits over a further ten components which covered all line items on the income statement and 
specified line items on the balance sheet. 
The scope of work at each component was determined by its contribution to the Group’s overall financial performance or  
balance sheet and its risk profile. Where component audits were performed by teams from other PwC network firms,  
members of the Group engagement team were involved in their work throughout the audit. We maintained regular 
communication and conducted formal interim and year-end conference calls with all full and specific scope component  
teams. The year end discussions also included divisional management. 
Of the 20 components in scope, we deemed three to be financially significant to the Group. We visited all three locations  
in the prior year and have commenced a rotational cycle of visits. The Group engagement leader visited the significant  
component in the United States twice during the year. Senior members of the Group engagement team also visited  
components in China and Italy. 
Together these full and specific scope component audits gave appropriate coverage of all material balances at a Group level.  
On a consolidated basis, these provided coverage of 84% of revenue and 73% of profit before exceptional items, intangibles 
amortisation and tax.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and  
extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect  
of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
Overall 
materiality
£12.4m (2016: £8.5m). £1.5m (2016: £1.5m).
How we 
determined it
5% of profit before exceptional items, intangibles 
amortisation and tax.
An allocation of Group materiality.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
It is clear from the Annual Report that this profit 
measure is used by shareholders in evaluating  
the underlying business performance. We applied  
a lower materiality to the audit of exceptional items 
and intangibles amortisation.
An allocation of Group materiality.
For each component in our audit scope, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of 
materiality allocated across components was between £0.4m and £9.0m. We applied a specific lower materiality to the audit  
of exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that 
was also less than our overall Group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.6m 
(Group audit) (2016: £0.4m) and £0.6m (Parent company audit) (2016: £0.4m) as well as misstatements below those amounts 
that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add or  
draw attention to in respect of the Directors’ statement in the financial 
statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to  
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements and the Directors’ identification of any material uncertainties  
to the Group’s and the Parent company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern over a period of at least twelve months from the date of  
approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw 
attention to. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s  
and Parent company’s ability to continue as a  
going concern.
We are required to report if the Directors’ statement relating  
to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is  
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover 
the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated  
in this report, any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained  
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based 
on these responsibilities.
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, 
(CA06), ISAs (UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and 
matters as described below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared  
in accordance with applicable legal requirements. (CA06)
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Parent company and their environment obtained in the course  
of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report. (CA06)
The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the 
solvency or liquidity of the Group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The Directors’ confirmation on page 50 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The Directors’ explanation on page 50 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group,  
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall  
due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications 
or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our  
review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the Directors’ 
process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and 
understanding of the Group and Parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit. (Listing Rules)
124
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Other Code provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when:
• The statement given by the Directors, on page 119, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group’s and Parent company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group and Parent 
company obtained in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on pages 88 to 94 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The Directors’ statement relating to the Parent company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure 
from a relevant provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. (CA06)
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 119, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent company’s ability  
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is  
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material 
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Other required reporting
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• the Parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Appointment
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 28 April 2016 to audit the 
financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2016 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted 
engagement is two years, covering the period ended 31 December 2016 and year to 31 December 2017.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Notes to the Group Financial Statements
1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance
The Consolidated Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC (the ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (together, the ‘Group’)  
for the year ended 31 December 2017 (‘2017’) were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of  
the Directors on 28 February 2018. The comparative information is presented for the period commencing 2 January 2016  
and ended 31 December 2016 (‘2016’). 
The Consolidated Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
The Weir Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.  
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented in Sterling. All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds (£m) except where 
otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous period. The following amendment applies for the 
first time in 2017:
Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 7
The amendment requires disclosure of information that will allow users to understand changes in liabilities arising from financing 
activities. This includes changes arising from: cash flows, such as drawdowns and repayments of borrowings; and non-cash 
changes, such as acquisitions, disposals and unrealised exchange differences. Additional disclosure has been included in note 26.
There are no other new standards or interpretations, in addition to the above, which are considered to have a material impact on 
the annual Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its 
subsidiaries, and the Group’s share of results of its joint ventures. For consolidation purposes, subsidiaries and joint ventures 
prepare financial information for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is achieved when the Group is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the investee. The results of a subsidiary acquired during the year are included in the Group’s results from 
the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group. The results of a subsidiary sold during the year are included in the 
Group’s results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group. All intragroup transactions, balances, 
income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and 
are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders’ equity.
A full list of the Company’s related undertakings can be found on page 202.
Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation
In order to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with a more relevant presentation of the Group’s 
underlying performance, on a like for like basis, profit for each period has been analysed between:
i) profit before exceptional items & intangibles amortisation; and 
ii) the effect of exceptional items & intangibles amortisation.
Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and/or infrequency of the events giving 
rise to them, merit separate presentation. These specific items are presented on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement 
to provide greater clarity and a better understanding of the impact of these items on the Group’s financial performance. In doing 
so, it also facilitates greater comparison of the Group’s underlying results with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial 
performance. This split is consistent with how underlying business performance is measured internally.
Exceptional items may include but are not restricted to: profits or losses arising on disposal or closure of businesses; the cost  
of significant business restructuring; significant impairments of intangible or tangible assets; adjustments to the fair value of 
acquisition-related items such as contingent consideration and inventory; other items deemed exceptional due to their significance, 
size or nature; and the related exceptional taxation.
Intangibles amortisation has been shown separately to provide visibility over the ongoing impact on the Group’s Income 
Statement of prior and current period investment activities.
Further analysis of the items included in the column ‘Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation’ is provided in note 5 to the 
financial statements.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017
Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 2. Accounting policies continued
Use of estimates and judgements
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out below. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  
in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and 
estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. 
Management base these judgements on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that  
is relevant to each individual circumstance. Actual results may differ from these judgements and the resulting estimates which 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised.
Areas requiring significant judgement in the current year and on a recurring basis are presented to the Audit Committee,  
as summarised on page 90.
The areas where management consider critical judgements and estimates to be required are those in respect of:
i. Retirement benefits
The assumptions underlying the valuation of retirement benefit assets and liabilities include discount rates, inflation rates and 
mortality assumptions which are based on actuarial advice. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the 
measurement of the Group’s retirement benefit obligations. Sensitivities to changes in key assumptions are provided in note 24.
ii. Provisions
Management judgement is used to determine when a provision is recognised taking into account the commercial drivers which 
gave rise to them, the Group’s previous experience of similar obligations and the progress of any associated legal proceedings. 
The calculation of provisions typically involves management estimates of associated cash flows and discount rates. The key 
provision which currently requires a greater degree of management estimate is the US asbestos provision, details of which are 
included in note 22. 
iii. Taxation
The level of current and deferred tax recognised in the financial statements is dependent on subjective judgements as to  
the interpretation of complex international tax regulations and, in some cases, the outcome of decisions by tax authorities in 
various jurisdictions around the world, together with the ability of the Group to utilise tax attributes within the limits imposed  
by the relevant tax legislation. 
The Group faces a variety of tax risks which result from operating in a complex global environment including the ongoing  
reform of both international and domestic tax rules in some of the Group’s larger markets and the challenge to fulfil ongoing  
tax compliance filing and transfer pricing obligations given the scale and diversity of the Group’s global operations.
The Group makes provision for open tax issues where it is probable that an exposure will arise including, in a number of 
jurisdictions, ongoing tax audits and uncertain tax positions which are by nature complex and can take a number of years to 
resolve. In all cases, provisions are based on management’s interpretation of tax law in each country, as supported, where 
appropriate, by discussion and analysis undertaken by the Group’s external advisers, and reflect the single best estimate of  
the likely outcome for each liability. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are included in current tax liabilities and total £26.6m  
at 31 December 2017.
The Group believes it has made adequate provision for such matters although it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will  
be different from the amounts provided.
The risk that the application of management judgements and estimates in tax provisioning in the financial statements fails to 
present a true and fair view of the tax position is a risk which receives significant focus from management, tax advisers and 
auditors. Actions to mitigate this risk include the following:
i)  The Group has capable people and strong processes and controls in place in order to deliver tax filings and tax payments  
in compliance with local tax requirements. This includes the recruitment and continued training and development of tax  
and finance staff with recognised professional qualifications.
ii)  Local tax systems and controls are monitored by Group management via a compliance scorecard process and any companies 
reporting a sub-standard level of performance are required to prepare and execute improvement plans.
iii)  Regular training is organised by the Group in our key jurisdictions and encouraged elsewhere to ensure we maintain 
appropriate standards of technical competence.
iv)  All personnel involved in filing tax returns are encouraged to share knowledge and seek input on best practice across the Group.
v)  External tax advisers either prepare or review the annual tax provisions and balances and are involved with the identification 
and management of transfer pricing policies and related documentation and filing requirements.
vi)  Standard operating procedures are in place to provide assurance at Group level that tax risks are being adequately managed 
and issues are escalated to Group level as appropriate.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 vii)  The Group tax team provides technical support on the progression and completion of tax audits and the resolution of issues 
raised under audit is handled in an open and collaborative manner.
Detailed tax disclosures are provided in notes 7 and 23.
Joint ventures
The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements which represent joint ventures. The Group’s interests in the 
results and assets and liabilities of its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of 
net assets less any impairment in value. The Consolidated Income Statement reflects the share of results of operations of these 
investments after tax. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investee’s equity, the Group recognises its share 
of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s 
share of the net fair value of the joint venture’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying 
amount of the joint venture and is not amortised. To the extent that the net fair value of the joint venture’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Group’s share 
of the joint venture’s profit or loss in the year in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements for each of the Group’s subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.  
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entity’s functional currency at the exchange 
rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at  
the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income 
Statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the 
Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net 
investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate for the year and  
their assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency translation 
differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the 
foreign currency translation reserve and in other comprehensive income.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is 
determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation. As 
permitted by IFRS 1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be £nil as at 27 December 2003. 
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 
that date.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the average 
exchange rate for the year.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, and to the extent that it is probable that  
the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, 
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. 
i. Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the buyer, usually on despatch of goods, and reliable measurement is possible. No revenue  
is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated 
costs, or the possible return of goods. Transfers of risks and rewards vary depending on the nature of the products sold and  
the individual terms of the contract of sale. Where the sale of a product requires customer inspection, revenue is not recognised 
until the inspection has been completed and approved by the customer.
This policy is applicable to the sale of both original equipment and spare parts, whether sold individually, in bulk or as part of  
a cross-selling marketing strategy.

Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
2. Accounting policies continued
ii. Provision of services
Revenue from the rendering of services is generally recognised on completion if the service contract is short-term in nature. 
Where this is not the case, revenue from services is recognised in proportion to the stage of completion of the service at the 
balance sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the contractual agreement with each separate customer 
and the costs incurred on the contract to date in comparison to the total forecast costs of the contract. Revenue recognition 
commences only when the outcome of the contract can be reliably measured, by reference to individual terms and conditions 
within each service contract, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the contract will flow to the Group. 
iii. Construction contracts 
Construction contracts usually contain discrete elements separately transferring risks and rewards to the customer. The stage of 
completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date 
bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work. The basis 
used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of 
the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures. Losses on contracts are recognised in the year when such losses 
become probable. Construction contracts are primarily entered into by the Group’s ‘Engineer to order’ businesses.
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant & equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses. Freehold  
land and assets under construction are not depreciated. Depreciation of property, plant & equipment is provided on a straight-line 
basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, to the Consolidated Income Statement over the expected useful life of the 
asset concerned, and is in the following ranges:
Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings 10 – 40 years
Short leasehold land & buildings duration of lease
Plant & equipment 3 – 20 years
Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Group’s 
interest in the fair value of the entity’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition. 
Acquisition costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they are incurred. Goodwill in respect 
of an acquired business is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses 
and is tested at least annually or where there are indicators of impairment.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on 
disposal of the unit.
Any contingent consideration is recognised at the date of acquisition or disposal. For acquisitions, subsequent changes to the  
fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period 
adjustments. The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information 
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year. If the change 
does not qualify as a measurement period adjustment, it is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. For disposals, any 
subsequent change in contingent consideration is adjusted against the disposal proceeds and the gain/loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition. An intangible resource acquired in a business 
combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal 
rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably. 
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an  
acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.  
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Brand names indefinite life*
Customer & distributor relationships 5 – 25 years
Purchased software 4 – 8 years
Intellectual property & trademarks 6 – 15 years
Other up to 6 years
*  Acquired brands which are considered to have a finite life are amortised accordingly.
134
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Research & development costs
All research expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which it is incurred unless it relates  
to the development of a new product or technology and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of  
the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the 
Group intends, and has sufficient resources, to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Any such capitalised 
development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over 
the expected life of the resulting product or technology.
Impairment of non-current assets
All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might  
be impaired. Additionally, goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which  
represents the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. An asset’s value in use represents  
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the  
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash generating unit to which it belongs. 
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash 
generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for 
an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount. The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined  
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill  
are not reversed.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items. 
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the  
cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. Raw material cost is generally 
determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities
The Group’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, 
loans and fixed-rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits. The Group also has other financial assets and 
liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations, and contingent consideration  
in relation to acquisitions.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Where an  
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original  
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any  
costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables, which are generally of a short-term nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an 
allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not  
be able to recover balances in full. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents
Cash & cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments 
with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on 
acquisition of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right  
of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.

2. Accounting policies continued
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings
Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured 
initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings  
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the 
Group has an unconditional right to settle the liability at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of  
a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to 
reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements. The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure 
to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage  
its exposure to interest rate risk. The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. 
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based  
on spot and forward foreign exchange rates and counterparty, and the Group’s own, credit risk. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate 
curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty and own credit risk. Changes in their fair values are recognised in the 
Consolidated Income Statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met. 
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS 39 and practical to do so. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net 
investment hedges, as appropriate.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will  
be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be 
recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow or net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, 
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income. When the  
hedged asset or liability is recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised  
in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement or, if the hedged item results  
in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer  
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other 
comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction  
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income, or recognised  
in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their 
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value 
with changes in its fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and as a 
consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards. 
The fair value of the LTIP or other conditional awards at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models 
and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual 
forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions. The conditions of the LTIP which 
took effect in 2014 are summarised in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which can be found on the Company’s website,  
www.corporategovernance.weir.
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken directly to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive 
income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK, US and 
Canada and post-retirement healthcare benefits provided to certain employees in the US.
For defined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected  
unit credit method and is recognised over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice  
of qualified actuaries. Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest  
on the net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the year reflects the net interest on the net pension  
liability. This represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying 
the discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan and the consequent 
reduction in the net liability, during the year.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Actuarial 
gains and losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the 
effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises the net total for each plan of  
the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high 
quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and are denominated in the 
currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. 
The balance sheet asset recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Group expects to recover by 
way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration  
is also given to any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Group’s contributions to the plans and these are charged to the 
Consolidated Income Statement in the year in which they fall due, along with any associated administration costs.
Leases
Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as 
finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant & equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance 
leases. Subsequently, the assets are depreciated over a period consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter. 
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a 
charge to the Consolidated Income Statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future years in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets 
represent tax recoverable in future years in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax  
losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates  
and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the  
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet  
and its tax base with the following exceptions:
i)  Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised;
ii)  Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
iii)  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against  
which the asset can be utilised.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly  
in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
New standards & interpretations
The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the 
following standards, amendments and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after 
the year covered by these financial statements.
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) Effective date for periods commencing
IFRS 9: Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers (including associated amendments*) 1 January 2018
Amendments to IFRS 2: Share-based payments 1 January 2018*
Annual improvements 2014 – 2016 1 January 2018*
IFRIC 22 Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration 1 January 2018*
IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019*
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments 1 January 2019*
* Not yet endorsed for use in the European Union.
The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in 
these financial statements. An impact assessment has been performed for each of the standards, amendments and interpretations 
effective from 1 January 2018, with no significant financial impact being identified. Further details are provided below in relation 
to the two new standards effective from 2018:
i)  IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, introduces new 
rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. The Group has carried out an impact assessment 
which has focused on the areas of classification, measurement and impairment. Internal procedures in these areas have been 
updated as appropriate in response to the new standard. Implementing IFRS 9 is not expected to have a significant impact on 
the financial statements of the Group.
ii)  IFRS 15 is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer.  
The standard permits either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption. The Group intends  
to adopt the full retrospective approach and will restate the 2017 comparative data accordingly in the 2018 Annual Report.  
The Group has completed an extensive impact assessment which included submissions from each reporting entity. Based  
on the assessment performed, it is expected that the new standard will have a limited impact on the results of the Group, 
estimated at less than 1% of Group revenue, with the main change relating to the timing of revenue recognition, either over 
time or point in time for certain ‘Engineer to order’ contracts. 
Initial planning has commenced for an assessment of the impact of the other standards applicable from 2019. 
Non-GAAP measures
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by  
the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. In measuring our performance, 
the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from our reported results in order to eliminate factors 
which we believe distort period-on-period comparisons. These are considered non-GAAP financial measures. This information, 
along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors in providing a basis for measuring our operational performance. 
Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating 
our performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute 
for, financial information in compliance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures as reported by the Group may not be 
comparable with similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.
Below we set out our definitions of non-GAAP measures and provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.

Free cash flow (FCF) is defined as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for income taxes, net capital expenditures,  
net interest payments, dividends paid, settlement of derivatives, purchase of shares for LTIP and other awards and pension 
contributions. FCF reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe is useful to investors as it represents cash 
flows that could be used for repayment of debt or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any. The reconciliation

3. Segment information
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Flow Control. The three 
divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment 
and a reportable segment under IFRS 8. The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed 
by the Chief Executive Officer which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment is the global leader in the provision of slurry handling equipment and associated aftermarket support for 
abrasive high wear applications used in the mining and oil sands markets. The Oil & Gas segment provides products and service 
solutions to upstream, production, transportation and related industries. The Flow Control segment designs and manufactures 
valves and pumps, and provides specialist support services to the global power generation, industrial and oil and gas sectors.
The Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing 
operations before exceptional items (including impairments) and intangibles amortisation (‘segment result’). Finance income  
and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments  
as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function. The amounts provided to the Chief Executive Officer 
with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements. The assets are 
allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset. The liabilities are allocated based on  
the operations of the segment. 
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis, in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The segment information for the reportable segments for 2017 and 2016 is disclosed below.

The decrease in permanent differences from a £9.5m addition in 2016 to a £4.0m deduction in 2017 arises in part from the release 
of tax risk provisions following the resolution of tax authority enquiries in the UK, Canada and the US. Other key movements in 
permanent differences include a credit in relation to non-taxable exchange gains/losses across various jurisdictions, a debit in 
relation to provisions for tax risk including transfer pricing and credit for Research & Development incentives.
The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed on 22 December 2017 and included a broad range of tax reform including a 
reduction in the Federal rate of corporate income tax from 35% to 21% (effective 1 January 2018) as well as significant changes 
to business deductions and other international tax provisions including changes to the rules governing interest deductibility.
US tax reform gives rise to a transitional one-off non-cash tax credit of £22.6m primarily due to the revaluation of the Group’s 
aggregate US deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities following the reduction in the US Federal rate from 35% to 21%.
Finance arrangements are in place to fund the acquisition of business operations in overseas territories. This finance is provided 
primarily to US operations through intragroup loans which provide a benefit to the Group effective tax rate. In addition, the Group 
claims a partial exemption under the UK Controlled Foreign Companies legislation for profits from ‘qualifying loan relationships’. 
The Group is monitoring the developments in relation to EU state aid investigations into this exemption, noting that at this stage 
the final outcome of any investigation is unclear.

In 2016 and 2017, shareholders on record were provided the opportunity to receive dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary 
shares through The Weir Group PLC Scrip Dividend Scheme. Participation in the scheme resulted in a final dividend for 2016 of 
£6.4m share issue and a cash dividend of £56.7m (final dividend for 2015: £29.6m share issue; £32.4m cash). The interim dividend 
for 2017 was split £16.1m share issue and £17.5m cash dividend (interim dividend for 2016: £19.1m share issue; £13.4m cash). 
The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares held, at the date the financial statements 
were approved and authorised for issue. The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in issue 
between the date of approval of this Annual Report and Financial Statements and the record date for the final dividend.
Dividends have been maintained in the year with dividend cover of 1.97 times (2016: 1.39 times) as explained in the Financial Review.

useful life and as such are not amortised. The brand names acquired during 2017 will be amortised fully over the next two years. 
The carrying value of brand names with an indefinite life is tested annually for impairment (note 14). There is no impairment 
charge in the current or prior year. The carrying value at the year end was £223.7m (2016: £241.3m). 
The brand name value includes the brands of Linatex, BDK, Warman, SPM, Gabbioneta, Multiflo, Mathena and Wales, all of

On 27 July 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of KOP Surface Products (KOP), a South Asian provider of advanced 
pressure control wellhead technologies, systems and services for a consideration of $118.0m less cash acquired of $3.9m.  
The acquisition was funded by the issue of shares totalling £90.0m. The provisional fair values, which are subject to finalisation 
during the first half of 2018, are disclosed in the table below.
There are certain intangible assets included in the £51.6m of goodwill recognised that cannot be individually separated and 
reliably measured due to their nature. These items include anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce.

Total cash outflow (note 26) (89.3)
The gross amount and fair value of KOP trade receivables amounts to £10.4m. It is expected that virtually all the contractual 
amounts will be collected.
KOP contributed £13.3m to revenue and an operating loss of £4.3m (including exceptional items and intangibles amortisation)  
in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2017. If the acquisition had occurred at the start of 2017, the revenue and profit  
for the year from acquired operations, after exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, would not have been materially 
different from the results disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement. Acquisition costs totalled £1.5m in the year (note 4).

i) Contingent consideration receivable
The disposal of American Hydro Corporation in 2016 included a final escrow payment of £3.6m due for settlement in 2017. This 
balance was settled during the year with £3.5m cash received and a £0.1m adjustment recorded in discontinued operations. 
An escrow receivable of £0.4m was booked in the year relating to the sale of the joint venture entity, Energy Products LLC (EPI). 
The balance is to be received early 2018.
ii) Contingent consideration payable
The deferred consideration payable in relation to the acquisition of Weir International in 2011 has been settled in the year following 
an agreement being reached to complete the purchase of the remaining minority interest. In 2017 a fair value adjustment of £9.6m 
and an unwind of £0.8m was recorded with payment of the closing deferred consideration in December 2017 to complete the 
purchase of the remaining minority interest for payment proceeds of £36.6m.
The remaining deferred consideration of £1.3m for the 2015 acquisition of Delta Valves was settled in the year. Based on final 
negotiations, £0.8m was paid in cash with the remainder of the balance written off as a fair value adjustment.
The deferred consideration of £0.6m relating to the 2016 purchase of the remaining shareholding of Shengli Oilfield Weir Highland 
Pump Company Ltd (Shengli) was paid during the year. 
There is contingent consideration payable of £3.4m remaining in relation to the 2014 Weir Trio acquisition. This relates to working 
capital balances and is now expected to be finalised in 2018. A reconciliation of fair value measurement of the contingent 
consideration asset and liability is provided above.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 14. Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives
Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to 
cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The Group tests goodwill and intangible 
assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
KOP Surface Products, acquired during 2017 as described in note 13, has been allocated to the Oil & Gas International (formerly 
Oil & Gas EMEA) CGU.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated as per the table below.

Description of CGUs
A description of each of the CGUs is provided below along with a summary of the key drivers of revenue growth and EBITA margin.
Flow Control
Flow Control includes the Gabbioneta brand. Flow Control is a supplier of highly engineered pumps, valves and associated 
aftermarket services to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries. The key drivers for revenues are 
capital expenditure within oil refinery, petro-chemical industries and power generation. Independent forecasts of expenditure in 
these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during the 
final quarter of 2017.
Minerals
Minerals includes the Weir Warman, Weir Linatex and Weir Trio brands. Weir Minerals companies supply pumps and associated 
equipment and services to all global mining markets. The key drivers for revenues are: (i) levels of mining capital expenditure 
which drives demand for original equipment; and (ii) levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and 
service. Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. 
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2017. 
Oil & Gas International
Oil & Gas International comprises multiple service centre locations within the Middle East and Europe and the recently acquired 
wellhead locations across a number of countries in Asia Pacific. The service centre locations supply services including repair, 
manufacture and certification of oilfield equipment, to a diverse portfolio of customers. The Asia Pacific location supplies surface 
wellheads, surface trees, valves and actuators as well as providing support to customers including installation, maintenance, 
rental and refurbishment services. The key drivers for revenues are oil and natural gas prices. Independent forecasts of these 
commodity prices have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions. These independent forecasts were prepared during 
the final quarter of 2017.
Oil & Gas North America
Oil & Gas North America includes the Weir SPM, Weir Seaboard and Weir Mathena brands. This CGU is a supplier of oil and gas 
well service pumps, wellhead solutions, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry. 
Demand in Oil & Gas North America is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas 
well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels. Independent forecasts 
of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, 
have been used during the final quarter of 2017 to derive revenue growth assumptions.

Discount rate 
  The pre-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the basis for the discount rate, with adjustments made, as appropriate, for geographic risk. 
The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance. During the year, there have been changes in 
the bond yields, equity market risk premium and industry asset beta, which have led to a decrease in the overall discount rate for the majority of countries. 
2
 
Real growth 
  Real growth beyond the five year forecast period has been held consistent with the prior year at 1.2% (2016: 1.2%), reflecting the increasingly global nature 
of these businesses, the long-term growth prospects in their end markets and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging 
markets which also have strong long-term growth prospects.
EBITA margins
EBITA margins have been forecast based on historical levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic 
environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues, and the impact of associated management actions.
Impairment testing and sensitivity analysis
Base case forecasts for all CGUs show significant headroom above carrying value. No sensitivity analysis has been undertaken as 
there is no reasonable possible change in key assumptions that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.

Warranties & onerous sales contracts
Provision has been made in respect of actual warranty and contract penalty claims on goods sold and services provided and 
allowance has been made for potential warranty claims based on past experience for goods and services sold with a warranty 
guarantee. It is expected that all costs related to such claims will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Provision has been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where 
the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received 
from the contracts. Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected 
benefits of the contract. It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Asbestos-related claims
Certain of the Group’s US-based subsidiaries are co-defendants in lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are 
claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to products previously manufactured which contained asbestos. The Group has 
comprehensive insurance cover for cases of this nature with all claims directly managed by the Group’s insurers who also meet 
associated defence costs. The insurers and their legal advisers agree and execute the defence strategy between them. There  
are currently no related cash flows to or from the Group, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. 
There remains inherent uncertainty associated with estimating future costs in respect of asbestos-related diseases. Actuarial 
estimates of future indemnity and defence costs associated with asbestos-related diseases are subject to significantly greater 
uncertainty than actuarial estimates for other types of exposure. This uncertainty results from factors that are unique to the 
asbestos claims litigation and settlement process including but not limited to: 
i) The possibility of future state or federal legislation applying to claims for asbestos-related diseases; 
ii) The ability of the plaintiff’s bar to develop and sustain new legal theory and/or develop new populations of claimants; 
iii) Changes in focus of the plaintiff’s bar; 
iv) Changes in the Group’s defence strategy; and 
v) Changes in the financial condition of other co-defendants in suits naming the Group and affiliated businesses.
162
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 A review of both the Group’s expected liability for US asbestos-related diseases and the adequacy of the Group’s insurance 
policies to meet future settlement and defence costs was completed in conjunction with external advisers. The exercise  
was originally completed in 2014 and has been repeated in 2017 as part of our planned triennial actuarial update. This review 
estimated future claims experience based on an industry standard epidemiological decay model and Weir’s claims settlement 
history. Due to the inherent uncertainty resulting from the changing nature of the US litigation environment as outlined above,  
and in conjunction with the actuarial review, the Directors consider 10 years (2016: 10 years) of projected claims to provide  
a reliable estimate of the future liability. A provision of £53.3m represents the Directors’ best estimate of the future liability, 
although these estimates and the period over which they are assessed will continue to be refined as the claims history develops. 
Confirmation was also received from external advisers that the insurance asset remains sufficient to match the Directors’ best 
estimate of the future liability and therefore a corresponding asset continues to be recognised for insurance proceeds (note 17). 
There can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual 
costs that may be incurred. Sensitivity analysis has been conducted which involved:
i) Increasing/decreasing the number of projected future settled claims and estimated settlement value by 10%; or
ii) Increasing/decreasing the basis of provision by two years.
Application of these sensitivities would not lead to a material change in the provision.
In the UK, there are outstanding asbestos-related claims which are not the subject of insurance cover. The extent of the UK 
asbestos exposure involves a series of legacy employers liability claims which all relate to former UK operations and employment 
periods in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1989 the Group’s employer’s liability insurer (Chester Street Employers Association Ltd)  
was placed into run-off which effectively generated an uninsured liability exposure for all future long tail disease claims with an 
exposure period pre-dating 1 January 1972. All claims with a disease exposure post 1 January 1972 are fully compensated via  
the Government established Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Any settlement to a former employee whose 
service period straddles 1972 is calculated on a pro rata basis. The Group provides for these claims based on management’s  
best estimate of the likely costs given past experience of the volume and cost of similar claims brought against the Group.
The UK provision was reviewed and adjusted accordingly for claims experience in the year, resulting in a provision of £4.7m  
(2016: £5.2m). 
Employee-related
Employee-related provisions arise from legal obligations, the majority of which relate to compensation associated with periods  
of service.
Exceptional rationalisation
Restructuring and rationalisation charges led to additions of £7.3m (2016: £63.0m) during the year which related to continued 
costs from 2016 restructuring projects and additional costs of £2.1m as a result of an extension of a prior period legal claim.
During 2017, a transfer has been made from exceptional rationalisation to the warranties and onerous sales contract provision. 
Included in the utilisation of the exceptional rationalisation provision in the year is non-cash utilisation items of £4.2m which led  
to a cash outflow of £28.6m.
Other
Other provisions relate to penalties, duties due, legal claims and other exposures across the Group.

Untaxed reserves primarily relate to temporarily disallowed inventory/receivable provisions and accruals/provisions for liabilities 
where the tax allowance is deferred until the cash expense occurs. In relation to the untaxed reserves, £34.7m relates to carried 
forward interest deductions in the US. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the US on 22 December 2017 maintained the rule 
which allows surplus interest expenses to be carried forward indefinitely to be used against future earnings. Forecasts have been 
prepared which indicate that this interest will be able to be substantially offset by 2022; therefore, it is considered appropriate to 
continue to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of this amount.
Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of £18.2m (2016: £11.5m) have not been recognised on the grounds that there is 
insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable. These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient 
to absorb these tax benefits. Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to £5.9m (2016: £4.2m) have not 
been recognised, but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Temporary differences associated with Group investments
A deferred tax liability of £15.1m (2016: £23.1m) has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the  
South American and Canadian subsidiaries and the unremitted earnings of the Canadian subsidiary of the US subgroup. As  
at 31 December 2017, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group 
does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal  
of deferred tax. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred 
tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to £1,971.9m (2016: £1,986.6m).
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
UK Corporation tax rate changes
Legislation was enacted on 26 October 2015 such that the main rate of UK corporation tax has been 19% since April 2017 and 
will be 17% from April 2020. Consequently, UK deferred tax has been provided at the prevalent rates during the periods in which 
the UK temporary differences are expected to unwind. As a result, deferred tax has been provided on UK temporary differences 
at 17.8% (2016: 17.8%).
24. Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans
The Group has four main defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America. All defined benefit plans are closed to new 
members. The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two funded UK plans.
UK plans
The Group has two funded defined benefit plans (the Main Plan and the Executive Plan) and an unfunded retirement benefit plan 
for retired executive directors. The Group also operates a defined contribution plan, the contributions to which are in addition to 
those set out below, and are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement. 
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary. The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits 
effective from 30 June 2015. 
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 17 years and from the Executive 
Plan is around 14 years. 
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits. The Main Plan holds 
two insurance policies which match the liabilities in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners. The 
Executive Plan entered into an insurance contract in 2017 which matches the liabilities of the plan in full. 
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the pension scheme Trustees and Group to agree upon the assumptions underlying 
the funding target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date. There 
is a risk to the Group that adverse experience against these assumptions could lead to a requirement for the Group to make 
considerable contributions to recover any deficit. This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan and the Executive Plan 
through the insurance policies held.
North American plans
The Group also sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the US and Canada and certain unfunded post-
employment healthcare benefits for senior employees in the US. 
These plans combined make up 3% of the Group’s pension and other post-employment benefit plan commitments and 2% of 
the Group’s total associated assets.
The weighted average duration of these plans is around 10 years.

The assumptions used to determine end-of-year benefit obligations are also used to calculate the following year’s cost.  
For North America, weighted average assumptions are shown where applicable.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases in longevity. The ‘current’ disclosures above relate  
to assumptions based on longevity (in years) following retirement at the balance sheet date, with ‘future’ being that relating  
to a member retiring in 2038 (in 20 years’ time).

The government bonds held at 31 December 2017 are all index-linked (2016: included 7% fixed interest government bonds).  
The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Group’s own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets  
used by the Group. 
In the UK, where the majority of the Group’s pension assets are held, the investment strategy is to hold equities and other 
return-seeking assets, such as diversified growth funds and a mixture of bonds, to meet the assessed value of the benefits 
promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners. For the remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently 
receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance policies and suitable bonds.

Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and interest on net pension liability is 
recognised in finance costs. 
A past service credit of £3.5m arose in 2017 in relation to certain members opting for a different benefit structure in one of the 
Group’s US post-retirement medical arrangements. 
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations using 
the projected unit method. The Group made special contributions of £3.0m in 2017 (2016: £2.8m) in addition to the Group’s 
regular contributions. 
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 
£65.0m. Under the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, the Group entered into a pension funding partnership structure  
under which it will contribute interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) for the Main Plan. The Main Plan’s interests in  
the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on an IAS 19 
accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for IAS 19 purposes. As a partner in the SLP, the Main Plan  
is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years, subject to conditions being met. The profits  
to be shared with the Plan will be reflected in the Group’s financial statements as a pension contribution. 
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of £10.6m with agreed recovery 
contributions of £2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017. The Trustees of the UK Executive Scheme entered into a full buy-in 
transaction in the third quarter of 2017, meaning all of the benefit payments due from the Executive Scheme are now covered  
by an insurance policy. There remains an outstanding premium payment (estimated to be £1.2m), which is expected to be paid  
in 2018 following a data cleanse process to finalise the insurance policy. The IAS 19 Balance Sheet at the 2017 year end reflects 
this expected payment due. 
The Group has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 and the 
current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a surplus in 2016 and also recognition of a minimum 
funding requirement. This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the Balance Sheet and that recognition of a surplus in 
2016 was appropriate on the basis that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of a current (or projected future) surplus at 
some point in the future. For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Group to adjust the Balance Sheet to recognise the 
future agreed deficit recovery contributions. Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input received and noting 
that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the schemes without cause, 
the Directors of the Group have concluded that the Group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus. Amendments to 
the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered. 
The total Group contributions for 2018 (including those expected from the SLP in the UK) are expected to be £6.2m.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Sensitivity analysis

 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change (14.0) 14.0 (15.5) 15.5
The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held. In the absence of such policies, 
the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown  
in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation  
and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. In practice, for example, a change in discount rate  
is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested (non-insurance policy) assets held by the plans.

Employee share plans
Under the Group’s LTIP 2014 Rules the types of awards which may be granted under this Plan to employees include: Performance 
shares, Restricted shares and Bonus shares. Details of each award are outlined in the Remuneration Report on pages 95 to 115.
One-off conditional share awards are also occasionally granted to employees. These transactions fall under the scope of IFRS 2 
and are treated in line with awards issued under the Group’s LTIP.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 The fair value at date of grant of the conditional awards under the LTIP has been independently estimated based on the  
type of award: 
i) Restricted shares
The grant date fair value of these awards is calculated as the share price at the date of grant less an adjustment for loss  
of reinvestment return on the dividend equivalent. There are no performance conditions attached to these awards. 
The fair value of occasional one-off conditional awards at grant date is also estimated on this basis.
ii) Performance shares
The grant date fair value of the performance share awards subject to the EPS and ROCE performance targets is calculated in  
the same way as the restricted share awards except that a discount of 11% is applied to reflect the holding period which applies 
to these awards. The EPS and ROCE performance targets are ‘non market’ vesting conditions for the purpose of IFRS 2 and so 
their effect is not allowed for in the grant date fair values.
The valuation of performance share awards subject to the TSR-related performance targets is performed using a Monte Carlo 
simulation model. The following table gives the assumptions made during the periods ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 
2016 in the calculation of the fair value of awards subject to the TSR-related performance targets made in those years.
2017 2016
Weighted average expected volatility (%) 37 .00 37 .00
Weighted average expected life (years) 3.00 3.00
Weighted average risk free rate (%) 0.30 0.70
Weighted average share price (£) 18.58 12.13
Weighted average fair value (£) 8.17 5.84
The expected life of the awards is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may  
occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends which may also  
not necessarily be the actual outcome. Market-related performance conditions have been taken into account in the calculation  
of fair values.
Bonus shares
Under the Group’s annual bonus plan, Executive Directors and members of the Group Executive typically receive 30% of any 
bonus deferred into an award of Weir Group shares which will normally be released after three years. These awards are entitled 
to accrue the value of the dividends payable on any deferred bonus awards during the three year holding period.
The LTIP bonus shares are administered by the Estera EBT. The shares are acquired on market at the grant date and are held  
in the Estera EBT until such time as they are vested. Forfeited shares are reallocated in subsequent grants. Under the terms  
of the Trust Deed, Weir Group is required to provide the Estera EBT with the necessary funding for the acquisition of the shares 
at the time of the grant.
The number of shares to be granted is determined based on the applicable annual bonus divided by the price at which the 
Company’s shares are traded at the date of the grant. In 2017, 15,242 shares were awarded (2016: 9,338).
The fair value of the rights at grant date was estimated using the market price of the Company’s shares on that date.

*  The fair value of cash & short-term deposits, trade & other receivables and trade & other payables approximates their carrying amount due to the short-term 
maturities of these instruments. As such, disclosure of the fair value hierarchy for these items is not required.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1:  quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either  
directly or indirectly;
Level 3:  techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable 
market data. 
At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 the Group has classified contingent consideration as level 3. A reconciliation  
of the movements in the contingent consideration fair value has been included in note 13.
During the periods ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2  
fair value measurements and no transfers into or out of level 3 fair value measurements.

Offsetting
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet where the Group currently has a legal 
right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.
As at 31 December 2017, cash & short-term deposits of £284.6m (2016: £258.6m) and current interest bearing loans & 
borrowings of £388.4m (2016: £144.0m) were presented after elimination of debit and credit balances within individual pools  
of £1.3m (2016: £2.3m).
The Group has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts  
to be offset in specific circumstances. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had derivative financial instruments of £10.2m which 
were subject to master netting arrangements but not offset.
C. Hedging activities
The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments in either cash flow hedging or net investment hedging relationships 
in accordance with IAS 39.

The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 D. Financial risk management 
Financial risk management of the Group is carried out by Group Treasury in conjunction with individual subsidiaries. The principal 
financial risks to which the Group is exposed are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Market risk
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business.
i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group is exposed to both transactional and translational foreign exchange risk. Transactional risk arises when subsidiaries 
enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency for operational or financing purposes  
or when the Group’s Treasury function enters into transactions for financing or risk management purposes. Translational risk 
arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into Sterling for consolidated reporting purposes. Foreign  
currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on 
material committed foreign currency transactions, usually by entering into forward foreign currency contracts through the  
Group’s Treasury function. Certain operating units apply cash flow hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39. The Group  
does not engage in any speculative foreign exchange transactions.
The Group has material foreign investments in the US, Australia, Europe and South Africa. In respect of translational risk,  
the Group has a policy of partially hedging its net investment exposure to US Dollar (US$), Australian Dollar (AUD), Euro (EUR) 
and South African Rand (ZAR) denominated subsidiaries. This is achieved through designating an element of foreign currency 
borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Group’s 
investments. The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Sensitivity to foreign exchange rates
The Group considers the most significant transactional foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian Dollar, Euro and US Dollar. 
The following table shows the impact of movements in derivative valuation as a result of a weakening of these currencies. In  
the Consolidated Income Statement, these amounts are offset by the retranslation of foreign currency denominated receivables 
and payables.

The Group is also exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as a result of its global operations and therefore the earnings  
of the Group will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates in relation to Sterling. The Group’s operating profit from 
continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation was denominated in the following currencies.

Operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items & intangibles amortisation 291.8 214.0
ii) Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings. Changes in interest rates will affect future interest cash 
flows on floating rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
The earnings of the Group are sensitive to changes in interest rates in respect of floating rate borrowings. As at 31 December 
2017, 26% of the Group’s borrowings were at floating interest rates. The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest bearing 
borrowings was as follows.

Other – (0.2) (0.2) – – –
Sensitivity to interest rates
Based on borrowings at 31 December 2017, a 1% increase in interest rates would have a £2.9m impact on the profit before tax 
and amortisation of the Group. This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year and that 
all other variables are constant throughout the year.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in 
place to meet possible downside scenarios. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and 
flexibility through the use of fixed rate loan notes, bank loans, commercial paper and bank overdrafts. Further details of the 
Group’s borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20.

Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties to its derivative 
financial instruments.
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and 
customers, with no significant concentration of risk. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of 
trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. In certain circumstances, operating entities are permitted  
to make use of invoice discounting facilities to reduce counterparty credit risk. In addition, applicable creditworthiness checks  
are undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with customers and credit limits are set as 
appropriate and enforced. As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of 
allowance for doubtful debts. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of amounts due to the Group.
The Group’s exposure to the credit risk of financial instruments is limited by the adherence to counterparty credit limits, and by 
only trading with counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating or better at contract inception, based upon ratings 
provided by the major credit rating agencies. Exposures to those counterparties are regularly reviewed and, when the market 
view of a counterparty’s credit quality changes, adjusted as considered appropriate.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the financial assets of the Group.

31. Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support 
its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or 
adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue 
new shares. The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Net debt to EBITDA cover
Net debt to EBITDA comprises net debt divided by operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items, 
intangibles amortisation and depreciation. 
The Group’s banking arrangements include bi-annual financial covenants of net debt to EBITDA (not greater than 3.5) and interest 
cover (not less than 3.5). For the purposes of the covenants required by the Group’s lenders, the net debt is to be converted at 
the exchange rate used in the preparation of the Group’s income statement and cash flows, i.e. average rate. In addition, results 
of businesses acquired in the financial year have to be included as if the acquisitions occurred at the start of the financial year, 
while the results of businesses disposed of in the year are to be excluded.
The Group considers that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA is the key metric from a capital management perspective and seeks  
to maintain the ratio below two times. Given the recent downturn in oil and gas markets, the metric is currently 2.5 times but  
is on a downward trajectory and remains actively managed.

Net debt at average exchange rates (£m) 873.7 758.3
Operating profit (£m) 218.2 90.3

Depreciation and intangibles amortisation (£m) 115.4 106.5
EBITDA (£m) 346.9 269.9
Net debt to EBITDA cover (ratio) 2.5 2.8
Interest cover
Interest cover comprises operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation 
divided by net finance costs (excluding exceptional items and other finance costs).

Operating profit before exceptional items & intangibles amortisation (£m) 286.9 214.0
Net finance costs (excluding exceptional items and other finance costs) (£m) 38.0 40.7
Interest cover (ratio) 7.6 5.3
Gearing ratio
Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises cash & short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans & 
borrowings (note 26).

1. Accounting policies
Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance
The Company Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC (the ‘Company’) for the year ended 31 December 2017 (‘2017’)  
were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 28 February 2018. The comparative 
information is presented for the period commencing 2 January 2016 and ended 31 December 2016 (‘2016’). 
The Weir Group PLC is a public limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Company Financial Statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historic  
cost convention and in accordance with FRS 101 and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.  
The following disclosure exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been consistently applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:
i)  Disclosures required by paragraphs 45(b) and 46-52 of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’ can be found in note 28 to the Group 
financial statements;
ii)  IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ exemption has been taken as a result of the disclosures in note 30 to the Group 
financial statements;
iii)  IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’;
iv)  Disclosure of key management compensation as required by paragraph 17 of IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’; 
v)  Disclosure of related party transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries as required by IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’; and
vi)  Paragraph 10(d), paragraph 10(f), and paragraphs 134-136, of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’.
The Company is the parent of the Weir Group PLC. Its principal activity is to act as a holding company for the Group and perform 
the head office function.
Use of estimates & judgements
The Company’s significant accounting policies are set out below. The preparation of the Company financial statements, in 
conformity with FRS 101, requires management to make judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and 
estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. 
Management base these judgements and estimates on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and  
other evidence that is relevant to each individual circumstance. Actual results may differ from these judgements and estimates 
which are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate  
is revised and in any future periods affected.
The area where management consider the more complex judgements and estimates are required is in respect of retirement 
benefits. The assumptions underlying the valuation of retirement benefit assets and liabilities include discount rates, inflation  
rates and mortality assumptions which are based on actuarial advice. Changes in these assumptions could have a material  
impact on the measurement of the Company’s retirement benefit obligations. Sensitivities to changes in key assumptions are 
provided in note 8.
Foreign currency translation
The presentational and functional currency of the Company is Sterling. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into the Company’s functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date. Currency 
translation differences are recognised in the Income Statement. 
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant & equipment is presented at historical cost.
Depreciation of property, plant & equipment is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value to the 
Income Statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, and is in the following ranges:
Long leasehold land & buildings 20 years 
Office & computer equipment 3 – 10 years
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
The expected useful lives of acquired intangible assets are as follows:
Purchased software  4 – 8 years
188
The Weir Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method.
Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to certain current and former employees in the UK.
For defined benefit pension plans, the annual service cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised 
over the future service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. Current service cost 
and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and net interest on net pension liability is recognised in finance costs.
The finance cost recognised in the Income Statement in the year reflects the net interest on the net pension liability. This 
represents the change in the net pension liability resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the  
discount rate to the opening net liability, taking into account employer contributions paid into the plan, and hence reducing  
the net liability, during the year.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Actuarial gains and 
losses, which represent differences between interest on the plan assets, experience on the benefit obligation and the effect  
of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in Other Comprehensive Income in the year in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the Balance Sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of 
the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on yields at the balance sheet date on appropriate high quality corporate bonds 
that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company’s obligations and are denominated in the currency in which  
the benefits are expected to be paid, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date. The Balance Sheet 
amount recognised is limited to the present value of economic benefits which the Company expects to recover by way of refunds 
or a reduction in future contributions. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is also given to 
any minimum funding requirements.
For defined contribution plans, the cost represents the Company’s contributions to the plans and these are charged to the 
Income Statement in the year in which they fall due.
Share-based payments
Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and as a 
consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to employees. 
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting 
period due to failure to satisfy service or performance conditions.
Financial assets & liabilities
The Company’s principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, 
loans and fixed rate notes, commercial paper, cash and short-term deposits. The Company also has other financial assets and 
liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Where an  
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an  
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original  
liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any  
costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure  
to exchange rate movements. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets or liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.  
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based  
on spot and forward foreign exchange rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the 
present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves, spot foreign exchange rates and counterparty  
and own credit risk. Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the Income Statement.

1. Accounting policies continued
Treasury shares
The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders’ equity as treasury shares and are recognised at 
cost. Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds 
from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the total comprehensive 
income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Taxation
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Balance Sheet 
and its tax base with the following exceptions:
i)  Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
ii)  A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets 
represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax 
losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred  
tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Income Statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised directly in equity.

In 2016 and 2017, shareholders on record were provided the opportunity to receive dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary 
shares through The Weir Group PLC Scrip Dividend Scheme. Participation in the Scheme resulted in a final dividend for 2016 of 
£6.4m share issue and a cash dividend of £56.7m (final dividend for 2015: £29.6m share issue; £32.4m cash). The interim dividend 
for 2017 was split £16.1m share issue and £17.5m cash dividend (interim dividend for 2016: £19.1m share issue; £13.4m cash). 
The proposed dividend is based on the number of shares in issue, excluding treasury shares held, at the date the financial statements 
were approved and authorised for issue. The final dividend may differ due to increases or decreases in the number of shares in 
issue between the date of approval of this Annual Report and Financial Statements and the record date for the final dividend.

8. Retirement benefits
The Company has two funded defined benefit plans (the Main Plan and the Executive Plan) and an unfunded retirement benefit 
plan for retired directors. The Company also operates a defined contribution plan. Contributions to the defined contribution 
arrangement are in addition to those set out below and are charged directly to the income statement. 
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are related to service and final salary. The Main Plan closed to future accrual of benefits 
effective from 30 June 2015.
The weighted average duration of the expected benefit payments from the Main Plan is around 17 years and from the Executive 
Plan it is around 14 years.
The current funding target for the UK plans is to maintain assets equal to the value of the accrued benefits. The Main Plan holds 
insurance policies in respect of a significant proportion of deferred and retired pensioners. The Executive Plan entered into an 
insurance contract in 2017 which will match the liabilities of the plan in full.
The regulatory framework in the UK requires the Trustees and Company to agree upon the assumptions underlying the funding 
target, and then to agree upon the necessary contributions required to recover any deficit at the valuation date. There is a risk  
to the Company that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Company to make considerable contributions  
to recover any deficit. This risk is significantly reduced for the Main Plan through the insurance policies held by the Plan.
Assumptions
The significant actuarial assumptions used for accounting purposes reflect prevailing market conditions and are as follows:
2017 2016
Significant actuarial assumptions:
Discount rate (% pa) 2.4 2.6
Retail Prices Inflation assumption (% pa) 3.2 3.3
Post-retirement mortality (life expectancies in years):
 Current pensioners at 65 – male 22.1 22.2
 Current pensioners at 65 – female 24.0 24.3

The government bonds held in 2017 are all index-linked. The pension plans have not directly invested in any of the Company’s 
own financial instruments, or in properties or other assets used by the Company.
The investment strategy for the UK is to hold equities and other return-seeking assets such as diversified growth funds and  
a mixture of bonds to meet the assessed value of the benefits promised for the non-insured deferred pensioners. For the 
remaining deferred pensioners and the bulk of pensioners currently receiving their benefit, the liabilities are backed by insurance 
policies and suitable bonds.
The change in net liabilities recognised in the Balance Sheet is comprised as follows.

Current service cost and administration expenses are recognised in operating costs and interest on net pension liability is 
recognised in other finance costs. 
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of regular valuations  
using the projected unit method. The Company made special contributions of £2.0m in 2017 (2016: £2.4m) in addition to the 
Company’s regular contributions. 
The most recent actuarial funding valuation of the Main Plan was as at 31 December 2014 when the funding shortfall was 
£65.0m. Under the recovery plan agreed with the Trustees, the Company entered into a pension funding partnership structure 
under which it contributed interests in a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) for the Main Plan. The Main Plan’s interests in  
the SLP will reduce the deficit on a funding basis, although the agreement will not affect the position directly on a FRS 101 
accounting basis as the investments held do not qualify as assets for FRS 101 purposes. As a partner in the SLP, the Main  
Plan is entitled to receive a share of the profits of the SLP once a year for 15 years. The profits to be shared with the Plan  
will be reflected in the Company’s financial statements as a pension contribution.
The Executive Plan actuarial valuation at 31 December 2013 included a funding shortfall of £10.6m with agreed recovery 
contributions of £2.4m per annum to 31 December 2017. The Trustees of the UK Executive Scheme entered into a full buy-in 
transaction in the third quarter of 2017, meaning all of the benefit payments due from the Executive Scheme are now covered  
by an insurance policy. There remains an outstanding premium payment (estimated to be £1.2m), which is expected to be paid  
in 2018 following a data cleanse process to finalise the insurance policy. The FRS 101 Balance Sheet at the 2017 year end reflects 
this expected payment due.
The Company has taken legal advice regarding its UK arrangements to confirm the accounting treatment under IFRIC 14 and the 
current exposure draft of the revised IFRIC 14 with regard to recognition of a current surplus and also recognition of a minimum 
funding requirement. This confirmed that there is no requirement to adjust the Balance Sheet and that recognition of a current 
surplus is appropriate on the basis that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of a current (or projected future) 
surplus at some point in the future. For the same reason, there is no requirement for the Company to adjust the Balance Sheet  
to recognise the future agreed deficit recovery contributions. Having considered the position, taking account of the legal input 
received and noting that the Trustees of the UK arrangements do not have discretionary powers to unilaterally wind up the 
schemes without cause, the Directors of the Company have concluded that the Company has an unconditional right to a refund 
of any surplus. Amendments to the current version of IFRIC 14 are currently being considered. 
The total Company contributions for 2018 (including those expected from the SLP) are expected to be £4.3m.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 Sensitivity analysis
Changes in key assumptions can have a significant effect on the reported net retirement benefit obligation and the income 
statement expense for 2018. The effects of changes in those assumptions are set out in the table below.

 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change 103.0 (129.5) 106.6 (133.3)
RPI inflation (and associated assumptions)
 Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1.0% change (95.8) 87 .3 (90.3) 82.8
 Effect on net liability of a 1.0% change (62.2) 56.0 (64.2) 58.1

 Effect on defined benefit obligation of a 1 year change (28.0) 28.0 (28.1) 28.1
 Effect on net liability of a 1 year change (12.8) 12.8 (14.1) 14.1
The impact on the net liability is significantly reduced as a result of the insurance policies held. In the absence of such policies, 
the impact on the net liability would be much closer to the significantly higher impact on the defined benefit obligation shown  
in the table.
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation and net liability in isolation  
and assume no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. In practice, for example, a change in discount rate  
is unlikely to occur without any movement in the value of the invested (non-insurance policy) assets held by the plans.
Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are analysed as follows.

Guarantees
The Company has given guarantees in relation to the bank and other borrowings of certain subsidiary companies amounting  
to £628.7m (2016: £616.6m). These guarantees are treated as contingent liabilities until it becomes probable they will be called 
upon. The likelihood of the guarantees being called upon is considered remote. 
Legal claims
The Company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal 
course of business. Provisions have been made where the Directors have assessed that a cash outflow is likely and they believe 
all other claims are remote.
16. Related party disclosures

taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008 and has, therefore, 
not appended the accounts of this qualifying partnership to these financial statements. Separate accounts for the partnership are 
not required to be, and have not been, filed at Companies House in the UK.

IMPORTANT – Future Payment of Dividends – Mandatory Direct Credit
From 2019, the Company is simplifying the way in which it pays dividends to shareholders by only paying cash dividends  
directly into a shareholder’s nominated bank account. This is known as Mandatory Direct Credit. The Company will no longer  
be issuing dividend cheques. Shareholders recorded on the register of members as receiving dividend payments by cheque  
will be contacted by Computershare. Those shareholders will need to take the required action by selecting the appropriate  
option as set out in the Computershare notification. 
Shareholders on the register of members who already have their dividends paid by any of the options set out below are not 
required to take any action unless they choose to withdraw from the Company’s Scrip Dividend Scheme (SCRIP). 
 
Direct payment to your bank
The best way to ensure that dividends are received as quickly as possible is to have your dividends paid directly to a UK  
bank or building society account. This is more convenient and helps reduce the risk of cheques becoming lost or delayed in  
the post. To switch to this method of payment you can register online or download a Dividend Mandate Form by selecting 
Downloadable Forms at www.investorcentre.co.uk. The form can also be accessed via the FAQ section on the Company’s 
website at www.global.weir/investors/shareholder-information/shareholders-faq. Alternatively, you can contact Computershare, 
who will also be able to assist with any questions you may have. 
An Annual Dividend Confirmation detailing all payments made throughout the tax year will then be sent to you once a year either 
electronically or to your registered address. In 2018, the Dividend Confirmation will be dispatched with the November 2018 
dividend payment and contain the payment information for dividends paid during the 2018/2019 tax year.
Global Payment Service
If you live overseas, Computershare offers a Global Payment Service which is available in certain countries. This may make it 
possible to receive dividends direct into your bank account in your local currency. Please note that the fees applied for this service 
will be automatically deducted from the proceeds before it is paid to you. For further details go to www.investorcentre.co.uk then 
select the information tab followed by FAQs then select the Dividends and Payments tab and the Global Payment Service tab.
Scrip dividend scheme
Shareholders may elect to participate in the Company’s Scrip Dividend Scheme (SCRIP). The SCRIP provides shareholders  
with the option to receive new fully paid ordinary shares in place of their cash dividend. Shareholders who participate in the 
SCRIP will be able to increase their shareholding in a simple, cost effective way without incurring dealing costs or stamp duty.  
All UK shareholders, including CREST members, can join the SCRIP, although certain restrictions apply to overseas shareholders. 
Holders of the Company’s American Depository Receipts (“ADRs”) are not eligible to join the SCRIP.
The price for the SCRIP dividend will be announced on 3 May 2018. The final date for receipt of SCRIP elections will be  
23 May 2018. The 2017 final dividend will be paid on 4 June 2018.

Dividend tax allowance
Dividend tax credits were replaced in  
April 2016 by an annual £5,000 tax free 
allowance on dividend income across  
an individual’s entire share portfolio. 
Above this amount, individuals will pay 
tax on their dividend income at a rate 
dependent on their income tax bracket 
and personal circumstances. We will 
continue to provide registered shareholders 
with confirmation of the dividends paid 
and this should be included with any  
other dividend income received when 
calculating and reporting total dividend 
income received. It is a shareholder’s 
responsibility to include all dividend 
income when calculating any tax liability.
This provision is enshrined in the Finance 
Act 2016. If you have any tax queries, 
please contact a financial advisor.
United Kingdom capital gains tax
For the purpose of capital gains tax, the 
market value of an ordinary share of The 
Weir Group PLC as at 31 March 1982  
was 29.75p. This market value has been 
adjusted to take account of the sub-
division of the share capital whereby each 
ordinary share of 25p was sub-divided 
into two ordinary shares of 12.5p each on 
28 June 1993. Rights issues of ordinary 
shares took place in April 1987 at 157p 
per share on the basis of one new 
ordinary share for every seven ordinary 
shares held, in July 1990 at 250p per 
share on the basis of one new ordinary 
share for every five ordinary shares held 
and in September 1994 at 252p per share 
on the basis of one new ordinary share  
for every four ordinary shares held.

Shareholder warning alert
Unsolicited investment advice  
and fraud
Many companies have become aware 
that their shareholders have received 
unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. Share 
scams are often run from ‘boiler rooms’ 
where fraudsters cold-call investors 
offering them worthless, overpriced or 
even non-existent shares.
These callers can be very persistent and 
extremely persuasive and their activities 
have resulted in considerable losses  
for some investors. Whilst usually by 
telephone, the high-pressure sales tactics 
can also come by email, post, word of 
mouth or at a seminar. Shareholders are 
advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, 
sell your shares at a premium or offers of 
free company reports.
If you receive any unsolicited  
investment advice:
• Make sure you get the correct name  
of the person and organisation and 
take a note of any other details they 
provide, such as a telephone number 
or address.
• Check that the caller is properly 
authorised by the Financial  
Conduct Authority (FCA) by  
visiting www.fca.org.uk.
• Report any approach from such 
organisations to the FCA using  
the share fraud reporting form at 
www.fca.org.uk/consumers/report-
scam-unauthorised-firm, where you 
can also find out about the latest 
investment scams. You can also  
call the Consumer Helpline on  
0800 111 6768.
• If calls persist, hang up.
Please note that if you deal with an 
unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial 
Services Compensation Scheme.
