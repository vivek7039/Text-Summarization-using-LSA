STRATEGIC REPORT Making good 
progress
Steve Marshall 
Chairman
Strong positive cash 
generation enables us 
to lift our final dividend
Wincanton plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2
STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW OUTLOOK
The Group remains well positioned in its 
chosen markets and continues to perform 
robustly and deliver strong service levels for 
customers. To date the Group has experienced 
no significant impact from the Brexit vote 
in June 2016, and we believe the Group can 
adequately manage any future uncertainty 
that arises during the Brexit process.
Robust cash generation supports limited 
scale investments in skills and technology 
capabilities to both protect and grow the 
business for the longer term without raising 
the Group’s overall risk profile.
During the coming year the Board expect 
Wincanton to make continued progress.
Steve Marshall
Chairman
DIVIDEND 
The Board are pleased to be recommending 
an increased final dividend of 6.1p per Ordinary 
Share for the year ended 31 March 201 7 
(2016: 5.5p). This reflects the Group’s strong 
operating profits and dividend policy outlined 
to shareholders last year when we resumed 
dividend payments. The proposed annual 
dividend is covered 3.0 times by underlying 
earnings. The Board’s progressive dividend 
policy is unchanged.
KEY PRIORITIES AND PROSPECTS
The Group’s overriding priority will be to 
oversee further progress in the delivery of the 
organic growth trading strategy, as set out in 
the Chief Executive’s statement. This requires 
targeted investments in people and processes, 
to extend our capabilities in areas directly 
relevant to customers in our existing contract 
logistics heartland. The Group now has the 
capacity to invest in business development, 
and is actively doing so; but it remains selective 
in its approach, with a risk appetite best 
described as low to moderate.
The Board will also be focused on the 
forthcoming triennial review of the pension 
scheme and in agreeing an appropriate 
future funding plan with the Scheme Trustee. 
The Group still has a sizeable pension deficit, 
and so the pension scheme will remain as a 
significant stakeholder for many years to come.
As already noted, talent management is 
already a key focus, and increasing diversity 
in all its forms will be a priority for the coming 
year, from the warehouse to the boardroom. 
The Board will also ensure that their 
stewardship obligations, not least in the areas 
of operational safety, sustainability and financial 
assurance, remain centre stage and in line with 
best practice.
INTRODUCTION
The year ended 31 March 201 7 represented 
a further year of good progress for Wincanton. 
The focus of the Board and the Executive 
Management Team is on positioning the Group 
to deliver long term organic growth, whilst 
also meeting its obligations to all stakeholders. 
This will be achieved by maintaining and 
deepening strong working partnerships 
with our customers.
The success of an outsourcing business model 
such as ours is driven by providing great 
customer service and value, maintaining high 
levels of contract retention and renewal and by 
securing new contracts to grow the business.
RESULTS
Underlying earnings per share was up by 1 5.9% 
over the prior year to 27 .7p, and has increased 
by 108.3% since the year ended 31 March 201 3. 
Year end net debt at £24.3m (2016: £39.5m) 
was once again reduced, cumulatively a 78.8% 
reduction over the same period. The Group’s 
existing banking facilities were satisfactorily 
extended during the year to provide an 
appropriate level of maturity.
PEOPLE AND THE BOARD
Board membership was unchanged during 
the year. Adrian Colman has continued to 
strengthen the senior management team, 
with a healthy mixture of internal promotions 
and external appointments; broadening 
our talent pool is fundamental to the Group 
delivering on its organic growth strategy 
and meeting customer expectations.
The contribution of the Group’s 1 7 ,500 
employees is once again recognised. 
The Group’s strong reputation for consistent 
operational delivery is above all the product 
of their hard work.

of Group HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
Delivering for our customers
We pride ourselves on fulfilling our existing 
customers’ home delivery needs, alongside 
building solid solutions that allow both 
retailers and consumers to benefit from 
the simplest and most seamless fulfilment 
methods available in today’s market. 
Supported by customer results and reviews 
eg. TrustPilot.
Continuously improving our operations
We have a large continuous improvement 
team, tasked with optimising and improving 
operations. This, coupled with a pro-active 
approach to collaboration, provides a 
realistic and highly valuable benefit for 
customers who are looking to reduce their 
overall cost to serve whilst maintaining high 
service levels.
Evolving our capability
We continue to work with large customers 
to meet their multichannel needs by 
developing smarter and more efficient ways 
of working. We continue to introduce new 
capabilities, for example, the implementation 
of the latest platform edition of Manhattan 
Associates’ Warehouse Management 
System (WMS). Manhattan’s market leading 
multichannel fulfilment solution will provide 
Wincanton and its retail customers with 
a flexible order fulfilment approach that 
delivers an integrated, multichannel buying 
experience for the consumer.
Our multichannel operations 
adapt quickly to changing 
shopping behaviours so that 
our customers can deliver the 
right brand experience
CHALLENGES
Delivering the right brand experience
SALE
Both volume and value of last mile deliveries are increasing as consumers are more 
confident at purchasing goods online. Retailers face the reality of placing their brands 
in the hands of third parties in order to fulfil their customer orders, which requires trust 
and integrity.
Cost to serve 
£
Cost to serve is high on the agenda with retailers continuing to demand better value 
from suppliers. Cost pressures impact all areas of the supply chain and, as margins are 
squeezed, the importance of operational optimisation becomes a central focus point, 
providing much needed areas of cost efficiency.
The customer journey
The ‘customer journey’ continues to be the primary focus for retailers, as the expectation 
of a multichannel experience becomes increasingly embedded in habitual consumer 
behaviour. The increasingly complex supply chain that is being driven as a result of this 
requires pragmatic and well thought through solutions.

HELPING RETAILERS STAY AHEAD
Wincanton’s skills and experience are 
helping retailers rise to the multiple 
challenges of today’s multichannel 
environment. With our support, retailers 
are able to offer faster, more flexible and  
more reliable services, giving consumers  
a seamless logistics supply chain, time  
after time – instore, online and everywhere 
in between.
We have a proud and proven track record 
across every aspect of retail, supporting 
household names, market leaders 
and smaller specialists with a range 
of technologies, services and support 
facilities. Nobody matches our ability to 
plan, schedule and deliver goods safely, 
effectively and efficiently, no matter 
the location. For example, our new 
warehouse management technology 
is giving retailers new capabilities 
in the storage, picking, packing and 
despatching of small orders in particular, 
helping them grow their businesses in 
new and exciting ways. Similarly, the huge 
fund of knowledge we have gained in the 
construction industry is helping retailers 
in the DIY sector improve home deliveries 
of bulky materials.
From collection at the dockside to 
fulfilment, from click and collect to home 
delivery with installation, across every size 
of retailer in every sector, we make sure 
that the consumer experience supports 
the brand promise.

of Group HOW WE ARE RESPONDING
Deploying new developments
We work closely with our suppliers to trial, 
evaluate and deploy new equipment. 
Our examples are wide ranging but include 
investment in new efficient vehicles, 
participation in continued Government 
trials of longer trailers and use of enhanced 
vehicle telematics which pro-actively 
track journeys to promote better 
driving methods and reduce accidents. 
Collectively these initiatives offer lower 
emissions, better efficiency and improved 
safety for our drivers and other road users.
Deploy technology to improve visibility 
and customer service
Whilst our solutions may be customer 
specific we are increasingly adopting a 
common standard across our transport 
operations. Central to this is Winsight, a 
key component of our in-cab technology 
platform. It allows drivers to connect with 
regional planning teams, to create effective 
route planning and provides transparency 
within the current fleet utilisation. The result 
is improved fleet optimisation and better 
visibility of deliveries for customers.
Delivering safety first
We treat health and safety as our number 
one priority and we are committed to 
raising awareness throughout all of our 
driver and warehouse teams. Our focus is 
driving behavioural change where driver 
and warehouse staff are continuously 
developed via training methods designed 
to improve individual skills, providing 
improved and safer performance.
CHALLENGES
Efficient and sustainable operations
Due to persistent cost pressures, coupled with a drive for stronger corporate and 
social responsibility, it is becoming increasingly common for businesses to demand 
more efficient solutions, not only from fuel economy and fleet optimisation, but also 
with a closer focus on sustainability.
Improved visibility and tracking
Shortened delivery timescales alongside fragmented drop locations across some sectors 
is driving the need for customers to have confidence in their logistics partner to deliver 
both accuracy and efficiency within their supply chains. 
Health and safety 
Within a transport and logistics environment health and safety has never been more 
important. Driver health and safety along with the challenges of running large vehicle 
fleets on the public highways are topics at the forefront of supply chain operations. 
This is applicable across Retail & Consumer as well as Industrial & Transport.
We continually develop our 
services to enhance our capability 
and ensure compliance as our 
markets evolve

STRATEGIC REPORT
FEATURE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FROM 
NEW DYNAMICS
We constantly monitor trends across 
all aspects of logistics, identifying 
opportunities where we can exploit 
changing market dynamics.
Ours is a diverse business but although 
we operate across many sectors with 
many different characteristics, our 
experience has revealed that supply 
chains frequently have challenges in 
common. While these challenges may 
present difficulties, they also generate 
opportunities for us to expand into new 
areas. For example, changing dynamics 
in the fuel sector meant that forecourts 
were no longer totally dominated by 
the big brands. Independent forecourt 
retailers now make up a significant market 
share and this has led to an increase in 
demand for more flexible fuel deliveries. 
Our response was the development of 
EnergyLink, a Wincanton-branded flexible 
nationwide fleet of fuel tankers that 
serves forecourts, service stations and 
airports. Customers have bought into the 
strengths and services that EnergyLink 
provides and recent months have seen 
significant expansion.
We apply this same flexible, entrepreneurial 
approach to all sectors, including 
construction where we have over 70  
ready-mix vehicles delivering to construction 
sites and individuals across the UK and we 
are currently exploring options in adjacent 
markets, such as bitumen.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The Group continues to 
perform robustly and 
deliver strong service 
levels for customers The year ended 31 March 201 7 has been 
another year of good progress and strong 
trading performance, securing important 
renewals and winning new contracts with 
new services and new customers. 
Revenue in the year ended 31 March 201 7 was 
£1,1 18.1m (2016: £1,1 32.5m excluding WRM), 
which represents a year on year decrease of 
1.3%. This has been driven primarily by the full 
year impact of contracts exited in the prior 
year, including all closed book home shopping 
contracts in Pullman, partly offset by revenue 
from contract wins.
Underlying operating profit grew by 7 .0% 
to £52.1m (2016: £48.7m excluding WRM), 
reflecting a continued strong operating and 
financially disciplined performance across 
the business, including an improvement in 
the performance of the Pullman business 
following the exit of loss-making contracts in 
the prior year. As a result we have achieved 
an underlying operating margin of 4.7%, up 
from 4.3% (excluding WRM) in the prior year.
Underlying EPS grew a healthy 1 5.9% and 
supports the growth in final dividend per share 
to 6.1p, resulting in a total 9.1p for the year.

Group underlying EPS
Following the disposal of Wincanton Records 
Management (WRM) in December 201 5, 
the Group has, with effect from 1 April 2016, 
refocused its internal management structure 
under the following two reportable segments; 
Retail & Consumer and Industrial & Transport. 
Segmental information for the year ended 
31 March 2016 has been realigned to aid 
comparability, and in line with management 
reporting, the results of WRM have been 
excluded from the results of the reportable 
segments in the prior year.
RETAIL & CONSUMER
2017 2016 Change
Revenue (£m) 649.3 624.4 4.0%
Underlying 
operating profit (£m) 25.8 25.2 2.4%
Margin (%) 4.0% 4.0% nil bps
Retail & Consumer reported revenues of 
£649.3m in the year, a 4.0% year on year 
increase compared with the £624.4m reported 
in the year to 31 March 2016. The contractual 
split of this segment between open and closed 
book remains relatively constant at 87% open 
book (2016: 90%).
Underlying operating profit for the year was 
£25.8m, up 2.4% on the £25.2m reported 
last year.
The split of Retail & Consumer revenue by the 
industry sectors it serves is as follows:
2017  
£m
2016
£m Change
Retail general 
merchandise 315.5 278.2 13.4%
Retail grocery 228.7 234.7 (2.6)%
Consumer products 105.1 111.5 (5.7)%
649.3 624.4 4.0%
The overall revenue increase was driven 
primarily by the impact of contract wins and 
strong volume growth with Home & DIY 
business customers, reported within Retail 
general merchandise. This growth was partly 
offset by the impact of lost volumes due 
to contract cessations in Retail grocery and 
Consumer products.
The business successfully renewed a number 
of important contracts and extended the 
services with key customers, such as Co-op 
providing food distribution services and 
Sainsbury’s providing warehousing and 
distribution services. Both of these important 
renewals demonstrate the strong partnership-
based ethos with our customers and our 
commitment to driving greater efficiency into 
these logistics operations. In a challenging 
grocery marketplace we will deliver substantial 
savings into the future for our customers. 
New business wins included a five year contract 
with wilko, one of the UK’s fastest growing 
retailers, to manage all UK transport operations, 
a three year warehouse management contract 
with Coca-Cola, a four year contract with IKEA 
and a five year contract with Majestic Wine to 
establish and operate an eCommerce National 
Fulfilment Centre. For IKEA, we will provide 
operational development and support for 
two new distribution centres, supporting their 
multichannel distribution growth strategy.
In any contracting business inevitably the new 
business growth has been partially offset by 
revenue reduction on contract losses and exits 
due to changes in customer requirements 
or transfers to alternative providers. 
During the year, this included the cessation of 
the Morrisons convenience store business, and 
a lost contract with Nestlé both announced last 
year as well as the cessation of a Tesco contract 
from July 201 7 .

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 17
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts STRATEGIC PROGRESS
We have made good progress against our 
strategic goals in both sectors as follows:
Delivering improvements for our 
customers in our existing operations 
and retaining existing contracts
Significant contracts were renewed during 
the year including Sainsbury’s and Co-op. 
Both are long standing customers of over 
20 years. The renewals are based on the 
strength of our relationships and a partnership 
approach to their supply chain needs as well 
as on our service excellence, adaptability and 
dependability. As customers adapt to changing 
consumer behaviour the evolution of the 
supply chain is an increasingly important part 
of the renewal process. 
During the year, the Construction business 
expanded its service offering into the  
ready-mixed concrete market and has 
commenced the acquisition of more than 100 
ready-mix vehicles. This investment is backed 
by an eight year contract with Hanson UK and 
supports the Group’s view that the prospects 
for the UK construction industry are positive as 
evidenced by the Government’s desire to build 
a million new homes by 2020 and to invest in 
major infrastructure projects.
Improving ‘share of wallet’ with our 
existing customers and focusing on 
cross selling our services
Excellent relationships are at the heart of our 
success and we ensure that we understand 
our customers’ needs and challenges so that 
we can add value to their business. During the 
period, we have extended the services we 
provide to a number of customers including 
Britvic and Screwfix. With Britvic we have 
extended our 1 9 year partnership and in 
addition to the distribution centre operation 
we have won a five year contract to operate 
their national transport operations. We have 
also extended our relationship with Screwfix 
with an agreement to design and manage a 
newly built warehouse.
These extended contracts demonstrate our 
track record of service excellence combined 
with a compelling commercial approach and 
added value.
Acquiring new customers through 
improved prospecting process and 
innovative service propositions
We were pleased to win new contracts with 
IKEA, wilko and Majestic Wine during the year.
To support IKEA’s multichannel distribution 
growth strategy, we have sourced and fitted 
out two warehouses in South East England 
which are now in operation. The new facilities 
will create an efficient and reliable operation 
which will support IKEA’s future growth plans.

Industrial & Transport reported revenues of 
£468.8m in the year, down 7 .7% on the £508.1m 
reported in the prior year.
The underlying operating profit of £26.3m 
compared to £23.5m last year, driven by the 
improvement in performance of the Pullman 
business together with non-recurring items 
from contract cessations such as property-
related credits.

Construction 134.4 138.5 (3.0)%
Other 127.4 134.8 (5.5)%
468.8 508.1 (7.7)%
The decrease in revenue compared to last year 
is primarily due to the cessation of the closed 
book Pullman home shopping contracts in 
the second half of last year, volume pressures 
in container transport operations (both within 
Transport services above), the insourcing 
of a construction logistics contract and 
the cessation of a contract within defence 
operations (included within ‘Other’) at the 
half year, partially offset by growth in our 
EnergyLink business and the start-up of our 
ready-mix concrete offering.
With over 60 years’ experience supporting 
the defence sector we received another gold 
standard accreditation known as the ‘SC21’ 
during the year. We are the first third party 
logistics company to be accredited with the 
gold SC21 award. Our defence operation 
was recognised for our change programme 
designed to accelerate the competitiveness of 
the aerospace and defence industry. This award 
demonstrates our commitment to continuous 
improvement and efficiency that we deliver 
through our tailored innovative supply 
chain solutions. 
Excellent relationships 
are at the heart of our 
success and we ensure 
that we understand our 
customers’ needs and 
challenges so that we 
can add value to their 
business

STRATEGIC REPORT
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED Our employees were also proud to be jointly 
awarded the Bis Henderson Third Party 
Logistics Provider of the Year at the Hermes 
Retail Week Supply Chain awards. The award 
in late September 2016 was awarded on the 
evidence of innovation, execution of those 
initiatives, a level of true collaboration with retail 
clients and evidence of those solutions to our 
customers, over the past 1 2 months. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
The health and safety of our people is our 
number one priority and we were pleased 
that our continued reduction in reported 
incidents was maintained this year as a result 
of our health and safety driver and warehouse 
initiatives and training programmes. 
During the year, we have also continued 
to support and encourage our people 
to be as happy and healthy as possible, 
through our award winning health and 
wellbeing campaigns to improve knowledge 
and understanding of issues particular 
to our industry.
We are acutely aware of our responsibilities 
to minimise our environmental impact and 
have ensured during the year that all sites, 
depots and offices have sustainability plans in 
place to minimise the environmental impact 
of their activities on the local environment. 
The continued reduced environmental 
impact statistics detailed later in the Corporate 
responsibility report on pages 28 to 31 show 
how much our commitment and efforts are 
paying off and we were proud to retain the 
Carbon Trust Standard to March 2018 which 
we have held since 2010.
Wincanton is a large scale employer in the UK 
and Ireland and we celebrate the diversity of 
background and ethnicity. Our employee base 
comprises 1 7 ,500 people with British, Irish, other 
EU and non EU heritage and we recognise and 
are grateful for the contribution they all make 
to the Group and wider economy now and in 
the future.
INNOVATION
We are serious about bringing innovative 
solutions to our business and our customers 
and we bring this together in Wincanton 
through our W
2
 programme. Our W
2
 Ideas 
Accelerator initiative is focused on finding and 
implementing innovative ideas from within 
Wincanton, harnessing and managing them 
via an interactive platform and engaging 
approach. Our W
2
 Labs initiative has been 
established in partnership with L Marks, 
innovation specialists and early-stage investors. 
We are taking the Wincanton brand and certain 
key logistics themes to the worldwide start-up 
community to identify great ideas to trial in our 
business incubator. 
PEOPLE
Wincanton employs 1 7 ,500 people, who are 
clearly our greatest asset. I thank them for their 
continued dedication, support and focus on 
our business and service to our customers.
Helping our people to develop and progress 
their careers with Wincanton is a really 
important element of our people strategy. 
We launched the ‘Your Future’ programme 
during the year as a new training programme 
to help attract people into logistics. We were 
delighted that a Wincanton General Manager 
was recognised in the Grocer’s Top New 
T alent list in 2016 for his work creating the 
programme. Additionally, our HR team won 
multiple awards at the HR Excellence Awards 
recognising our T alent Management Strategy 
and Health and Wellbeing programmes for 
colleagues and the overall “HR Excellence 
Gold Award”. 
We were delighted to be awarded the contract 
to manage all UK transport operations for 
wilko, the family owned retailer. We will be 
responsible for the replenishment of their 
900-strong store portfolio making over 100,000 
deliveries per annum.
The set up and successful Christmas operation 
of a new National Fulfilment Centre (NFC) 
for Majestic Wine has again proven our 
eCommerce expertise. We now generate over 
£250m of revenue from customers where 
we help them deliver their multichannel 
operations, which demonstrates great 
capability in a changing retail landscape.
Driving ongoing cost reductions and 
cash generation
Our track record in continuous improvement 
helps our customers in terms of lowering their 
cost of operations in open book contracts and 
supports our margins in closed book contracts. 
This continued drive to improve efficiency 
of operations strongly supports our ability to 
retain existing contracts with customers and 
build long term partnerships.
We continued the year on year trend of strong 
positive net cash flow of £1 5.2m (2016: £18.1m), 
see cash flow table on page 22. This excellent 
cash performance enables us to have the 
confidence to lift our final dividend from 
5.5p to 6.1p per share this year resulting in a 
total dividend for the year of 9.1p per share 
(2016: 5.5p per share). We also continue to 
support our legacy pension scheme with 
deficit recovery plan payments, net of certain 
Scheme administration costs, of £14.1m in the 
year (2016: £20.9m). The remainder of cash 
generated reduced the level of closing net 
debt to £24.3m (2016: £39.5m).
BREXIT
Following the result of the EU Referendum 
in June 2016 we have closely followed 
developments in our markets and assessed 
the potential impact on our business. As a UK 
and Ireland focused business the direct impact 
to date has been negligible for Wincanton. 
However, we do recognise the potential to 
experience an affect as our customers’ markets 
are impacted. This could be both positive 
or negative dependent on factors such as 
consumer confidence, construction investment 
sentiment, the effect of the devaluation of 
sterling currency and the availability of labour 
in the UK market place.

The Directors present the results of the business on an underlying basis, excluding amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items, the related tax and 
exceptional tax, where applicable, from operating profit, profit before tax and EPS, as they believe this better represents the performance of the business. A reconciliation 
of these measures to their statutory equivalent is shown in the table on page 23.
Wincanton plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 20
STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW Exceptional tax comprises a tax credit of 
£4.0m (2016: £0.9m) relating to previous years’ 
tax liabilities offset by a tax charge of £0.3m 
(2016: £nil) on exceptional profit.
The total net deferred tax asset has reduced 
to £1 7 .2m (2016: £22.0m), primarily as a result 
of the reduction in the pension deficit and the 
deferred tax asset thereon. 
PROFIT AFTER TAX AND EARNINGS 
PER SHARE
Profit after tax for the year is £42.0m 
(2016: £6 1.1m) with the reduction of £1 9.1m 
due to lower exceptional profit following the 
£32.4m gain on sale of WRM in the year ended 
31 March 2016. The reduction arising from 
the lower exceptional profit was partly offset 
by improvements in underlying operating 
profit, financing costs and amortisation of 
acquired intangibles. 
Underlying EPS, which excludes from earnings 
amortisation of acquired intangibles and 
exceptionals, increased by 1 5.9% to 27 .7p 
(2016: 23.9p). Basic EPS was 34.2p (2016: 50.7p) 
with the decrease again being explained by 
the reduction in exceptional profit. 
The calculation of these EPS measures is set 
out in Note 7 . 
DIVIDENDS
 
2017

2016

Interim 3.0 –
Final (proposed) 6.1 5.5
Total 9.1 5.5
The Group’s policy is to show dividend 
growth broadly matched to growth in 
underlying earnings.
In setting the dividend the Board consider a 
range of factors, including the Group’s strategy 
(including downside sensitivities), the current 
and projected level of distributable reserves 
and projected cash flows.
The Board have proposed a final dividend 
of 6.1p per share relating to the year ended 
31 March 201 7 , an increase compared to the 
final dividend paid in respect of the year ended 
31 March 2016.
Dividend payments of £10.4m (2016: £nil) in the 
year comprised the final dividend of 5.5p per 
share relating to the period ended 31 March 
2016 and the 201 7 interim dividend of 3.0p 
per share.
The non-cash financing items total £4.7m 
(2016: £5.7m) and comprise the discounts 
unwinding on the Group’s provisions for 
property and insurance claims plus the 
financing charge in respect of the defined 
benefit deficit, lower in the year because of 
a reduction in the opening pension deficit.
AMORTISATION OF ACQUIRED 
INTANGIBLES
Amortisation of acquired intangibles of £2.2m 
is £2.3m lower than the prior year as a result 
of the intangible relating to the acquired 
construction business being fully amortised at 
the end of March 2016. The remaining balance 
will be fully amortised by 31 March 2018.

European operations and WRM.
In the prior year, exceptional profit arose on the 
disposal of WRM.
Other items comprise the settlement of a claim

Underlying tax of £7 .5m (2016: £6.5m) 
represents an effective tax rate of 18.0% 
(2016: 18.4%) on underlying profit before 
tax and is stated before tax credits of £0.4m 
(2016: £0.9m) in respect of the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles and exceptional tax 
of £3.7m (2016: £0.9m).
The Group’s revenue of £1,1 18.1m in the year 
ended 31 March 201 7 was 2.6% lower than the 
prior year (2016: £1,147 .4m). Excluding WRM, 
which was sold in December 201 5, the 
decrease in revenue was 1.3%. This decrease 
is principally due to contract exits, including 
those from all closed book contracts providing 
fleet maintenance for home delivery services 
in the Pullman business. The impact of the 
contract exits, together with some volume 
pressure in the Containers business, has 
been partly offset by new wins and volume 
growth, particularly in the Retail general 
merchandise business.

Underlying operating profit grew by 2.4% 
to £52.1m. Excluding WRM, which recorded 
£2.2m operating profit in the year ended 
31 March 2016, the Group’s underlying profit 
grew by 7 .0%. This growth reflected the 
continued strong operating performance, the 
improvement in the Pullman business, primarily 
due to the exit of the loss-making home 
shopping contracts and credits from end-of-
contract property settlements. As a result we 
have achieved an underlying operating margin 
of 4.7%, marginally up from 4.4% in the prior 
year (4.3% excluding WRM).

Committed facilities
During the year, the Group agreed an 
extension of the maturity of its syndicated 
facilities to October 2021. 
The US Private Placement debt of £20m 
was redeemed from cash generated in the 
year and from other existing facilities on 
7 November 2016.
The Group’s facilities at 31 March 201 7 
comprise the following: the syndicated main 
bank facility of £14 1.2m which amortises by 
£8.8m in October 201 9, with a second equal 
amortisation at the four year anniversary in 
October 2020; and £25m from the Prudential/
M&G UK Companies Financing Fund LP , which 
amortises by £6.2m in January 2021 with the 
remaining balance maturing in January 2022.
The Group maintains a mix of hedging 
instruments (swaps) to give an appropriate 
level of protection against changes in interest 
rates. At the year end, £20m of debt was at 
fixed rates and the balance at floating rates.
Wincanton operates comfortably within its 
banking covenants, as summarised in the 
table below:
Covenant Ratio
At 31 
March 
2017
Adjusted net debt: EBITDA <2.75:1 0.77
Interest cover >3.5:1 14.1
Fixed charge cover >1.4:1 2.9
PENSIONS
The Group operates a number of pension 
arrangements in the UK and Ireland.
Defined benefit arrangements
The Wincanton plc Pension Scheme (the 
Scheme) includes defined benefit sections which 
were closed to future accrual on 3 1 March 20 1 4.
Group’s cash exposure to these onerous leases 
will fall materially over time. 
The £6.5m inflow on working capital in the 
year ended 31 March 201 7 is due to favourable 
timing on year end collections in the normal 
course of business. The large working 
capital outflow of £51.8m in the year ended 
31 March 2016 was the result of a one-off 
adjustment to year end working capital 
management activities.
The Group paid cash tax in the current year 
of £2.6m (2016: £3.1m). The cash tax payable 
continues to trend below the underlying 
charge due to the impact of tax relief on the 
pension deficit recovery payments made 
in the year and on share options exercised. 
This is expected to continue going forward. 
The amount of cash interest paid, excluding 
fees, of £6.8m (2016: £9. 1 m) reduced significantly 
in the year reflecting the lower level of average 
net debt compared to the prior year. 
Free cash flow of £39.8m (2016: £(1 2.2)m) has 
been used to maintain the pension recovery 
payments of £14.1m (2016: £20.9m), to pay 
equity dividends of £10.4m (2016: £nil), and 
to reduce net debt by £1 5.2m (2016: £18.1m).
Net debt at 31 March 201 7 was £24.3m 
(2016: £39.5m), reflecting the net cash inflow 
in the year of £1 5.2m.

Closing net debt
The average level of net debt was reduced 
by £54.0m from £108.0m in the prior year 
to £54.0m in the current year from the cash 
generation of the business and the impact 
of the proceeds received from the disposal 
of WRM.
FINANCING AND COVENANTS
The Group’s committed facilities at the year 
end were £166m (2016: £21 5m) and the 
headroom in these committed facilities to 
reported net debt at 31 March 201 7 was £142m 
(2016: £1 76m). The Group also has additional 
operating overdrafts which provide day to 
day flexibility and amount to a further £1 1m in 
uncommitted facilities. Sterling and Euro pools 
are operated and whenever possible, surplus 
cash is netted against overdrafts.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CONTINUED The membership data split by key categories is 
as follows:
  2017 2016
Deferred 8,030 8,525
Pensioners 5,883 7,125
13,913 15,650
The Scheme had an IAS 1 9 deficit of £78.4m 
at 31 March 201 7 (2016: £105.6m). The deficit 
at 30 September 2016 was £169.2m.
The deficit has reduced due to an increase 
in the market value of the investments, a 
reduction in liabilities due to demographic 
assumptions and contributions received from 
the Group, being partly offset by an increase 
in liabilities resulting from a fall in the discount 
rate. The discount rate has fallen to 2.6% 
compared with the prior year of 3.5%. Each 0.1% 
increase in the rate impacts the liabilities of the 
Scheme by approximately £21.5m.
The last triennial valuation of the Scheme 
was undertaken as at 3 1 March 201 4 and was 
finalised in April 201 5. This showed a deficit 
on a technical provision basis of £1 95m and 
a deficit recovery payment plan was agreed 
with the T rustee which provided for a baseline 
annual payment of £1 4.4m increasing by RPI 
each year through the recovery period to 
September 2024. The cash contribution made in 
the current year to fund the deficit was £1 4.8m. 
Certain administration costs have also been 
paid directly by the Group and in line with the 
agreement with the T rustee, deducted from 
these contributions. The next triennial valuation 
will be based on the position as at 3 1 March 201 7 .
Over recent years, the T rustee has pursued a 
diversification of the investment portfolio as 
part of a de-risking strategy and the programme 
has continued in the year ended 3 1 March 201 7 . 
As at 3 1 March 201 7 the Scheme’s investment 
was split between 56% in return-seeking assets 
and 44% in defensive assets.
The T rustee has also decided to hedge the 
interest and inflation rate risks facing the Scheme 
and will systematically increase the level of this 
hedge to 100% of the Scheme’s assets over 
a period of 1 5 months from August 201 6 to 
November 201 7 , subject to leverage restrictions. 
This increase will, as far as practicable, eliminate 
changes in the funding level driven by changes 
in interest or inflation rates. At 3 1 March 201 7 the 
Scheme hedged 89% of its inflation rate risk and 
78% of the interest rate risk.
In conjunction with the T rustee, the Group 
has also initiated an Enhanced T ransfer Value 
exercise, whereby deferred members 
approaching retirement may choose to transfer 
their assets out of the Scheme in order to access 
the new flexible retirement options available. 
As a result of this exercise the Group has 
recognised an exceptional item of £(0.9)m, being 
the costs associated with making the transfer 
offer, including the provision of independent 
financial advice. This exercise will conclude in 
the first half of the year ended 3 1 March 201 8 
together with an associated cash outflow to 
fund the enhanced transfer values and an 
expected reduction in pension liabilities.
The Trustee has also written to members 
with small pension pots to remind them of 
the option under normal Scheme rules to 
exchange their benefits for a one-off cash 
sum. In response to this communication 
1,566 members have taken up this option 
resulting in a reduction in the liability of £3.8m.
Defined contribution arrangements
The Group’s defined contribution arrangements 
include the Retirement Savings Section, Pension 
Builder Plan and Auto Enrolment section in the 
UK and a separate similar local scheme in Ireland. 
Active membership of these schemes was 1 5,52 4 
(201 6: 1 5,437) in the year. The charge incurred for 
these arrangements totals £1 7 .9m (201 6: £1 8. 1 m).
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Alternative performance measures (APMs) are used by the Board in assessing the Group’s performance and are applied consistently from one period to 
the next. They therefore provide additional useful information for shareholders on the underlying performance and position of the Group. Additionally, 
underlying EPS is used as a key performance indicator for the share incentive schemes, including the Special Option Plan and Long Term Incentive Plan. 
These measures are not defined by IFRS and are not intended to be a substitute for IFRS measures.
The Group presents underlying EBITDA, operating profit and EPS which are calculated as the statutory measures stated before amortisation of acquired 
intangibles and exceptionals, including related tax and exceptional tax items where applicable. The table below reconciles the APMs to the statutory 
reported measures.

Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts of influence and empowerment to embed risk 
management behaviours and implement or 
change controls. 
The RMC has oversight responsibility for: Group, 
business and function risk registers; risk controls 
and processes (such as Group policies and 
business procedures); and business continuity 
arrangements throughout the Group, including 
disaster recovery. 
The Head of Internal Audit is invited to attend 
RMC meetings and provide updates on 
findings of internal audit reviews to ensure 
any potential concerns or actions are shared 
so they can be addressed and monitored 
to completion.
Risk registers
The Group has compiled and maintain a Group 
risk register of the significant risks at Group 
level. Risk registers specific to business unit and 
support functions are maintained by senior 
management responsible for those areas. 
Each risk register has been compiled following 
comprehensive assessment of the Group 
and its competitive environment. Appropriate 
responses and controls for all risks have been 
determined to, where possible eliminate, 
but more usually mitigate, the impact and 
likelihood of the risks. 
Mitigation may include the introduction of 
additional controls, changes in procedures, 
increased insurance cover and commercial 
changes, along with other actions. The Group 
risk register is reviewed and monitored at 
each meeting of the RMC and if deemed 
necessary any amendments are submitted 
to the EMT for consideration, followed by the 
Audit Committee. 
Risk responsibility and assessment
Ultimate responsibility for setting the Group’s 
risk appetite and the effective management of 
risk sits with the Board.
The Board believe that the risk management 
system provides sufficient information and 
assurance on the key risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group and facilitates informed 
decision making on strategic, commercial and 
financial matters.
During the year the Board considered 
and confirmed the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal controls.
Acting within authority delegated by the 
Board, the Audit Committee has delegated 
oversight of risk management and the 
control environment, which is the day to day 
responsibility of the EMT.
Full details of the Audit Committee’s remit can 
be found in the Corporate Governance section 
on pages 4 1 to 43.
Risk management system
The risk management system comprises three 
integrated risk management components: 
a working committee; risk registers at both 
Group and business unit level; and a control 
assessment programme.
Risk management committee
The Risk Management Committee (RMC) 
is an internal working committee set up 
to undertake second level assurance. 
The RMC maintain an up-to-date view on the 
current and prospective risks relevant to the 
Group and its macro environment, monitor 
the effectiveness of the control environment, 
and identify improvements to controls and 
processes to reduce risks to the lowest level 
of acceptability.
The RMC reports to the EMT and Audit 
Committee on the current risk profile of 
the Group and progress on risk mitigation 
towards target risk levels set. The RMC meets 
at least five times per year and is comprised 
of business unit leadership and heads of 
support functions. This composition of senior 
management represents all significant risk 
areas within the Group, provides a collective 
oversight of the whole Group, and has the level 
PRINCIPAL RISKS 
AND UNCERTAINTIES
This report, incorporated within the Strategic 
Report, sets out how the Group manages risk 
by explaining the controls, risk management 
system and the Group’s key principal risks  
and uncertainties. The key principal risks  
are those risks that are considered material  
and could have a significant impact on the  
Group’s financial position, its operations  
and/or reputation.
Risk governance
The Group faces a diverse range of risks and 
uncertainties which could have an adverse 
effect on its success if not managed. To address 
these the Group designed and embedded 
a risk management system to identify and 
monitor all relevant current and potential risks 
and uncertainties, and to develop mitigation 
plans to reduce the likelihood and/or impact 
of the risks to the lowest extent possible.
Operational oversight and application of risk 
management in the Group is the responsibility 
of the EMT. Independent oversight and 
monitoring is undertaken by the Board’s Audit 
Committee, on behalf of the Board. Both the 
EMT and Audit Committee consider risk as 
a routine agenda item at their respective 
meetings. This ensures that sufficient time is 
allocated to consideration of the effectiveness 
of risk management and identification of any 
areas that could be further strengthened. 
The internal risk and control environment is 
reviewed by Internal Audit throughout the 
year, and their findings are reported to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee make 
recommendations to the Board, or determine, 
within the remit of its authority, any remedial 
actions or alterations to the risk management 
and control environment to ensure it remains 
up-to-date and fit for purpose.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISK REPORT VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 (“Code”), the 
Directors assessed the viability of the Group 
over a three year period, from 1 April 201 7 to 
31 March 2020, taking into account: the Group’s 
current position; and the potential financial 
and operational impact of the principal risks 
(on pages 26 to 27), in severe but plausible 
scenarios. In making their assessment, the 
Board carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
The Directors determined that a three year 
period to 31 March 2020 is the appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability 
statement. This is the same timescale over 
which the Group plan, and the budgets 
and forecasts are reviewed by the Board 
in its annual planning process. It is therefore 
considered that this presents the Board and 
readers of the Annual Report and Accounts 
with a relevant and reasonable degree of 
confidence over the longer term outlook. 
Based on this assessment, the Board have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet liabilities as they fall due 
to 31 March 2020.
This statement was approved by the Board 
on 16 May 201 7 .

Whistleblowing
The Group has in place a whistleblowing 
policy and procedure for all employees and 
other entitled individuals, to report concerns. 
The policy sets out the standards expected 
of all those it legally applies to and a clear 
procedure for raising concerns in strict 
confidence. The policy emphasises that 
anyone following the correct procedure and 
raising concerns in good faith is protected 
from recourse. 
In the event of a concern employees are 
encouraged to first talk to their line manager 
or contact the HR team directly, if appropriate 
and they feel able to. When this is not 
possible or appropriate, employees can raise 
concerns directly to the Whistleblowing 
Officer or call an independent, external 
whistleblowing hotline, provided by Expolink. 
All calls to Expolink can be made on a named 
or anonymous basis. Reports of concerns 
are always treated in strict confidence and 
investigations are overseen by the Company 
Secretary, the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Group HR Director. This ensures a thorough, 
fair and transparent process is undertaken 
and any actions are identified and addressed. 
A Whistleblowing Register is maintained and 
monitored, and is regularly reviewed by the 
Audit Committee.
Control assessment
The Group operates an annual programme 
which requires all business sites to complete 
an assessment on their application of controls 
and processes at site level. The completed 
assessments are submitted to Internal Audit 
who then follow up any issues of concern 
and may incorporate areas for further 
investigation into the scope of their Internal 
Audit assignments; and/or notify the RMC of 
any issues or remedial actions that need to 
be addressed and completed. Internal Audit 
report on the outcome of all submitted 
control assessments to each Audit Committee 
meeting throughout the year.
During the year, the RMC, through a delegated 
working group, reviewed the current control 
assessment programme and developed 
a more detailed programme, the Risk 
Management Tool. Following EMT and Audit 
Committee approval the Risk Management 
Tool will be implemented in replacement of 
the control assessment programme in the year 
ended 31 March 2018.
Business continuity planning
The Group maintains detailed Business 
Continuity Plans (BCP) for all sites and offices, 
which are dovetailed with customers’ plans 
where necessary, to ensure an immediate 
and appropriate response to incidents. 
The rolling review of the quality and testing of 
all BCPs is undertaken at both site and Group 
level. The results of the review and testing 
programme are reported to the RMC, who 
maintain oversight on behalf of the EMT.
During the year, the Group has continued with 
its IT disaster recovery migration for business 
applications and services. Scenario testing was 
undertaken at disaster recovery sites and found 
to be effective.

Significant 
changes to 
market sectors 
and operating 
environments
The Group provides services in a competitive and complex environment, with large and sophisticated customers within 
both its Industrial & Transport and its Retail & Consumer sectors. The Group faces into commercial pressures to renew and 
win business with acceptable levels of margin in order to deliver sustainable growth and returns. These pressures may 
stem from:
• Changes in customer appetite for outsourcing services
• Strategic or behavioural changes in the competition, which may impact market pricing
• New disruptors, in particular the emergence of new technologies
The Group closely monitors its strategic and operational performance through its KPIs (set out on page 1 5) and regularly reviews: market opportunities and threats, 
sector strategies, the sales pipeline, business optimisation programmes, innovation and solutions development, bespoke business propositions, and the talent 
development and retention strategies.
In addition to annual customer surveys, the business maintains key customer account plans to consider current and future needs, alongside the tracking of service, 
financial and operational contractual performance.
As a supply chain organisation the Board, EMT, and leadership teams, are closely monitoring the emerging developments on Brexit to determine if it could impact 
the market sectors the Group operates within, and any potential impact on customers and suppliers.
Brexit and 
macro economic 
factors
The UK’s decision to withdraw from the European Union has increased uncertainty in the economy and for all businesses. 
The Group’s operations are predominantly in the UK and, with the exception of a small level of operations in the Republic 
of Ireland, the Group is not directly exposed to European markets. The Group is, however, aware of potential for changes 
to its markets and operations from factors including:
• Economic and legislative changes in the lead up to and immediately following the proposed exit in 2019
• Impacts on our customers’ business
• Changes in the movement and supply of labour for both our warehousing and transport operations
The Group is closely monitoring developments in the Brexit process and has performed an initial risk assessment to identify areas of potential exposure. The topic 
of Brexit is a frequent area of discussion with our customers and the Group will continue to stay closely connected with our customers to identify any change in their 
requirements that may arise. There has been negligible impact of the Brexit vote on the Group in the nine months since the referendum of June 2016.
Significant 
health, safety or 
environmental 
incident
The Group operates in environments which have the potential to be hazardous to people or property if not actively 
managed. A failure to manage these risks properly could result in injury or death of people and/or damage to property and 
the environment. Should an event occur it could lead to regulatory action, fines, withdrawal of licences, site closures and 
damage to the Group’s reputation. All of which have the potential to impact the Group’s ability to win and do business.
The Group has detailed health and safety procedures and processes in place and employs health and safety teams at all business locations. The local team and 
operations are then monitored by a second-line central health and safety team. The Group undertakes regular training and assessment programmes, monitors 
business records and completion of risk self-assessments, analyses all ‘near miss’ reporting and undertakes audits and investigations if felt necessary. Health, safety 
and environmental data and reporting are provided to business management and leadership to manage and achieve target business performance.
Cyber security
The Group is acutely aware of the increasing prevalence of cyber security attacks in the digitalised world. Accordingly, cyber 
security is considered a principal risk and receives significant focus to ensure the protection of data and systems. A cyber 
attack could potentially impact the Group’s operational performance and reputation and could lead to penalties, fines  
and/or regulatory action.
The nature of this risk is evolving rapidly. The Group mitigates the threats and risks through maintenance of an appropriate IS infrastructure. There are robust security 
processes and protocols in place and the Group operates strict access controls. A suite of policies and procedures are in place that cover all areas of system, software, 
usage, security and data protection. The Group undertakes monthly vulnerability scanning, regular audits, and an annual penetration test with follow up monthly 
reviews. In addition, the Group has established an Information Security Forum to focus on data protection and security across the business.
IS infrastructure 
and systems
The Group is highly dependent on a high quality IS infrastructure and IT systems to operate the business and that of its 
customers. It is therefore essential to business and operational performance that key systems, software and hardware are 
operational at all times. Failure of these for more than a short period could impact the ability of the Group to support its 
businesses and have contractual implications which could lead to penalties or other liabilities.
To mitigate this risk, the Group maintains robust BCPs which include remote servers and a disaster recovery site with a data centre for back up of central systems. 
The BCP is tested at least annually. The IS strategy contains a programme of phased refreshment of the IS estate on a priority basis and policies and procedures are 
in place to facilitate early detection and escalation of issues. The Group also maintains an extensive IS team to develop solutions and maintain the stability and security 
of the infrastructure.
Recruitment 
and retention
The inability to recruit and retain employees, from drivers and warehouse operatives to executive talent, is considered 
a principal risk. Failure to retain people with the right skills, competencies, values and behaviours needed to operate 
and grow the business would impact the long term success of the Group.
The Group has a strong and extensive human resources function to monitor and maintain a high standard of recruitment and a regular appraisal process, based on 
key competencies. The Group constantly review and refresh strategies and processes for recruitment and retention, such as the driver recruitment strategy which 
monitors driver vacancies and pipeline. The Group also has established relationships with preferred agencies for contingency. Talent and development are monitored 
and supported by a dedicated team to ensure people at all levels have access to training and development opportunities. Rewards are benchmarked to ensure they 
remain competitive and an annual employee engagement survey is undertaken and tracked as a KPI. The Board and Nomination Committee closely monitor and 
review the Board, executive and senior management strategies for succession planning and review the Group’s talent pool on a regular basis. The Group and the 
Board are mindful of the potential impact of Brexit on current and future employees, and are closely monitoring Brexit implications for emerging clarity.
Key suppliers
As a large supply chain organisation, the Group is reliant on strong and reliable relationships with key suppliers and have 
obligations to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 201 5. Failure to comply with regulations and have robust contractual 
arrangements with its largest suppliers could have significant financial and reputational impacts on the Group and its 
business performance.
The Group mitigates these risks through well established financial and internal control processes managed by central and operational finance teams and a large 
and experienced Procurement function. The Group reviews the financial stability and suitability of suppliers and requires they adhere to the Group’s policies 
and ethical standards. Regular supplier account management meetings take place to review performance. As noted above any potential Brexit impact is being 
closely monitored.
Legal and 
regulatory 
compliance
The Group must comply with an extensive range of regulation and legislation in order to provide its services and solutions. 
Failure to comply to the required standards could lead to significant legal and regulatory actions, sanctions, removal 
of licences and permits, penalties and fines, and could result in reputational damage to the Group and potential harm 
to its employees or property.
Policies and procedures are in place throughout all areas of the Group to ensure systems, business and central operations all comply with relevant areas of legislation 
and compliance. The RMC maintain and monitor an internal legal and regulatory tracker to identify current and emerging legislation and determine any impact it 
may have to the Group and its policies, controls, communications and training that may need to be provided to Group employees. Second-line testing is undertaken 
by central functions to review the operation of controls and their effectiveness, including annual review of Group policies internally as well as a second review 
by external advisers.
Pension deficit
The Group has a significant deficit on its Defined Benefit pension scheme. The employer contribution levels required to 
eliminate this deficit, and the pension deficit itself, are subject to: financial market conditions, global economic and political 
matters, demographic factors, expected future investment returns and the legal and regulatory environment. Changes in 
any of those factors could materially alter the deficit value and lead to a material change in cash contributions, a change to 
the repayment period, regulatory intervention, or a combination thereof. These changes could impact the cash flow and 
profitability of the Group and restrict its ability to invest in the business, pay dividends and repay debt.
The Group has undertaken steps to mitigate the risk exposure of financial market movements and economic and political conditions. At the end of the year ended 
2014, the Defined Benefit (DB) section of the Scheme was closed to future accrual to cap the risk. During the year ended 31 March 201 7 , the Group and Trustee 
commenced Liability Management exercises which offer alternative options to Scheme members and a potential to reduce the overall liabilities of the Scheme.
The Group maintains a strong working relationship with the Trustee, who is responsible for managing the fund and setting the investment strategy. The investment 
strategy is intended to reduce the investment risk through an appropriate level of matching between assets and liabilities in the Scheme. The Group and the Trustee 
engage high quality external fund managers and actuaries, and have separate legal, covenant and audit advisors to support and inform their decision making.
Contributions to the Scheme are next due to be reviewed as part of the triennial funding valuation as at 31 March 201 7 . If there is an increase in the pension deficit 
at this point, contributions to the Scheme may have to be increased to ensure that the deficit is eliminated over a reasonable period whilst remaining at a level that 
is affordable and sustainable for the Group.

damage to the Group’s reputation. All of which have the potential to impact the Group’s ability to win and do business.
The Group has detailed health and safety procedures and processes in place and employs health and safety teams at all business locations. The local team and 
operations are then monitored by a second-line central health and safety team. The Group undertakes regular training and assessment programmes, monitors 
business records and completion of risk self-assessments, analyses all ‘near miss’ reporting and undertakes audits and investigations if felt necessary. Health, safety 
and environmental data and reporting are provided to business management and leadership to manage and achieve target business performance.
Cyber security
The Group is acutely aware of the increasing prevalence of cyber security attacks in the digitalised world. Accordingly, cyber 
security is considered a principal risk and receives significant focus to ensure the protection of data and systems. A cyber 
attack could potentially impact the Group’s operational performance and reputation and could lead to penalties, fines  
and/or regulatory action.
The nature of this risk is evolving rapidly. The Group mitigates the threats and risks through maintenance of an appropriate IS infrastructure. There are robust security 
processes and protocols in place and the Group operates strict access controls. A suite of policies and procedures are in place that cover all areas of system, software, 
usage, security and data protection. The Group undertakes monthly vulnerability scanning, regular audits, and an annual penetration test with follow up monthly 
reviews. In addition, the Group has established an Information Security Forum to focus on data protection and security across the business.
IS infrastructure 
and systems
The Group is highly dependent on a high quality IS infrastructure and IT systems to operate the business and that of its 
customers. It is therefore essential to business and operational performance that key systems, software and hardware are 
operational at all times. Failure of these for more than a short period could impact the ability of the Group to support its 
businesses and have contractual implications which could lead to penalties or other liabilities.
To mitigate this risk, the Group maintains robust BCPs which include remote servers and a disaster recovery site with a data centre for back up of central systems. 
The BCP is tested at least annually. The IS strategy contains a programme of phased refreshment of the IS estate on a priority basis and policies and procedures are 
in place to facilitate early detection and escalation of issues. The Group also maintains an extensive IS team to develop solutions and maintain the stability and security 
of the infrastructure.
Recruitment 
and retention
The inability to recruit and retain employees, from drivers and warehouse operatives to executive talent, is considered 
a principal risk. Failure to retain people with the right skills, competencies, values and behaviours needed to operate 
and grow the business would impact the long term success of the Group.
The Group has a strong and extensive human resources function to monitor and maintain a high standard of recruitment and a regular appraisal process, based on 
key competencies. The Group constantly review and refresh strategies and processes for recruitment and retention, such as the driver recruitment strategy which 
monitors driver vacancies and pipeline. The Group also has established relationships with preferred agencies for contingency. Talent and development are monitored 
and supported by a dedicated team to ensure people at all levels have access to training and development opportunities. Rewards are benchmarked to ensure they 
remain competitive and an annual employee engagement survey is undertaken and tracked as a KPI. The Board and Nomination Committee closely monitor and 
review the Board, executive and senior management strategies for succession planning and review the Group’s talent pool on a regular basis. The Group and the 
Board are mindful of the potential impact of Brexit on current and future employees, and are closely monitoring Brexit implications for emerging clarity.
Key suppliers
As a large supply chain organisation, the Group is reliant on strong and reliable relationships with key suppliers and have 
obligations to comply with the Modern Slavery Act 201 5. Failure to comply with regulations and have robust contractual 
arrangements with its largest suppliers could have significant financial and reputational impacts on the Group and its 
business performance.
The Group mitigates these risks through well established financial and internal control processes managed by central and operational finance teams and a large 
and experienced Procurement function. The Group reviews the financial stability and suitability of suppliers and requires they adhere to the Group’s policies 
and ethical standards. Regular supplier account management meetings take place to review performance. As noted above any potential Brexit impact is being 
closely monitored.
Legal and 
regulatory 
compliance
The Group must comply with an extensive range of regulation and legislation in order to provide its services and solutions. 
Failure to comply to the required standards could lead to significant legal and regulatory actions, sanctions, removal 
of licences and permits, penalties and fines, and could result in reputational damage to the Group and potential harm 
to its employees or property.
Policies and procedures are in place throughout all areas of the Group to ensure systems, business and central operations all comply with relevant areas of legislation 
and compliance. The RMC maintain and monitor an internal legal and regulatory tracker to identify current and emerging legislation and determine any impact it 
may have to the Group and its policies, controls, communications and training that may need to be provided to Group employees. Second-line testing is undertaken 
by central functions to review the operation of controls and their effectiveness, including annual review of Group policies internally as well as a second review 
by external advisers.
Pension deficit
The Group has a significant deficit on its Defined Benefit pension scheme. The employer contribution levels required to 
eliminate this deficit, and the pension deficit itself, are subject to: financial market conditions, global economic and political 
matters, demographic factors, expected future investment returns and the legal and regulatory environment. Changes in 
any of those factors could materially alter the deficit value and lead to a material change in cash contributions, a change to 
the repayment period, regulatory intervention, or a combination thereof. These changes could impact the cash flow and 
profitability of the Group and restrict its ability to invest in the business, pay dividends and repay debt.
The Group has undertaken steps to mitigate the risk exposure of financial market movements and economic and political conditions. At the end of the year ended 
2014, the Defined Benefit (DB) section of the Scheme was closed to future accrual to cap the risk. During the year ended 31 March 201 7 , the Group and Trustee 
commenced Liability Management exercises which offer alternative options to Scheme members and a potential to reduce the overall liabilities of the Scheme.
The Group maintains a strong working relationship with the Trustee, who is responsible for managing the fund and setting the investment strategy. The investment 
strategy is intended to reduce the investment risk through an appropriate level of matching between assets and liabilities in the Scheme. The Group and the Trustee 
engage high quality external fund managers and actuaries, and have separate legal, covenant and audit advisors to support and inform their decision making.
Contributions to the Scheme are next due to be reviewed as part of the triennial funding valuation as at 31 March 201 7 . If there is an increase in the pension deficit 
at this point, contributions to the Scheme may have to be increased to ensure that the deficit is eliminated over a reasonable period whilst remaining at a level that 
is affordable and sustainable for the Group.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 27
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts At the heart of our listening processes is our 
‘Your Voice’ Employment Engagement Survey. 
We undertake the survey on an annual basis. 
For new employees that transfer into 
Wincanton from one of our customers we 
undertake a snapshot version of our survey 
three months after the transfer date to get early 
feedback during the transition period. Our aim 
is to improve survey results year on year. 
We take the results very seriously and seek to 
provide a whole range of dedicated activities 
and targeted and robust action plans at both 
Group and local level, to address the feedback 
shared with us.
We publicise regular commentary and we also 
undertake ‘State of the Nation’ briefs, where 
senior managers share business performance 
results with employees on a regular basis and 
provide the opportunity to ask questions. 
We actively encourage employees to share 
their thoughts, concerns and ideas with the 
wider company through our programme of 
dedicated listening groups, and as part of our 
commitment to continuous improvement 
we establish working parties to seek input to 
drive change and improvements in the way 
we work.
HEALTH AND WELLBEING
Our employees are our greatest asset and 
we want to support them to be as healthy 
and happy as possible. 
Throughout the year ended 31 March 201 7 
we have focused on a wellbeing programme 
and calendar of events to raise awareness of 
health topics which align with national health 
awareness programmes.
Our award winning ‘health and wellbeing 
campaign’ is focused on improving 
knowledge and understanding about health 
issues particular to the logistics industry. 
Campaigns have included; providing new or 
more varied healthy foods at sites, wellbeing 
kiosks, health assessments and exercise classes.
During the year we also launched a successful 
‘Cycle to Work’ scheme and undertook a 
sponsored community cycle ride from John 
O’Groats to Land End, via our sites, to celebrate 
Wincanton’s 90th anniversary and raise money 
for charity.
We are also determined to play our part in 
addressing the skills gaps and shortage of 
graduate talent that’s affecting the supply 
chain and logistics industry. That is why we 
are founding sponsors of the NOVUS Trust 
which is an industry-wide initiative run by the 
Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport 
(CILT). The aims of the NOVUS Trust are to 
bridge the skills gaps and create the supply 
chain leaders of tomorrow. Participants qualify 
by passing a rigorous selection process, to what 
is considered to be a groundbreaking course 
designed with Huddersfield University. As part 
of the course they are guaranteed a mentor 
and an industrial placement with a sponsor 
company, such as Wincanton, and following 
completion of the course a graduate level job.
Wincanton also provide a training scheme 
that leads to a vocational qualification, funded 
by the Skills Funding Agency, in warehousing 
and transportation, which was rated ‘Good’ 
by Ofsted in July 2016. The programme is 
designed to increase skills and knowledge in 
health, safety and work practices.
In June 2016, we were honoured to be awarded 
three prestigious HR awards. The awards were 
in recognition of the Group’s strategies to 
retain, attract and manage key talent and skills, 
and for our health and wellbeing campaign. 
In 201 7 we are proud to have been shortlisted 
for our resourcing strategy.
CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT
We work hard to ensure we are listening to 
the views of our people. 
At Wincanton we operate informal, scheduled 
and annual processes for ensuring our 
employees have a voice in their careers and 
the wider operations of the Group.
We make listening to everyone within 
Wincanton a core component of how we 
operate our business. Whether it is informal 
talks at depots, warehouses and office sites 
or our more structured departmental and 
group-wide meetings, we do all we can 
to ensure that our employee’s voices and 
opinions are factored into our thinking. 
PEOPLE MATTER
Our employees really matter to our business. 
That is why we strive to hire the best employees 
in every area of our operations. We do 
everything we can to ensure our employees 
represent the local communities in which 
we operate.
OUR VALUES 
Our values were created by our employees and 
we live by them every day:
• Excellence. At every level and in every task, 
we aim to be the best at what we do.
• Integrity. We do the right things for the right 
reasons, to make the right call every time.
• Passion. We love logistics and work diligently 
and with passion.
• Proactivity. Every day, we seek opportunities 
to be one step ahead.
• Trust. We need to be able to rely on each 
other in good times and bad; when the 
pressure is on or when we are having fun.
• Togetherness. We work as one team: 
collaboratively and politics-free. We come 
together to help each other succeed.
DIVERSITY MATTERS
Wincanton is committed to employee diversity, 
equality and inclusion. We work hard to ensure 
employees of all backgrounds, genders and 
ethnicity are valued equally. We treat each 
other with respect, and ensure all employees 
undertake our diversity programmes which 
explain our philosophy of treating everyone 
the same.
We also require the highest ethical standards 
as part of our culture. This is evident across our 
business – whether it is making sure employees 
come to their place of work safely and in good 
health – or simply supporting each other. 
We talk and engage with each other with 
respect to ensure we do business the right way.
DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE
We provide a deep, broad and continual 
learning and development programme 
throughout every level of our organisation. 
By drawing on learning and development 
opportunities, we enable the Group to meet 
current and future requirements.

basis for first line managers in risk assessment 
and accident investigation. In addition we 
provide all mandatory training required by 
regulation and legislation relevant to the 
particular working environments and roles 
of our employees. 
WIDER CONTRIBUTION
At Wincanton we offer a range of rewards that 
recognise the contribution our employees 
make to the success of the Group, the wider 
industry and the community at large. 
We also provide many ways for employees 
to help us improve the Group’s growth and 
performance as well as expand our links with 
local communities.
Every site develops a programme that 
promotes and encourages links with their local 
community. Activities range from school visits 
to raise road awareness, to family fun days and 
charity events to raise money for causes that 
our employees have chosen.
The safety of our drivers is a significant focus 
in a logistics business. We track and monitor 
driving records, incidents and drivers’ behaviour 
and regularly review the results. We pay 
particular attention to the measurement of 
Collisions per Million Kilometres (CMK) as a 
barometer for our performance in these areas. 
Our ‘Driver’s Handbook’ is provided to ensure 
all drivers have the information they need 
to help them work safely and professionally. 
It includes driving and handling specific 
safety initiatives to keep our drivers and the 
public safe, such as our initiative EVADE. 
EVADE is our vulnerable road user programme 
which includes information and guidance 
on practices to be followed to safeguard 
pedestrians and cyclists. 
The Driver’s Handbook is part of our ongoing 
Driver ST AR programme, designed to elevate 
driving standards in Wincanton. The ST AR 
programme focuses on driver risk assessment, 
based on increasing overall road craft skills, 
and linkage into risk based driver intervention 
that help us to identify areas where support, 
training and further information may be 
required. The programme recognises driver 
performance and drivers can graduate over 
a five year period through bronze, silver, and 
gold standard levels.
Each year we also hold a Driver of the Year 
competition to celebrate the professionalism 
and talent of our drivers. 
Aside from driving, we provide an annual 
schedule of training on health and safety 
related topics, which are cascaded throughout 
our business sites and offices. Regular ‘Health, 
Safety and Environment’ training is provided to 
our managers and we cascade new initiatives 
through ‘train the trainer’ programmes to 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The health and safety of our employees is our 
highest priority and is at the heart of all we do.
We have a substantial team of talented drivers 
who take pride in their profession. We are 
equally proud of the quality of our non-driving 
employees and regardless of where our 
employees work within the business we invest 
in equipment and training relevant to every 
role to ensure we maintain our ‘best in class’ 
safety record.
An important KPI for us is measurement of 
LTIFR, and we track this on a weekly basis. 
We are pleased with the continued progress 
we have made in this area of safety, which is 
supported by another annual reduction in this 
figure. Our progress on LTIFR is shown on our 
KPIs on page 1 5. 
We use other metrics to give us a broader and 
deeper insight into safety, such as days lost 
ratio and employers liability claims. These are 
tracked throughout the year on a weekly basis 
and we review the data to monitor the impact 
of initiatives and training programmes in the 
business. We were pleased to see the rates 
continue to decrease in these areas. 
Given the nature of our business and working 
environments we track all activities closely 
to identify areas for continual improvement. 
We do this through ‘near miss’ reporting, 
whereby we encourage all employees to 
report anything they see which could be 
potentially hazardous or harmful, or could be 
improved. The level of reporting has continued 
to rise during the year which demonstrates the 
engagement and passion of our employees 
to care for themselves and each other.

We use the following environmental principles to help us identify and manage any impact 
of our business on the environment:
1 Integrate
We integrate environmental considerations into key business decisions.
2 Develop
We develop progressive products and services to assist our customers to improve their 
environmental performance.
3 Management 
We ensure operational excellence and legal compliance through environmental management 
systems and employee training.
4 Measure
We monitor, measure and continuously improve our environmental performance.
5 Communicate
We communicate our progress to our customers, employees and investors.
6 Carbon emissions
We minimise the consumption of fossil fuels and associated emissions of carbon dioxide, 
and other greenhouse gases.
7 Resources
We minimise our consumption of non-renewable and environmentally sensitive resources.
8 Waste
We minimise the amount of waste produced through prevention, reuse and recycling.
9 Pollution
We prevent ground and water pollution and minimise emissions of airborne pollutants.
10 Communication
We minimise the negative impact of our activities on local communities and engage positively 
with the communities in which we operate.
EXTERNAL REPORTING  
AND RECOGNITION
Our initiatives to reduce our environmental 
impact and the progress we have made, 
are recognised by our customers and other 
stakeholder bodies.
Carbon Trust Standard
We were proud to retain the Carbon Trust 
Standard, which has been awarded to March 
2018. We have held the standard since 2010 
and value its recognition of the continuous 
and consistent reductions we have made 
on our carbon footprint. This is a particularly 
significant achievement as a growing 
logistics organisation.
CDP disclosure score
We have submitted fully collated data to the 
CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) 
for the past seven years and over that period 
our CDP disclosure score has risen significantly 
from 56% to 95%. 
The CDP is the leading international index of 
climate change and carbon management 
maturity for companies.
In 2016, CDP changed their scoring 
methodology and we were rated at ‘B minus’. 
This is consistent with the previous year’s 
performance and makes us a company 
‘managing carbon’. This means we have gone 
OUR ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY
We are acutely aware of the environmental 
impact of the logistics industry. To ensure we 
keep it at the front of our minds and do all 
we can to minimise environmental impact 
we have a clear environmental strategy 
which is cascaded throughout Wincanton. 
All sites, depots and offices have plans in place 
regarding their local environment and activities 
which could have a detrimental environmental 
impact. Progress on these plans is regularly 
reported to, and monitored by, our senior 
management team.
We have an important part to play in 
helping our customers achieve their wider 
environmental goals and we know that a 
well-managed supply chain plays a key role in 
mitigating their impact on the environment as 
well as our own. We support our customers by 
identifying efficiencies, promoting collaborative 
working and by offering significant expertise 
and experience in managing environmentally 
sustainable logistics.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
CONTINUED beyond completing a full disclosure and being 
aware of our environmental issues, impacts 
and risks. This score recognises that we are 
implementing actions, policies and strategies 
to address these environmental issues and our 
carbon reduction figures reflect this.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
We believe that continuous improvement 
and operational excellence is enhanced 
by robust environmental governance and 
management systems. 
Responsibility for our environment programme 
sits with our Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee (HSE). The Committee is chaired 
by our Group HSEQ Director and attended 
by members of the EMT. This demonstrates 
the importance we place on our 
environmental strategy. 
We use an ISO14001 certified environmental 
management system and provide monthly 
performance results across a range of indicators. 
This supports our environmental policy and 
principles by enabling us to take prompt 
corrective actions and to identify and exploit 
improvement opportunities in each of our 
business sectors. 
Carbon emission information is prepared 
in accordance with the Carbon Disclosure 
Standards Board (CDSB) Framework 1.1 and 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for 
operational control. Carbon factors are per 
Defra/DECC conversion factors for company 
reporting 20 1 6 with both electricity generation 
and distribution emissions being included 
as scope 2 emissions.
We also record energy and fuel use for 
managed supplies, which includes all supplies 
that are wholly or partially managed at 
sites operated by Wincanton for itself or its 
customers, irrespective of whether the fuel 
and/or energy is purchased by us directly. 
The sources of emissions include road transport 
fuels; fuels for non-road transport uses; energy 
utilities for buildings; and fuel for business travel 
in Wincanton driven vehicles. We also include 
consumption of fluorinated refrigerant gases as 
a scope 1 emission and have not excluded any 
emissions sources regardless of materiality.
We are a participant in the UK CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme and all CRC qualifying 
emissions are included in our scope 1 and 2 
carbon emissions figures. We complied with 
the UK Energy Saving Opportunities Scheme 
(ESOS) original 201 5 deadline and utilised the 
costed energy saving measures in our internal 
environmental targets to 2020, to derive full 
value from the ESOS compliance process.
REDUCING THE CARBON 
INTENSITY RATIO
We set internal targets for carbon emissions 
reduction, which are absolute in nature 
and decouple emissions performance from 
business performance. However, as changes 
in our business activities directly affect 
emissions, we use a carbon intensity measure 
to ensure we optimise the carbon efficiency 
of our operations.
Our carbon intensity is defined as total scope 
1 and 2 carbon emissions from managed 
supplies per unit of revenue, and our carbon 
intensity ratio for the year ended 31 March 201 7 
was 320 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 
(tCO
2 e) per £m of revenue. This is a reduction 
year on year because, whilst we have seen 
revenue growth, we have reduced our energy 
and fuel use. There were also favourable 
variances in the UK carbon factors.
CREATING A SUSTAINABLE 
ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL
Our approach to Corporate Social 
Responsibility contributes to growth and 
shareholder value by investing in the 
capabilities and wellbeing of our people, 
creating value for our customers through 
innovation, and contributing to the positive 
future of the communities we work in and 
our environment.

FEATURE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING BEHAVIOURS
Safety is our number one priority. 
We aim to be the safest operator in 
the business in order to protect our 
people, our communities and our fellow 
road users.
Behavioural change is the key to 
continuous improvement and we invest 
in a wide range of initiatives that target 
potential areas of concern and help us 
take preventative action. For example, 
our STAR (Standards, Training, Attitude 
and Recognition) programme uses the 
latest technology to constantly assess our 
drivers, who are then graded according 
to their behaviours. By recognising and 
celebrating the safest drivers, we can 
focus on improving the performance 
of all.
Behavioural change is also at the heart of 
our staff welfare initiatives. We promote 
the value of an active lifestyle, highlight 
potential health issues and provide 
support across our entire workforce. 
Our commitment to health and safety 
extends to our local communities and 
fellow road users. During the year, 
we continued to provide awareness 
training and advice to young cyclists, 
demonstrating the potential dangers 
posed by heavy goods vehicles and 
offering advice on how to stay safe 
on the road.

16 May 201 7
During the year the Board have continued to focus on the development 
and practice of good governance throughout the whole organisation 
and have remained compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code).
The Board have reviewed and monitored the Group’s performance 
to ensure: that sound internal controls and financial and regulatory 
monitoring are in place; that the Group has adequate cyber and 
data security in place; and that the Group leads the implementation 
and promotion of vital health and safety initiatives to keep our people 
and stakeholders safe.
Following several changes to the Board during the previous financial year, 
this year has been a period of stability with no Board changes.
As stated in our Annual Report last year, we undertook our first external 
Board evaluation this year using Condign Board Consulting Limited. 
The purpose of the external evaluation was to gain independent 
appraisal and insight on the effectiveness and performance of the Board, 
its Committees and the Directors.
Following a comprehensive evaluation process, the review concluded 
that the Board operate in a very functional, highly collegiate way which 
is effective and purposeful in seeking value for shareholders and mindful 
of the need to discharge its obligations to other stakeholders. All of 
the members of the Board were found to challenge effectively and to 
contribute to the overall performance of the Board and its Committees.
With the Executive Directors well embedded and a strengthened 
management team appointed during 2016 and 201 7 , the Board have 
been focused on the strategic direction, which included review of its 
appetite for risk and ensuring appropriate governance and controls are 
in place to support strategy delivery and aspirations for growth in the 
business and operating environment. Good governance helps the Board 
address challenges that arise internally and externally, and enables the 
Board to undertake active stewardship of the Group to ensure it remains 
alert, agile and prepared.

GOVERNANCE
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and 
performed by different individuals. A responsibility statement for each 
role has been set out and adopted by the Board.
The Chairman, Steve Marshall, is primarily responsible for the operation of 
the Board and for ensuring that its strategic and supervisory role is achieved. 
He is an independent Non-executive Chairman, deemed independent on 
appointment and remains independent in accordance with the Code.
The Chief Executive, Adrian Colman, is responsible for the day to day 
running of the business which includes implementation of the strategy, 
decisions made by the Board and operational management of the Group 
supported by his Executive Management Team (EMT).
Executive Management T eam
The EMT comprise the senior leadership team that report directly to the 
Chief Executive and have management responsibility for the business 
operations and support functions. The EMT meet monthly and relevant 
matters are reported to Board meetings by the Chief Executive and, 
as appropriate, the Chief Financial Officer and other EMT members.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director, Stewart Oades, is an independent 
Non-executive Director of the Board. His role as the Senior Independent 
Director is to act as a sounding board for the Chairman and perform an 
intermediary role to other Directors, where necessary. He leads the appraisal 
and review of the Chairman’s performance and makes himself available 
to shareholders if they have any concerns that the Chairman and Chief 
Executive have failed to resolve or it is not appropriate for them to do so.
Non-executive Directors
All of the Non-executive Directors were deemed independent on 
appointment and continue to be independent in accordance with 
the Code. They were each appointed on the basis of their calibre and 
experience and provide diversity through their skills, background and 
qualifications. Each Non-executive Director has worked at director 
level in a variety of disciplines and commercial environments, similar 
sized organisations and regulated environments. The Board believe 
this enables them to collectively add value and provide independent 
oversight and challenge across all corporate and commercial aspects 
with their contributions and external perspective. 
Each Non-executive Director is appointed for an initial fixed term 
of three years, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. 
Their appointment term may be renewed by mutual agreement with 
due regard to the Code, their performance and contribution, and their 
ongoing independence.
Non-executive Directors are expected to: scrutinise, measure, review 
and challenge the performance of the EMT ; assist in the development 
of Group strategy; review the Group financial information and 
performance; ensure systems of internal control and risk management 
are appropriate and effective; review the relationship with the External 
Auditor within the Audit Committee; and review the remuneration of, 
and succession planning for, the Board.
At least twice a year, the Chairman and Non-executive Directors meet 
without the Executive Directors being present.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
As a listed company on the London Stock Exchange the Company 
is required to comply with the principles and provisions set out in the 
Code in force at the date of this report. The Board are committed to 
the principle of full compliance and are satisfied that the Company has 
complied with all of the requirements of the Code during the year.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
Wincanton plc and its subsidiaries (together the Group) remain 
committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate 
governance. All reports in the Governance section and Directors’ 
Remuneration Report have been prepared in accordance with the 
Code that applies to this accounting period.
Throughout the year ended 31 March 201 7 , the Board consider they, 
and the Company, have complied with all of the provisions of the Code.
BOARD LEADERSHIP
Role
The Company is led and controlled by the Board of Directors (shown 
on pages 34 to 35), who are collectively responsible for the long 
term success of the Company and the endorsement and application 
of corporate governance.
Decision-making
The Board have a formal Schedule of Matters reserved for their 
decision-making. Such matters include Group strategy and structure, 
governance and regulatory compliance, financial reporting, major 
capital commitments, major contracts and agreements, internal controls, 
significant remuneration changes, stakeholder engagement, and material 
corporate transactions (including acquisitions and disposals).
The Schedule of Matters Reserved sets out the parameters of each matter 
and limitations delegated to Board Committees and a sub-committee 
of the Board, the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is an 
ad-hoc executive management committee, authorised to approve 
day to day operational matters within limits and restrictions determined 
by the Board.
The Schedule is reviewed annually to ensure it remains fit for purpose 
and sets the parameters for management and expectation for 
internal controls.
Directors’ duties
The powers and duties of the Directors are determined by legislation 
and the Company’s Articles of Association. Directors are required to act 
in good faith in a way that they consider would be most likely to promote 
the success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders as a whole. 
In doing so, the Directors are required to have regard (amongst other 
matters) to:
• the likely consequences of any decision in the long term;
• the interest of the Company’s employees;
• the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers 
and others;
• the impact of the Company’s operations on the community and 
the environment;
• the desirability of the Company to maintain a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct; and
• the need to act fairly towards all shareholders of the Company.
In addition to their statutory duties, the Directors must ensure that the 
Board as a whole focus effectively on all areas of their responsibility. 
The Board consider all such areas within routine agenda matters 
at each Board meeting.

GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The review consisted of reviewing all Board and Committee meeting 
packs and minutes for the financial year and then one-to-one interviews 
with each Director and the Company Secretary were conducted by the 
external evaluator in January 201 7 . The interviews covered areas such as 
the conduct and operating rhythm of the Board, Board and Committee 
organisation and performance, the roles and contributions of Board 
members, Group dynamics and engagement, Board composition, the 
Board response to challenges, communications and engagement with 
shareholders and other stakeholders and overall Board effectiveness. 
The evaluator then observed Board and Committee meetings in 
February 201 7 .
The findings of the evaluation were analysed and presented to the Board 
by the evaluator at a Board session held on 1 March 201 7 . The evaluation 
confirmed that the composition, interaction and experience of the Board 
was highly functional and collegiate; engagement was effective and 
purposeful; and the Board sought to deliver value to its shareholders and 
discharge its obligations to its other stakeholders. The review also found 
that the Board had achieved its objectives set on the back of the 201 6 
Board evaluation regarding greater non-financial performance information. 
The successful achievement of this objective is demonstrated in the 
inclusion of non-financial KPIs on page 1 5. 
Board commitments
All of the Directors are fully committed to their roles and to their statutory 
and fiduciary duties. Over the course of the year the Board received 
briefings and presentations from key members of the management team. 
The Board also held two meetings at business sites in Kettering and Sutton 
Coldfield, to receive business presentations from local management 
teams, and to observe and engage with colleagues working in site facilities. 
The site visits enable the Board to gain a deeper insight and understanding 
of the business and in particular customer contracts and operations.
Outside of meetings the Board are also given opportunities to attend 
further business sites and visits are facilitated by the Company Secretary.
These additional activities help to ensure that the full Board have a sound 
understanding of the business and its operations, to enable them to 
provide appropriate oversight and challenge to the EMT.
Other directorships
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors hold appointments as 
directors on a small number of other companies, as detailed in their 
biographies on pages 34 to 35. The number of external appointments 
held by the Chairman and Non-executive Directors are considered upon 
changes in appointments and annually as part of their performance 
reviews. Following review and full attendance at all Board and Committee 
meetings and activities outside meetings during the year, it is considered 
the Chairman and Non-executive Directors have sufficient time and 
commitment to the Group.
The Board acknowledge that Executive Directors may wish to 
undertake external non-executive director roles outside of the Group. 
It is recognised that such opportunities broaden their development, 
widen their commercial experience and so benefit the Group. To protect 
the interests of the Group each Executive Director is restricted to one 
non-executive role at any one time. During the year and to the date 
of this report no Executive Director held any external appointments. 
Conflicts of interest
The Board monitor and review potential conflicts of interest on 
a regular basis and consider any situational conflicts at each Board 
meeting. Where any conflict arises the Board consider and authorise the 
reported actual or potential conflict in accordance with the provisions 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association.
Board Committees
There are three Committees of the Board, an Audit Committee, 
Nomination Committee, and Remuneration Committee. 
Each Committee have terms of reference set by the Board, which 
are reviewed annually and made available on the Group’s website. 
Membership of each Committee is determined by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee and in consultation with 
the appropriate Committee Chairman. The membership, role and duties 
discharged in the year ended 31 March 201 7 for each Committee are set 
out in their respective Committee reports that follow.
Meetings attendance  
During the year, and at the date of this report, there has been full 
attendance at all Board and Committee meetings by all of the Directors. 
It is acknowledged that there may be unforeseen circumstances from 
time to time which could prevent a Director from attending. In such 
circumstances the Director would be expected to review the meeting 
papers and provide comments to the Chairman, Committee Chairman 
or Company Secretary to ensure they are raised at the meeting. 
During the 201 7 financial year the Board held ten scheduled Board 
meetings. The table below sets out the attendance of the Directors 
at the scheduled Board meetings during the year under review:

Directors indemnity and insurance
Directors are ultimately responsible for the operation, performance 
and decision-making of the Company. In doing so, they are exposed to 
potentially significant personal liability under criminal or civil law and 
the UK Listing, Prospectus, Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, 
which include penalties such as private or public censure, fines and/
or imprisonment.
In line with normal market practice, it is considered in the Company’s best 
interests to protect the Directors from the consequences of innocent 
errors or omissions. Accordingly, Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance policy is maintained at the Company’s expense and was in 
place throughout the year. The policy provides indemnity to Group 
employees that serve as directors or officers of any Group company, 
as recommended by the Code, which includes the Board of Directors. 
This insurance policy would not provide cover in the event that a Director 
or officer had knowingly acted fraudulently or dishonestly.

professional advice at the Company’s expense, as and when required. 
In addition, all Directors have unfettered access to the advice and services

dialogue with shareholders to ensure that the strategy and business

managers and analysts is conducted through meetings with the Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Officer. Brokers’ reports and analysts’ 
briefing notes are regularly distributed to all Directors. The Board receive 
updates on feedback raised by institutional shareholders, fund managers 
and analysts, to enable the Directors to form a view of the priorities 
and concerns of stakeholders. In addition, the Chairman and Committee 
Chairman are available to engage with major institutional shareholders 
from time to time.
During the year, a shareholder engagement exercise was undertaken. 
This included the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee seeking 
engagement on changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy due 
to be presented to shareholders for approval at the 201 7 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). Further details on this can be found in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report starting on page 44.

and other stakeholders, such as share price, announcements, circulars, 
press releases, current and historic Annual Report and Accounts, 
corporate governance information and shareholder documentation.
Shareholders can elect how they receive Company communications 
from the Company. Electronic communications are endorsed by the 
Board as the most efficient communication and one which also helps 
the Group reduce its environmental impact and costs. Accordingly, all

for our future business, employees and costs, and potential impact on

Financial reporting and significant financial matters
The principal matters of judgement considered by the Committee 
in relation to the accounts for the year ended 31 March 201 7 and how 
they were addressed:
Property provisions
The balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 201 7 includes property 
provisions of £16.5m. 
The Committee reviewed a management report on the property 
portfolio and considered the provision for onerous leases and 
dilapidations, the utilisation of the provision during the year, and the 
rationale for the year end provision. The Committee also considered 
the External Auditor’s testing of the assumptions.
The Committee were satisfied the assumptions and disclosures in the 
Annual Report were appropriate.
Pension scheme obligations
The balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 201 7 includes a pension 
scheme deficit of £78.4m, with gross pension obligations of £1,1 56.7m. 
In arriving at the gross obligation figure, the Committee considered the 
accounting basis of the pension scheme in the year ended 31 March 
201 7 and reviewed the pension items provided by management, 
based on the Company Actuary’s report on the key assumptions in the 
pension obligation calculation and related income statement items. 
The Committee also considered the work performed by the External 
Auditor to test those assumptions.
The Committee were satisfied that the assumptions used and the 
disclosures in the Annual Report were appropriate.
Materiality and misstatements
The External Auditor, following discussion with the Committee, set the 
materiality and notify the Committee if they identify any misstatements 
through their audit. The Committee review the external auditors 
approach on materiality and level of materiality applied and any 
misstatements reported.
After review of management presentations and reports, including 
consultation with the External Auditor, the Committee were satisfied 
that the financial statements appropriately addressed the critical 
judgements and key estimates in respect of the amounts reported and 
the disclosures. The Committee were also satisfied that the significant 
assumptions used for determining the value of assets and liabilities had 
been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and on that basis the 
Committee recommended the Annual Report to the Board for approval.
• reports to the Board on any matters where it considers action or 
improvement is needed, including recommendation of remedial 
actions; and
• report to the Board on how the Committee has discharged 
its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee has unrestricted access to Company documents, 
management, Internal Audit, the Company Secretary, the External 
Auditor and any other advisers, as and when required.

GOVERNANCE
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
CONTINUED In addition, KPMG has put in place further independence safeguards 
through professional values, communications, internal accountability, 
risk management and independent reviews. KPMG regularly review the 
composition of the audit team and rotate teams in accordance with the 
relevant regulations; and consider the fees paid by the Company and its 
related entities for professional services provided.
Any significant new engagement undertaken for the Company 
is subject to acceptance procedures, requiring consultation with 
Simon Haydn-Jones, the Senior Statutory Auditor.
Auditor tender 
A robust and thorough audit tender was undertaken last year which 
concluded with a recommendation to reappoint KPMG as the Group’s 
External Auditor. The Committee are acutely aware that, despite 
undertaking the tender last year, KPMG have been the Group’s External 
Auditor since it listed in 2001. Therefore, although there is no requirement 
to retender for some time, the performance and effectiveness of the 
Auditor are rigorously considered and their length and continued 
appointment is kept closely under review.
Non-audit services
The Company’s Non-audit Services Policy is intended to put in place 
appropriate controls for the approval and engagement of any non-audit 
assignments according to the nature and value of the work, to safeguard 
audit objectivity and independence.
The APB’s Ethical Standard 5 sets out the permissible non-audit services 
that external auditors can perform, and KPMG ensures that all requests 
from the Company to provide non-audit services, to any KPMG office, 
are considered in the context of the Company’s policy and KPMG’s 
own ethical standards.
Full disclosure of audit and non-audit fees paid in the year ended 
31 March 201 7 are set out in Note 3 to the financial statements on 
page 79.

Risk management 
The Group’s principal risk management systems comprise:
• risk registers and reviews at both Group, business unit and support 
functions level;
• periodic control risk self-assessments;
• deep dives on specific risk profiles and challenges in particular business 
areas; and
• Risk Management Committee (RMC) oversight.
A full report of the Group’s risk management systems and controls, 
principal risks and uncertainties; and statement following the viability 
assessment are included in the Risk report on pages 24 to 27 .
Internal Audit function
The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer and 
has direct access to the Chief Executive and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. In addition to attendance at all Audit Committee meetings 
the Head of Internal Audit reports regularly on internal audit reviews 
to the EMT and RMC.
The Internal Audit function provide independent and objective review 
of risks and controls and reports to the Board, Audit Committee and 
senior management, to ensure the Group complies with corporate 
governance and regulatory responsibilities. The audit reviews consider 
the extent to which systems of internal control and risk management are 
designed and operate effectively, adequately manage or mitigate key 
risks, and safeguard assets and limit liabilities.
The role of Internal Audit and the scope of its works, are regularly 
reviewed to ensure it remains independent, fit for purpose and addresses 
business changes and regulatory requirements. The formal Audit Charter 
is reviewed by the Committee annually.
During the year, the annual evaluation of the Internal Audit function 
was considered by the Audit Committee. The results of the assessment 
concluded that the Internal Audit function was adequately resourced 
and operates effectively.
External Auditor
The Committee evaluates the effectiveness and independence of the 
external audit process and External Auditor annually in respect of their 
performance and conduct. The External Auditor tender undertaken in 
the last financial year was scheduled to coincide with the auditor rotation. 
Upon the reappointment of KPMG LLP (KPMG) as the Group’s External 
Auditor Simon Haydn-Jones became the new Senior Statutory Auditor 
with effect from 1 April 2016.
Auditor performance
The Committee undertakes an annual comprehensive assessment 
of the External Auditor’s performance following the financial year end 
annual audit, scoring the performance and effectiveness of the External 
Auditor, taking on board feedback from management. The Committee 
were satisfied the External Auditor had performed effectively in respect 
of the external audits for the year ended 31 March 2016 and the review 
of the half year to 30 September 2016.
Auditor independence
The Committee requires the External Auditor to give an annual 
confirmation of the actions it has taken to ensure objectivity and 
independence, including where non-audit services are provided.
For the audit of these financial statements the External Auditor, 
KPMG, have confirmed compliance with the firm’s ethics and 
independence policies, partner and staff compliance with their ethics 
and independence manual, including prohibition on holding Company 
shares. KPMG have assured the Group their ethics and independence 
manual is fully consistent with the professional practice rules of the 
Auditing Practices Board (APB) Ethical Standards, the auditor’s regulator.

Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts and retention. This policy will, therefore, be presented to our shareholders 
for approval at our AGM on 29 June 201 7 , with the intention that it will 
become effective from 1 July 201 7 .
During the year the Committee undertook a range of duties delegated 
to it by the Board. The activities included a review of fees paid to the 
Chairman; and scrutiny and approval of salary increases, LTIP awards 
and bonus payments to Executive Directors and senior management. 
As we do each year, the Committee sought to ensure that remuneration 
design rewarded only high performance, and was compliant with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. As in the previous year, the Committee 
did not recommend a change to the Chairman’s fee and the Non-
executive Directors’ fees also remained unchanged. An increase in salary 
was awarded to the Executive Directors effective 1 July 2016 that was 
wholly consistent with the average employee salary increase across the 
Group and the Committee have applied the same principle again for 
salaries of Executive Directors effective 1 July 201 7 . 2016 LTIP awards, 
granted in the form of nil cost options, were made to Executive Directors 
contingent on the same performance conditions applied in 201 5, as set 
out in the policy, and were also awarded at the same level as in previous 
years. The Committee thoroughly reviewed the Executive Directors’ 
performance reviews and bonus objectives which contained targets for 
financial performance and growth, and non-financial activities linked 
to the Group’s strategic objectives set out on page 14. Following strong 
financial performance and significant achievement across all of their non-
financial objectives and targets, the Committee considered the award of 
£477 ,528 (being 73% of his annual bonus entitlement) for Adrian Colman 
and £276,988 (being 77% of his annual bonus entitlement) for Tim Lawlor 
to be a fair and reasonable award for the year ended 31 March 201 7 . 
The bonus awards and payments were also determined in line with the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy and will continue to operate in this way 
for the year ended 31 March 2018.
Following my statement, you will find the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. This report will be presented to our shareholders 
for an advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM, and expands on the areas 
I have summarised above. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
guidance notes that follow will also be presented to shareholders at the 
AGM on a binding vote basis.
As a Committee we welcome engagement and constructive dialogue 
with all of our shareholders on remuneration, at any time. If you would 
like to contact us, please do so through our Company Secretary.

COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL STATEMENT
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year 
ended 31 March 201 7 .
It has been a busy year for the Committee in which we reviewed the 
appropriateness of the existing Remuneration Policy, and provided 
oversight and challenge to ensure that we remunerate our Directors and 
senior management in a way that (a) attracts and retains the best talent 
and (b) encourages high performance to achieve the Group’s strategic 
targets, but do not encourage irresponsible risk taking.
Far from being a statutory driven review process, as a Committee 
we continually review and monitor the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy against our business strategy, best practice and our relevant 
market environment. We also actively consider any feedback we 
receive from shareholders and the reports which institutional investors 
and shareholder bodies issue on remuneration policy and practices. 
Our intention is always to ensure reward is appropriately underpinned 
by challenging performance targets that align with the Group’s strategic 
goals and benefit our stakeholders in a responsible and sustainable way. 
We strongly believe this approach motivates and rewards individuals 
appropriately for their contribution to the Group’s performance and 
aligns executives’ interests in the same way shareholders receive a return 
on their investment in us.
As I referred to in my statement last year, at the forthcoming AGM we are 
required to put our Directors’ Remuneration Policy before shareholders 
for approval. In the context of the Group strategy we undertook a 
thorough and comprehensive review during the year, to compare our 
practices with new and emerging remuneration practices and market 
expectations. Following this review, we believe that our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy continues to be appropriate, and are therefore 
proposing the policy remains broadly unchanged. In recognition of 
emerging best practice, we have updated our policy to reduce the 
pension contribution for new Executive Director appointments to 1 5% of 
salary, to be in line with pension arrangements for other senior managers. 
The Committee have also reviewed the flexibility under the Policy for the 
Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan, to ensure the Committee 
can review performance measures and weightings ahead of each award 
to ensure they reinforce the business strategy.
As part of this process, we sought engagement with both our largest 
shareholders and shareholder bodies. Shareholder reactions to our 
relatively unchanged Directors’ Remuneration Policy were positive and 
therefore no further changes were made. Further information regarding 
the review we undertook, and the consultation and engagement 
process, can be found on page 46. Our conclusions were that the 
Company’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy, as set out on pages 54 to 59, is 
fit for purpose and the most suitable way to remunerate for performance 
We believe that our Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy 
continues to be appropriate

INTRODUCTION
The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out the Company’s 
remuneration of its Directors during the year ended 31 March 201 7 in 
line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders 
in July 2014. This section also summarises how the Committee intend to 
implement the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (being submitted to our 
shareholders for approval at the 201 7 AGM) from 1 July 201 7 .
This report is subject to an advisory vote by shareholders at the 
Company’s AGM on 29 June 201 7 .
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The Directors’ Remuneration Report, as a whole, has been prepared on 
behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with 
the Code, the Listing Rules and the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 201 3.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report comprises the Committee 
Chairman’s Annual Statement, this report and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy together with the accompanying notes. 
The Chairman’s Annual Statement and the Remuneration Policy are 
not subject to audit. Sections of this report are subject to audit and are 
highlighted accordingly.
ROLE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The main role of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration 
of Directors and senior management supports the delivery of the 
strategic goals of the Group without encouraging undesirable risk 
taking behaviour. This objective is achieved by: setting remuneration 
appropriate to the industry and markets in which the Group operates; 
and making a significant proportion of remuneration dependent on 
delivery of demanding but achievable performance targets key to 
delivering the business strategy, to reinforce development of a high 
performance culture.
Meetings
Details of Committee Membership and attendance at meetings are 
included in the Corporate Governance report on page 38. There were 
five Committee meetings during the year and one meeting between 
1 April 201 7 and the date of this report.
Members of the Committee were all independent Non-executive 
Directors selected to represent a broad range of backgrounds and 
experience to provide balance and diversity. In addition to formal 
Committee meetings, Committee members met outside of the 
scheduled meetings as necessary.
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Group HR Director attend 
the Committee’s meetings by invitation to provide advice and assistance 
on specific matters. However, no attendee was present when their own 
remuneration was being discussed.
Committee T erms of Reference
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are reviewed annually to 
ensure they reflect current regulatory and governance requirements 
and duties. The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Group’s website at www.wincanton.co.uk/investors/board-and-

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION Directors’ Remuneration Policy commencing 2018
The Company must put its Directors’ Remuneration Policy to a binding 
shareholder vote at least once every three years under the current 
remuneration regulations. As the last AGM at which shareholders 
approved the existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy was in 2014, the 
Company must submit the Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval 
to our shareholders at the 201 7 AGM.
During the year the Committee reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy considering alignment with the business strategy, new and 
emerging remuneration practices and market expectations and the 
current political focus on remuneration. Following this review, the 
Committee determined that the existing Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy is fit for purpose. The Committee chose to reduce the pension 
contribution for new Executive Director appointments to 1 5% of salary, 
to be in line with pension arrangements for other senior managers, and 
reviewed the flexibility under the policy for the Annual Bonus and Long 
Term Incentive Plan, in line with market practice, to ensure the Committee 
can review performance measures and weightings ahead of each award 
to ensure they reinforce the business strategy.
In reviewing the Policy, the Company engaged with selected 
shareholders and shareholder bodies, and the Committee was pleased 
with the feedback received. The conclusion, after taking feedback into 
account, was that the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, as set out on pages 
54 to 59, be presented to shareholders for a binding vote at the AGM 
on 29 June 201 7 , with the intention that it will become effective from 
1 July 201 7 .

Adrian Colman was appointed as Chief Executive of the Company on 
1 August 201 5 and therefore his service contract was refreshed to reflect 
his new role and remuneration. Both Directors’ service contracts are 
compliant in all respects with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The service contract for each Executive Director is available for inspection 
by shareholders at the Company’s registered office and will be available 
at the 201 7 AGM.
Remuneration consultant
Kepler (a brand of Mercer) is the Committee’s appointed Remuneration 
Consultant regarding remuneration advice. Kepler is a founding 
member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Consultants. For more detail please refer to the website, 
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.
The Committee annually reviews the support and advice provided by 
Kepler and was comfortable that Kepler continues to provide objective 
and independent remuneration advice and has no conflicts of interest 
with the Group that may impair its independence. Other than advice 
on remuneration, no other services were provided by Kepler to the 
Company. Mercer provides unrelated advice to the Trustee of the Pension 
Scheme in relation to investments.
During the year, Kepler attended Committee meetings upon invitation 
to provide advice and support to the Committee in areas such as: 
reviewing the remuneration policy; performance measure selection and 
calibration for long term incentives; current market practice; governance 
developments; drafting the remuneration report; and relevant 
comparator groups for pay and performance.
Fees payable to Kepler amounted to £48,765 (2016: £18,205), based on 
attendance at meetings and advisory materials. Fees for the year ended 
31 March 201 7 include Kepler’s support on reviewing remuneration 
policy and on implementation of the LTIP .
Directors’ Remuneration Policy in the year ended 
31 March 2017
Executive Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 March 201 7 
consisted of base salary, annual bonus, long term incentives, pension 
provision and taxable benefits. The bonus and long term incentives are 
performance-related and conditional on the achievement of Group 
performance targets and continued service to encourage retention. 
Performance targets are set at the start of each financial year and are 
clear, robust and objective and take into account the wider economic 
environment of the Group.
The existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which commenced on 
1 April 201 5, was designed to provide clarity and transparency of 
remuneration, simplify the remuneration structure and align Executive 
Directors’ interests with both Company performance and shareholder 
interests through generation of greater Company value over the 
long term.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was developed following 
consultation with the Company’s main shareholders and bodies that 
represent shareholders and investors, who were supportive of the 
principles of the policy overall.

 The Committee deemed that Eric Born should not receive a bonus in respect of the year ended 31 March 2016. For the purposes of this table the percentage of Adrian Colman’s bonus is the pro-
rated element attributable to the period he served as Chief Executive and not his full year bonus for the year ended 31 March 2016.
4
 The maximum opportunity for ‘single figure’ purposes is 200% of salary. The Committee decided the bonus would be paid 100% in cash as the plan ended on 31 March 2015 and no performance 
conditions would be applied, therefore it is not defined as a long term incentive.
5
 The maximum opportunity for ‘single figure’ purposes is 200% of salary. 50% of bonus is deferred in shares which vest subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive.
6
 The maximum opportunity for ‘single figure’ purposes is 25% of salary. 75% of bonus was deferred in shares which vested subject to performance and are therefore defined as a long term incentive.

 From 1 April to 31 July 2015 Eric Born served as Chief Executive. Adrian Colman was appointed Chief Executive on 1 August 2015. These figures contain pro rated remuneration in respect of each 
Director according to the period served for the year ended 31 March 2016.

 The Chief Executive’s bonus is the pro rated element attributable to the period Adrian Colman served as Chief Executive. The Committee deemed that Eric Born should not receive a bonus in 
respect of the year ended 31 March 2016.
The comparator group comprises all management level employees, approximately 300 people. This group was chosen as broadly the same group of 
employees that are entitled to participate in the Group’s management bonus scheme and a similar range of taxable benefits, and is consistent with the 
group used as comparators for this purpose in previous financial years. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the Group’s employees are on legacy 
employment arrangements as a result of having transferred into the business or are entitled to remuneration arrangements determined by customers 
rather than the Group.

 Tim Lawlor joined the Group from 28 September 2015 as Chief Financial Officer and therefore his remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2016 is prorated for his appointment period.
3
 The taxable benefits comprise the gross value of those benefits provided to the Executive Directors, including company car allowance and healthcare. The value of company car allowance 
provided during the year ending 31 March 2017 was £25,000 for Adrian Colman and £15,600 for Tim Lawlor.
4
 The pension related benefits comprise the amounts contributed to the defined contribution section of the Company’s pension scheme or the salary supplement provided in lieu of such 
contributions where the value exceeds the annual allowance set by HMRC.

 The value of long term incentives for the year ended 31 March 2017 includes awards vesting for performance during the financial year under the legacy 2013 SOP , calculated based on the 
embedded gain between the option price and the share price on date of vest. For the July 2013 SOP award the embedded gain was £1.10 per share (based on the share price at date of vesting 
of £1.78). Further details can be found on page 51.

Executive Directors’ salaries
Executive Directors’ salaries are reviewed annually with any change effective from 1 July.
During the year, the Committee awarded a 1.5% increase to the Chief Executive and 1.7% increase to the Chief Financial Officer effective from 1 July 
2016, aligned with the average budgeted salary increase across the Group. The salaries of the Executive Directors as at 31 March 201 7 and with effect 
from 1 July 201 7 are set out in the following table and the increases are in line with that for the wider employee population:

T otal pension scheme entitlements (audited)
Adrian Colman and Tim Lawlor are members of a defined contribution section of the Wincanton plc Pension Scheme. During the year the Company 
paid an employers’ pension contribution equivalent to 22% of Adrian Colman’s pensionable salary and 1 5% of Tim Lawlor’s pensionable salary. 
Where the individual’s pension exceeded the HMRC annual allowance in the 2016/1 7 tax year, the excess was paid in the form of a taxable cash 
payment. Executive Director pension arrangements for year ended 31 March 2018 will be consistent with this approach.
Employment benefits
Executive Directors’ employment benefits for the year ended 31 March 201 7 were provided on the same basis as for the previous incumbent of the role 
in the prior financial year, and will continue to be provided in the next financial year.
The Senior Management Annual Bonus Plan for the year ending 31 March 201 7 (audited)
The Senior Management Annual Bonus Plan came into effect on 1 April 201 5. The Annual Bonus is normally paid in cash, however if the share 
ownership guideline is yet to be achieved, any bonus earned above 100% of salary must be used by the Executive Director to purchase Wincanton 
shares until the share ownership guideline is achieved. The performance conditions for the year ended 31 March 201 7 were 60% weighted on Group 
financial performance (underlying operating profit) and 40% weighted on performance against personal objectives. Of the personal objective 
proportion, half was weighted on financial and half weighted on non-financial objectives.
The Senior Management Annual Bonus Plan performance for the year ended 31 March 201 7 (audited)
Both Executive Directors were eligible for an Annual Bonus award for the year ended 31 March 201 7 . The maximum bonus opportunity for the year 
ended 31 March 201 7 for Adrian Colman was 1 50% of salary and for Tim Lawlor was 1 20% of salary.
The Annual Bonus award for the year ended 31 March 201 7 was determined by the level of satisfaction of the performance conditions and of the 
financial and personal objectives, as set out below.
Annual Bonus awarded based on underlying operating profit performance target for the year ended 31 March 201 7

Bonus opportunity on the underlying operating profit element 8% 50% 100% 71.6%
ABP awarded based on achievement of personal objectives for the year ended 31 March 201 7
The personal financial objectives for Adrian Colman and Tim Lawlor for the year ended 31 March 201 7 included: repaying and refinancing the Group’s 
bank debt; working with the Pension Trustee to strengthen the pension deficit reduction strategies; development of the dividend model and policy; 
delivery of Group financial performance at or above market consensus; and growth of revenue through annualised sale wins above prior year revenue. 
The personal non-financial objectives for Adrian Colman and Tim Lawlor for the year ended 31 March 201 7 included: talent strengthening and structural 
changes; refocus of sales and marketing strategies and functions; implementation and delivery of the strategy (set out on page 14); greater engagement 
with largest customers; operational improvement targets to support the strategy and growth in propositioning and innovation; continue to improve 
health and safety performance; and complete the IS infrastructure programme.
The Committee considered the performance of both Executive Directors, and reviewed the level of achievement against each of their respective 
objectives summarised above. Debt repayments had been made as planned and the refinancing had been completed to October 2021 at lower rates, 
avoiding renewal during the Brexit negotiation timetable. A new investment strategy has been agreed and implemented in respect of the Pension 
Fund aimed at minimising the financial impact of political uncertainty impacting the pension deficit, the dividend policy has been communicated 
and well received by shareholders and dividends had resumed. The Group’s financial performance for the year had exceeded target and market 
consensus. Annualised sales targets were just short of the numerical target but were supported with a strong pipeline and pre-pipeline for the current 
and next financial years at the in year target levels set. People changes and the talent strengthening programme had been completed without business 
disruption with appointments of a new Managing Director of Industrial & Transport, a new Business & Optimisation Director, Group HR Director and 
Chief Marketing Officer. Delivery of the strategy has been implemented and has started to deliver the objectives intended, as detailed in the Chief 
Executive’s statement on pages 16 to 1 9. Health and safety performance has been strong with LTIFR reduced from 0.71 to 0.68, and the IS infrastructure 
programme has been completed, both mitigating principal areas of risk to the Group. Following due consideration of the evidence to support 
achievement of each of the objectives, together with their overall annual performance review, the Committee concluded that both of the Executive 
Directors had performed strongly in all areas of their financial and non-financial bonus objectives which had directly resulted in a strong Group 
performance and a Group well positioned for growth and the future, to the benefit of all of its stakeholders.

  Adrian Colman Tim Lawlor

Following consideration of the above, the Committee awarded an annual bonus equivalent to £477 ,528 (being 109.4% of salary) to Adrian Colman and 
£276,988 (being 92.3% of salary) to Tim Lawlor, based on their salary at the end of the year ended 31 March 201 7 .
Long term incentives – Special Option Plan (audited)
The SOP is the Company’s LTIP put in place under the previous remuneration policy, which ended on 31 March 201 5. SOP awards were made as market 
priced options, which meant that the Executive Directors would only realise value to the extent that the options vested, following satisfaction of the 
performance conditions and if the share price had increased above the option price. The 2014 SOP options due to vest in July 201 7 and December 201 7 
are the last awards made under this Plan.
Performance targets
Threshold vesting (25% of maximum) under the SOP requires average TSR growth to exceed 10% per annum. Full vesting would be achieved for 
average TSR growth of 22% per annum during the three year period from date of award, with straight-line vesting between points. There is also an EPS 
underpin which requires no reduction to the underlying EPS at any point during the relevant three year period. If EPS reduces at any point during the 
relevant three year period, the relevant awards would lapse in full regardless of TSR growth. These performance conditions apply to all SOP awards.
Awards vesting in the year ended 31 March 201 7 (audited)

 The option price is calculated using the three day average share price immediately preceding the date of award.

 For the award made on 12 July 2013, average annual TSR growth was 54% (maximum vesting at 22%) and EPS did not reduce over the three year period, therefore the awards vested in full.

 The value of these awards for the purpose of the single figure is based on embedded gain, calculated as the difference between option price of 68p per share and the share price at date of vest. 
L TIP for the year ended 31 March 201 7 (audited)
From 1 April 201 5 the new LTIP , approved by the Company’s shareholders at the AGM on 16 July 2014, came into force. During the year, LTIP awards were 
made in accordance with the LTIP rules and the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (approved at the 2014 AGM) on 21 July 2016 and 14 November 2016.
Performance targets
Performance metrics for the 2016 LTIP award were consistent with the performance metrics applied to the 201 5 LTIP awards. The two metrics are 
TSR and EPS, weighted 60% on basic underlying EPS and 40% on TSR relative to the FTSE All-Share Index (excluding investment trusts). The threshold 
(entry point) for 25% vesting of the TSR element requires the Company’s TSR to be equal to the TSR of the Index itself and 100% vesting requires the 
Company’s TSR to be equivalent to the upper quartile of the Index which is calibrated as Index + 10% per annum (ie 33% outperformance of the Index 
over the three year term of the award). EPS is measured on a point-to-point basis over the three year period in aggregate, with 25% of the EPS element 
vesting at the threshold (entry point) of 6% growth per annum and 100% vesting for 1 1% growth per annum. There is straight-line vesting between 
threshold and maximum. Both performance measures are measured over three financial years.
Awards made in the year ended 31 March 201 7 (audited)
LTIP awards to the Executive Directors during the year are set out below, based on 100% of salary for both the Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer. The EPS and TSR performance period for the 21 July 2016 awards is 1 April 2016 to 31 March 201 9.

Operation of the Annual Bonus Plan and L TIP in the year ended 31 March 2018
The Group intends to operate each remuneration element in the year ended 31 March 2018, including the ABP and L TIP and their respective performance 
conditions and opportunities, in broadly the same way as in the year ended 31 March 201 7 . For 2018, the annual bonus is based 60% on Group profit 
before tax, and 40% on performance against personal objectives (of which half is weighted on financial and half weighted on non-financial targets). 
The Committee considers it commercially sensitive to disclose annual bonus targets prospectively and will provide disclosure of these in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2018. The Committee expects performance metrics for the 201 7 L TIP award will be consistent with 
the performance metrics applied to the 2016 L TIP awards, and be based 60% on basic underlying EPS and 40% on TSR relative to the FTSE All-Share Index 
(excluding investment trusts). The threshold (entry point) for 25% vesting of the TSR element requires the Company’s TSR to be equal to the TSR of the 
Index itself and 100% vesting requires the Company’s TSR to be equivalent to the upper quartile of the Index which is calibrated as Index + 10% per 
annum (i.e. 33% outperformance of the Index over the three year term of the award). EPS is measured on a point-to-point basis over the three year period 
in aggregate, with 25% of the EPS element vesting at the threshold (entry point) of 6% growth per annum and 100% vesting for 1 1 % growth per annum. 
There is straight-line vesting between threshold and maximum. Both performance measures are measured over three financial years.

Share ownership policy
Employee share ownership is a key part of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and is designed to help maintain long term commitment through 
accountability and business understanding, and provide the opportunity to benefit from growth in Group value as shareholders. Adrian Colman 
is required to build and maintain a shareholding level of 300% of salary, which he met during the year ended 31 March 2016.
Tim Lawlor joined the Company on 28 September 201 5 and has not met the minimum shareholding guideline of 1 50% of salary that applies to new 
Executive Directors under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy during the year. In accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy effective from 
1 April 201 5, Tim Lawlor is expected to purchase shares with any bonus above 100% of salary until the shareholding guideline is achieved.

Executive Directors
Salary
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Salaries are set at a sufficient level to recruit and retain individuals of the necessary quality to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Operation Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with changes effective 1 July.
Salaries are typically set after considering:
• the responsibilities of each individual role;
• progression within role;
• individual performance;
• an individual’s experience; and
• salary levels in companies of a similar size and complexity.
Salaries may be adjusted and any increase will ordinarily be (in percentage of salary terms) in line with those 
of the wider workforce.
Increases beyond those granted to the wider workforce may be awarded in certain circumstances such as:
• where there is a change in responsibility;
• progression in the role;
• material market misalignment; or
• a significant increase in the scale of the role and/or size, value and/or complexity of the Group.
Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider employee population, the Committee will provide an explanation 
in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Benefits
Purpose and link 
to strategy
The Group provides the appropriate benefits for Executive Directors in a business of this size in order to recruit and retain 
individuals of the necessary quality to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Operation Benefits include but are not limited to:
• Company car or car allowance;
• Private medical insurance for the Executive Director and their direct family;
• Personal accident and travel insurance; and
• Death in service cover.
In addition, relocation assistance is available on a case by case basis. Assistance may include, but is not limited to, facilitating 
and/or meeting the costs of removal and other relocation costs, children’s education, a limited amount of family travel and tax 
equalisation arrangements and may extend to facilitating and/or meeting the costs of re-establishing them to their previous 
location at the end of the employment or assignment.
Opportunity Benefits vary by role and individual circumstance and eligibility is reviewed periodically. Benefits are not anticipated to exceed 
10% of salary per annum over the period for which this policy applies. The Committee retains the discretion to approve a 
higher cost in exceptional circumstances (e.g. relocation) or in circumstances where factors outside of the Group’s control 
have materially changed (eg costs of medical premiums). If this occurs, the Committee will provide details and rationale 
in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee regularly reviews the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
to ensure it supports shareholder interests and closely reflects business 
strategy. When setting the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, the 
Committee considers the following:
• business strategy;
• total remuneration levels operating in companies of a similar size and 
complexity such as:
 – revenue and scale of operation;
 – number of employees;
 – market capitalisation and enterprise value;
 – customer base; and
 – geographic reach;
• the responsibilities of each individual role;
• individual performance; and
• each individual’s experience.
Following a thorough and comprehensive review, we believe that our 
Remuneration Policy continues to be appropriate, and are therefore 
proposing the Policy remains broadly unchanged. In recognition of 
emerging best practice, we have updated our Policy to reduce the 
pension contribution for new Executive Director appointments to 1 5% of 
salary, to be in line with pension arrangements for other senior managers. 
The Committee has also reviewed the flexibility under the Policy for the 
Annual Bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan, in line with market practice, 
in order that the Committee can review performance measures and 
weightings ahead of each award to ensure they reinforce the business 
strategy. The policy will be proposed to shareholders at the 201 7 AGM for 
approval, with the intention that it will become effective from 1 July 201 7 , 
if approved.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY All employee share plans
Purpose and link 
to strategy
The Company encourages voluntary participation in share ownership throughout the Group where share plans are 
appropriate.
Operation of all 
employee share plans
Under the current all employee share plan arrangements, Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Company’s 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP).
Participants make monthly contributions from their gross salary to buy Partnership Shares. The Company currently awards one 
Matching Share for every four Partnership Shares acquired. In addition, any dividends paid in respect of shares held under the 
SIP are used to buy Dividend Shares.
Opportunity In line with HMRC limits, the rules of the Company’s SIP set out the following maximum levels, which may be amended from 
time to time so that they are in line with legislation:
Free Shares – The maximum value of Free Shares per tax year is £3,600.
Partnership Shares bought by employees – The maximum pre-tax salary that can be used to buy Partnership Shares is £1,800 
per annum.
Matching Shares – The Company can match employees’ Partnership Share purchases by giving them additional shares. 
The maximum award of Matching Shares is two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share bought. The Company currently 
awards one Matching Share for every four Partnership Shares bought.
Pension
Purpose and link 
to strategy
The Group provides the appropriate pension provision for Executive Directors in a business of this size in order to recruit and 
retain individuals of the necessary quality to deliver the Group’s strategy.
Operation of pension 
arrangements
Executive Directors are entitled to join the defined contribution section of the Wincanton plc Pension Scheme. In certain 
circumstances, for example where the annual allowance level set by HMRC is exceeded, the pension provision will be in the 
form of a taxable cash supplement.
Opportunity Up to 22% of pensionable salary for existing Directors, reducing to 1 5% of pensionable salary for appointments of Executive 
Directors from 1 July 201 7 .
Annual Bonus
Purpose and link 
to strategy
The aim of the annual bonus is to incentivise and recognise the Executive Directors annual contribution to the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy by rewarding performance against stretching financial and personal objectives; and reinforce achievement 
of the shareholding requirement.
Operation Performance is measured over each financial year. Performance measure weightings and individual objectives are reviewed 
prior to the start of the financial year to ensure they remain appropriate and reinforce the business strategy. Performance 
targets are set annually to ensure they are appropriately stretching and reflect those strategic objectives. At the end of the 
year, the Committee determines the extent to which these targets were achieved.
The annual bonus is normally settled in cash. However, if the share ownership guideline is yet to be achieved, any annual 
bonus earned above 100% of salary must be used by the Executive Director to purchase Wincanton shares until the share 
ownership guideline is achieved. All bonus awards are at the discretion of the Committee.
Opportunity An Executive Director’s annual bonus cannot exceed 1 50% of salary.
A bonus of up to 25% of maximum is payable for ‘Threshold’ performance, 50% of maximum for ‘T arget’ performance and 
up to 100% of the bonus is earned for ‘Maximum’ performance, with straight-line vesting in between.
Performance measure Annual performance is typically based on achievement of profit targets and personal objectives.
Normally, the Committee would expect the profit element to have a minimum weighting of 60% and a maximum weighting 
of 80%, and achievement of personal objectives to have a minimum weighting of 20% and a maximum weighting of 40%. 
However, it retains discretion to adjust weightings to align with the business plan for each year.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee have the ability to exercise discretion to override the formulaic bonus outcome 
within the limits of the plan where it believes the outcome is not truly reflective of performance and to ensure fairness to both 
shareholders and participants.
Recovery provisions Clawback and malus provisions exist in respect of misstatements and misconduct.
Wincanton plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts Long term incentives
Purpose and link 
to strategy
The aim of the long term incentive is to incentivise and recognise the performance of Executive Directors in respect of their 
contribution to the delivery of the Group’s strategy over the longer term by rewarding strong financial performance and 
sustained increase in shareholder value.
Operation Performance is measured over a period of no less than three years.
The Committee reviews the performance measure weightings ahead of each award to ensure alignment with Wincanton’s 
strategy and has discretion to adjust weightings to ensure alignment to that strategy. Performance targets are reviewed ahead  
of each performance period and the Committee has discretion to adjust targets to ensure they remain appropriate and 
stretching. T argets are set having regard to a number of internal and external reference points.
Awards may be granted as nil cost options or conditional share awards. Dividends or dividend equivalents may accrue 
on LTIP awards and be paid in shares or cash on those shares which vest.
Opportunity Maximum award levels for Executive Directors are 100% of salary. In exceptional circumstances, for example on recruitment, 
individual awards may be granted up to 250% of salary.
Up to 25% of an award vests for ‘Threshold’ performance and 100% of an award vests for ‘Maximum’ performance.
Performance measures Performance measures for 201 7 awards will be TSR relative to an appropriate comparator group and EPS growth, weighted 
40% and 60% respectively. The Committee will review the performance measures, their weightings and performance targets 
in advance of each award to ensure alignment with strategy.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has the ability to exercise discretion to override the formulaic performance 
outcome downwards to ensure alignment of pay with the underlying performance of the business during the performance 
period.
Recovery provisions Clawback and malus provisions exist in respect of vested and unvested awards in circumstances of misstatement 
and misconduct.
Shareholding guidelines
Purpose and link 
to strategy
Shareholding guidelines ensure alignment between Executive Directors and shareholders.
Operation Shareholding guidelines are for any new Executive Director to accrue and then maintain a holding of shares with a value 
of 1 50% of their salary as assessed by the Committee from time to time. For Executive Directors in place before 1 April 201 5, 
the shareholding guideline is 300% of salary. Any bonus achieved in excess of 100% of salary will be required to be used 
to purchase shares until the shareholding guideline is met.
Non-executive Directors
Purpose and link to 
strategy
The Company seeks to attract and retain a high calibre Chairman and Non-executive Directors by offering market competitive 
fee levels.
Operation On the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-executive Director, the fees will be set taking into account the experience 
and calibre of the individual.
Neither the Chairman nor the Non-executive Directors participate in any of the Company’s short or long term incentive 
arrangements, nor do they receive benefits or pension provision. They are however, reimbursed for reasonable costs incurred 
in carrying out their role.
The Chairman receives an annual fee. The Non-executive Directors receive an annual base fee and additional fees are paid 
to reflect additional responsibilities, such as chairing a Board Committee.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors receive their annual fee paid in monthly instalments. The fee of the Chairman is 
set by the Committee and the fees of the Non-executive Directors are approved by the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Chairman and Chief Executive.
Opportunity Fee levels are reviewed on a periodic basis, and may be increased taking into account factors such as the time commitment 
of the role and market levels in companies of a similar size and complexity. Fees for the Chairman and Non-executive Directors 
will not exceed the limit as set out in the Company’s Articles of Association (£500,000 in aggregate as at the date of this report).

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED • determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) 
for incentive-plan purposes, based on the plan rules and the 
appropriate treatment under the plan rules; and
• adjustments required in certain circumstances (eg rights issues, share 
buybacks, special dividends, other corporate events, etc.).
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be explained 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration. As appropriate, it might also 
be the subject of consultation with the Company’s major shareholders.
Minor changes
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Policy set out 
above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes 
or to take account of a change in legislation) without requiring prior 
shareholder approval for that amendment.
Payments from existing awards
Any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after 1 July 201 7 
(being the date on which the Policy will become effective, subject to 
shareholder approval) will be honoured. Such commitments include:
• Legacy SOP awards granted under the remuneration policy which 
expired on 31 March 201 5. These legacy SOP awards will continue 
until they vest or expire, subject to achieving stretching performance 
conditions. During the year, the July 201 3 SOP awards vested, and 
the 2014 SOP awards for Adrian Colman are due to vest subject 
to achievement of performance conditions in July 201 7 . After July 
201 7 , there will be no remaining unvested executive remuneration 
arrangements from this legacy remuneration policy. Further details of 
bonus payments and share awards made during the year are disclosed 
in this report on pages 49 to 52.
• 201 5 and 2016 LTIP awards granted under the Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM, vesting after three years 
based on EPS and TSR performance conditions. Further details of these 
awards can be found on page 52.
Differences between the Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors and employees generally
Pay mix – The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is more heavily weighted 
towards variable pay than for other employees, to make a greater part 
of their pay conditional on the delivery of the Company’s strategy and 
performance. Wincanton’s approach to salary reviews is consistent across 
the Group.
Bonus – The eligibility to participate and receive a bonus, and the level of 
bonus available, is dependent on the role and level of seniority within the 
business and Group structure. During the year, the Company operated 
two bonus schemes for senior talent, the Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) for 
executive management and a General Management Bonus Scheme. 
In addition, some employees are eligible for a bonus depending on the 
customer contract on which they work and for new business won under 
a new Super Sales Bonus Scheme.
Long term incentives – Up to 30 senior managers in the Group, such 
as the Executive Directors and other senior employees with key skills 
and experience or that perform key roles which significantly drive value 
in the Group, are annually awarded LTIPs. Such awards are intended 
to encourage sustainable long term value generation and align senior 
employees’ interests with our shareholders.
Pensions – All employees, including the Executive Directors, are eligible 
to become members of one of the defined contribution sections of 
the Wincanton plc Pension Scheme. The level of employers’ pension 
contribution for employees is determined by their level of seniority 
and/or age. The Remuneration Committee were keen to ensure the 
maximum pension employer contribution was aligned between the 
Executive Directors and the senior management population, being the 
highest maximum level of employer pension contribution, and therefore 
NOTES TO THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
These notes are intended to provide guidance on the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy to aid understanding of its practical application 
and are reviewed annually. No change to the explanations represent 
a change to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
Incentives
For the Annual Bonus, the profit performance reflects the basis on which 
the Group is managed: sustained profit performance improvement 
should enable the Group to improve its balance sheet to maintain a 
sound financial position and secure the long term success of the Group 
for the benefit of all of its stakeholders.
For the Long Term Incentive, the Committee believes EPS provides a 
good line of sight for Executive Directors, and that relative TSR aligns 
Executive Director remuneration with shareholder interests and takes 
into account the impact of external environment changes on Company 
performance. Ahead of each performance cycle, the Committee may 
review and adjust the TSR comparator group for future cycles to ensure 
relevance to Wincanton. The Committee may adjust the TSR comparator 
group of outstanding cycles in the event that a TSR comparator ceases 
to exist, de-lists or is acquired or the Committee deems it to be no longer 
a suitable comparator.
The performance measures applying to awards are reviewed ahead of 
each award to ensure they continue to support shareholders’ interests 
and are appropriately aligned to Wincanton’s long-term strategy.
When setting performance targets for short and long term incentives, the 
Committee considers a range of internal and external reference points: 
such as the Company’s strategic plan, consensus market forecasts, past 
Company performance and the performance ranges for comparator 
companies. The Committee then sets incentive targets that are stretching 
and achievable.
By measuring the personal performance of an Executive Director, 
the Committee is able to monitor performance against other key 
strategic objectives.
Incentive Plan discretions
The Committee operates the Company’s incentive plans according to 
their respective rules and Remuneration Policy, and in accordance with 
the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant.
In line with common market practice, the Committee retains discretion 
as to the operation and administration of these incentive plans, including 
with respect to:
• who participates;
• the timing of grant and/or payment;
• the size of an award and/or payment (within the plan limits approved 
by shareholders);
• the manner in which awards are settled;
• the choice of (and adjustment of) performance measures and targets 
in accordance with the Remuneration Policy set out above and the 
plan rules;
• in exceptional circumstances, amendment of any performance 
conditions applying to an award – provided the new performance 
conditions are considered fair and reasonable, and are neither materially 
more nor materially less challenging than the original performance 
targets when set;
• discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event 
of a variation of share capital, change of control, special dividend, 
distribution or any other corporate event which may affect the current 
or future value of an award;
Wincanton plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 57
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts Compensation for forfeited awards would only be considered on a 
matching fair value basis. When the Company announces an Executive 
Director appointment, if applicable, it will provide an explanation of the 
reasons for a compensation award being granted, and a breakdown of 
that payment.
In the case of an internal promotion, any outstanding variable pay 
awarded in relation to the previous role will be continued on the 
original terms.
Executive Directors’ service contracts
All Executive Directors are appointed on the basis of a 1 2 month rolling 
period in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, subject to election 
and annual re-election by the Company’s shareholders at the AGM.
Under the Executive Directors’ service contracts, the Company is required 
to give 1 2 months’ notice and the Executive Director six months’ notice 
of termination.
Payments on termination and change of control
If notice is served by either party, the Executive Director can continue 
to receive basic salary, taxable benefits and pension provision for the 
duration of their notice period during which time the Company may 
require the individual to continue to fulfil their current duties or may 
assign a period of ‘garden leave’. The Committee will take account of 
an Executive Director’s duty to mitigate their loss. There are no other 
arrangements in place between the Company and its Directors that 
provide for remuneration for loss of office following a change of control 
of the Company.
In addition to the contractual provisions regarding payment on 
termination, the Group’s incentive plans and share schemes contain 
provisions for termination of employment, based on ‘good leaver’ and 
‘bad leaver’ treatment. Good leavers are typically defined as participants 
who leave early on account of injury, disability or ill health, death, a sale 
of their employer or business in which they were employed, statutory 
redundancy, retirement, or any other reason at the discretion of the 
Committee. Bad leavers are employees that leave for any other reason. 
In circumstances of termination on notice the Committee will determine 
an equitable remuneration package, having regard to the particular 
circumstances of the case.
For good leavers, payment of an annual bonus is normally tested on full 
financial year performance and the amount payable is then pro rated 
for the period worked by the Executive Director in the financial year. 
There is no provision for an amount in lieu of bonus to be payable for any 
part of the notice period not worked, with Committee discretion to treat 
otherwise. Bad leavers lose any right to the annual bonus.
A good leaver would not forfeit long term incentive awards on cessation 
of employment. The awards would continue to be held by the good 
leaver until vest, on the normal vesting date or earlier at the discretion of 
the Committee, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions 
of the award. Awards would be adjusted pro rata for the amount of 
vesting period worked by the Executive Director, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise. Bad leavers would forfeit all unvested long term 
incentive awards held.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive 
Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or otherwise) 
to additional amounts which would need to be met, for example 
in a redundancy situation. In addition, the Committee retains discretion 
to settle any other amounts reasonably due to the Executive Director, 
for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director 
in connection with the termination of employment, where the Company 
wishes to enter into a settlement agreement (as provided for below) 
and the individual must seek independent legal advice.
reduced the maximum contribution for new Executive Directors to 
the same level as senior management in the proposed Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy intended to become effective on 1 July 201 7 , 
subject to shareholder approval.
Share Incentive Plan – The Company operates a tax-advantaged SIP 
and actively promotes SIP participation to all employees to align their 
interests to delivery of Group strategy and performance by providing 
the opportunity to become shareholders in order to share in the Group’s 
growth and success. Within the SIP all participants are currently eligible 
to receive one matched share for every four shares purchased.
Employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
When making remuneration decisions, to ensure there is a fair and 
consistent approach to remuneration, the Committee considers pay 
and employment conditions across the Group, such as determination of 
salary increases to Executive Directors with reference to the range of base 
pay increases within the Group. The Committee also reviews base salaries, 
pension provision, annual bonuses and LTIP awards for the EMT.
The Committee does not formally consult with employees on a routine 
basis but does so if any significant changes to Group remuneration and 
employment policies are proposed. The Committee receives information 
on the annual base salary reviews across the Group and the annual bonus 
and LTIP awards made to employees that report into the EMT and below. 
The Committee members, as Directors, receive the annual employee 
consultation results which are presented to the Board.
Consideration of shareholders’ views
The Committee considers best practice developments and publications 
from institutional investors and shareholder bodies as well as any 
shareholder views expressed during dialogue. The Committee is 
committed to maintaining an open and consultative dialogue with 
Company shareholders and shareholder bodies and intends to consult 
extensively when reviewing or making substantive changes to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy. During the year, the Remuneration 
Committee wrote to its largest shareholders and selected shareholder 
bodies in February 201 7 to seek engagement on the largely unaltered 
Directors Remuneration Policy, ahead of its presentation to shareholders 
for a binding vote at the 201 7 AGM in June. There were no material 
comments and feedback was positive.
Remuneration on recruitment of an Executive Director
When making an appointment of a new Director, including by way 
of internal promotion, remuneration packages and fees are set in 
accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
To determine the appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, 
the Committee will consider relevant factors such as: the experience 
and calibre of the individual, the quantum/nature of remuneration, 
the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited, the role 
requirements, and the market benchmark. Initial salaries may be set 
below market rate and consideration given to phasing any increases over 
two or three years subject to development in the role. Normal variable 
pay will be subject to the maximums set out in the tables within the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy on pages 54 to 59.
The Committee may consider it is appropriate to grant one off awards 
to compensate new Executive Directors in respect of incentive 
arrangements forfeited when leaving a former employer. In doing so, 
the Committee would consider relevant factors, including: the structure 
of the awards forfeited; the strength of the performance conditions 
attached to those awards; and the likelihood of those conditions 
being met. To the extent that it is not possible or practical to provide 
compensation within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive 
plans, a bespoke arrangement could be created in accordance with 
the discretion permitted to the Committee under the Listing Rules.

consultancy arrangements. These are intended to be used in exceptional 
circumstances and only would be entered into where the Committee 
believed that it was in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders to do so.

Registered in England and Wales No. 4 1 78808
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Group 
and parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law, they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under UK company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the Group and parent Company 
in respect of that financial period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable 
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have a general 
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Under applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply 
with those laws and regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
The UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as each Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information which the Company’s auditor is unaware 
of, and each Director has taken all the steps they should have taken in 
their duty as a Director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and ensure that the Company’s auditor would be made 
aware of that information.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 4. Employment practices
The Group has assessed the impact of the legislation on Group 
employment practices and processes, including Wincanton’s use of 
agencies, from an HR and Procurement perspective. In conjunction 
with external advice, the employment practices and processes have 
been thoroughly reviewed and updated where relevant, and all 
updated policies and practices have been communicated and cascaded 
throughout the Group. Localised training and support has continued 
to be provided to all Group employees by their designated HR teams. 
In addition, the HR function are working on a Code of Conduct to 
summarise the key policies and standards with the intention that this 
will be rolled out within the Group during 201 7 . A project to consider 
the use and risks specific to agencies has commenced and standards 
to be applied have been agreed. Revisions to policy and practices 
are in progress and will be completed and rolled out throughout the 
Group and to the agency suppliers during 201 7 .
Delivery of the four strategic steps and ongoing compliance of practices 
and processes introduced or updated, is supported by the Group’s 
established governance processes. All Group policies and processes 
are reviewed at least annually to ensure they remain relevant, up‑ to‑ date 
and elevate behavioural standards and ethical conduct to reflect the 
Group’s values and importance of social responsibility in our supply chain 
and business, for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 
As with all other regulatory and legislative requirements, the Group 
expects the nature, root causes and circumstances that lead to modern 
slavery and human trafficking, in all its forms, will change and evolve 
over time driven by external factors and as such new requirements, 
circumstances and risks could arise. The Group will continue to be vigilant, 
proactive, and closely and regularly review the four strategic steps and 
influential factors to ensure Group policies and practices remain fit for 
purpose and address any new or emerging risks or developments 
throughout the year.
The Directors approved the above statement on 16 May 201 7 .
Alison Dowling
Company Secretary
Wincanton plc 
Registered in England and Wales No. 4 1 78808
STATEMENT ON THE MODERN SLAVERY ACT
Wincanton takes its ethical standards and conduct very seriously and 
sets out its requirements for suppliers in procurement and ethics policies. 
The Group are committed to requiring its supply chain understand 
its standards and expectations on anti‑ bribery and corruption, legal 
compliance and ethical conduct.
This statement is provided in compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 
201 5 and sets the Group’s approach to prohibiting any form of forced 
labour or slavery throughout its supply chain.
Upon commencement of the legislation in 201 5, Wincanton reviewed 
its employment and procurement activities in line with the new 
legislative requirements and set out the following four strategic steps 
it had taken or was in the process of taking to ensure compliance with 
the legislation:
1. produce and communicate a Strategy Statement and Modern 
Slavery Policy;
2. assessment of current suppliers;
3. embed additional due diligence within our procurement activities; and
4. review our employment practices and processes, including 
the use of agencies.
Following on from the activities set out in our statement last year, there 
has been continued progress and activities to deliver the four strategic 
steps during the year ended 31 March 201 7 as set out below: 
1. Strategy statement and policy 
The production of a statement and policy, together with related policy 
amendments, were all undertaken and communicated, as reported last 
year. During the year ended 31 March 201 7 the Group’s HR function, 
in conjunction with our external legal advisers, have reviewed the 
Statement and Policy and related policies to ensure they remain 
compliant and fit for purpose. They have also continued to oversee, 
communicate and provide training on the Group’s expectations and 
responsibilities of employees.
2. Assessment of current suppliers
As reported last year, the Group completed an assessment of its current 
suppliers by size and risk, and all suppliers were sent a letter setting 
out the Group’s requirements for their compliance with the legislation. 
Those suppliers identified as being of highest risk were also requested 
to provide details of their strategy and approach to compliance 
with the legislation. Responses from these suppliers were reviewed 
and a continued assessment of suppliers is being undertaken.
3. Procurement due diligence
The Procurement function have incorporated additional due diligence 
into their pre‑ qualification process, when tendering and procuring new 
suppliers and undertaking renewals. All suppliers must agree and comply 
with the Wincanton Modern Slavery Policy and the Procurement Code of 
Ethics which encapsulate the legislative requirements, in order to provide 
goods and services to the Group. Additional work has been underway 
during the year to develop a Supplier Code to further drive higher ethical 
standards, above and beyond compliance requirements, and this is 
expected to be rolled out to all suppliers regardless of size during 201 7 .

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest
effect on our audit, in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows.
We continue to perform procedures over Goodwill. However, following continued significant levels of headroom and an
insensitivity to key assumptions, we have not assessed this as one of the risks that had the greatest effect on our audit.
Therefore it is not separately identified in our report this year.
The risk Our response
Group pension obligation
£1,156.7 million 
(2016: £1,001.0 million)
Refer to page 42 (Audit 
Committee Report), page 75 
(accounting policy) and pages 91 
to 94 (financial disclosures).
Subjective valuation
Significant estimates are made in 
valuing the Group's funded pension 
obligation (before deducting scheme 
assets) and small changes in either the 
assumptions or estimates used may 
have a significant effect on the results 
and financial position of the Group.
Our procedures included: 
— Benchmarking assumptions: challenging, 
with the support of our actuarial specialists, 
the key assumptions applied, being the 
discount rate, inflation rate and 
mortality/life expectancy, by comparison 
against externally derived data; and
— Assessing transparency: considering the 
adequacy of the Group's disclosures in 
respect of the sensitivity of the obligation 
(and deficit) to these assumptions
Property provisions
£16.5 million 
(2016: £15.3 million)
Refer to page 42 (Audit 
Committee Report), pages 74 and 
75 (accounting policy) and page 
89 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
The Group carries onerous lease and 
dilapidation provisions in relation to 
sites for which the Group is a lessee. 
The calculation of these provisions
requires the Directors to make a 
number of judgements and estimates 
and requires ongoing trading conditions 
and market sentiment to be reflected 
as time progresses.
The key inputs to the calculation of the 
provisions are the discount rate, the 
forecast cash-flows and assessment of 
market sentiment (void and rent-free 
period assumptions).
Our procedures included: 
— Benchmarking assumptions: comparing 
the key assumptions (market rent, discount 
rate) used to externally derived data;
— Assessing expert's credentials:
evaluation of competence and 
independence of an external expert used 
by the Group in estimating the dilapidation 
provisions;
— Historical comparisons: comparing the 
previously forecast cash flows to actuals to 
assess the historical accuracy of 
forecasting;
— Our sector experience: assessing, with 
the support of our own property specialists 
where relevant, significant changes in 
market sentiment (market rent, void and 
rent-free period assumptions) affecting the 
onerous lease provisions and expected 
cash outflows used in calculation of 
dilapidation provisions;
— Personnel interviews: corroborating 
judgements through discussions with both 
finance and property teams; and
— Assessing transparency: considering the 
adequacy of the Group's disclosures in 
respect of the provisions.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 65 3. Our application of materiality and an
overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the financial statements as a
whole was set at £1.8 million (2016: £1.4 million)
determined with reference to a benchmark of
Group profit before taxation, of £45.4 million, of
which it represents 4.0% (2016: 4.2% of profit
before taxation normalised to exclude the
exceptional profit on disposal of Wincanton
Records Management of £32.4 million).
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected
or uncorrected identified misstatements
exceeding £0.1 million (2016: £0.1 million), in
addition to other identified misstatements that
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
With the exception of the Guernsey component
(Risk Underwriting (Guernsey) Limited), the Group
team performed the audit of the Group as if it
was a single aggregated set of financial
information using the materiality level set out
above.
We subjected the Guernsey component to
specified risk-focused audit procedures over
Insurance provisions. The audit of the Guernsey
component was performed by a component
auditor and the audit of the rest of the Group by
the Group team.
The Group team instructed the component
auditor as to the significant areas to be covered,
including the relevant risks detailed above and the
information to be reported back. The Group team
approved the component materiality of £1.0
million (2016: £1.0 million) having regard to the
mix of size and risk profile of the Group.
Overall, the audit of the Group covered 100%
(2016: 100%) of total Group revenue, Group profit
before tax, and total Group assets.
Telephone conference meetings were held with
the component auditor. At these meetings, the
findings reported to the Group team were
discussed in more detail, and any further work
required by the Group team was then performed
by the component auditor.

CONTINUED 4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
— the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
— the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
— we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
— in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we
have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation
to:
— the Directors’ statement of Principal risks and
uncertainties on pages 24 to 27, concerning the 
principal risks, their management, and, based on that, 
the Directors’ assessment and expectations of the 
Group’s continuing in operation over the three years to 
31 March 2020; or 
— the disclosures in Note 1 of the financial statements 
concerning the use of the going concern basis of 
accounting.
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters
on which we are required to report by exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our
audit, we have identified other information in the annual
report that contains a material inconsistency with either that
knowledge or the financial statements, a material
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
— we have identified material inconsistencies between
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
— the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
— the parent Company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or  
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
— we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
— the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 60 and 25, 
in relation to going concern and longer-term viability; 
and      
— the part of the Corporate Governance Report on page 
37 relating to the Company’s compliance with the 
eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities.  
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 62, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  A description of 
the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on the 
Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely 
to the Company’s members as a body and is subject to 
important explanations and disclaimers regarding our 
responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201 7 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Statement of compliance 
Wincanton plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in England and 
Wales. The Company is a public company limited by shares. The address 
of the Company’s registered office and its registered number are shown 
on page 106. The consolidated financial statements include those of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and the 
Group’s jointly controlled entities.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by the European Union (EU) and 
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS (Adopted IFRS).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following 
Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but are either not yet effective or 
have not yet been adopted by the EU:
 • IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
 • IFRS 1 5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 • IFRS 16 Leases
 • Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based 
Payment Transactions
 • Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative
 • Amendments to IAS 1 2 Recognition of Deferred T ax Assets for 
Unrealised Losses
 • Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets 
between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
 • Annual Improvements 2014–2016 Cycle
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and 
becomes effective for the Group for the year ended 31 March 201 9. 
Applying IFRS 9 will result in changes to the measurement and disclosure 
of financial instruments and introduces a new expected loss impairment 
model. The Group does not currently expect adoption of the standard to 
have a significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position, 
but it will result in increased disclosure.
IFRS 1 5 Revenue from Contracts with Customers was issued by the IASB 
in May 2014 and becomes effective for the Group for the year ended 
31 March 201 9. Under IFRS 1 5 revenue is recognised when the customer 
obtains control of the goods and services transferred by the Group and 
the related performance obligations have been satisfied. The amount 
recognised reflects the amount of consideration to which the Group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
The Group does not expect IFRS 1 5 to have a significant impact on 
the total revenue recognised for customer contracts. The timing for 
recognising revenue on individual contracts is expected to change in 
response to variable consideration components, and the capitalisation 
of costs of fulfilling a contract; the impact at Group level is not expected 
to be significant.
The Group will be required to disclose separate line items for contract 
assets and contract liabilities and to include further details on significant 
changes in these balances, as well as judgements made in determining 
which costs of fulfilling a contract can be capitalised.
The Group expects to apply IFRS 1 5 retrospectively, with the year ended 
31 March 2018 restated as the comparative period. 
IFRS 16 Leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and becomes 
effective for the Group for the year ended 31 March 2020. Adoption  
of this standard will result in the recognition of assets and liabilities 
relating to leases which are currently being accounted for as operating 
leases. The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 16, 
with a material impact anticipated on the presentation of reported assets, 
liabilities and components within the income statement of the Group, 
as well as extensive additional disclosures.
Other than as mentioned above, the Group does not currently expect 
that adoption of the other standards and amendments listed will have 
a significant effect on the consolidated results or financial position of 
the Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements in 
accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101 ); these are shown on pages 100 to 103 and present 
information about the Company as a separate entity.
Basis of preparation
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. They are prepared on 
the historical cost basis except where assets or liabilities are required to be 
stated at their fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these Group financial statements with 
the exception of amendments resulting from IFRS 1 1 Accounting 
for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, IAS 16 and IAS 38 
Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation, 
IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative and Annual Improvements 201 2-2014 Cycle. 
The adoption of these amendments has not had an effect on the 
consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of Group financial statements under Adopted IFRS and 
parent Company financial statements under FRS 1 0 1 requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical 
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised and/ or in future periods if applicable. 
Judgements made by management in the application of Adopted IFRS 
that have a significant effect on the Group financial statements and 
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are 
discussed in the relevant notes to these consolidated financial statements. 
Management discusses with the Audit Committee the development, 
selection, application and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting 
policies and estimates.
The areas where policy and estimate selection are most critical for the Group 
are concerned with the accounting for pensions and the determination of 
provisions, as discussed below. 
Defined benefit pension arrangements
Details of the Group’s defined benefit arrangements are set out in Note 23 
to the financial statements, including the assumptions made, risk factors 
and tables showing the sensitivity of the pension scheme obligations to 
changes in actuarial assumptions. The effects of changes in the actuarial and 
demographic assumptions underlying the Scheme’s obligations, together 
with experience gains or losses and the return on assets excluding amounts 
recognised in net financing costs are classified as remeasurements in the 
defined benefit liability.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Property provisions
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and therefore 
judgement is applied in making a reliable estimate of the quantum and 
timing. Further information about the assumptions and risk factors is given 
in Note 1 9.
Going concern
The Group has net liabilities of £1 39.4m (2016: £184.3m) primarily 
as a result of the pension deficit as well as previous retained losses. 
The reduction in the year principally relates to the profit for the year and 
reduced pension deficit offset by dividend payments. 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out on pages 1 5 to 
23 which also contain a review of the financial position of the Group, its 
cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities. In addition, Note 
25 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing: its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; 
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
During the year, the Group has repaid the remaining US Private 
Placement (USPP) debt of £20m and agreed an extension of the 
maturity of its principal bank facilities to October 2021. The Group’s 
facilities comprise the following: the syndicated main bank facility of 
£14 1.2m which amortises by £8.8m in October 201 9, with a second equal 
amortisation at the four year anniversary in October 2020; and £25m from 
the Prudential/M&G UK Companies Financing Fund LP , which amortises 
by £6.2m in January 2021 with the remaining balance maturing in 
January 2022.
As part of the year end process the Directors have undertaken a going 
concern review, as required by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. 
This includes a review of the headroom available when the Group’s 
facilities are compared to the forecast monthly cash flows for the 
forthcoming financial year, sensitising the borrowing covenants to give an 
indication of the headroom therein, and consideration of the assessment 
undertaken for the purposes of providing the Viability statement on 
page 25. Having undertaken this review the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group overall have adequate 
resources to continue to meet their obligations as they fall due and satisfy 
their borrowing covenants for the foreseeable future. Accordingly these 
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Group financial statements include the financial 
statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up 
to the balance sheet date. When the Company acquired the Wincanton 
group of companies upon demerger from the former parent in May 
2001, the changes in Group structure were accounted for using the 
principles of merger accounting available under UK GAAP at the time. 
Businesses acquired or disposed of since then have been accounted 
for using acquisition accounting principles from or up to the date that 
control passed.
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group. Control is achieved 
when the Company has power over the investee; is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable return from its involvement with the investee; and has 
the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The Company reassesses 
whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate 
that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control 
listed above. In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
or up to the date that control passed.
The results, assets and liabilities of jointly controlled entities are 
incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of 
accounting, in accordance with IFRS 1 1 Joint Arrangements and IAS 28 
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Under the equity method, 
a jointly controlled entity is initially recognised in the consolidated 
statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income of the jointly controlled entity. Intra-group balances, and any 
unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-
group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with jointly 
controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised 
gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition 
method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of 
subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated 
to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets arising under a business combination (acquired 
intangible assets) are capitalised at fair value as determined at the date of 
acquisition and are stated at that fair value less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets from the date 
they are acquired as follows:
Customer relationships 6 to 10 years
The cost of computer software purchased or developed in-house which 
has the capacity to generate economic benefits for a period in excess 
of one year is capitalised as an intangible asset. Amortisation is charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the following 
estimated useful lives:
Computer software costs 3 to 5 years
Major software projects, such as the Group back office project, may be 
amortised over lives of up to ten years.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of 
tangible assets includes directly attributable costs, including appropriate 
commissioning costs. The cost of financing the construction of major 
properties is included in their capitalised cost. The interest rate applied 
represents the actual finance costs incurred on the funds borrowed 
specifically to construct the asset.
Subsequent expenditure
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment the costs incurred in replacing part of such an 
item if it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and when the cost can be measured reliably. All other such 
costs, including the derecognition of the replaced part of the item, 
are expensed in the income statement as incurred.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years
Short leasehold improvements life of lease
Plant and equipment, furniture and fittings 5 to 25 years
Office machinery and computers 3 to 5 years 
Motor vehicles 5 to 10 years
The range of useful economic lives given reflects the fact that assets held 
for specific contracts are depreciated over the lives of those contracts. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. The residual value of tangible assets, 
if significant, is reassessed annually.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred 
in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location 
and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less selling expenses.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value on initial 
recognition (discounted if material) and subsequently at amortised cost, 
ie less any impairment losses.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, restricted cash and 
call deposits. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at their fair value on initial recognition 
(discounted if material) and subsequently at amortised cost.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on such translation are recognised 
in the income statement. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at 
the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues 
and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at rates 
approximating the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised directly in a separate component of other comprehensive 
income. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
Employee benefits 
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension arrangements. The assets of these arrangements are held 
in separate Trustee administered funds independent of the Group. 
The investment strategy of the Trustee and Group is to maximise 
investment returns, with a key area for management attention being 
to seek to meet the Group’s funded defined benefit obligations. 
In accordance with this strategy certain investments are designated at 
fair value and are accounted for as set out below. The defined benefit 
arrangements closed to future accrual with effect from 31 March 2014.
Defined contribution arrangements 
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension 
arrangements are recognised as an expense in the income statement 
as incurred.
Defined benefit arrangements 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension 
arrangements is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the 
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for 
their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine 
the present value, and the fair value of any scheme assets is deducted. 
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s 
obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the 
projected unit method.
Where the calculation results in an asset to the Group, this is limited to 
the present value of any future refunds from the scheme or reductions 
in future contributions to the scheme.
Past service costs arising due to plan amendments or curtailments 
are recognised in the income statement immediately.
Remeasurement gains and losses that arise in calculating the Group’s 
obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised in full through other 
comprehensive income in the statement of comprehensive income.
Share based payment transactions
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share based Payments 
to the grants of options made under the Executive Share Option 
Schemes, Special Option Plan, Executive Bonus Plan and Long Term 
Incentive Plan. 
The Group issues options under equity-settled share based incentive 
schemes to certain employees which are measured at the date of grant 
as the fair value of the employee services required in exchange for the 
grant. The fair value determined is expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that 
will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market based 
vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by an external valuer using the Binomial, 
Monte-Carlo or scenario-modelling methods as appropriate. 
The expected life assumptions used in the models have been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A number of shares in the Company are held in trust on behalf of 
employees who hold options under the Group’s equity-settled share 
based incentive schemes. Such shares are held by an employee benefit 
trust and are treated as treasury shares and shown in the balance sheet 
as a deduction from equity. 
Other share schemes
Shares awarded on a matching basis to employees participating in 
the Company’s Share Incentive Plan are purchased at the prevailing 
market rate and charged to the income statement each period as 
employees make an eligible contribution. The shares purchased are 
held in a separately administered offshore trust for the benefit of the 
Plan participants.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows.
Wincanton plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 75
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The Group provides for onerous property provisions on a site by site 
basis due to the unique nature and location of each site. Provision is made 
for the best estimate of the expected cost of empty and under-utilised 
properties, including dilapidations where applicable. Dilapidations are 
provided for specific individual properties where the outflow of resources 
is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. 
Where significant, amounts are discounted.
The Group provides for insurance claims on an appropriate discounted 
basis depending on the expected timing of their settlement. Provision is 
made for the estimated costs of claims arising from past events based on 
the advice of the Group’s external insurance advisers. 
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, other than inventories and 
deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. The two exceptions are 
dealt with as per the separate applicable accounting policy. An asset is 
considered for impairment testing if objective evidence indicates that 
one or more events had a negative effect on the estimated future cash 
flows of the asset. If any such indication exists the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. For trade receivables specific bad debts are 
provided against unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of 
the amount owing is possible; at that point the amount considered 
irrecoverable is written off.
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets. An impairment loss is recognised 
whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit 
exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect 
of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the amount of 
goodwill allocated to the applicable cash-generating unit and then 
to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a 
pro rata basis. 
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised 
cost is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset. 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value. For an asset that 
does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the 
asset belongs.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. An impairment 
loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed only 
to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had 
been recognised and if the reversal can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement 
on the delivery of those services based on the proportion of the 
total delivered that can be reliably measured at the balance sheet 
date. Where payments are received in advance of revenue being 
recognised they are included as deferred income. Where revenue 
is recognised in advance of amounts being invoiced it is reported 
as accrued income. Where a contract contains elements of variable 
consideration, the Group will estimate the amount of variable 
consideration to which it will be entitled under the contract. 
Variable consideration can arise as a result of incentives, performance 
bonuses, penalties or other similar items. Variable consideration is 
recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that the economic 
benefit will transfer to the Group.
Expenses
Lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement 
as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable and other charges 
less interest income.
Interest payable on borrowings is calculated using the effective interest 
rate method. Other charges include bank fees, amortisation of bank 
arrangement fees, unwinding of discounts, and losses on hedging 
instruments that are recognised in the income statement (see hedge 
accounting policy below). 
Interest income includes interest receivable on funds invested and 
gains on hedging instruments, and these are recognised in the income 
statement as they accrue.
Net financing costs include the interest on the net defined benefit 
pension liability.
Taxation
T ax on profits or losses for the year comprises current and deferred tax 
and is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in the relevant component.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for 
the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill and the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Operating segments 
Operating segments are identified on the basis of information that is 
provided to the Executive Management Team (EMT), which is the Group’s 
chief operating decision-maker, to allocate capital and resources and to 
assess performance.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, 
financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, 
the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for 
trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments which are accounted for as trading 
instruments are recognised initially and subsequently stated at fair 
value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify 
for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends 
on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting 
the future cash flows at rates determined by year end yield curves.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market 
price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted 
forward price.
Upon initial recognition attributable transaction costs are recognised 
in the income statement when incurred. 
Fair value hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised 
firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value 
of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is 
attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost 
or amortised cost) and any gains or losses on remeasurement are also 
recognised immediately in the income statement (even if those gains 
would normally be recognised directly in reserves). Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the 
hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount 
of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit 
or loss from that date.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the 
effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is 
recognised directly in equity within hedging reserves. The ineffective part 
of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within operating profit, or 
within net financing costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as 
cash flow hedges. When the forecast transaction that was being hedged 
is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the 
derivative financial instrument is removed from equity and recognised in 
the income statement in the same period. When the forecast transaction 
subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed 
from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of 
the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, 
or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain 
or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance 
with the above policy when the transaction takes place. If the hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative gain 
or loss is removed from equity and recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation
Where a foreign currency liability is used to hedge an investment in 
a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge shall be 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion 
shall be recognised in profit or loss. 
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge that have been accumulated in equity are 
reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment 
on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.
Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities
Where a derivative financial instrument is used to economically hedge 
the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, 
no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised in the income statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, 
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on 
an effective interest basis. Interest-bearing borrowings which are 
designated hedged items in a fair value hedge arrangement are 
carried at fair value (see policy above).
Dividends 
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are declared and 
approved, or paid.
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
Underlying results are used in the day-to-day management of the Group. 
They represent statutory measures adjusted for items which could 
distort the understanding of performance and comparability year on 
year, namely the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptionals, 
related tax and exceptional tax items where relevant. Page 23 provides 
a reconciliation between APMs and statutory IFRS measures.

Wincanton plc provides contract logistics services in the UK and Ireland. Following the disposal of Wincaton Records Management (WRM), the Group 
has, from 1 April 2016, refocused its internal management structure under the following two reportable segments; Retail & Consumer (including retail 
general merchandise, retail grocery and consumer products) and Industrial & Transport (including transport services, construction and other).
Segmental information for the period ended 31 March 2016 has been realigned to reflect the changes to the reportable segments.
The results of the operating segments are regularly reviewed by the Executive Management Team (EMT) to allocate resources to these segments and 
to assess their performance. The Group evaluates performance of the operating segments on the basis of revenue and underlying operating profit. 
Assets and liabilities are reviewed at a consolidated level only, therefore segmental information is not provided.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 6.1p per share for the year ended 31 March 201 7 (2016: 5.5p) which, if approved by shareholders, will be 
paid on 4 August 201 7 to shareholders on the register on 7 July 201 7 , an estimated total of £7 .5m. The proposed final dividend is subject to approval 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 29 June 201 7 and in accordance with Adopted IFRS has not been included as a liability in these 
financial statements.
In setting the dividend the Directors have considered a range of factors, including the Group‘s strategy (including downside sensitivities), the Group’s 
net debt position, the current and projected level of distributable reserves and projected cash flows.
The Employee Benefit Trust has waived the right to receive dividends in respect of the shares it holds, see Note 20 for further detail.

Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs) which are in line with the Group’s reported operating segments, as per the table 
below. At 1 April 2016, CGUs were restructured in line with the change in the reported operating segments. Reported figures at 31 March 2016 have 
been restated accordingly.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations are cash flow projections based on the financial 
budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the forthcoming financial year and 24 months beyond. The financial budgets and forecasts have 
been set on a contract by contract basis, taking account of prior year results and expected developments. Cash flows beyond those 1 2-month and 
further 24-month periods are extrapolated to perpetuity using the estimated growth rates and underlying inflation rates stated below, which do not 
exceed the long term average growth and inflation rates in the specific geographical area where the CGU operates.

Management determined the growth rates and underlying inflation rates based on expectations for market development and these are consistent with 
external forecasts and historical trends. The discount rates are pre-tax and reflect the relevant risks. The value in use has been determined in a similar 
manner as in 2016. The key assumptions for 201 7 are disclosed in the table above, in 2016 these rates were; estimated growth rate 1.9%; underlying 
inflation rate 2.1%; and discount rate 8.6%.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The estimated recoverable amounts for both the Retail & Consumer and the Industrial & Transport CGUs exceed their respective carrying amounts 
by approximately £382m and £356m (2016: £355m and £281m respectively). The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment 
testing. Management believe no significant change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount 
for either CGU.

The Group owns 100% of the share capital of an insurance company which insures certain of the risks of the Group. The insurance provisions in the 
above table are held in respect of outstanding insurance claims, the majority of which are expected to be paid within one to seven years. The discount 
unwinding arises primarily on the employers’ liability policy which is discounted over a period of seven years at a rate based on the Group’s assessment 
of a risk free rate.
The property provisions are determined on a site by site basis, as the best estimate of the expected costs of empty and under-utilised properties, 
including dilapidations. Provisions made in the year comprise dilapidations made in the normal course of business. The provisions are utilised over the 
relevant lease term, with the majority expected to be utilised over the next three years. Amounts have been discounted at a rate based on the Group’s 
assessment of a risk free rate. 
Reclassification includes amounts previously reported within creditors.

The number of shares detailed above differs from those in Note 7 as a result of the inclusion, in the above total, of the shares held within an Employee 
Benefit Trust (EBT) and also the effect of weighting for the purpose of the earnings per share calculations.
The holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time. At general meetings of shareholders each shareholder 
(or appointed proxy) present in person is entitled to vote; on a show of hands each person has one vote, and on a poll has one vote per share. In respect 
of the Company’s shares that are held by the EBT (see over), all rights are suspended until these shares are reissued.
During the year ended 31 March 2002, the Company established a Capital Redemption Reserve of £49,998 on redemption of redeemable 
preference shares.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose from the original acquisition of the then Wincanton group of companies by Wincanton plc, on the demerger from the 
previous parent in May 2001, which was accounted for under merger accounting principles.
Hedging reserve
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective 
part of the gain or loss on the derivative is recognised directly in equity within the hedging reserve. When the forecast transaction that was being 
hedged is realised the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well 
as from any translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries.

Own shares
The own shares reserve comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the EBT established in Jersey and managed on its behalf by independent 
trustees. At 31 March 201 7 , the number of the Company’s shares held by the EBT had decreased to 295,033 (2016: 1,806,521 ). The EBT has waived the 
right to receive dividends in respect of the shares it holds. The average cost of the shares held is 16 1p each (2016: 1 73p) and at 31 March 201 7 , the market 
value of the shares held was £0.8m (2016: £3.0m).
All of the shares in the EBT are held in respect of the Group’s various equity compensation schemes (see Note 24) and at 31 March 201 7 there were 
295,033 (2016: 1,806,521 ) shares held in respect of vested options.

22. OPERATING LEASES
Leases as lessee
The Group leases warehousing facilities, commercial vehicles and other logistics equipment for use in its operations. Typical lease periods for new 
warehouse rental contracts are between three and ten years although older rental contracts are for longer periods with intervening break clauses. 
The average period for vehicles and equipment is five years. The amounts charged to the income statement in the current and prior years are shown 
in Note 3.
The total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases fall due for repayment as follows:

More than 5 years 1.2 108.5 1.6 108.7
51.1 174.2 53.9 174.9
Wherever possible these commitments are mitigated through contractual commitments from customers for whom the properties are occupied and/or 
vehicles and plant are rented. The degree of mitigation can be banded according to the nature of the contract between the Group and its customers. 
This includes ‘back-to-back’ leases which are fully underwritten by customers throughout the life of the lease and multi-user locations where, although 
there is no specific matching of lease and contract terms, there are varying degrees of contract backing and therefore mitigation is spread across a 
number of customers.

Pension schemes
Employees of Wincanton participated in funded pension arrangements in the UK and Ireland during the year ended 31 March 201 7 details of which 
are given below. 
The principal Wincanton Scheme in the UK (the Scheme) is a funded arrangement which has three defined benefit sections and two defined 
contribution sections, called the Wincanton Retirement Savings Section and the Wincanton Pension Builder Plan. The employees of Wincanton Ireland 
Limited are eligible to participate in a separate defined contribution scheme. Assets of these pension arrangements are held in separate Trustee 
administered funds independent of Wincanton. The weighted average duration of the funded defined benefit obligation is approximately 18 years.
In previous years, a small number of employees, who were subject to the statutory earnings cap on pensionable earnings prior to 6 April 2006, were 
entitled to participate in an unfunded unapproved arrangement in addition to accruing benefits from the Scheme. There have been no active 
members of this arrangement throughout the years ended 31 March 2016 and 201 7 .
The defined benefit sections of the Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 March 2014. This means that no future service benefit will accrue but 
pensions built up to the date of closure have been preserved. 
The latest formal valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2014 by the Scheme actuary, Hymans Robertson. It was agreed between the 
Trustee and the Group in April 201 5 and submitted to the Pension Regulator. The Group, in consultation with the Trustee, agreed to leave the terms of 
the cash contribution that the Group makes to the Scheme in order to address the past service deficit unchanged from that previously agreed and it 
will continue to increase by RPI each year through to September 2024. In addition, it was agreed that certain administration expenses would be paid 
directly by the Group and deducted from these deficit funding contributions. The expenses, which amount to £0.7m (2016: £0.6m), are not included in 
the contributions below. The deficit funding contribution in the year net of these expenses was £14.1m (2016: £1 3.9m; £20.9m including an additional 
£7 .0m paid into the Scheme following the disposal of WRM). The next triennial valuation will be carried out by the Scheme actuary as at 31 March 201 7 .
In the year commencing 1 April 201 7 , the Group contributions are expected to be the deficit funding contribution of £1 5.2m (£14.6m after deduction 
of certain administration expenses as mentioned above) which has been increased by RPI as set out in the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2014. 
In addition, other administration costs of the Scheme will be borne directly by the Group, these are expected to total £0.7m.
The defined benefit sections of the Scheme expose the Group to various risks: longevity risk (members living longer than expected), inflation and 
interest rate risk (higher or lower than expected), and market (investment) risk (lower returns than expected). The Trustee and Group have taken steps 
to mitigate these risks through the use of:
 • hedging instruments within the investment portfolio; and 
 • diversification of the investment portfolio. 
The Group has also taken steps to reduce risk and the build-up of further liabilities and associated risk, as mentioned above, by closing the defined 
benefit section to future benefit accrual and undertaking various liability management exercises. These include a pension increase exchange exercise 
reducing the Group’s exposure to inflation risk; a trivial commutation exercise where, in line with the Scheme rules, members with small accrued 
defined benefit pensions are able to exchange their pension for a one off cash sum; and a recently launched Enhanced Transfer Value exercise, 
where deferred members approaching retirement may choose to transfer out of the Scheme in order to access the new flexible retirement options 
now available. 
The Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity specific or scheme specific risks.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 91
Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts 23. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit sections of the Group are calculated in accordance with IAS 1 9 Employee Benefits (Revised) and are set 
out in the tables below.
The calculations under IAS 1 9 are based on actuarial assumptions which are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible assumptions about the 
long term future which, unless by chance, will not necessarily be borne out in practice. The fair value of the assets, which are not intended to be realised 
in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the liabilities are derived from cash flow 
projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain.

Fair value of Scheme assets 1,080.5 897.1
Net defined benefit liability (78.4) (105.6)
The movement in the above net defined benefit liability in the year was primarily the result of an increase in the market value of the investments, a 
reduction in liabilities due to demographic assumptions and contributions received from the Group, being partly offset by an increase in liabilities 
resulting from a fall in the discount rate. The net defined benefit liability, after taking into account the related deferred tax asset, is £65.1m (2016: £86.6m).

The illustrations consider the result of only a single assumption changing with the others assumed unchanged, although in reality it is more likely 
that more than one assumption would change and potentially the results would offset each other. For example, a fall in interest rates will increase 
the Scheme obligations, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in market value of certain Scheme assets.

The total expense relating to the Group’s defined contribution schemes in the current year was £1 7 .9m (2016: £18.1m).
24. EQUITY COMPENSATION BENEFITS
Employees of the Group participate, subject to seniority and length of service, in the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The other schemes in existence 
are the Executive Bonus Plan (EBP) and Special Option Plan (SOP), although no grants were made in respect of these schemes in the year. All of these 
schemes involve the grant of options or conditional awards of shares in the Company.
Grants of options are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, which requires the fair value of services received in return for 
share options granted to be recognised in the Income statement over the vesting period. The Group recognised total expenses of £0.9m (2016: £0.9m) 
in respect of the costs of equity-settled share based payment transactions during the year.  The fair value of these services is measured by reference 
to the fair value of the share options granted under each scheme.
The number of options outstanding and exercisable in respect of each scheme at 31 March 201 7 is as follows:

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 203p (2016: 180p). The options outstanding 
at 31 March 201 7 had a range of exercise prices of between nil and 16 1p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of seven years. 
The number of nil cost options awarded under the terms of the Executive Bonus Plan were calculated with reference to the 30 day average quoted 
market price of the Company’s shares for the year ending 31 March of the financial year immediately preceding the date of award. Awards made under 
the Special Option Plan, Executive Share Option Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan were granted based on the average quoted market price of 
the Company’s shares for a period of up to three business days immediately prior to the date of grant. Upon exercise, all options granted under these 
schemes are equity-settled.
The terms and conditions of the grants to date under these schemes are as follows:

element requires 6% growth per annum, with 100% vesting at 11% per annum. The 
threshold entry point of 25% vesting for the TSR element requires performance in line 
with the Index, with 100% vesting at outperformance of 10% per annum (equivalent 
to 33% over the term of the option). Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between 
the threshold and maximum for both elements.

Executive Bonus Plan
The Group introduced the Executive Bonus Plan during the year ended 31 March 201 2. The award was made part in cash, part in deferred shares and 
for the years ending 31 March 201 3 and 31 March 2014 was settled 50% : 50%. For the year ended 31 March 201 5 the award was settled 100% in cash. 
The Plan ceased on 31 March 201 5 and all awards of deferred shares vested in July 201 5. 
The Bonus Plan operated for a fixed four year period. At the end of that period the balance of a participants’ Plan account became payable.

25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial risk management and treasury policies
The Group, through its activities, is exposed to a range of financial risks. Financial risks are managed through the Group’s centralised treasury function 
which acts within clearly defined policies approved by the Board. These policies are designed to reduce the financial risks faced by the Group relating 
to liquidity risk, market risk (being interest rates, equity prices and currency exchange rate exposure) and credit risk. Transactions of a speculative nature 
are not permitted and the treasury function does not operate as a profit centre.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s policy on funding capacity 
is to ensure that there is always sufficient long term funding and short term facilities in place to meet foreseeable peak borrowing requirements.

The Group has £166m (2016: £21 5m) of core committed funding of which £65m was drawn at 31 March 201 7 (2016: £75m), leaving headroom of £101m 
(2016: £140m). The Group also has overdraft and other uncommitted facilities. Within the £166m (2016: £21 5m) of core committed facilities there is £25m 
(2016: £45m) in the form of term loans which must be drawn. At certain points in the working capital cycle this results in the Group having cash which is 
held in short term interest-bearing deposits. The Group also holds cash deposits within its insurance subsidiary; these deposits have a mix of maturities, 
none of which is greater than 1 2 months. The Group’s net debt at the balance sheet date was:

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates will affect the Group’s income or the value of its 
holdings of financial instruments.
Interest rate risk
The Group maintains a policy of using derivatives to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed, capped, and floating interest profiles, so as to limit 
the exposure to the cash cost of servicing its debt.
The majority of the Group’s drawn debt at 31 March 201 7 was at floating rates. At 31 March 201 7 , the Group had in place a £20m five year sterling interest 
rate swap (maturing 201 9) with an effective rate of 2.0%. The net fair value of the financial instrument used to manage interest rates at the year end was

Interest rate sensitivity
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on the Group’s profit before tax and on its equity. The impact has 
been calculated by applying the change in interest rates to the weighted average interest rate during the year, and applying this rate to the average 
borrowings during the year, taking into account the impact of the interest rate swap of £20m. A variation of 1% represents management’s view of 
a reasonably possible change in interest rates. Any impact on equity excludes the possible effect which a change in interest rates may have on the 
present value of the Group’s pension obligations, the effects of which are set out in Note 23.

The methods and assumptions used to calculate the possible effect of a change in interest rates are consistent with those used in the prior year. 
Currency risk and sensitivity 
The Group is a largely UK based business with a small proportion of the Group’s activities denominated in euro. The only non-sterling activity 
is in Ireland. In order to protect the sterling value of the balance sheet, the Group finances its investment in Ireland by borrowing in euro. 
Transactional exposure is minimal as the vast majority of transactions are denominated in euro, the relevant functional currency of the operation.
Operational foreign exchange risk, where purchases or sales are made in non functional currency, is hedged on an ad hoc basis by buying or selling 
the relevant currency on a forward basis if the amounts involved are material.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, 
and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers.
The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Deposits are only made with pre-approved 
counterparties. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit. The Group does not generally require collateral in respect of financial 
assets. At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet of £1 28.9m (2016: £1 53.3m). See Note 1 5 for 
further analysis of trade receivables and the associated doubtful debt provisions held.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide optimal returns for 
shareholders, and to maintain an efficient capital structure.
In doing so, the Group’s strategy is to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and flexibility. To achieve this strategy 
and maintain this position, the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as net debt to EBITDA, interest cover and fixed charge cover. In addition 
the Group ensures a combination of short term liquidity headroom with a diverse long term debt maturity profile. As at the balance sheet date the 
Group’s average debt maturity profile was 4.5 years. 
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the above table. 
Under the disclosure requirements of IFRS 1 3, all fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be categorised as level 2.
Derivatives
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated as the contractual forward price less the current forward rate. The fair value of interest rate 
swaps was determined by discounting the future cash flows at rates determined by year end yield curves.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings and unsecured bond issues
Fair value is calculated on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows at market interest rates.
26. RELATED PARTIES
Identity of related parties
The Group has a controlling related party relationship with its parent Company Wincanton plc. In addition the Group has related party relationships 
with its Executive and Non-executive Directors and with its subsidiaries and jointly controlled entity.

WINCANTON PLC COMPANY STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 201 7 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s 
financial statements.
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company meets the definition of 
a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, the financial statements 
have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101 ).
Under Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account. The profit 
attributable to the Company is disclosed in the footnote to the Company’s balance sheet.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share based 
payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow 
statement and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the remeasurement of certain financial instruments to fair value.

Forward-looking statements
These Annual Report and Accounts and Wincanton’s website 
may contain certain ‘forward-looking statements’ with respect to 
Wincanton plc and the Group’s financial condition, results of operations 
and business, and certain of Wincanton plc’s and the Group’s plans, 
objectives, goals and expectations with respect to these items.
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by 
their use of a date in the future or such words as ‘anticipates’ , ‘aims’ , ‘due’ , 
‘could’ , ‘may’ , ‘should’ , ‘expects’ , ‘believes’ , ‘intends’ , ‘plans’ , ‘targets’ , ‘goal’ or 
‘estimates’. By their very nature forward-looking statements are inherently 
unpredictable, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because 
they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in 
the future. Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate to 
factors that are beyond the Group’s ability to control or estimate precisely. 
There are a number of such factors that could cause actual results and 
developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by 
these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not 
limited to, changes in the economies and markets in which the Group 
operates; changes in the legal, regulatory and competition frameworks in 
which the Group operates; changes in the markets from which the Group 
raises finance; the impact of legal or other proceedings against or which 
affect the Group; changes in accounting practices and interpretation 
of accounting standards under IFRS, and changes in interest and 
exchange rates.
Any written or verbal forward-looking statements, made in our Annual 
Report and Accounts or on Wincanton’s website or made subsequently, 
which are attributable to Wincanton plc or any other member of the 
Group or persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their 
entirety by the factors referred to above. Each forward-looking statement 
speaks only as of the date of our Annual Report and Accounts, or on the 
date the forward-looking statement is made. Wincanton plc does not 
intend to update any forward-looking statements.
