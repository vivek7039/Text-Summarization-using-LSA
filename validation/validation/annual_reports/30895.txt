An unrivalled portfolio
Through our best in class networks we help our customers to communicate where 
terrestrial telecom networks lack reliability or coverage; on land, at sea or in the air.
Global Xpress – the first  
global, high bandwidth  
satellite network  
 
GX, based on our four Inmarsat-5 satellites 
currently in orbit, is a global, mobile, high 
bandwidth network, which will be further 
augmented by new, low-cost technologies 
in the future. The GX network is fully 
operational, following the launch of 
the fourth I-5 satellite in 2017.
The European Aviation  
Network – a unique asset  
 
 
The integrated S-band satellite and 
air-to-ground network, the EAN, will be 
a compelling and unique proposition for 
commercial aviation customers in Europe, 
compared to other satellite-only offerings. 
The network delivers higher capacity, wider 
coverage, superior cost per bit, faster speeds 
and lower latency, with smaller and lighter 
equipment which can be installed quickly, 
more cost effectively and with less fuel drag.
High-performance  
mobility-designed L -band 
satellites – supported by secure 
networks and technology  
Our L -band networks, through eight 
Inmarsat-3 and Inmarsat-4 satellites, have 
helped Inmarsat to establish and develop 
a loyal customer and distribution base 
over time. The Inmarsat-6 satellites comprise 
two dual payload (L -band and Ka-band) 
satellites due to be launched at the start of the 
next decade. This will ensure the reorientation 
of our L -band capabilities towards new growth 
opportunities uniquely addressable by a 
cutting edge global network, with a small, 
low-cost, highly reliable and agile device 
to deliver our services to end users.

Deorbiting 
A spacecraft is ‘raised’ 
to ‘graveyard orbit’, 
a circular orbit 
that is higher 
than operational 
geostationary orbit
Over 15 years, 
the spacecraft will 
travel around the 
earth for a total 
of 1.5 billion km –  
roughly the same as 
1,951 round trips 
from the Earth 
to the Moon! 
Fuel carried
The spacecraft typically 
carries over 2,000kg (2 tonnes) 
of propellant into space –  
most of this is used to raise 
the orbit after separating from 
the launch vehicle, leaving 
only 200kg for station-keeping 
for the remaining lifespan.
Space debris
In collaboration with several 
agencies around the globe, 
we continually monitor 
close approach of objects 
near our fleet. On average, 
we have to take avoiding 
action 20 times per year. 
Positioning
The spacecraft’s position is 
constantly monitored 24/7 
from our Satellite Control Centre. 
When a manoeuvre is required, 
thrusters accelerate the satellite 
to the required position. The average 
manoeuvre uses 10g of propellant 
(I-5 satellites).
Sensors
Typically a spacecraft has sensors 
to detect the sun, the stars, the earth 
(typically older spacecraft only), 
and the spacecraft’s own rotation. 
It takes roughly a tenth of a second 
for the signal to propagate from 
the satellite to the ground.
Disposal
We monitor the spacecraft 
long enough to confirm it 
has reached the graveyard 
orbit and then passivate. 
This means we check the 
satellite has no energy 
left and this typically 
takes a few days.

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 05 Strategic Report | The life cycle of a satellite CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Continuing to deliver
We remain well placed 
to access future 
growth opportunities
We have seen solid progress in 2017 towards 
our objectives of building a significant new mobile 
broadband business with our new Global Xpress 
constellation, as well as investing in establishing 
a leadership position in the largest growth 
opportunity in the commercial satellite sector, 
In-Flight Connectivity for the commercial 
aviation sector. In our core business overall, 
particularly in Maritime, Aviation and Government, 
we have seen solid steady performance in the 
face of growing competition.
OUR RESPONSE TO 
SECTOR HEADWINDS
However, we have been hit with headwinds as well, 
which have negatively affected our share price. 
Some of these derive from issues in the sector 
we are in. Firstly, there is growing overcapacity 
in the fixed satellite space, derived from declining 
video and telecoms revenues, markets we 
are not in. Secondly, companies in the sector 
who are financially stressed have dropped prices. 
As a result of these factors, fixed satellite 
operators are attempting to enter the higher 
growth mobile satellite space where we operate.
We believe these trends were predictable and 
known. It was contemplated as we invested further, 
over the last few years, so as to maintain leadership 
in the mobile satellite sector of commercial 
satellites. The mobile satellite sector is 
fundamentally distinct from the fixed sector and 
the services needed to address this market will take 
many years for competitors to develop. Our moves 
in broadband mobile satellite are made from a 
position of strength in the maritime and aviation 
sectors, where we have had a presence and been a 
leader for decades. These are healthy and growing 
segments in the commercial satellite sector and 
our moves in 2017 and leading into 2018 uniquely 
position us to lead and accelerate growth in these 
emerging opportunities in the years ahead.
OVERVIEW OF OUR 
PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The management team has been following the 
strategic plans outlined in our previous annual 
reports and commented on in our quarterly 
reporting and in 2017 executed well on those 
plans to drive future growth opportunities. 
Major accomplishments for the year include 
two successful satellite launches, a set of 
new service launches across land, sea and air, 
as well as tremendous progress on the build, 
licensing and sales of our soon to be launched 
European Aviation Network. We have built up 
our presence and costs in aviation so that we 
are in a position to successfully support and 
grow that business in the years ahead.
While certainly there were operational and sector 
challenges in 2017, overall the management 
team has executed well and achieved our primary 
strategic objectives for positioning the business 
for growth. This will be laid out in more detail on the 
following pages of this report by Rupert Pearce, 
in his CEO review and in the strategy section.
BALANCING INVESTMENT 
IN GROWTH WITH 
SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
In light of this year’s share price performance, 
we have also stood back and assessed our plans 
and performance. We have met extensively with 
shareholders and listened. It is clear from this 
feedback that there is growing concern about the 
impact of our medium to long-term investments 
on the short-term financial performance of the 
business and the implications for our financial 
strength downstream. It is important to emphasise 
that our business remains on a solid footing 
financially and the Board remains supportive of the 
investment path we are on. However, we will continue 
to assess various paths to enhance our progress 
over the short term, as well as the long-term, 
to address the concerns which have been raised.
That brings me to the Board’s decision on the 
dividend going forward. During 2017, particularly in 
the second half of the year, two elements started 
to become clearer. Firstly, the Board’s conviction 
around our opportunity to build our position in the 
emerging and substantial In-Flight Connectivity 
segment continued to grow and, secondly, 
the continued lack of visibility and uncertainty 
around the future cash contribution from Ligado 
Networks. With these factors in mind, particularly 
their potential impact on our short to medium-term 
cash flow profile, the Board took the decision 
to reduce the level of annual (full year) dividend 
payments to shareholders to 20.00 cents ($) 
per share.
Inmarsat is pleased that it has paid over $2.1bn to 
shareholders in dividends since our IPO in 2005. 
However, given the magnitude of solid growth 
opportunities before us and the other reasons 
stated, adjusting our dividend to address this capital 
requirement is in the Company’s best interest.
The dividend will remain at these levels until 
our cash flow grows sufficiently, to make future 
increases in the dividend appropriate. Whilst 
this was an extremely difficult decision for 
the Board to take, we had to ensure the right 
balance between providing our shareholders 
with attractive cash returns and doing what is 
right for the business – in particular, by supporting 
our growth prospects with a clear and targeted 
investment programme.

THE INMARSAT 
INVESTMENT THESIS
Standing back from all of this you can see that 
we are investing with the belief that broadband 
connectivity will greatly expand in the markets 
we serve, those with little or no terrestrial wired 
or wireless connectivity. This of course is at sea, 
in the air and in remote, less densely populated 
environments. This is broadly our investment 
thesis and supports our purpose of ‘enabling 
a connected world’. We believe we are best 
positioned to be a leader in this often overlooked 
global opportunity. Translated to more specifics, 
this means that we believe more consumers on 
aircraft will demand connectivity on their smart 
phone or laptop. We believe that ship owners 
and mariners will have greater increased need 
for high speed connectivity for ships generally 
and also in what is being referred to as ‘Smart’ or 
automated ships. We believe that government 
and aid workers in remote environments, will 
demand the same kind of connectivity they 
experience everywhere else, in order to stay 
connected and function. Our resources are 
focused on investments that ride this trend.
BOARD DEVELOPMENTS
Early last year, two of our long-standing Directors 
retired from the Board, with one having been 
appointed at the time of our IPO in 2005 and 
the second in 2006. We would like to thank 
Stephen Davidson and Kathleen Flaherty for 
their significant contributions to the success 
of Inmarsat over more than a decade.
Joining the Board during 2017 is Warren Finegold. 
Warren has tremendous experience in the 
telecoms sector, having recently retired 
as a senior executive with Vodafone, as well as 
significant experience in investment banking. 
His biography can be found on page 61.
We have asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, a long-standing 
Director at Inmarsat, to stay on the Board, while 
recognising he is no longer deemed independent 
due to his tenure with us. Bryan will continue 
to participate in the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, but no longer as a formal member. 
He will remain as a member of the Telecoms 
Regulatory Committee. The Board however, 
still maintains significantly more than a majority 
of its Directors as independents. We believe that 
Sir Bryan’s contributions and insights continue 
to be extremely valuable for the Inmarsat Board.
Our Board is diverse in experience, gender and 
nationality. For a global technology business 
we believe this is essential to achieving a 
high level performance for the Board, as well 
as the Company as a whole. When we review 
Board succession, and the appointment of new 
Non-Executive Directors, diversity consideration 
is part of the hiring process. We have recently 
published our Gender Pay Report which looks 
across our business to ensure there is no 
unconscious bias in any of our decision making 
and we report separately our UK employee statistics 
to the UK Government. A copy of the report can 
be found on our website. There has been much work 
done during 2017 on our talent management 
and internal succession planning and we are 
delighted progress has been made on these key 
areas to support opportunities for our staff.
We would like to assure our shareholders that we 
strive to meet the highest standards in terms of 
the governance standards we utilise to conduct 
our business. Last year, while our Remuneration 
Policy received a solidly supportive vote, the 
implementation of that Policy however received 
significant opposition. In light of that, we have 
consulted with shareholders and reviewed our 
remuneration implementation. As a result we 
have listened to the comments received and 
made significant changes which are highlighted 
in our Remuneration Report on page 76.
Your Board continues to function well and we 
completed our annual assessment of this during 
the course of 2017. More details are provided 
in the Governance Report on page 56.
SUMMARY
We believe Inmarsat is on the right course 
to continue to grow profit and prosper for our 
customers, staff and shareholders. We have 
maintained our leadership in maritime and 
aviation while making significant unprecedented 
investments to allow us to focus in those sectors 
we believe we can profitably grow. Despite these 
forward looking investments, we remain solid 
financially. However, we need to be mindful of 
financial market concerns for the sector and the 
growing investments required to capitalise on these 
growth opportunities and the Board is focused 
on these areas as part of its 2018 priorities.
We would like to thank our customers for 
continuing to trust and rely on us for their 
often mission critical connectivity. We take our 
commitment to reliability and quality deeply 
seriously, not only for the safety services 
we provide at sea and in the air, but also for our 
commercial services. We also would like to thank 
our staff for their dedication and commitment 
which allows us to continue to succeed. Lastly, 
I would like to thank our shareholders who have 
supported the continued evolution of our business 
into new and essential growth opportunities.

Strategic Report | Chairman’s statement CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW
Making a difference
Inmarsat delivered further 
operational and strategic 
progress in 2017 , comprising 
both gratifying near term 
revenue growth as well as 
several important strategic 
proof-points around exciting 
medium-term growth 
opportunities, especially in 
In-Flight Connectivity (‘IFC’)
STRONG PERFORMANCE 
ACROSS OUR BUSINESS 
UNITS THROUGHOUT 2017
Our solid operational progress supported 
the Group in delivering revenue growth 
of over 5% for the year, with our investment 
in Global Xpress, our high bandwidth global 
mobile satellite network, starting to show 
material returns, generating over $140m 
of revenue in the year.
Indeed, there were strong performances 
across our business units throughout 2017:
 › In Maritime, we made important strategic 
progress in securing the long-term future for 
Fleet Xpress, with significant commitments 
signed with leading distribution partners. 
After a challenging year in 2016, which 
continued into Q1 2017, we delivered 
quarter-on-quarter growth for three 
consecutive quarters and year-on-year 
revenue growth in the fourth quarter
 › In Government, we delivered on our strategy 
to increase our contracted revenue base 
and diversify our customer and product base, 
supported by another excellent operational 
performance during the year
 › In Aviation, we further established our 
market position in IFC through commercial 
momentum and strategic investment, 
and our core business delivered double 
digit revenue growth throughout 2017
 › Enterprise continues to make progress 
notwithstanding challenges, by focusing 
on mobility applications. We remain 
optimistic about the long-term future 
demand for M2M connectivity in the 
emerging global Internet of Things 
(‘IoT’) market
We also delivered several notable successes 
in the development of our global networks –  
in particular:
 › We successfully launched our fourth 
GX satellite in May 2017, to provide global 
in-orbit redundancy and additional 
capacity and capabilities into new 
regional growth opportunities

they will help to further drive the performance 
and development of the key parts of the 
business that they now lead. 
At the end of the year, we also created a 
new division within the business, the Product 
Group, led by Nick Thexton as our Chief Product 
Officer, who joined us last year from YouView 
and previously spent many years in a number 
of senior roles at Cisco Systems and NDS. 
Nick also joined Inmarsat’s Executive Team. 
This newly created product team has 
been established through a spin-out of 
our end-to-end product development and 
management activities in our current technology 
division, our business units and our finance 
division, bringing together all product-related 
activities under one roof, and the addition of our 
nascent and fast-growing digital services team. 
We believe this will provide more focus and 
agility in our product and service innovation, 
development and life cycle management, 
both digital and non-digital. The team will 
work as a catalyst between the business units 
and the central functions, focusing on the 
strategic and commercial value of these 
services, as well as driving a multi-disciplinary 
approach to building them. Our technology 
division’s focus will tighten to global networks 
and operating systems.
INMARSAT REMAINS WELL 
POSITIONED TO CAPTURE 
SIGNIFICANT GROWTH 
OPPORTUNITIES
Our performance in 2017, supported by the 
impact of these organisational developments, 
will help to ensure that Inmarsat remains well 
positioned to capture the significant growth 
opportunities that will become available 
in the coming years, as a result of two major 
demand drivers.
Firstly, the current demand for global 
mobile satellite broadband services continues 
to grow more rapidly than in many other 
satellite segments. Secondly, lower speed, 
high resistance satellite connectivity services 
to support emerging Io T applications offers 
significant growth potential over the 
medium to long-term.
Both of these areas will be driven by further 
growth in demand for mobile connectivity 
services in the Maritime, Government, 
Aviation and Enterprise markets, supported 
by the ongoing surge in data utilisation 
by users on the move and around the world.
 › Our S-band satellite was also successfully 
launched in June 2017, to become an integral 
part of our new European Aviation Network 
(‘EAN’), to be combined with a complementary 
air-to-ground component network 
recently completed by Deutsche Telekom 
and expected to be launched in 2018
 › We completed the design and procurement 
of our fifth GX satellite, announced and 
initiated in July 2017 and expected to 
be launched in late 2019, and our two 
replacement Inmarsat-6 satellites remain 
on track for their launches in 2020 and 
2021, respectively and
 › We procured launchers for two of 
these satellite programmes: comprising 
Arianespace’s Ariane-5 for GX-5 (2019) 
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ H-IIA 
rocket for Inmarsat-6F1 (2020)
These planned investments in our network 
infrastructure drove an increase in capital 
expenditure in 2017, which was the primary 
driver behind the reduction in free cash flow 
in the year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the Group declined by 
5.5%, in the year, with revenue growth offset 
by further planned investment in IFC market 
capture and service delivery and in developing 
our networks and back office infrastructure, 
as well as changes in revenue mix.
SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TAKEN 
LEADING TO MAJOR CHANGES 
TO THE ORGANISATION DURING 
THE YEAR
There were a number of significant 
people-related actions carried out during 
the year, which led to major organisational 
developments across our business.
During the fourth quarter, we initiated a

CONTINUED
With two complementary global satellite 
communications networks (each with in-orbit 
redundancy), we are fully focused on mobility 
markets. With a 38-year history and reputation 
of delivering reliable and agile connectivity 
services to customers, we are very well positioned 
to retain and capture a leading market position 
in both global mobile broadband and satellite 
IoT markets. Our confidence is supported by our: 
 › Unrivalled presence in key end markets, 
with a disciplined focus on end users for 
whom our services are highly differentiated 
and mission critical, supported by strong 
local market access and licensing, following 
many years of relationship-building and 
investment. We are the current global leaders 
in the supply of satellite telecommunications 
services to the maritime, government and 
aviation sectors
 › Long-standing and sustainable 
advantage in global coverage, enabling 
our customers to utilise a seamless, 
consistent service wherever they are in 
the world, ensuring they have reliable, 
always-on connectivity across our truly 
global technology platforms
 › Owner economics, ensuring we provide 
a high quality service to customers, meeting 
their capacity requirements and delivering 
for them an optimised value proposition 
 › Established global distribution networks, 
both through direct and indirect channels, 
providing a diversified route to market, 
global access and reach, specialisation 
and customer intimacy
 › A clear technology roadmap, based on 
an open network architecture, enabling the 
agglomeration of diverse future technologies, 
as appropriate, with a unique ability to:
 – Augment our global GX network 
through new, agile, lower cost technologies, 
focused on areas of high demand, to 
remain a leader in coverage, capability, 
capacity and cost. This will translate 
over the medium-term into high relative 
returns on investment and ensure we 
continue to efficiently deliver a lower cost 
per bit to our customers, while maintaining 
tight control over the timing and extent 
of our capex. As a consequence we expect 
infrastructure capex to meaningfully 
moderate after 2020
 – Renew our valuable and differentiated 
L-band services with the current 
investment in the Inmarsat-6 generation 
of satellites, which will replace our 
Inmarsat-4 series. This will also help us to 
pursue complementary medium-term 
L -band growth opportunities in 
emerging global IoT markets and 
other new opportunities
In Maritime, we are confident that our future 
growth will be founded on continued progress 
in penetrating the maritime VSAT markets 
and by diversification of our L -band business 
into new market segments. In Government, 
we remain well-placed to capture value over 
the medium-term as the trusted provider 
of unique space-based capabilities to 
governments as and when near-term budgetary 
and operational tempo headwinds start to ease. 
In Enterprise, future growth is targeted in the 
emerging IoT opportunity, where we expect 
satellite services to play a substantial global 
role over the medium-term. Finally, we expect 
that Aviation will be the largest individual growth 
driver for the overall business in the coming 
years, through the consistent double-digit 
growth trajectory of our core Aviation business 
(composed of services to the Business and 
General Aviation segment and the Safety and 
Operational Services segment) and through 
the significant medium-term growth potential 
of our fast-emerging and substantial IFC 
Aviation business.

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 10 Strategic Report | Chief Executive’s strategic review Based on our future delivery against these 
strategic objectives, we remain confident 
in the medium to long-term growth outlook 
for the business. This confidence reflects the 
strong long-term growth anticipated in our 
key mobile satellite communications markets, 
our market-leading global broadband GX 
capabilities, our unique competitive position 
within each of the fast-growing Aviation markets, 
the resilience and agility of our established 
L -band business and its future growth potential, 
the power of our global distribution channels 
and our full-service global mobile offering.
Building on the strong positive momentum 
achieved in 2017, and based on our recent 
contract wins in a number of markets, 
we expect to deliver further revenue growth 
in the short term, to come mainly from 
material new GX revenue streams. We expect 
our L -band business to remain resilient over 
the medium-term, given its differentiated 
characteristics, with future growth coming from 
the emergence of new market opportunities, 
such as IoT, services to smaller vessels and 
aircraft, and next generation maritime 
and aviation safety services.
A STRATEGY DESIGNED TO 
FUTURE PROOF OUR BUSINESS 
Given Inmarsat’s track record, unique capabilities 
and differentiated market position, we are well 
placed to continue to grow our revenues in 
2018 and beyond and to capture significant 
medium-term growth opportunities available 
to us in each of our chosen markets.
This will be supported by our strategy, 
outlined in more detail on the next few pages 
of this report, which is to be an ‘enabler for 
the connected world’. This strategy is based 
on the following priorities:
 › Capturing the maximum number 
of broadband platforms
 › Re-positioning our L -band services 
for new growth
 › Establishing our digital platform  
and business
 › Creating a high-performance 
organisation and
 › Transforming our operating environment
We are targeting mid-single digit percentage 
revenue growth (excluding Ligado) on average 
over the next five years, with EBITDA and free 
cash flow generation (both excluding Ligado) 
expected to steadily improve as a result of the 
combined impact of this growing revenue base, 
an improved revenue mix, tightly managed 
overhead costs and new, lower cost, satellite 
technologies being implemented. We expect 
these factors to drive a meaningful moderation 
in our annual infrastructure capex over 
the medium-term.
Finally, I would like to thank our employees for 
their support and hard work over the past year, 
in particular for their willingness to embrace 
change. And I would like to thank our partners, 
customers, shareholders and other stakeholders 
for the trust and support they continue 
to give us.

EMPLOYEE 
ENGAGEMENT
Employee engagement describes 
an employee’s level of commitment 
and enthusiasm to their work and 
their company.
Why it is important
This is a new KPI for 2017. It is 
important as higher levels 
of employee engagement have 
been proven to positively impact 
business performance.
 4
EMPLOYEE TURNOVER
Voluntary employee turnover 
is calculated as the number 
of voluntary leavers in a year 
(permanent employees) divided 
by the average headcount 
during the year.
Why it is important
Some level of turnover is healthy 
to enable a refresh of our skills base 
and create new opportunities for 
our people to progress. However, 
keeping it at a reasonable level is 
important to sustain engagement, 
retain key skills and knowledge 
and avoid unnecessary disruption 
and recruitment costs.

Significant growth opportunities
FIXED SATELLITE OPERATORS’ 
MARKETS REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE, 
WHILST GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 
REMAIN IN MOBILITY
Unlike fixed satellite operators, Inmarsat has 
no exposure to slower growth, structurally 
challenged markets, in particular video and 
fixed point telecommunications, and is therefore 
highly differentiated from these operators.
As evidence of this, Inmarsat outperformed 
the listed fixed service operator peer group, 
in terms of revenue growth, in recent years. 
Further validation of the growth prospects 
of mobility is that most of the fixed satellite 
operators are looking to enter mobility markets 
to support their future growth profile.
Inmarsat has a unique position in mobility, 
with a long-standing and sustainable 
advantage in coverage, high-performance 
mobility-designed satellites, unique and 
highly secure networks and technology, 
embedded safety services and a  
market-leading distribution network.
ONGOING SURGE IN DEMAND FOR 
BROADBAND DATA ON THE MOVE
The major long-term trend in our industry is 
the significant ongoing surge in demand for 
broadband data. In each of Inmarsat’s core 
market segments, customers continue to 
utilise more of our products, which have been 
uniquely designed to deliver truly pervasive, 
highly reliable broadband data on the move.
Broadband data is increasingly becoming 
a mission-critical enabler of our customers’ 
businesses, to help drive their commercial 
and operational progress. Our customers’ 
demand for data is being accelerated by the 
emergence of the ‘internet of things’ which 
is proliferating billions of smart devices and 
extending the requirement for highly secure, 
highly reliable connectivity into many new 
areas of the global economy.
Inmarsat is already at the forefront 
of providing this connectivity and we will 
continue to support our customers as 
their requirements continue to develop 
over the medium to long-term.
MOBILITY RELATIVELY  
WELL-INSULATED FROM RISK 
OF FUTURE OVER-SUPPLY
Satellite operators are progressively adopting 
HTS technology, with HTS capacity expected 
to grow from less than 700 Gbps in 2015 
to approximately 3,600 Gbps in 2020 while 
demand is now expected to exceed 1,500 Gbps 
by 2020, the majority of which is expected to 
come the utilisation of consumer broadband 
in North America (source: Euroconsult).
Consequently, most of the competing satellite 
systems planning to launch in the coming years 
have not been designed and will not therefore 
be optimised, for mobility markets. We expect 
Inmarsat’s core global maritime, aviation 
and government mobility markets will remain 
relatively well insulated from this threat.
Furthermore, much of the capacity to be 
delivered by these new satellite systems 
may be ‘stranded’ over areas of low demand, 
so negatively impacting the economics 
of these systems.
INCREASING INTEGRATION 
WITH TERRESTRIAL NETWORKS 
AND ECOSYSTEMS
In a world increasingly reliant on coverage 
and connectivity to perform mission-critical 
tasks via applications and solutions, mobile 
satellite communications services can offer 
a powerful complementary capability to 
terrestrial networks, delivering a complete 
package to end-users, and providing high 
levels of resilience.
The reach of terrestrial networks has 
extended geographically, working seamlessly 
with global satellite communications networks, 
providing customers with the end-to-end 
services they require. Consequently, the closer 
integration of satellite with broader information 
and communications ecosystems is therefore 
expected to lead to the increasing importance 
of value-added services and new business 
models in the industry.
Inmarsat will look to collaborate with terrestrial 
operators to provide holistic solutions and 
applications for end-user customers. For example, 
we announced in March 2017 our participation 
in AT&T’s consortium for the First Responder 
Network Authority contract in the U.S., with 
a view to delivering a wide portfolio of satellite 
communication solutions and value-added 
services, as part of the AT&T’s national 
network solution.
KEY MARKET TRENDS AND 
INMARSAT’S POSITION
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Satellite communications operators, like 
Inmarsat, own and operate fleets of satellites as 
a communications network, distributing services 
either directly to end customers or with the 
support of third party service providers and 
distributors. There are two primary categories 
of satellite operators:
 › Mobile satellite services (‘MSS’) operators, 
including Inmarsat, typically operating in L -, 
Ka- or S-frequency bands, and focusing on 
communications for mobility applications 
in commercial and governmental markets
 › Fixed satellite services (‘FSS’) operators 
operate in Ka-, Ku- and C -bands, and focus 
on communications for fixed applications 
in media, telecoms, corporate and 
governmental markets
MSS and FSS operators use satellites that 
are located in geostationary orbit, orbiting 
35,786km above the Earth, medium earth orbit, 
orbiting approximately 8,000 to 16,000km 
above the Earth and low earth orbit, orbiting 
approximately 480 to 1,600km above  
the Earth.
Inmarsat’s satellites are in geostationary 
orbit, orbiting the Earth above the equator 
at the same speed as the Earth rotates, 
and therefore remain above the same point 
relative to the Earth’s surface. This means 
that a satellite system of just three satellites 
is enough to achieve global coverage. 
For satellite operators in middle and low 
earth orbits, given their closer proximity 
to Earth and the technological challenges 
of landing traffic from those positions, 
many more satellites are required to 
achieve global coverage.
INMARSAT HAS A UNIQUE POSITION IN MOBILITY ,

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 18 Strategic Report | Our markets In-Flight Connectivity: a growth market
The major growth opportunity for Inmarsat in the coming years is the provision 
of IFC services to customers in the commercial air transport segment
 2 0 , 000+
PREDICTED INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF CONNECTED AIRCRAFT 
IN OPERATION BY THE MIDDLE OF 
THE NEXT DECADE
According to 2017 research conducted 
by Inmarsat in conjunction with the 
London School of Economics, connectivity 
is transforming aviation markets, with 
related ancillary revenues from activities 
like targeted advertising, e-commerce 
and the delivery of premium content and 
entertainment becoming increasingly 
important to airline profitability.
This research forecasts that airlines will 
be gatekeepers to a $130bn incremental 
market opportunity for all related parties 
by 2035, empowered by IFC services, 
with the airlines themselves capturing 
around 25% of this value. This will be 
driven by digitalisation across the industry, 
consistent growth in passenger demand 
for connectivity and new technologies, 
powered by satellite communications and 
air-to-ground networks. Consequently, 
the retail value for satellite operators and 
services providers delivering IFC connectivity 
services to the industry is predicted to grow 
from around $1bn in 2017 to $5.4bn by 2026 
(source: Euroconsult).
Inmarsat, with a current estimated segment 
share in IFC of over 30% (excluding North 
America and based on our signed aircraft 
under contract for GX Aviation services), 
is targeting to become the market leader 
in this rapidly developing market segment.
With our unique global broadband networks 
(including both GX and our integrated satellite/
air-to-ground, the EAN), complemented by 
our global high resilience and safety networks 
(deployed across our SwiftBroadband (‘SB’)
and SB-Safety services) and supported by 
our strong and highly experienced distribution 
channel and hardware partners (as well as our 
own newly created direct sales, marketing and 
service delivery capability), we are well-placed 
to continue to drive towards market leadership 
in this high-growth sector over the coming 
years. Although we currently remain in the 
market capture and infrastructure investment 
phase regarding the global IFC opportunity, 
we remain confident that over the medium-term 
our IFC business will become highly profitable 
and cash generative on a long-term, 
sustained basis.

TRANSFORMING EFFICIENCY AND 
OPERATIONS – ENVIRONMENTAL 
COMPLIANCE
Monitoring ships’ energy consumption and 
emissions is required by law in many parts of the 
world. With fuel soaking up 46% of running costs 
on average (source: Drewry), shipping companies 
have another powerful incentive to make sure 
their vessels are running efficiently.
Rolls-Royce’s Energy Management System collects 
data from a multitude of ship control systems and 
equipment sensors. Using Inmarsat’s high speed 
always-on broadband service Fleet Xpress (‘FX’), 
this data will now be aggregated and reported 
in real time – meaning any inefficiencies can be 
flagged and immediately dealt with, often remotely. 
But Fleet Xpress is more than just a connectivity 
pipe. Our investment in the Inmarsat Gateway 
is creating an application ecosystem where 
accredited innovators develop content-rich 
solutions integrated with our network.
Additionally, flexible control of bandwidth will 
allow ship managers to choose whether to dedicate 
part of their service to specific vessel efficiency 
measures, or for the application itself to trigger 
bandwidth dynamically. Together, these technological 
advances will enable safer, smarter, greener and 
more efficient vessels.

committed to Fleet Xpress over the coming years, 
including both commitments from our key strategic 
distribution partners as well as vessels committed 
to be migrated from our interim VSAT product, 
XpressLink (‘XL’), to Fleet Xpress, ensuring 
a strong foundation for growth going forward.
Revenue from our VSAT products, XL and FX, 
increased by 20.9% in 2017, including 18.3% 
growth in Q4, 25.8% in Q3, 21.0% in Q2 and 17.7% in 
Q1, highlighting the on-going increase in customer 
usage of our high bandwidth products. There were 
4,332 VSAT vessels at the end of the year (2016: 
3,028), including 2,614 FX vessels (2016: 335).
The VSAT installation order book has also 
increased, rising to around 720 vessels at 
the end of 2017 , from around 500 at the end of 
2016. The pace of FX installations continued 
to accelerate, driven by the continued ramp-up 
of our internal installation capability and the 
growing engagement of our distribution partners. 
The overall proportion of completely new customer 
installations remained high during the year at 
26%, (Q4: 31%, Q3: 25%, Q2: 22%, Q1: 19%).
THE VSAT MARKET –  
MARKET OUTLOOK AND 
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The major opportunity for Inmarsat in maritime 
is in the high bandwidth Very Small Aperture 
Terminal (‘VSAT’) segment. The addressable 
market for VSAT services is expected to double 
over the next decade, from around 20,000 
vessels today to around 40,000 vessels at the 
start of the next decade, with the market worth 
around $1bn at that point
1
.
With our large legacy user base (to migrate 
to VSAT services), global distribution network, 
unique product and service range, and trusted 
heritage, Inmarsat remains in a strong position 
to be able to garner a leading position in this 
major market opportunity. Our high bandwidth 
GX-based product, Fleet Xpress (‘FX’), continues 
to establish itself as the leading service proposition 
in this market, with fast-growing revenues from 
both our direct sales channel and, increasingly, 
through our long-established distribution partner 
community. We now have more than 10,000 ships 
After a challenging year 
in 2016, which continued

were with our distribution partners (Q3: 423, 
Q2: 243, Q1: 97).
As anticipated, VSAT Average Revenue per User 
(‘ARPU’) declined by 7.3% to $2,885 per month in 
2017, reflecting the on-going impact of wholesalers 
continuing to increase their share of this mix, a trend 
which is expected to accelerate. Retail ARPU 
for XL vessels remained stable during the year 
at around $3,000 per month, with around 1,700 
vessels to be migrated to FX in the coming years.
THE MID-MARKET –  
MARKET OUTLOOK AND 
OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The mid-market segment in Maritime is where 
Inmarsat has been a leader for many years, with 
our core L -band product, FleetBroadband (‘FB’) 
setting the standard for maritime connectivity 
services. This segment comprises the merchant, 
offshore, high-end fishing and high-end leisure 
sub-segments and numbers around 60,000 
vessels today, with a total segment value at 
retail of around $540m
1
. Over the medium-term, 
we expect a moderate decline in the size of this 
segment, driven principally by the migration of 
vessels into the VSAT segment (see above) on 
an ARPU accretive basis. In the mid-market 
segment, we expect FB to continue to be highly 
competitive, bolstered by material cost, form 
factor and capability improvements which will 
become available following the launch of our 
Inmarsat-6 series satellites in the early 2020s 
and which will maintain our position as the 
leading L -band services innovator.
FB performed solidly in 2017. Vessels using the 
product declined to 36,105 at the end of 2017 , from 
38,088 at the end of 2016. Around 40% of this 
decline in FB vessel numbers (around 830 vessels) 
related to the managed, ARPU-accretive migration 
of these vessels up to FX. The remainder (around 
1,100 mainly low ARPU vessels) were lost as a result 
of scrappage and increased competition at the 
low end of the market (which we are addressing 
through new service propositions, including 
Fleet One). As a result of these factors, 
FB revenues declined by 5.1% in 2017.
FB ARPU has remained resilient over the year 
at around $780 per month, with the positive 
impact of customers moving to higher value 
packages within FB, broadly offsetting a number 
of customers with higher value FB packages 
migrating to FX, a trend which is expected 
to continue in the coming years.
Revenue from our mainly lower margin and 
legacy products declined by 14.8% in 2017 
with the decline in our legacy services partially 
offset by increased sales of FX terminals which 
contributed an increase in revenue of $7.1m 
in 2017. FX and Fleet One terminal sales become 
a regular feature of our revenue mix, as we 
further our efforts to capture and build share 
in the VSAT and Smaller Vessel markets.
THE SMALLER VESSEL MARKET –  
MARKET OUTLOOK AND OUR 
PERFORMANCE IN 2017
The size of the addressable market in smaller 
vessels, which includes fishing and leisure vessels, 
is around 690,000 vessels today, and is expected 
to see moderate growth over the next decade 
to around 725,000 vessels, valuing the market 
at around $780m
1
. We see significant potential 
in the medium to long-term to serve this large 
market, where the small form-factor, low cost 
and unique service capabilities of our newly 
launched L -band offering, Fleet One, will have 
sustained differentiation.
Fleet One delivered $5.0m of airtime and 
equipment revenue in 2017, up from $3.2m in 
2016, predominantly as a result of increased 
vessel numbers. Fleet One’s customer base 
grew to 3,083 vessels by the end of the year, 
an increase of around 800 from the end 
of 2016. Fleet One’s average ARPU increased 
year-on-year to $100 per month for 2017.
MARITIME COSTS, MARGINS 
AND CAPEX
Against the backdrop of flat revenues, direct 
costs increased by $6.9m in the year, reflecting 
a change in revenue mix, due to the impact of 
lower margin FX and Fleet One terminal sales to 
capture market share. Indirect costs decreased 
by $4.6m in the year, driven by the impact of 
an internal reorganisation in July 2016, which 
moved costs of c. $4m during 2016 from 
Maritime into Central Services.
As a result of the above factors, EBITDA in 2017 
declined by $13.0m, 2.9%. EBITDA margin 
decreased to 78.2% in the year, (from 79.1% 
in 2016). Maritime capex was relatively flat 
for the year. 
Cyber resilience at sea
In today’s connected world, the threat of cyber crime is very real. The high profile attack 
on A.P. Moller-Maersk in 2017 is reported to have cost the company between $200m and 
$300m*. Satellite connectivity has driven the growth of computer systems controlling 
navigation and operations, bringing a new level of sophistication to shipping. Meanwhile, 
crew are bringing on board more devices and consuming more content. The threat from 
malicious attacks to a ship’s infrastructure has never been so real. It can have a substantial 
effect on the safety of crew, security of data and theft of valuable cargo, which is why cyber 
resilience at sea is essential. Inmarsat’s Fleet Secure, powered by the Trustwave Unified 
Threat Management system, gives vessel operators the tools they need to protect their 
fleet from cyber attack, detect vulnerabilities and respond to threats. With Fleet Secure 
as a Managed Service and seamlessly integrated into Fleet Xpress, there is peace of 
mind and complete visibility and protection of vessels today and in the future.

SURVEILLANCE
Tactical Unmanned Air Vehicles (‘UAVs’) are 
widely used for surveillance – by military forces, 
safety and security organisations and many 
enterprises. But LALE (low altitude long endurance) 
UAV operators have faced frustrating limitations 
because the satellite technology that could 
extend sorties beyond line of sight (‘BLOS’) has 
been too big, heavy and power-draining for 
the compact airframes.
Until now. Inmarsat SB-UAV couples a significantly 
reduced technical terminal with SwiftBroadband 
always-on data up to 200 kbps – with the 
only limit being the UAV’s range. Compression 
software makes it possible to send high-quality 
video in real-time, for full and immediate 
situational awareness. SB-UAV is transforming 
airborne communications, no more so than at 
sea where only satellite networks can reach.

are expected to grow 
from around $800m in 
2017 to nearly $1.4bn 
by 2025, on a wholesale 
basis (source: NSR)
The resilience of satellite communications 
continues to be a focus for policy attention 
and investment within NATO and Five-Eyes 
countries. Major government agencies 
have acknowledged the need to rely upon 
commercial satellite communications as part 
of an integrated satellite communications 
architecture. This strategy focuses on 
delivering a global user experience, with unique 
government features, across all government 
service platforms. To meet this need, Inmarsat 
provides trusted end-to-end managed 
communications on a global basis – ‘SATCOM 
as a Service’ – to proactively support 
government customers’ desire for innovation 
and agility in acquisition.
Inmarsat continues to work with its 
technology partners to deliver innovative 
products and services built to meet the 
expanding requirements of the Defence and 
Intelligence Community as well as civilian 
agencies, such as coast guard, immigration, 
border protection, diplomatic, VIP, public 
safety and emergency responders.
Notable innovations have included Military-Ka 
for manned/unmanned Airborne Intelligence 
Surveillance & Reconnaissance (‘AISR’), 
which delivers high data rates to and from 
Ka-band-equipped U.S. aircraft, adding new 
trusted capabilities for national security. 
In addition, the launch of new aeronautical 
terminals have expedited access to the 
GX global network and provided a more 
connected experience in the air and  
on the sea.
Inmarsat has also extended its innovation in 
the high mobility government L -band market 
with products and services tailored to specific 
customers’ needs, further enhancing military 
satellite systems. Evidence of this is continued 
high utilisation of Inmarsat’s unique L -band 
Tactical Satellite service (‘L -TAC’) – a highly 
resilient communication service that 
MARKET OUTLOOK
The growth of Government and military 
satellite communications will be driven by 
internationalisation of demand beyond 
the established space-equipped nations, 
major events, budgetary stimulus, technology 
obsolescence and new opportunities emerging 
from a structural shift from government 
procurement of proprietary space infrastructure 
to the acquisition by governments of off-the-shelf 
services from commercial partners to replace 
or complement proprietary capabilities. We 
also believe that many governments will embrace 
the power of space-based communications 
in areas of high policy importance such as 
first response and emergency readiness and 
interoperability, e-citizenship, bridging the digital 
divide, security and efficiency of infrastructure 
(including energy and water systems) and 
next generation transportation and logistics 
networks. Consequently, government agencies’ 
operational reliance on commercially-provided 
space-based capabilities is expected to become 
an increasingly common feature of the industry.
Inmarsat is well placed to participate in this 
potential emerging new government market 
segment over the long-term, having invested 
significantly in MILSATCOM augmentation 
in recent years, both in Ka-band and L -band, 
in particular to ensure that GX is fully fungible with 
the U.S. Government’s proprietary satellite system 
in the future. In particular, Inmarsat’s ability 
to augment existing military satellite systems 
through the global availability of its end-to-end 
L -band and Ka-band networks is delivering 
highly resilient communication capabilities with 
increased flexibility and robustness in support 
of mission-critical applications.
By combining mission-focused product 
innovation with mature customer relationships 
and understanding, we will continue to deliver 
clear competitive differentiation and diversify 
into new verticals and geographies.

In an era of constant political scrutiny via social media and the 24 hour news cycle, 
Heads of State and senior government officials cannot afford to be offline when they are 
in-flight. They need ‘office in the sky’ connectivity for multiple devices, voice and video, 
secure VPN, as well as IP TV and streaming ser vices, so they can stay informed and 
respond effectively to fast moving events.
Inmarsat Global Xpress delivers seamless, reliable high-speed broadband wherever they fly. 
Combined with Eclipse’s Aero+ Flexibility solution, bandwidth can be assigned to different 
zones in the plane – for example, accompanying journalists can pay to access data or 
the whole allocation can be directed to the HoS if they are handling a crisis – all without 
impacting safety services in the cockpit.
So today, global leaders are travelling safe in the knowledge they will never be in the dark.

In addition, micro antennas, as small as 12.5cm, 
are delivering extremely high data rates and 
are now operationally deployed to support 
small intelligence platforms.
PERFORMANCE IN 2017
Our Government business delivered revenue 
growth of 11.0% in 2017, reflecting another 
strong operational performance. Despite 
several years of strong revenue growth in 
Government, budget and operational tempo 
headwinds persist with many of our core 
customers. Consequently, near-term future 
revenue growth is expected to be modest, 
as the Boeing take or pay contract reduces 
to a normalised level, the exceptional revenues 
of 2017 are not repeated and contract wins 
continue to be lumpy and irregular.
U.S. Government revenues grew by 21.4% 
in 2017, driven by the impact of short-term 
higher operational tempo activity during 
Q3, a material new business win in Q2 and 
approximately nine months of revenue from 
the U.S. Navy Commercial Broadband Satellite 
Program Satellite Services Contract (‘CSSC’). 
In addition, there was another full year of 
revenue from our Take or Pay contract with 
Boeing, which is expected to decline to 
normalised levels that will be established 
in the next few years.
Outside the U.S., Government revenues fell 
by 5.1% in 2017, mainly reflecting a material 
reduction in exceptional operational revenues 
outside the U.S. from Q3 2017, which had 
been received since Q3 2015.
Direct costs during 2017 increased by $13.2m, 
32.0%, including an increase of $5.5m, due 
to the increased contribution from the CSSC 
contract, which is relatively low margin, and 
the challenging comparator, as outlined above. 
Indirect costs increased by $1.7m, or 3.8% 
in the year. EBITDA increased by $21.3m, 
8.7%, in the year and EBITDA margin declined

IN ANCILLARY REVENUES
We know the appetite for in-flight broadband is 
there – 60% of respondents in the 2017 Inmarsat 
In-Flight Connectivity Survey considered it a 
necessity, not a luxury – but what is passenger 
connectivity worth to the global airline industry?
In the first research study of its kind, the London 
School of Economics and Political Science (‘LSE’), 
in association with Inmarsat, developed an 
independent forecasting model to predict how 
broadband-enabled ancillary revenues are set 
to take off. The result: Airlines are the gatekeepers 
of a staggering $130bn* of ancillary revenues 
by 2035, of which the airlines themselves will 
potentially benefit by $30bn*.
Reliable, high-quality broadband connectivity is 
the catalyst for targeted advertising, content and 
e-commerce revenue opportunities. Once airlines 
can offer uninterrupted broadband services, each 
passenger can be worth $4* more per flight – that’s 
a potential 2,000% rise within the next 17 years.

REVENUE GROWTH DELIVERED 
BY OUR AVIATION BUSINESS 
IN 2017
In BGA, SwiftBroadband revenues grew by 16.2% 
in 2017 to $75.3m (2016: $64.8m), driven by an 
increase in number of installed aircraft and higher 
average revenue per aircraft (‘ARPA’), which 
increased to $1,665 per month, from $1,496 per 
month at the end of 2016, as a result of higher 
airtime usage. By the end of 2017, there were 
3,818
1
 active aircraft with SwiftBroadband 
services in BGA (2016: 3,609). The installation 
programme for JetConneX, our new GX-based 
product for the BGA market, gained continued 
traction during the year, with 165 terminals now 
installed, generating airtime revenue of $4.6m 
in 2017 (2016: $0.3m). JetConneX is now line fit 
on the five large OEM platforms (Gulfstream, 
Bombardier, Dassault, Embraer and Cessna), 
which we expect to drive accelerated growth 
over the medium-term.
In SOS, our Classic Aero product delivered 
revenue growth of 15.2% to $41.8m in 2017, 
(2016: $36.3m), with an increase in number 
of total aircraft to 9,224 (2016: 8,951) and as 
a result of higher ARPA, which increased to 
$380 per month, from $338 per month in 2016, 
reflecting higher customer airtime usage.
Revenue in our other legacy products in our 
core business decreased slightly to $11.0m 
in 2017 (2016: $12.4m).
IFC PERFORMANCE IN 2017
IFC revenues, comprising our SwiftBroadband- 
based IFC services for commercial aviation, 
as well as our GX Aviation services for IFC, 
grew by $33.2m to $62.5m in 2017.
the BGA segment) has exceptional immediate 
growth potential in the BGA segment, and that 
our soon-to-be-launched SB-Safety product 
has strong medium-term growth potential 
in the SOS segment, including for both next 
generation safety services and air traffic 
management services (for example, in the 
European IRIS project).
IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY 
(‘IFC’) – MARKET OUTLOOK
As outlined on page 19, the major growth 
opportunity for Inmarsat in the coming years 
is the provision of IFC services to customers 
in the commercial air transport segment.
There is expected to be a ramp-up in the number  
of connected aircraft in operation in the future 
– from 6,000 in 2015 to over 20,000 by the 
middle of the next decade (source: Valour). 
Over 70% of these new aircraft are expected to 
be based in the relatively nascent IFC markets 
of Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and 
Latin America. These regions will drive the 
majority of the future growth of the global 
air transport industry and are therefore key 
target areas for Inmarsat.
CORE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE 
IN 2017
Revenue in our Core business, which comprises 
SwiftBroadband and JetConneX for BGA, 
Classic Aero for SOS and other legacy products, 
increased by $19.2m to $132.5m in 2017.
We expect that Aviation 
will be the largest 
individual growth driver 
in the coming years
BUSINESS AND GENERAL 
AVIATION (‘BGA’) AND SAFETY 
AND OPERATIONS SERVICES 
(‘SOS’) – MARKET OUTLOOK
The retail value of the BGA segment is expected 
to more than treble in size, from $250m in 
2017 to $1bn by 2026 (source: Euroconsult), 
driven by a continued steady increase in aircraft 
and an increased bandwidth requirement per 
aircraft, partly driven by innovation in cabin 
and cockpit applications.
The SOS segment is expected to more than 
double in size from $55m in 2017 to $150m in 
2026 (source: Inmarsat internal estimates), 
on a wholesale basis. This is driven by the 
transition of legacy communications systems 
to next generation IP networks, key regulatory 
mandates coming into force over the 
medium-term, the rise of next generation 
safety services, the increasing prevalence 
of cockpit satellite communications and 
revolutionary ‘connected aircraft’ services 
becoming the norm in the industry.
Inmarsat has strong legacy market positions and 
new product offerings in both of these markets, 
as well as an exceptionally experienced and 
capable distribution channel to market, and 
we expect to continue to deliver strong revenue 
and profit growth, based on further product 
and service upgrades which will drive customer 
usage in the future. Specifically, we believe that 
SwiftBroadband has room to continue to grow 
in both the BGA and SOS segments, especially in 
the fast-emerging smaller aircraft sub-segment 
and for connected aircraft applications, that

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 30 Strategic Report | Business overview  of the major growth opportunities in IFC. 
Consequently, EBITDA in IFC, during the current 
phase of investment in market capture and 
delivery, declined to $(18.3)m (2016: $(5.9)m).
EBITDA for the overall Aviation business 
increased by $6.0m, 6.2%, in 2017, with EBITDA 
margin declining to 53.0% in the year, from 
68.3% in 2016, reflecting the changing revenue 
mix and higher indirect costs in IFC.
We continue to believe that Aviation EBITDA 
margins will remain negatively impacted in the 
short term by our efforts to build our market 
position in IFC. Revenues will initially be low 
margin installation revenues rather than higher 
margin air time revenues, as we drive equipment 
installation programmes for certain customers. 
In addition, indirect Aviation costs will continue 
to rise in the short term (albeit more slowly than 
in 2016 and 2017) as we continue to invest in 
IFC market capture and delivery.
However, over the medium-term we expect 
IFC margins to rebuild as higher margin airtime 
revenues come to the fore and as our indirect 
costs to support the business stabilise in 
support of a business that can then scale.
As previously outlined, we believe that, over the 
years 2016 to 2021, EBITDA margins in Aviation 
will fall from over 60% in 2016 to around 50% 
in 2017 and then to around 40% in 2018, after 
which higher revenues, improved revenue mix 
and more stable indirect costs start to deliver 
a return to 2016 margins in Aviation.
Cash capex decreased by $22.1m in the year, 
as a result of significant infrastructure investment 
in the S-band satellite in Q4 2016, ahead of its 
launch in Q2 2017.
Our SwiftBroadband-based IFC services in 
commercial aviation, delivered revenue growth 
of 41.6% to $39.0m in 2017 (2016: $27.6m). 
This growth was driven by increased usage 
by a number of key customers during the year, 
with around 900 active aircraft currently using 
the service. Over the medium term, we expect 
to transition a portion of these customers 
onto GX for Aviation IFC services.
A substantial number of airlines signed up for 
the provision of GX for Aviation IFC services 
during 2017, including Qatar Airways, Avianca, 
AirAsia, Philippine Airlines and Air Astana, and 
we now have over 1,300 aircraft expected under 
signed contracts for IFC services, (2016: 950 
aircraft), with around 3,000 aircraft in our new 
business pipeline.
During the year, several customers made 
progress with their GX terminal installation 
programmes, including Deutsche Lufthansa 
Group, and we continue to support them 
in preparation for active service. There were 
194 GX-installed aircraft across a number of 
our customers at the end of 2017 (from 20 
at the end of 2016 – all of which are directly 
related to Lufthansa). Consequently, $23.6m 
of GX-related IFC revenue was generated in 
2017, (2016: $1.6m). The vast majority of 
this revenue was relatively low margin 
installation revenue.
The complementary ground component of 
the EAN is now complete, and we are working to 
activate aircraft for trials, with European roll-out 
of the service expected to take place into 2019. 
We now have substantially all the required 
regulatory authorisations for this phase.
AVIATION COSTS, MARGINS 
AND CAPEX
Direct costs in our Core business remained fairly 
immaterial at $1.0m in 2017, given the dynamics 
of this business (which are based on the sales 
of airtime through partners and resellers). Indirect 
costs in the Core business remained stable 
at $9.8m, with EBITDA increasing to $121.7m 
during the year (2016:$103.3m), reflecting 
revenue growth and related operational 
gearing in that business.
In IFC, direct costs increased to $25.1m in 
2017 (2016: $3.2m), as a result of additional 
lower margin GX installation revenues being 
added to the revenue mix. Indirect costs 
in IFC increased by $23.7m to $55.7m, due 
to increased headcount and other overhead 
costs associated with the pursuit and delivery 
Safety in the skies
Over the last 15 years, global air transport passenger levels have soared from 1.6 billion to 
3.8 billion*. That’s only been possible because satellite communication in the cockpit has 
enabled airlines to safely put more planes in the sky at any one time and open up more routes.
Improved Air Traffic Control (‘ATC’) and operational benefits such as better fleet management 
and increased efficiency have saved the airline industry an astounding $3bn* over that time.
With passenger numbers predicted to double by 2035, Inmarsat is transforming aviation 
connectivity again. SwiftBroadband-Safety offers high-speed, secure IP connectivity 
globally to further optimise flight operations and support a host of new safety applications –  
as well as delivering even more savings for the industry.

building the North-South railway line to enable 
the movement of valuable commodities along the

this colossal project, Valec needed a better way 
to control the flow of traffic and operations while 
the partially in-use line was completed.
Inmarsat partner Globalsat has installed BGAN 
terminals in rail vehicles so the central operations 
centre can use GPS tracking to pinpoint their 
location and talk to the drivers on push-to-talk 
radio handsets anywhere and at any time, thanks 
to Inmarsat’s highly reliable L -band satellite

REVENUE GROWTH  
IN M2M
Whilst this is still at a very early stage of 
development and it will take some considerable 
time to position and scale our IoT products and 
services for substantial new revenue growth, 
we are confident in the long-term potential 
for our business in this area. In particular, 
we expect significant new growth potential 
over the medium-term to arise from emerging 
new market opportunities associated with 
the ‘digital society’ and/or global 5G 
deployments, including IoT.
M2M – A MAJOR FOUNDATION 
FOR FUTURE GROWTH
Our position in Machine-to-Machine (‘M2M’) 
connectivity continues to provide us with a 
strong foundation from which to nurture and 
grow potential development opportunities 
around ‘Internet of Things’ applications.
During the year, in line with our drive to 
maximise this opportunity, we made a small 
minority investment in Actility, an IoT solutions 
specialist, following our recently established 
partnership with them to extend the reach 
of our satellite networks through the addition 
of a Low Power Wide Area Network extension 
for IoT applications globally.
Inmarsat continues to play a role in the LoRa 
Alliance, which is dedicated to developing 
a global standard for IoT. The LoRa Alliance 
was founded by industry leaders across the 
industry to help enable IoT, M2M, smart city 
and industrial applications. Inmarsat aims 
to provide the LoRa ecosystem with satellite 
connectivity to enable the deployment of 
solutions anywhere an object or device 
needs to be connected.
In addition, we gained further traction in 
facilitating the deployment of IDP services, 
in response to the growth in mission critical 
IoT applications which is driving demand 
for connectivity with unprecedented reach, 
range and reliability on a global basis.
MARKET OUTLOOK
The emerging digital society will depend 
for its success on connectivity as a critical 
enabler – but the networks needed to support 
new digitally enabled environments such 
as smart cities, intelligent transport systems, 
energy systems, clean water, agriculture, 
e-logistics, tele-medicine and e-government, 
will need pervasive coverage across the 
whole of society, incredible network reliability 
and resilience as well as a range of specialist 
services such as broadcast services and 
precision navigation.
These features demand an enhanced role 
for satellite communications and we believe 
that our small-form factor, cheap, agile, 
resilient and global L -band services are 
perfectly tailored for these needs.
The ability of satellite services to extend the 
range of terrestrial networks and to narrow 
the digital divide, to enhance resiliency and 
redundancy (especially cyber resilience) and 
to provide a range of unique complementary 
capabilities such as broadcast services and 
precision navigation services is expected 
to drive significant medium to longer-term 
growth opportunities for Inmarsat, especially 
in commercial segments such as mining and 
construction, logistics and transportation, 
smart cities and smart agriculture.
In recent years, Inmarsat has successfully 
established a land-based commercial 
mobile satellite services business focused 
on providing highly portable satellite 
communications services to remote 
communities and/or for use when terrestrial 
networks are not available, for example, 
in diverse sectors such as first response, 
media, aid, mining and construction 
and other areas.

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 34 Strategic Report | Business overview  Disaster relief communications
When natural disasters strike, the frequent loss of terrestrial networks hampers 
attempts to get help to victims fast. Establishing reliable communications is essential 
to coordinating relief efforts and keeping emergency responders safe in dangerous, 
sometimes hostile environments.
Team Rubicon unites the skills and experience of military veterans with first responders, 
rapidly deploying teams to communities across the globe affected by disasters. Inmarsat 
has transformed the organisation’s ability to channel their resources and maximise their 
impact by providing a whole raft of satcom services – IsatPhone 2 satellite phones and 
IsatData Pro to keep in touch with and track teams on the ground; BGAN and Global Xpress 
to transmit situational reports and video. When the 2017 hurricane season opened with 
three catastrophic storms in quick succession, and Mexico City suffered a 7.1 magnitude 
earthquake, Team Rubicon ran up to 15 simultaneous operations – without a single 
lost connection.
2017 PERFORMANCE
In 2017, Enterprise revenues declined 
by 8.3% in the year, as a result of ongoing 
market pressures.
Revenue in our Broadband Global Area 
Network (‘BGAN’) product declined by 
8.0% to $27.8m in the year. Satellite phone 
terminal sales and airtime revenues were 
also down, falling 10.0% to $30.8m.
Whilst both product lines benefited from 
the short term impact of hurricane-related 
activity during Q3, they continue to be 
negatively impacted by an increasingly 
competitive market environment, particularly 
from land-based Ka-band and Ku-band 
and cellular alternatives.
Fixed-to-mobile revenues decreased by 
29.1%, $16.6m, during the year, reflecting a 
continued decline of satellite-based voice 
products, partly driven by an ongoing 
migration to Voice over IP.
M2M revenue increased by 9.5% to $18.3m 
during the year, with the number of connected 
M2M terminals increasing to over 358,000 by 
the end of the year, highlighting continued strong 
demand for M2M in commercial applications.
Direct costs increased by $4.6m, 24.5%, 
in 2017, as a result of a change in revenue mix, 
whilst indirect costs reduced by $2.6m, 
13.1%, in the year. As a result of the increase 
in direct costs, EBITDA was down by $14.0m, 
13.2% in 2017. Consequently, EBITDA margin 
declined to 69.3% in 2017.

capabilities to deploy into new regional 
growth opportunities. With full global coverage 
established, our future strategy for GX is to 
augment our network with new, low-cost 
technologies which will provide additional 
capacity by adding highly-targeted density. 
This new satellite technology will be able to 
deliver a significant step-up in throughput 
and capacity into key regions of high 
demand at low cost.
OPERATIONS
Our organisational infrastructure is managed 
and operated by our Central Operations Office, 
with support from our functional teams in 
Finance, HR, Marketing, Legal, Regulatory, 
Compliance, Risk and Governance. 
We continue to drive best practice and 
innovation to drive out cost and complexity 
across our organisation, to become more agile 
and to become easier for partners, customers 
and suppliers to do business with.
In addition, we continue to take action to ensure 
that the organisation’s resources are optimally 
balanced for future growth. For example, 
in Q4 2017 , we initiated a headcount reduction 
programme implemented in Q4 2017 to reduce 
our legacy costs, with associated one-off costs 
of $19.9m, ensuring that we have the capacity 
to invest in new skills to support the future 
growth of the business. Actions such as this will 
help to provide a strong backbone to support 
the growth of the business in the future. 
Revenue from Ligado for the year increased by 
$7.3m. $5m of the yearly increase is attributable 
to deferred income recognised. In total, $16.0m 
(2016: $11.0m) of deferred income was recognised 
during the year with the majority reflecting the 
impact of the revenue deferral arising under the 
revised transition agreement finalised in 2016. 
At 31 December 2017, the Group held $181.8m 
of deferred revenue on the balance sheet in 
respect of expected costs of implementation 
of this agreement. There have been no other 
developments in respect of this agreement 
in the period.
LIGADO NETWORKS
The lack of visibility over the cash payments 
from Ligado beyond the end of 2018 continues. 
Contractually, payments from Ligado will pause 
in 2019 and then resume in 2020 at c. $136m 
per annum, growing thereafter at 3% compound 
over the next 99 years. Should Ligado obtain 
its licence from the Federal Communications 
Commission in 2018, there would be no pause 
in 2019. Any payments not made in 2019, 
together with payments deferred between 2016 
and 2018 (approximately $35m) will be due for 
payment by Ligado with interest at the earlier 
of commissioning their network or 30 June 2021.
Whilst the outlook for Ligado remains uncertain 
there are many ways in which the Ligado position 
could evolve positively for the Group. Ligado 
has been through bankruptcy once already 
with Inmarsat’s contract enduring this event as 
without that contract, Ligado’s stated business 
model and potential high market value are 
not viable. Whilst Inmarsat will continue to adopt 
a prudent approach to Ligado in its financial 
planning, the Group’s contract provides 
material possible upside value.
CENTRAL SERVICES COSTS 
AND CAPEX
Direct costs increased by $13.6m to $16.7m in 2017, 
mainly as a result of increased leasing costs.
Indirect costs increased by $55.3m in the year, 
due to higher underlying central operational 
delivery costs of $41.9m in 2017, relating to 
increased expenditure on the GX network and our 
operational capabilities including Cyber and IT.
We continue to expect a higher level of central 
operational delivery costs, reflecting not 
only the impact of the new GX related ground 
infrastructure being implemented but also 
increased investment in both IT and cyber 
security capabilities across the organisation, 
with the growth in central operational delivery 
costs in 2018 expected to be in the single digits, 
in percentage terms.
Central Services capital expenditure in the year 
increased by $204.9m, due to further expenditure 
on GX, including initial investment in the design 
and build programme for the 5th GX satellite 
and I-6 satellite infrastructure, as well as further 
investment in organisational capability.
Our Central Services team 
is responsible for managing 
and operating our satellite 
and ground networks and 
supporting the business to 
deliver its strategic priorities
TECHNOLOGY
Our Central Technology Office manages and 
operates our satellite and ground infrastructure, 
and manages the design, build and launch of 
our new satellite networks.
Our L -band satellite networks, through eight 
Inmarsat-3 and Inmarsat-4 satellites, have 
helped Inmarsat to establish and develop a 
loyal customer and distribution base over time. 
Our average L -band network availability 
remains at 99.9 per cent, with this reliability 
remaining attractive to government, military 
and enterprise-level users whose operations 
require mission and business critical 
communications support.
The Inmarsat-6 replacement satellites comprise 
two dual payload (L -band and Ka-band) satellites 
to be launched at the start of the next decade. 
This will ensure the reorientation of our L -band 
capabilities towards new growth opportunities 
uniquely addressable by a cutting edge global 
network, with a small, low-cost, highly reliable and 
agile device to deliver our services to end users.
The GX network, based on our four Inmarsat-5 
satellites in Ka-band, is fully operational and has 
been revenue generating since 2016. Our fourth 
GX satellite, launched in 2017, provides in-orbit 
redundancy and additional capacity and

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 38 Strategic Report | Chief Financial Officer’s review due to the I-5 F4 and S-band satellites coming 
into commercial service in the fourth quarter 
of 2017. As a result of these factors, and lower 
Adjusted EBITDA, operating profit for 2017 
decreased by $125.6m compared with 2016.
NET FINANCING COST
On an underlying basis net financing costs 
increased by $13.1m from $86.3m in 2016 
to $99.4m in 2017 due to the higher average 
level of borrowings during the year.
On a reported basis net financing costs for 
2017 decreased by $56.2m to $91.7m with 
the underlying $13.1m increase in net financing 
more than offset by the impact on the income 
statement of the 2017 and 2023 Convertible 
Bonds. There was a net credit of $7.7m in 2017 
due to a decrease in the unrealised conversion 
liability on the 2023 Convertible Bond 
(2016 charge of $28.8m) driven by a fall 
in the convertible bond price over the period 
(see note 9). In addition, in 2016, a $32.8m 
one-off charge was recognised relating to 
the redemption of the 2017 convertible bonds.
TAXATION
The tax charge for 2017 was $47.5m, a decrease 
of $8.3m compared with 2016. This decrease 
is largely driven by the reduced profit in 2017.
The effective tax rate for 2017 was 20.7% 
(2016: 18.6%) compared to an average statutory 
rate for the UK for 2017 of 19.25% (2016: 20%). 
The higher effective tax rate is largely due to 
the revaluation of U.S. related deferred tax assets 
driven by the reduction in the U.S. Federal tax 
rate from 35% to 21% in Q4 2017; the impact of 
this was $9.8m. This deferred tax cost is partially 
offset by the beneficial impact of the unrealised 
conversion liability on the convertible bonds 
which is not taxable. In 2016, the effective tax 
rate was impacted by the revaluation of the 
deferred tax liabilities due to a reduction in 
the UK tax rate from 18% to 17% from 2020.
The underlying effective tax rate for the year 
(after removing the impact of the unrealised 
conversion liability on the convertible bonds 
and the revaluation of deferred tax balances) 
was 15.7% (2016: 19.4%). This relatively low 
rate and improvement on 2016 is largely due 
to the benefits from the Patent Box regime in 
the UK secured earlier this year which results 
in some profits being taxed at 10%, rather than 
the statutory rate of 19.25%.
PROFIT AFTER TAX
Profit After Tax (‘PAT’) declined by $61.1m 
in the year, mirroring the decrease in EBITDA 
of $63.3m. The increase in depreciation 
of $57.3m was offset by the decrease in 
net financing costs of $56.2m.
Adjusted PAT, which excludes the impact 
on the income statement of the convertible 
bonds and the restructuring charge of $16.1m, 
declined by $107.7m in 2017. This decline 
largely reflects the $43.4m reduction in 
EBITDA (before restructuring) and the $57.3m 
increase in deprecation with the remaining 
reduction due to the increase in the underlying 
net financing costs of $13.1m offset by the 
lower taxation charge.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, 
excluding post-tax restructuring costs, the  
post-tax impact of the early repurchase of 
the 2017 Convertible Bonds and the change 
in the fair value of the conversion liability 
component of the new 2023 Convertible Bonds 
were 42 and 41 cents respectively, compared 
with 65 and 64 cents respectively in 2016.
Basic and diluted earnings per share, 
including the elements outlined above, for 
profit attributable to the equity holders of 
the Company were 40 cents compared with 
54 cents and 53 cents respectively in 2016.
GROUP RESULTS
Group revenues increased in 2017 by $71.2m 
mainly driven by the growth in Aviation, 
as well as Government.
In 2017, direct costs increased by $61.4m, 
rising faster than revenues, in response to the 
changing revenue mix across the business, 
particularly as we sought to capture share in key 
markets, including the addition of installation 
revenues in Aviation (with related direct costs up 
$22.9m in the year), a higher level of equipment 
sales in Maritime and the continued ramp-up of 
the CSSC contract in Government. In addition, 
in Central Services, there were higher costs, 
mainly related to capacity leasing.
Indirect costs in the year grew by $53.2m, 
reflecting increased IFC capability in Aviation 
(an increase of $23.5m in 2017) and higher 
central operational delivery costs (an increase 
of $41.9m in 2017), but a reduction of $12.2m 
in indirect costs elsewhere in the business, 
reflecting tight cost control more generally.
In addition, a headcount reduction programme 
was implemented in Q4 2017 , with an associated 
one-off cost of $19.9m, to reduce our legacy 
costs, ensuring that we have the capacity to 
invest in new skills to support the future growth 
of the business. As a result of the above, Adjusted 
EBITDA in 2017, decreased by $43.4m from 
the prior year, and Adjusted EBITDA margin 
decreased to 53.7%, from 59.8% in 2016.
OPERATING PROFIT
As noted above, the one-off costs associated 
with the headcount reduction programme reduced 
operating profit in 2017. In addition, depreciation 
and amortisation for 2017 increased by $57.3m

Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Strategic Report | Chief Financial Officer’s review GROUP BALANCE SHEET
The table opposite shows the condensed 
consolidated Group Balance Sheet.
The increase in the Group’s non-current 
assets of $269.4m is largely due to our 
ongoing investment in new technology and 
infrastructure, including GX, the S-band 
programme and the I-6 constellation, less 
depreciation of existing assets in service.
The net decrease in current assets of 
$153.2m is due to a decrease in short-term 
deposits which have been used to fund 
additional capital investment in the business. 
The increase in current liabilities of $115.6m 
to $864.5m (2016: $748.9m) largely relates 
to an increase in trade and other payables 
of $76.3m to $584.5m (2016: $508.3m) 
which were impacted by the timing of the 
settlement of trade payables at the end of 
the year. The balance of the increase is due to 
the combination of a draw down in the Ex-Im 
Facilities of $78.4m, which increased current 
borrowings by $21.8m, and an increase in 
provisions of $14.3m relating to the headcount 
reduction programme implemented in the 
fourth quarter.
There has been a decrease in non-current liabilities 
of $14.4m to $2,839.7m (2016: $2,854.1m). 
This is primarily driven by a decrease in derivative 
financial instruments of $25.7m reflecting a 
reduction in the unrealised conversion liability 
on the convertible bonds and a decrease in 
other payables of $16.5m due to the settlement 
of a long-term creditor. These reductions are 
partially offset by an increase in deferred 
tax liabilities of $29.0m due to higher 
capital allowances.
CASH FLOW
During the year, free cash flow decreased by 
$233.3m, mainly due to lower cash generated 
from operations ($31.1m), higher capital 
expenditure ($185.8m) and higher cash interest 
paid ($32.2m) as a result of the refinancing in 
Q3 2016.
The change in working capital has improved by 
$26.8m, driven by the timing of supplier payments 
in Q4 but also by tighter management of inventory 
and more timely collection of receivables.
Cash tax paid decreased to $19.8m (2016: $35.6m) 
due to lower UK profits and a tax refund relating 
to an overpayment in 2016. Cash tax was $27.7m 
lower than tax charged in the income statement 
due mainly to the $9.8m impact of the revaluation 
of the Group’s U.S. deferred tax asset following 
the reduction in U.S. Federal tax rates.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
BASED ON CURRENT MANAGEMENT PLANS, 
INFRASTRUCTURE CAPEX IS EXPECTED 
TO MEANINGFULLY MODERATE AFTER 2020
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40 Strategic Report | Chief Financial Officer’s review CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The increase in capital expenditure on major 
infrastructure projects in 2017 relates to 
continued investment in the GX and I-6 satellite 
infrastructures. Success-based capex also 
increased in 2017 driven by the acceleration 
in the installation of GX terminals in Aviation 
and Fleet Xpress in Maritime. Other capex 
investment also increased during the year, 
driven by investment in ongoing infrastructure 
maintenance, IT and new product and 
service development.
FUTURE GUIDANCE
We are targeting mid-single digit percentage 
revenue growth (excluding Ligado) on average 
over the next five years, with EBITDA and free 
cash flow generation (both excluding Ligado) 
expected to improve steadily as a result of the 
combined impact of this growing revenue base, 
an improved revenue mix, tightly managed 
overhead costs and new, lower cost, satellite 
technologies being implemented that we expect 
to drive a meaningful moderation in our annual 
infrastructure capex over the medium-term.
Specific financial guidance for the future 
performance of the business is as follows:
 › Group revenue:
 – 2018 revenue, excluding Ligado, 
of $1,300m to $1,500m (unchanged)
 – Annual GX revenues at a run rate of 
$500m by the end of 2020 (unchanged)
 › Group capex:
 – Over 2018 to 2020, we expect that 
capital expenditure will be within a 
range of $500m to $600m per annum
 – Based on current management plans, 
infrastructure capex is expected to 
meaningfully moderate after 2020 
as we bring to bear our next generation 
network augmentation plans and become 
increasingly driven by IFC revenues

DIVIDEND
In the course of 2017, and in particular during 
the second half of 2017, two factors have 
become more important, specifically:
 › The lack of visibility over future cash payments 
from Ligado Networks beyond the end of 
2018; and
 › The increasingly clear opportunity that 
exists for Inmarsat in the fast-growing 
and substantial IFC segment in Aviation
Given these factors, and the Board’s requirement 
to ensure that the Group has sufficient financial 
resources to support delivery of a leading 
position in IFC through the current infrastructure 
investment period, the Board has taken a 
decision to reduce the annual dividend 
to 20 cents per share.
The annual dividend is expected to stay at these 
levels until the cash flow of the business rebuilds 
sufficiently to make an increase appropriate, 
having regard to the level of investment 
required to pursue attractive opportunities for 
sustained long-term profitable growth, to providing 
competitive returns to our shareholders and to 
the capital structure of the business. It should 
be noted in this context that the Group has a long, 
established track record of paying substantial 
dividends, having returned over $2.1bn to 
shareholders since our IPO in 2005.
The Board will propose to shareholders a 2017 
final dividend of 12.00 cents per share, based on 
the reduced annual level of dividend of 20 cents 
per share and Inmarsat’s historic allocation of 
60% of the full year dividend to the final dividend. 
Added to the interim dividend already paid of 
21.62 cents per share, the total dividends paid 
and proposed in respect of the year ended 
31 December 2017 will be 33.62 cents per share.
Inmarsat will continue to provide shareholders 
with the option of a scrip dividend alternative for 
dividend payments, and will review this approach 
on a regular basis. At the interim stage, the scrip 
option was taken up by shareholders holding 
a total of 63m shares (13.9% of the then issued 
share capital) with an issue value of $13.7m. 
These shares were issued on 20 October 2017. 
Inmarsat plc now has 457,659,212 shares in issue.
The dividend is to be paid on 25 May 2018 
to ordinary shareholders on the share register 
at the close of business on 20 April 2018. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve the 
final dividend payment at the Annual General 
Meeting on 2 May 2018. Dividend payments 
are made in Pounds Sterling or in shares using 
an exchange rate derived from the WMReuters 
GBP/USD 9am fix (London time) four business 
days prior to the date of announcement of the 
scrip reference price. The 2017 final dividend is 
not recorded as a liability in the financial 
statements at 31 December 2017.
IFRS 15 AND IFRS 16
Inmarsat will be adopting IFRS 15 and 16 for 
the financial year ending 31 December 2018.
The primary impact of IFRS 15 will be in Maritime 
and Aviation where revenue and costs related 
to equipment installation will now be spread over 
the length of the contract, rather than being 
recognised at the time of installation. This is 
expected to have a marginal negative impact on 
revenue, whilst capital expenditure and EBITDA 
are both expected to increase slightly, given that 
installation costs will be capitalised going forward.
IFRS 16, which Inmarsat is adopting a year 
early to avoid restatements impacting in two 
successive years, requires vehicles and properties 
to be accounted for as ‘right-of-use assets’. 
This is expected to have a small positive impact 
on EBITDA, due to lease costs being reclassified 
as depreciation and interest.
GROUP LIQUIDITY AND 
CAPITAL RESOURCES
At 31 December 2017, the Group had cash 
and cash equivalents of $144.9m and available 
but undrawn borrowing facilities of $500.5m 
under our Senior Credit Facility.

RESOURCES AND RELATIONSHIPS
Delivering a positive impact
of our key talent, which in turn has informed 
our succession planning and individual 
development plans.
More broadly we have focused on enhancing our 
people’s performance. Following a wide-ranging 
review of our current performance management 
process, and reviewing external best practice, 
we have redefined our performance management 
process and principles and have outlined a new 
‘Be Your Best’ approach that will be launched 
in early 2018. Alongside this, we have redefined 
our total reward philosophy approach for 
launch also in 2018.
The HR team has also continued its own 
transformation journey to delivering excellence 
for the organisation it serves. Core systems 
capability has been enhanced, we have 
rationalised our payroll process, launched 
a new ‘people portal’ and moved to a more 
direct model of resourcing saving $1.7m 
(April 17 to year end).
We also continued to build an effective 
organisation, and in the autumn we consulted 
on and implemented organisational changes 
that rebalanced the mix of skills and capabilities 
we have across the global organisation to 
ensure we have a firm platform for growth.
range of sustainability issues ranging from 
the importance of charitable giving to cyber 
security. The analysis of this has informed 
the content included within this report and we 
have utilised the Global Reporting Initiative 
(‘GRI’) framework to structure a number 
of our disclosures. Our GRI Content Index can 
be found on the CSR section of our website. 
We will continue to engage with our stakeholders 
on an ongoing basis.
OUR PEOPLE
Building a high-performance organisation 
continued to be at the heart of our activity in 
2017. The launch of a comprehensive People 
Strategy ensured sustained focus and progress 
on developing our people and our culture to 
ensure Inmarsat is an engaging and inspiring 
place to work, where everyone can be their best.
We believe that the key to sustained performance 
lies in the quality of our leaders and managers and 
this year we devoted much effort in developing 
leaders at all levels in the business, from the 
Executive Team to more junior managers. This 
involved the delivery and execution of a range of 
activities from tailored leadership development 
programmes, face-to-face and online training and 
development, the creation of a 2018 commercial 
curriculum for senior leaders, and a bespoke RADA 
programme for senior women. This leadership 
work was underpinned by the development of a 
comprehensive talent framework, created through 
the insights gained from a formal assessment 
programme that has supported the identification 
The Board believes corporate 
and social responsibility 
is an important part of the 
Group’s culture and the 
adoption of good practice 
will have a positive impact 
on the business
Ensuring we act in an ethical manner, taking 
account of our responsibilities – socially and 
environmentally – is important in the way we 
operate and interact with our stakeholders, 
including investors, employees, suppliers and 
business partners. This way of working contributes 
to how we create value for all our shareholders.
This section of our Annual Report is prepared in 
accordance with the Companies, Partnerships and 
Groups (Accounts and Non-Financial Reporting) 
Regulations 2016. Here we provide information 
of Inmarsat’s development, performance 
and position and the impact of our activity 
relating to environmental matters, employees, 
social matters, respect for human rights and 
anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. 
More information relating to these activities 
can be found on the CSR and investor relations 
sections of our website.
Inmarsat is committed to improving its 
transparency in these areas and, as a result, 
responded to the RobecoSAM Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment for the first time 
in 2017.
MATERIALITY
Inmarsat recognises that its non-financial 
information statement should reflect a fair 
view of the information required by stakeholders 
and therefore we have conducted a materiality 
assessment to ensure that we are reporting on 
material disclosures in a clear and balanced way.
As part of this materiality assessment, we have 
engaged with a number of external and internal 
stakeholders throughout 2017 including a 
number of employees, customers, suppliers 
and shareholders. A summary of the key 
focus areas for the output is shown above.
We held stakeholder interviews and sent 
out quantitative surveys to understand the 
level of stakeholder concern regarding a wide 
KEY STAKEHOLDER RESPONSES (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL)
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 42 Strategic Report | Resources and relationships CODE OF CONDUCT, ANTI-CORRUPTION 
AND ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORPORATE 
TAX EVASION
Our Code of Ethics requires Directors, 
officers, employees and contractors to 
conduct business with the highest standards 
of personal and professional integrity. A copy 
of our Code is published on our website.
We comply with local laws where we operate and, 
in 2017, we have received no fines or penalties 
associated with non-compliance to any law relating 
to the environment, human rights violations, 
labour standards, anti-corruption or tax.
Across our Group we ensure our employees 
comply with the UK Bribery Act and the U.S. 
Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act. A summary 
of our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy 
can be found on our website. As part of our 
commitment to preventing bribery and 
establishing a culture that does not tolerate 
corruption wherever and in whatever form it 
takes, we ask our Directors, employees and 
contractors to confirm annually that they 
understand the restrictions outlined in the 
policy and the implications for breaching 
the policy for the business and them 
as individuals. Our anti-bribery policy 
operates in line with current legislation. 
The policy also incorporates guidelines on 
dealing with gifts and accepting and giving 
hospitality. Our latest training module 
on this subject was issued to employees 
in February 2018.
We have separate policies in place dealing 
with ethics, fraud, the use of inside information 
and whistleblowing. These policies are fully 
endorsed and supported by the Board which 
has ultimate oversight.
We ask Directors, employees and contractors 
to confirm they understand these policies 
and how they are applied, once a year 
through the online training platform Nebula 
reaching our global employee base of 
around 2,000.
CULTURE AND VALUES 
2017 also saw us develop our employee value 
proposition framework and roadmap for launch 
in 2018, underpinned by insights gathered 
from global focus groups and our quarterly 2017 
People Pulse survey, which launched in January. 
These have provided rich feedback to understand 
what our people really value about working at 
Inmarsat, what motivates, inspires and engages 
them. In response to this insight and feedback 
we have continued to extend our employee 
offer with a number of initiatives such as a 
new approach to flexible working, building our 
communications and engagement capability and 
an expanded learning and development offer.
A key pillar of our transformation will be the 
company-wide culture change programme 
that we launched to our global senior leaders 
community in the autumn. This work will help 
to ensure that we all embrace behaviours and 
ways of working which support the delivery 
of excellent business performance and help us 
to become a high-performance organisation.
COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT
Two-way open communications are an 
important part of creating an engaging and 
inspiring culture. We continued to build our 
group internal communications capability 
this year, supporting a rich mix of activities 
that provided opportunities for our people 
to connect with our vision and strategy, 
brand and culture and to share their feedback.
More formally we maintained our engagement 
with elected employee forums in the UK and 
Batam in Indonesia, a Works Council in the 
Netherlands and an Enterprise Agreement in 
Perth, Australia. In 2017 meetings between 
the Executive Team and the UK Staff Forum 
were set quarterly, facilitating open and honest 
communications and two way engagement. 
Some of these meetings were also extended 
to include global representation.
In support of the organisational changes 
announced in the autumn and in accordance 
with legislation and their role as elected 
representative staff bodies, the UK Staff 
Forum and the Netherlands Works council 
were called upon to engage in a formal 
consultation process. We were very appreciative 
of their professionalism and willingness to 
take on an additional workload and work with 
management on this.
Télécoms Sans Frontières (‘TSF’)
In 2000, Inmarsat became the first official partner of Télécoms Sans Frontières (TSF), 
an organisation that responds to the critical need for reliable emergency telecommunications 
services following conflicts or natural disasters. Since then, Inmarsat and TSF have covered 
158 emergency deployments in 72 countries, delivering 1.3 million calls during more than 
10,500 days in the field. Assistance provided by TSF to 830 humanitarian organisations, 
governments and UN agencies has facilitated the aid brought to several million people 
across the globe. Inmarsat and TSF work together to ensure telecommunications support 
is established as soon as possible in an emergency, as well as providing training in areas 
frequently affected to ensure that in the long-term locals can use the equipment if 
another crisis strikes.

Gender pay
We are committed to being a diverse and 
inclusive organisation where everyone can 
thrive. We encourage diversity, we need it 
to manage complexity and to deliver new 
levels of innovation and creativity demanded 
by the digital world. We are fully supportive 
of the drive to be more open and transparent 
about gender pay, and the focus this brings 
on driving improvements.
At April 2017 , we had 756 employees in the UK, 
69% of whom are men and 31% are women, 
compared to 75% male employees in a typical 
high-tech company*. Our analysis shows that 
overall the gap between men and women’s 
earnings is 24.5% (mean) or 24.4% (median) 
based on hourly rates of pay at the snapshot 
date of 5 April 2017. Like many other technology 
companies our gap reflects our challenge 
to attract men and women in equal numbers. 
In fact, our analysis shows that if we had 
equal numbers of men and women at each 
organisational level, the gap would be reduced 
to 8.5%. This 8.5% differential itself is a 
reflection of the types of roles men and women 
are doing within Inmarsat – we typically have 
more men than women in disciplines such 
as engineering and business development, 
which tend to be higher paid in the market 
than functional roles where we tend to have 
more women. In encouraging our women 
in the workplace we equally look to offer the 
same opportunities to all employees.
Whilst there may be understandable reasons 
for the gap, we are keen to rectify the balance as 
part of our new diversity and inclusion strategy. 
The strategy has been developed to create an 
environment that supports women to thrive 
through flexible working practices to enhance 
their development and progression through 
mentoring and to help accelerate their careers 
DIVERSITY
In this age of digital evolution we require new 
levels of innovation and creativity, which we 
believe are greatly enhanced by diversity of 
all forms and we are very proud that we have 65 
different nationalities within the Inmarsat Group.
In addition, our core purpose as an organisation 
is to enable the connected world, and in delivering 
our purpose we provide connectivity to an 
increasingly international and diverse customer 
base. In doing so we want to make sure that 
we reflect the society we serve. Not only is this the 
right thing to do, we also believe that doing it well 
will support the building of long-term relationships 
which in turn drive long-term business success.
Creating a great work place with an inclusive 
and diverse culture also helps to attract and 
recruit the best people, and engage and 
motivate our current employees.
To support our vision, we have developed 
a three-year Diversity and Inclusion plan with 
actions at multiple stages of the employee 
life cycle from attraction to recruitment to 
development, and there are a number of initiatives 
focused on ‘life at Inmarsat’ – creating and 
maintaining an engaging and inspiring place to 
work. Recent activities include: STEM Outreach 
initiatives, attracting female graduates via 
partnership with TARGETJobs, focused recruitment 
for experienced hires, mentoring, identifying high 
potentials and accelerating careers, targeted 
development programmes, introducing family 
friendly policies including flexible working, 
designing a new performance management 
approach with calibration to avoid unconscious 
bias, promoting external and internal role 
models, creating International Women’s Day 
awareness and celebrations and hosting the 
International Women’s Network.
When recruiting, we value diversity in its 
broadest definition and work to provide 
opportunities for all, including for disabled 
employees by reviewing the requirements of 
their working environment to accommodate 
practical changes as far as possible to allow 
them to continue in their daily work routine. 
If such changes were unrealistic to implement, 
we would review alternative employment 
options for the individual within the Group.
We do not tolerate discrimination in any  
form – race, gender, age, culture, nationality 
and disability – against our employees, 
either from other employees or third parties.
The gender split across the Group (excluding 
contingency workers) as at 31 December 2017 
is illustrated in the following table.
We have a worldwide anonymous telephone 
service for employees to use if they have 
any concerns. No calls were received by 
the external provider in 2017.
In addition, our internal audit team complete 
regular anti-corruption and anti-bribery risk 
assessments as part of the ongoing internal 
audit programme. All third parties that are 
in contact with Inmarsat during the course of 
any business matter, are also assessed for risks 
related to corruption through visual compliance 
and due diligence checks. We have detailed 
clauses in our contracts with agents, suppliers 
and partners regarding the need to adhere 
to anti-bribery requirements.
Internal Audit has its annual plan in 
conducting reviews of business operations, 
financial and internal controls, IT and cyber 
security, and legal and regulatory compliance. 
Through these reviews Internal Audit assessed 
the key risks, including risks related to bribery 
and corruption, and mitigation activities 
undertaken by management, and reported 
its findings to the Audit Committee. In 2017 
Internal Audit had not identified, or reported, 
or been aware of any incidences of corruption. 
Moreover no legal cases relating to corruption 
have been brought against Inmarsat or 
its employees during the reporting period. 
Moreover, no employees have been dismissed 
or disciplined for corruptions and no business 
partners have had their contracts terminated 
or not renewed due to violations related to 
corruption in the reporting period.
The Company has invested significant time 
and resources, working closely with an expert 
external organisation, to review its processes 
to ensure compliance with the recent new 
legislation regarding corporate tax evasion, 
combining the review with an updated 
assessment of its anti-bribery and corruption 
processes. The work has highlighted where 
improvements can be made to existing 
business processes and practices.
HUMAN RIGHTS
We are committed to respecting the human 
rights of employees, customers, suppliers, 
business partners and the wider communities 
in which we operate.
Inmarsat has had no incidents of 
non-compliances with labour standards or 
of human rights violations (including those 
relating to child labour or forced labour) 
within the reporting period.

RESOURCES AND RELATIONSHIPS
CONTINUED
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 44 Strategic Report | Resources and relationships We were delighted to launch the Learning Hub, 
our brand new platform for learning to provide 
global access to online training and learning 
interventions. Through the Learning Hub, our 
people can find resources to enhance a wide 
variety of skills: from presenting and public 
speaking to communication; managing 
performance to leading change; project 
management and much more.
We also see value in personalised learning, 
and so in addition to our corporate initiatives 
each business area carries its own budget for 
role-specific training and we provide support 
in the form of education sponsorship.
Two of Inmarsat’s key principles are diversity and 
inclusion, and these are reflected in our attitude 
to learning and development. We encourage 
our people to find opportunities for growth in 
a range of resources and encourage people to 
think beyond the classroom. And when we are 
developing new learning programmes, those 
principles help to ensure growth opportunities 
reach all of our people, no matter where in the 
world they are located.
We monitor the cost efficiency of programmes 
to implement training and therefore monitor 
the business benefits of our training and 
employee development programmes.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Inmarsat plc Board receives an annual 
update on health and safety activity across 
the Group. Rupert Pearce, CEO, has been 
identified as having responsibility for health 
and safety issues within the Group and one 
of his 2018 objectives relates to ensuring 
there are appropriate health and safety 
measures in operation across the Group. 
We have a dedicated Health and Safety 
Manager who is located in our London 
headquarters and our subsidiary operations 
have identified managers responsible for 
health and safety.
Our goal is to encourage strong leadership 
in championing the importance of and 
a common-sense approach to health and 
safety in the workplace. We recognise the 
need to provide a safe working environment 
for our employees, contractors and  
any visitors.
During the year we introduced a global 
policy on Electromagnetic Fields (‘EMF’) 
and there is active EMF monitoring 
across the Group.
We had 27 (2016: 18) accidents or near misses 
reported, and again we had no fatalities.
through high-potential programmes. It also 
includes our active involvement and commitment 
to STEM education programmes, the Digital 
Gender Divide and the UN Equals group.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY
In January 2017 we launched a global quarterly 
employee engagement survey that provides 
our Executive Team and line managers with 
information and insight about how positive 
our people are across a range of engagement 
drivers. The survey is a dynamic and interactive 
tool enabling managers to monitor engagement 
and feedback from their teams and respond to 
anonymised comments. The average response 
rate was 82% over the course of the last three 
surveys and we have received thousands of 
comments, showing how engaged our employees 
have been with the survey. These comments 
have complemented quantitative data 
with more qualitative commentary. Group 
engagement score was 7.4/10.
LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT
Having built strong foundations in the preceding 
few years, 2017 saw increased investment 
in learning and development initiatives across 
our global population. We also believe that our 
leaders and managers are key to the engagement, 
retention and development of our people, 
so leadership development continued to be a 
central focus. In addition to our existing leadership 
programmes we developed and rolled out 
‘The Practical Manager’ – a new programme for 
managers to enhance their understanding of the 
philosophies, principles and policies for managing 
people at work, and launched ‘Great Connections’, 
a programme to improve the frequency and 
quality of career and performance development 
conversations between managers and the 
people in their teams. In addition, considerable 
focus was given to our Executive Team and 
Extended Leadership Team (‘ELT’) via a series 
of development events designed to develop 
highly skilled and cohesive senior leadership.
Inmarsat is an exciting, complex and evolving 
place to work, and so we value sharing knowledge 
and insights across the business to communicate, 
to educate, and to engage. We ran a series 
of Tech Talks to share compelling stories from 
our Chief Technology Office and continued 
to offer comprehensive training on Inmarsat’s 
products and services for our staff as well as 
for our customers and end-users and also used 
the opportunity of these talks to raise other key 
changes in the business such as the new Global 
Data Protection Regulations. We also continued 
to run our Global Induction programme to 
educate and welcome our new joiners.
STEM – City and Islington College
Twenty five students successfully completed the annual Inmarsat Strategy Challenge, 
which aims to bridge the experience gap for high performing STEM students, through tackling 
complex, real world problems that the space sector is supporting. The students from City and 
Islington College’s Sixth Form College and Centre for Applied Sciences were set the challenge 
of how to effectively respond to natural disasters using satellite communications.

The roll-out of our Streamline Programme 
for customers is well underway. The Streamline 
Programme encompasses updated terms 
and conditions and agreements for our 
partners which can be accessed through 
a partner portal which contains service and 
product information as well. Many of our 
key customers have transitioned to this new 
way of working. Additionally, all new customers 
are using the Streamline Programme as 
standard. This roll-out will continue into 2018.
The Global Procurement team has been 
working to understand its suppliers much 
better during the year. This has led us to 
undertake a rationalisation of our supply-base 
and we will continue to do this by appointing 
preferred and approved vendors, with whom 
we have standard terms in place.
As part of our ongoing programme of supplier 
due diligence we worked with a third party agency 
who undertook a review of our entire supply 
base to undertake a risk review including credit, 
compliance and other business risk areas. 
We will use this analysis further in identifying 
and mitigating risk in our supply chain and 
the supply chains of our suppliers.
The simplification of our Procure to Pay 
function was further supported by a number 
of enhancements to our core finance system. 
One element of this was the creation of 
a Procurement Portal which enables a new 
way to buy across the Company, ensuring 
we guide employees to the preferred and 
approved suppliers we want them to use. 
This, in conjunction with, the further roll-out 
of Purchasing Cards allows the business to 
acquire the goods and services they need 
using the most cost-effective methods.
A number of corporate deals have been put in 
place during 2017 including the contract for 
a Group-wide travel management company.
In 2017, we published our Modern Slavery 
Policy which can be accessed on our website. 
We are also finalising our supplier code of

OUR SATELLITE AND 
GROUND NETWORKS
As part of our business of operating a global 
satellite network, we operate a number of 
ground earth stations, VSAT and telemetry 
and tracking facilities where there are satellite 
dishes which generate radiation. Access to 
these sites is restricted and there are regular 
health and safety checks to ensure that they 
are in protected areas away from access 
by the general public. Personnel who work at 
these sites are provided with relevant training 
as to health and safety issues.
SPACE DEBRIS
As a satellite operator, we have adopted the 
highest industry standards in terms of space 
debris mitigation, including end-of-life 
graveyard manoeuvre plans for the disposal 
of satellites when they reach the end of their 
commercial life. We operate our satellites in 
geosynchronous orbit which is approximately 
36,000km (22,500 miles) above the Earth. 
This orbit has significantly less debris than 
at low earth orbit which is approximately 
700km above the Earth and where several 
MSS operators have their satellite constellations. 
We are also a founding member of the Space 
Data Association (‘SDA’). Along with Intelsat, 
SES and Eutelsat we aim to improve the 
satellite safety of flight and make operations 
in space safer and more reliable.
OUR TECHNOLOGY
We have identified technology as one of the 
key resources supporting our business model. 
While investment in innovation is clearly 
important, having talented and experienced 
teams who understand how technology and 
innovation can work together is essential. 
Our teams monitor what happens in the 
macro environment and see how this affects 
future innovation so we produce services 
our customers want to use.
OUR PARTNERS
Our partners are critical to our business success. 
Our definition of partners encompasses all 
those we work with – manufacturers, suppliers, 
distributors, service providers and end-users. 
We rely on their excellence to support the 
achievement of our business objectives 
and strengthen our service offering.
During the year we undertook the 
following activities:
 › A global gap analysis was carried out to 
compare current conditions and practices 
in order to identify gaps and areas in 
need of improvement. Opportunities for 
improvement have already begun and will 
continue as part of our 2018 framework
 › We reviewed our fire strategy at HQ with a view 
to continue this approach into 2018 for all sites
 › We introduced training for shift workers
 › Risk assessments continue to be a key 
focus of our business for different activities 
and legislative requirements
 › Mental health first aid training and 
awareness was once again arranged and 
was well received across our global offices
 › The annual Wellbeing Week, with a focus 
on maintaining a healthy eating lifestyle 
for employees, was again supported by 
offices in all our key hubs
 › We continued to drive improvements 
in operating in a safe operating culture
 › We embedded processes in our corporate 
systems for capturing staff, contractors or 
interns globally who may have a disability 
or mobility impairment to be compliant 
with the Disability Discrimination Act
We continue to monitor the following health 
and safety priorities based on business 
activities and the potential harm to staff:
 › Musculoskeletal disorders and DSE 
(display screen equipment) related  
ill health
 › Working at height
 › Manual handling
 › Lone working
Specific training and awareness materials 
are provided to staff who are affected by 
these identified areas of work.
We introduced an on-line tool for staff to log 
incidents. This will allow us to capture data to 
monitor trends and implement corrective 
action where necessary. This is particularly 
useful for our field engineers and those 
working in shipyards for installations.
In 2017, we participated in several UK local 
government-led meetings with emergency

RESPONSIBILITY
Our website provides considerable information 
about how we connect with organisations, 
individuals and our different partners to extend 
the reach of our services to support those who 
may need assistance either for humanitarian 
needs or charitable endeavours. You can find 
out more online at inmarsat.com and review 
case studies and updates in our CSR section.
Our maritime heritage is a key reminder to 
us of how we have supported mariners and 
the wider maritime community for 39 years 
and remain focused on doing so in the future. 
We remain the only approved provider of 
satellite communications services for the 
Global Maritime Distress and Safety System 
(‘GMDSS’) and we continue to invest in the 
development of maritime safety services. 
This year, we launched SafetyNET II, an 
enhancement to the Inmarsat C SafetyNET 
system, providing shoreside authorities a 
secure web-based interface with an interactive 
platform to give greater control and flexibility 
of their safety broadcasts. Our Inmarsat C 
SafetyNET service continues to be used to 
provide vital updates on reported pirate activity. 
The service enables ship masters to access 
reports of pirate movements, giving them 
information to know which regions to avoid 
with high pirate activity and allowing them 
to re-route if necessary. SafetyNET also 
broadcasts navigational and meteorological 
warnings and alerts to aid mariners in safety 
of navigation.
The 2017-18 Volvo Ocean Race, of which 
Inmarsat is the official satellite communications 
provider, relies on Inmarsat safety services 
for the crews to maintain communication at 
all times, wherever they are. This year we piloted 
a new web-based system for Rescue Coordination 
Centres (‘RCCs’) which was used by Volvo 
Ocean Race control and RCCs to coordinate 
rescue operations if needed. FleetBroadband, 
Inmarsat C and our handheld phone are all 
standard equipment for each of the yachts. 
Our IsatPhone handheld service was used in the 
last Race to provide emergency communications 
when one of the ships ran aground, with 
the yacht captain praising it for saving the 
crew’s lives.
In addition to maritime safety services, we 
also promote safety services to the aviation 
industry for use in the cockpit. We remain 
committed to the provision of International 
Civil Aviation Organisation (‘ICAO’) approved 
satellite safety services, and are expanding

and rolled-out on aircraft during 2017.
In 2017, we continued to support the 
telecommunications relief aid organisation, 
Télécoms Sans Frontières (‘TSF’). We paid 
a $240,000 cash donation and $100,000 
in free airtime. We also paid $115,000 to 
the World Maritime University as part of our 
support for the education of maritime specialists. 
These two payments are our most significant 
charitable payments. The total charitable 
donations amount paid in 2017 was 
approximately $420,000. This amount 
excludes the free airtime and terminals 
we offer to multiple charities as we support 
their endeavours throughout the year.
Our core charitable support remains on the 
work carried out by TSF. TSF runs programmes 
on disaster relief and preparedness, training 
other relief organisations and regional and 
national disaster response agencies about 
the available capabilities for emergency 
telecommunications. We have also 
continued our support for the International 
Telecommunications Union (‘ITU’). In 2017, 
we started to provide support for Team Rubicon 
UK which unites the skills and experiences 
of military veterans with first responders to 
rapidly deploy emergency response teams 
worldwide. 35 individuals from across the 
Inmarsat business were trained as Greyshirts, 
which means they have completed training 
courses to be able to support the charity. We 
supported T eam Rubicon deployments in Nepal, 
Sri Lanka, Australia, U.S., UK and the Caribbean 
by providing resources and communications 
equipment and airtime, Our staff were encouraged 
to get involved during Company time and we 
launched our volunteering policy to our global 
workforce in February 2018.
Our CEO, Rupert Pearce serves as Commissioner 
to the Broadband Commission for Digital 
Development. It was set up by the ITU and UNESCO 
with the aim of boosting the importance of 
broadband on the international policy agenda 
and expanding broadband access to accelerate 
progress towards national and international 
development targets, as proposed by the UN. 
He is also a member of the Broadband 
Commission’s Working Groups on Digital 
Entrepreneurship, Vulnerable Countries 
and Digital Health Working Group.
Volvo Ocean Race
Inmarsat is delighted to provide onboard connectivity to the Volvo Ocean Race for the 
fifth consecutive time. Once again, we provide support for the sailors in terms of safety, 
communications and advanced broadcasting. The partnership with Volvo Ocean Race 
allows Inmarsat to showcase our cutting edge, reliable technology that connects 
sailors to the rest of the world, even from the most isolated locations.

As part of some UK Space Association funded 
projects, we are working with the University 
of Leeds on an eHealth project in Nigeria, 
and work with a number of universities and 
research centres on some of our future 
satellite development projects.
Now into its fifth year, this year’s award-winning 
Inmarsat Summer Strategy Challenge concluded 
well. We work with a London exemplar STEM 
focused college to make opportunities available 
to a number of their talented students to complete 
a challenging programme, addressing critical 
real world issues, such as the digital divide 
in Africa, the future of aero safety and forest 
governance in south east Asia. We are seeking 
to pioneer a new model of industry-college 
engagement. Increasingly, experience that 
goes beyond the norm is essential in the route 
to work and Inmarsat’s programme is targeted 
to support deserving students. Additionally, 
the programme with the London-based school 
forms part of Inmarsat’s promotion of STEM 
education to encourage young people to be 
inspired by space-enabled communications 
and to follow careers in the satellite world.
In 2017 we expanded our entry routes into 
Inmarsat for those at the start or early stages 
of their career. In 2018 we will see the start of 
a renewed graduate programme that consists 
of three work streams: engineering, corporate 
and functions, and business development. 
Internships and work experience opportunities 
are improved and have increased and are fully 
transparent for applicants of all backgrounds. 
We are also supporting the UK Government’s 
intent to increase apprenticeships and skills 
provision and we will have our first entry 
of apprentices in 2018.
Recruitment processes for these are managed 
to encourage and support a diverse applicant 
and entry pool.
Utilising TARGETJobs for graduate hiring 
we are partnering with them and other 
engineering employers on their Future Female 
Engineer days to bring more women into the 
sector. More specifically they are supporting 
us in our desire to hire more female graduates 
and we have specified a certain percentage 
of female applicants for consideration. 
Our Universal Service Obligations seek 
to support the use of our services, normally 
payphones, in rural villages in remote regions 
of the world, where terrestrial voice services 
are poor or non-existent.
Our global offices support local causes 
at a corporate and employee level and 
we encourage staff to get involved in local 
community initiatives. Employees across our 
offices are encouraged to support individual 
charities of their choice, and for employees 
in our principal UK office, this is encouraged 
through the UK Government’s tax approved 
contributions scheme.
In 2017, we implemented three major 
international development programmes, 
each of which is supported by the UK Space 
Agency’s International Partnership Programme 
(‘IPP’). The IPP is a fund that supports 
international development objectives aligned to 
the Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDG’) – it 
uses the unique advantages of space based 
systems to provide service and data to 
disadvantaged populations. All of the projects 
must meet defined SDG ambitions and 
demonstrate that the project is the most 
effective way of meeting the international 
development objective.

RESOURCES AND RELATIONSHIPS
CONTINUED
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 48 Strategic Report | Resources and relationships This decrease in emissions is a result of our switch 
to a renewable electricity supply at our London 
headquarters, our largest electricity-consuming 
site, and a number of energy-saving initiatives 
rolled out across the Group.
All new office builds, such as in St Johns (Canada) 
and Batam (Indonesia), are designed with energy 
efficiency in mind. We continue to improve 
operations to ensure they are fine tuned to 
occupational usage, including the efficient 
running of servers at our data centres. Across 
the group LED lighting has been installed where 
appropriate. Video conferencing and other 
collaboration tools allowing visual connectivity 
are being used to reduce the dependency 
on air transport and are a popular means of 
communication with staff working in different 
locations and across different time zones.
At our headquarters in London we are currently 
undertaking a refurbishment that will help 
reduce energy consumption at site. We are in 
the process of replacing the energy-intensive 
chillers on-site with new environmentally 
friendly machines which produce less carbon 
emissions per unit of gas input and operate 
20% more efficiently.
COMMERCIAL WASTE
In the London office and at our major sites, 
we continue a progressive approach to waste 
management. Recycling is managed locally 
in the larger sites with the separation of plastics, 
paper and non-recyclable materials. In the 
head office in London, which is the single 
largest office for the Group, 100% of waste is 
diverted from landfill and this policy has been 
in place since 2009. We separate our waste 
into four streams: recyclable, non-recyclable, 
glass and confidential waste. Confidential 
waste is shredded and pulped to be reused in 
paper products. In 2017 our total waste from 
the London head office increased 72%. This 
increase is something we are addressing and 
working with our London office caterers to 
reduce our impact on the environment and, 
for example, cooking oils are now collected 
and converted to sustainable biofuels.

We continue to monitor our energy consumption 
and comply with our social and legal responsibilities 
in terms of carbon emissions. Please see our 
summary of carbon emissions within the Report 
of the Directors on page 100.
In 2017 we set an interim target to reduce 
absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 10% 
compared to 2016. We have over-achieved 
this target with our absolute Scope 1 and 2 
emissions having decreased by 17% since 2016, 
and 35% since 2015 (using the market-based 
Scope 2 accountancy method).
We are proud to be sponsoring the Best 
Diversity Strategy Award at the TARGETjobs

ENVIRONMENT
In 2017 Inmarsat achieved a CDP (formerly 
known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) 
score of B, maintaining our performance from 
2016 and demonstrating that we are managing 
our environmental impact, as well as climate 
change related business risks and opportunities.
Although the direct activities of the Group 
are judged to have a low environmental impact, 
we understand that unless urgent action is 
taken to limit global temperatures to 2C (35.6F) 
above pre-industrial levels, climate change 
presents significant and systemic risks. Within 
our annual CDP response we provide details 
on Inmarsat’s substantive regulatory, physical 
and reputational risks and opportunities relating 
to climate change. For example, rising sea levels 
as a result of climate change could impact 
our satellite access stations and/or land earth 
stations which are located at strategic points 
around the world and act as traffic gateways 
connecting customers using the Inmarsat 
satellites to terrestrial networks. To manage 
this risk, we have established site selection due 
diligence processes which incorporate climatic 
geographical considerations.
Looking beyond our direct climate impact, 
it is important to note that our stakeholders 
identified that working with suppliers to 
reduce emissions in our supply chain should 
be a priority for Inmarsat. As a result, we are 
currently working with our sustainability partner,

CENTRAL RISK COMMITTEE
RISK MANAGEMENT
Focus on mitigation
The policy sets out the Group’s risk appetite as well 
as roles and responsibilities. The Board believes 
that the behaviour of individuals across the 
business is key to under-pinning an effective risk 
management culture. Across the Group, use of 
the Inmarsat Values helps promote the right set 
of values to support effective risk management.
As required by the policy, management operates 
a risk management process to identify, assess, 
mitigate and report significant risks within the 
business and to report to the Board on how 
those risks are being managed. Risks are initially 
identified and reviewed in each business unit 
and area, then on a quarterly basis risk reports 
are formally reviewed by senior management 
on a central Risk Committee representing each 
component part of the business. These risks 
are assessed and consolidated in a systematic 
way to identify the Group’s principal risks. 
The Group’s principal risks are further discussed 
and reviewed by the Executive team, and 
each quarter, the resulting Group risk report 
is discussed by the Audit Committee and the 
Board, who has overall responsibility for the risk 
management framework.
Starting in 2016, risk workshops were held across 
the Group following the new risk assessment and 
mitigation process, and concluded by the end 
of September 2017. The individual risk reports 
are assessed by the Central Risk Committee 
and consolidated into a Group risk report. 
The report includes a much more robust 
description of the Group’s risk profile with 
targeted mitigation actions to reduce the risks. 
Due to the risk assessments focusing more 
on strategic objectives, the new process 
contributes to the achievement of strategic 
goals. Both these objectives based risk 
workshops and risk workshops on information 
assets, using the same process, are important 
components of Inmarsat’s project to obtain 
ISO 27001 certification.
The Board regularly and as part of the financial 
year end process, reviews the Group’s principal 
risks and the actions being taken to mitigate 
those risks. As part of the long range business 
plan and risk management processes particularly, 
the Board determines the level of risk carried 
and the extent of mitigating activity required 
to deliver an acceptable level of risk. The Board 
defines the risk governance framework and 
sets the overall risk strategy and the Audit 
Committee reviews the risk management 
framework and the effectiveness of internal 
controls particularly with regard to financial 
Effective risk management 
is fundamental to our 
ability to meet both our 
short-term and longer- 
term strategic objectives
RISK FRAMEWORK
Risk comes hand-in-hand with business 
opportunity. Risk is not something that should be 
driven out of the business but rather something 
to be identified, intelligently assessed and 
managed. The aim is not to eliminate all risks, 
but to foster a culture supportive of effective 
risk management by encouraging appropriate 
risk taking in order to achieve the Company’s 
objectives. The Group’s approach to risk 
is brought together in an overarching risk 
management policy. This policy together with 
the risk assessment and mitigation process, 
have been implemented in order to evolve 
risk management into more focus on strategic 
and business objectives, focus on mitigation 
of the largest risks, and to comply with ISO 27001 
in support of this ongoing cyber security project. 
RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 50 Strategic Report | Risk management of doing business. We manage the risks based 
on a balance of risk and reward determined 
through careful assessment of both the potential 
probability and impact as well as risk appetite. 
Risk appetite is considered as part of the 
compilation of business cases, annual business 
plan and budget and long range business plan. 
There will be a balance of risk and opportunity 
considered as we take our investment decisions. 
We consider reputational as well as financial 
impact, recognising the value attributable to 
our brand. The Group faces a number of ongoing 
operational risks including damage to satellites 
and ground network operations, financial 
planning, potential compliance issues, litigation, 
credit and foreign exchange risk and the risks 
associated with dealing with tax authorities 
in multiple jurisdictions. The importance of 
these risks will vary over time and is kept under 
constant review. Although many of the risks 
influencing our performance are macroeconomic 
and likely to affect the performance of businesses 
generally, others are particular to our operations 
in mobile satellite services.
In accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board has 
taken into consideration the principal risks in 
the context of determining whether to adopt 
the going concern basis of accounting and 
when assessing the prospects of the Group for 
the purpose of preparing the Viability Statement 
which can be found on page 55. The Going 
Concern statement is provided on page 99 
in the Directors’ Report.
Our principal risks are discussed on the next few 
pages and are as summarised in the Preliminary 
Results Statement distributed on 9 March 2018. 
These have been subject to robust assessment 
and review. This summary, however, is not intended 
to be an exhaustive analysis of all risks and 
uncertainties affecting our business and are 
not listed in any order of priority.
In identifying the principal risks set out 
below we have disclosed those risks that we 
currently consider to be the most significant 
to the Group at the date of this Annual Report. 
The risk trend for each principal risk at the 
date of this Annual Report has been assessed 
as either stable, increasing or reducing in size, 
measured in both net impact and net probability 
and compared to a year ago. The principal 
risks are identified below and we have 
indicated against each risk how it principally 
relates to our strategy, noting that all risks 
will impact the strategy to some extent.
controls. This includes reviewing the internal 
audit programme and related reports to 
ensure that all key mitigating controls are 
being periodically reviewed and where issues 
are identified that they are being addressed 
on a timely basis. Assurance on broader risk 
controls is provided by a combination of internal 
management information, internal audits, 
external audits and Board oversight. There is also 
an externally supported whistleblowing facility.
The management of risk is embedded in our 
everyday business activities and culture, with all our 
employees and contractors having an important 
role to play. The diligence applied by our workforce 
to consider risk is reflected in business cases 
which are submitted for approval and ongoing 
projects have risks reported on a regular basis.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
The Group faces a number of risks that may 
adversely affect our strategic and business 
objectives, operations, liquidity, financial 
position, reputation or future performance, 
not all of which are wholly within our control 
or known to us. Some such risks may currently 
be regarded as immaterial and could turn out 
to be material. We accept risk is an inherent part

testing of the GX5 and Inmarsat-6 satellites.
 › We build in a high degree of redundancy in our satellite 
constellations and ground network. We have 24-hour 
monitoring of our satellites and network by sophisticated 
monitoring systems and knowledgeable staff who ensure 
any necessary action is taken promptly.
 › We buy insurance to compensate for the financial loss 
in the event a satellite or ground network element is 
damaged or lost.
 › We have disaster recovery plans for satellite and network 
operations which are regularly tested to ensure contingency 
plans work.
 › We are focused on ensuring our systems operate with a 
high degree of cyber security protection which is covered 
below in a separate risk.
7. Failure 
of critical 
customers and/
or distribution 
channel
Link to strategy:

 › We rely on our distribution channel for part of our 
revenue and they might not sell our services effectively 
or competitively. We have critical GX and FX contracts 
which require careful management to ensure successful 
execution. We may not meet customer needs with 
some declining legacy products.
 › Relying on some critical customers may increase our 
financial exposure if they fail to make payments for 
our services.
 › We provide our services to many government organisations 
around the world which may have conflicting requirements, 
and our revenue may be affected by governments’ 
reduction in spending and their other political priorities. 
We may lose customers due to poor quality service 
delivery or operations, or fail to keep up with the business 
needs of our customers. We may fail to roll-out new 
services including migrating existing customers. 
A competitor may buy a critical customer or partner.
 › We may encounter delays in bringing new products and 
services to market. Our inability to directly control our 
retail company or business specialising in U.S. Government 
contracts, may restrict our business activities.
 › We build strong relationships with all our partners, 
including through the Inmarsat World conference where 
we bring together partners and developers. We provide 
the partners with excellent services to sell in their markets. 
We encourage sharing of information and developing ideas 
through direct meetings with our partners and through 
our regional and global conferences. We have an effective 
credit management process in place, assessing the credit 
risk of new and existing customers.
 › We continue to improve the reliability of our satellites 
and services which are critical to our end-users. We have 
simplified our standard contracts and pricing in order to 
make it easier to do business with us. We promote fair play 
in our distribution channel and will not promote customer 
churn. We introduce new services with common 
technologies and develop more competitive pricing 
strategies. We continue to broaden our customer base 
through sales strategies and new service offerings.
 › Inmarsat Government operates with a proxy board to allow 
it to manage its business in accordance with U.S. requirements 
and compete effectively for U.S. Government business.
8. Security risk
Link to strategy:

 › We may suffer damage to satellites, networks, 
information/data, systems, processes and our services 
to customers as a result of malicious or flawed code, 
unauthorised access, service denial, ransom/coercion, 
or security compromise. There is also a significant risk 
of aggregated minor risks having an impact on service 
delivery. Data or IP could be stolen. This could also 
have consequential impact on reputation, business 
plans and operations and future revenue from risk 
averse customers/markets.
 › The risk has increased during 2017 due to the 
continuously increasing external threat. We have 
made considerable progress and continue to invest 
to further reduce the constantly evolving risks.
 › We maintain industry-standard security measures, and 
have increased our investment in state-of-the-art cyber 
countermeasures and enhanced cyber security operations 
to improve detection and response to incidences. We are 
progressing with a project to obtain ISO 27001 certification. 
We have completed risk assessments on information assets 
across the Group, and as a consequence, we are deploying 
appropriate controls.
 › Through our One IT project we are building a modern computer 
infrastructure that enhances protection of critical assets 
and data. We are improving our processes to be compliant 
with the GDPR legislation.
 › We have improved our incident response capability. 
We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans 
for important elements of our networks; contingency 
plans are tested regularly.

9. Spectrum, 
orbital slots 
and market 
access risk
Link to strategy:
 1
 2
 5
 › We rely on radio spectrum, which has historically been 
allocated without charge, to provide our services. We must 
agree how it is used in coordination with other satellite 
operators and need to coordinate its ongoing availability. 
We may not be able to coordinate usage in the future  
and/or may be charged for the spectrum which could 
affect our ability to provide services. Channel 
consolidation may drive down prices and ARPU.
 › We require orbital slots to place our satellites in the 
correct position to provide adequate coverage and 
deliver our services. We may not be able to obtain 
adequate orbital slots or we may miss deadlines to 
bring orbital slots into use.
 ›
Given the nature of the satellite business it is important 
to have access to all areas of the globe and provide 
coverage world-wide. This requires licensing from 
multiple national authorities. We may not be able to 
gain these licences for various reasons. Market access 
may not be allowed in certain countries which restricts 
our services being offered.
 › We regularly improve the efficiency of our spectrum 
usage through innovation and system enhancement. 
We also educate and inform regulators and governments 
as to the unique socio-economic contribution of our 
mobile satellite services. We work with organisations such 
as the ITU, and participate in conferences such as the 
World Radio Conference to brief them on the ongoing 
need for our frequency allocations.
 › We negotiate with other companies on orbital slots and 
the ability to achieve better spectrum usage and allocation. 
We monitor spectrum usage and assess whether there 
are benefits to our partners, customers and ourselves 
to migrate higher volume users to GX services.
 ›
We obtain in-country market access for our distribution 
channel as far as possible and make any licensing 
requirements as straightforward as possible for  
our partners.
10. Failure 
of critical 
suppliers
Link to strategy:
 1
 2
 3
 5
 › We rely on a limited number of third party suppliers 
and partners in the production of our satellites, launch 
providers’ systems, terminals and products and we may 
have limited control over availability, quality and delivery 
of these goods. A satellite manufacturer or a supplier 
to the satellite manufacturer, may fail or have serious 
damage to a production facility that delays the delivery 
of our satellite. A satellite launch provider may additionally 
have a launch failure which affects the timing of our 
planned launches. A competitor may buy a critical 
supplier or partner. A critical supplier may fail financially 
or one of their systems may fail.
 › The risk has decreased during 2017 due to work in 
Group Procurement.
 › We work closely with our suppliers to review programme 
plans, delivery quality and timing to ensure that they meet 
our requirements. We have a highly experienced quality 
assurance team at satellite manufacturing sites to check 
design and production activities and also at launch sites 
ahead of our satellite launches.
 › The Group Procurement department’s reviews and actions 
reduce the risk, for example exploring dual sourcing and 
assessing suppliers’ quality, technical know-how 
and financial viability.
 › We can operate in an agile way to seek new satellite 
launch providers if required as we did to secure an 
alternative provider for the delayed Inmarsat S EAN 
satellite launch in 2017.
11. Failure 
to effectively 
operationally 
deliver products 
and services
Link to strategy:
 1

 3
 5
 › We may fail to keep up with the developing business 
needs of our customers. We may fail in developing 
products and services that match their needs or 
encounter delays in bringing new products and 
services to market.
 › We may not be able to take to market our products and 
services for various reasons such as network/satellite 
issues, capacity constraints and/or technological 
difficulties which would impact our ability to generate 
revenues. Products may become obsolete.
 › We may fail in our internal processes leading to 
violations of regulations, for example financial reporting 
requirements. An export control violation may affect 
service delivery.
 › The risk has decreased in 2017 due to systematic work 
with improving and documenting existing processes, 
as well as implementing robust new systems and processes.
 › In developing products and services, we have processes 
which we continuously evolve and seek to improve to meet 
the expectations of customers.
 › We liaise closely with third parties across our ecosystem to 
review requirements and then plan our delivery against these.
 › Our systems need to be agile to be able to respond to any 
changing needs and having open network systems enables 
this agility by us and our wider partners.
 › All significant product and service developments are 
subject to approval and regular programme reviews to 
identify critical issues, changes, delivery delays and 
resolutions, and projected cost against budget. We are 
able to prioritise investment activity to focus on new 
requirements if this is felt appropriate.
 › We rely on a close relationship between our customer-facing 
business units, our operations team who deal directly with 
operating new products and services and the engineering 
and product teams.
 › We document and improve our internal processes.
 › We maintain an ongoing informed dialogue with investors, 
and ensure that internal and external expectations 
are aligned.

12. Risk to 
people, skills, 
location and 
working 
environment
Link to strategy:
 4
 › We may fail to hire skilled people or adequately improve 
skills to maintain and grow our business, or to deliver 
our strategy. We may lose highly technical and specialist 
employees who have very specific skill sets that are vital to 
the business. We may lose knowledge with employees and 
consultants that leave the Company. Brexit negotiations 
outcomes could impact EU citizens working in London and 
UK citizens in Europe. We may lose employee engagement 
and motivation. We may suffer a terrorist attack or a 
natural disaster on one of our network or office locations.
 › The risk has decreased during 2017 due to the 
implementation of the People strategy.
 › We develop and implement a People strategy where we identify 
key employees, skills and skills gaps to manage the human 
resource effectively and enable delivery of the strategy of the 
Company. We develop and implement recruitment strategies 
to hire people with the new skills needed. Inmarsat’s Brexit 
committee analyses risks and deploys strategies to minimise 
possible impact. The Brexit committee has organised briefing 
sessions for EU citizen employees and Inmarsat is financially 
supporting residency applications. We are in the process 
of reviewing and enhancing our employee proposition 
which focuses on career development, training and reward 
to improve people’s experience of Inmarsat.
13. Geo-political 
risk
Link to strategy:
 4
 5
 › Downturns in the economy of a country and/or world economy, 
or closure of capital markets could impact our business, our 
ability to raise financing and impact the delivery of our strategy. 
We could fail to comply with applicable international legislation 
and international reporting requirements.
 › Armed conflicts as well as a low oil price may have large 
effects on world trade and consequently on our business, 
strategy and currency exchange rates.
 › We do a large amount of business with governments across 
the globe including the U.S. Government. Major political 
policy changes and decisions, such as sanctions and Brexit, 
may impact our business. Brexit negotiations outcomes 
could impact EU citizens working in London and UK citizens 
in Europe. We may suffer a terrorist attack or a natural disaster 
on one of our network or office locations. Our staff and their 
families may suffer a local epidemic or global pandemic.
 › We ensure the Company is financially robust and resilient 
to economic downturns.
 › We continuously review and adapt our strategy in reaction 
to developing political or economic situations. We assess 
and manage new risks such as the impact of the UK Brexit 
and changes in government, epidemics, for example that 
potentially could impact our people and business. Inmarsat’s 
Brexit committee analyses risks and deploys strategies to 
minimise possible impact.
Each scenario was tested and the financial impact 
estimated based upon a combination of internal 
estimates and data available from reliable external 
sources. Mitigation strategies were identified 
and costed in conjunction with internal experts 
to calculate the net likely financial impact of each 
scenario in both isolation and if they were to occur 
concurrently. The Audit Committee reviewed and 
discussed the process undertaken by management.
CONCLUSION
Based on this assessment, the Directors confirm 
that they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
period to 31 December 2020.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors noted 
that the Group is exposed to particularly high 
levels of risk when a satellite is launched though 
this is routinely mitigated through launch insurance, 
for which there is a well-developed market. Once 
satellites have been successfully placed into orbit, 
the experience of the last 35 years is that failures 
are rare, which is due in part to the high levels 
of redundancy that are routinely built into the 
satellites and ground network. Looking beyond 
the risks associated with the satellites and our 
network the geographical and sector diversification 
of the Group’s operations helps reduce the risk 
of a loss that might endanger the viability of 
the Group.
contribute significantly to the longer-term viability 
of the Group. The following risks were deemed as 
having the potential to threaten the operational 
viability of the Group:
 › Failure of satellites and our network: Modelled 
the impact of a catastrophic failure to satellites 
in both our I-4 and GX networks
 › Spectrum, Orbital slots and Market access 
risk: Modelled the impact of our inability to 
obtain appropriate licences and market access 
to deliver services across our key networks
 › Security Risk: Modelled the impact of an 
aggressive cyber-attack that penetrates 
our networks and/or key systems
 › Failure of Critical Customers: Modelled 
the impact of the loss of key customers
 › Geo-political risk: Modelled the loss of core 
government contracts due to geo-political 
events outside the control of the Company
 › Failure to expand into the broadband market: 
Modelled the impact of materially lower GX 
growth rates than in the Plan
 › Failure to successfully grasp aviation 
passenger connectivity opportunity: Modelled 
the impact of materially lower Aviation passenger 
connectivity growth rates than in the Plan
 › Failure to at least maintain our existing 
L-band business: Modelled the impact of 
materially lower growth rates than in the Plan
 › Failure to maintain and grow Maritime 
business: Modelled the impact of materially 
lower growth rates than in the Plan
VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2014, the Directors 
have assessed the viability of the Group over a 
three year period, taking into account the Group’s 
current position and the potential impact of the 
principal risks documented on pages 51 to 55 
of the Annual Report.
ASSESSMENT PERIOD
The Directors have determined that a three year 
period to 31 December 2020 is an appropriate 
period over which to provide its viability statement. 
This is the key period of focus within the Group’s 
strategic planning process and it reflects 
the period over which the Group has reasonable 
visibility of both customer contracts and 
product development programmes.
ASSESSMENT PROCESS
The Long Range Business Plan (‘the Plan’), 
which is updated annually, formed the basis for 
the viability assessment. The Plan, as a matter 
of routine, takes account of ‘business as 
usual risks’ including slower revenue growth, 
increased operating costs, higher working capital 
requirements and adverse outcomes to disputed 
items. In completing the viability assessment, 
the Plan was tested against a number of severe 
but plausible principal risk scenarios. The scenarios 
were determined by considering which of the 
principal risks to the business outlined above

Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Strategic Report | Risk management CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 
TO GOVERNANCE
We are committed to 
maintaining the highest 
standards of governance 
at the Board level and 
throughout the Company
The Board is ultimately responsible to shareholders 
for all our activities: for delivering our strategy 
and financial performance in the long-term 
interests of the Company; for efficiently using 
our resources and having regard to social, 
environmental and ethical matters. Setting the 
right cultural tone from the Board, through the 
Executive Directors and Executive Management 
Board throughout the Group is very important.
The Board approves the Group’s governance 
framework with the Board Committees 
contributing their specialist focus to key 
areas such as remuneration policy, internal 
controls and risk management.
Our governance framework reflects the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’) and the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013 (‘the Regulations’). 
We comply with the Code with one exception 
that I, as Chairman, was not considered 
independent on appointment because I was 
previously an executive director. However we 
have a strong Senior Independent Director, 
Dr Abe Peled, who provides additional 
independence to respond to any shareholder 
queries and has joined me in several 
shareholder meetings.
During 2017 there were changes in Board 
membership which I’ve summarised in my 
opening Chairman’s statement on page 7 
and also note later in this Report.
The Directors have confirmed by way of 
a statement, on page 103, that they consider 
the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable. The processes 
including financial controls and reporting, 
and risk management, which underpin and 
support our confidence in making this statement 
are long-established and embedded into our 
business and we continue to make improvements 
in our reporting. In addition, our Internal 
Audit department reviewed the narrative 
sections of the Annual Report. In line with its 
terms of reference, a subset of the Disclosure 
Committee also reviews the Annual Report 
to ensure it contains all necessary disclosures 
to fairly present the Company’s and the 
Group’s financial condition and results of 
operations. Our external auditors review the 
narrative sections of the Annual Report to 
identify any material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. Our Board members 
receive drafts of the Annual Report in sufficient 
time to facilitate their review and input.
We are aware of the Financial Reporting Council 
report which encourages the Board to address 
culture, encourage discussion and debate how 
boards and executive management can steer 
corporate behaviour to create a culture that 
will deliver sustainable good performance. 
The Board is very collaborative and collegiate; 
honest and open debate is in evidence at 
all Board meetings. The Board and Executive 
Management Board understand the increasing 
importance which corporate culture plays in 
delivering long-term business and economic 
success and this will be an area of focus for 
the Board. During 2017, we introduced a new 
high-performing culture programme which is 
mentioned in the ‘Our People’ section of the 
Resources and Relationships part of this Annual 
Report. It has already been rolled out to the 
extended leadership team of around 100 senior 
managers across the Group and all employees 
will participate in workshops during 2018 and 
into 2019. We act with integrity and we see 
this within our Board discussions, and how this 
cascades down through the business from the 
Executive Management Board. We are very 
proud of Inmarsat’s brand and are focused 
on protecting its integrity for the future.
As Chairman I am able to call on a broad 
and diverse range of skills and experience 
from all my Directors. The blend of experience, 
nationalities and range of cultural experience 
within the Board is valuable to us as we fulfil our 
duties. The diversity already on our Board allows 
us to be culturally aware and respond where there 
are areas which need greater focus. Succession 
planning for the Non-Executive Directors remains 
a key focus for the Nominations Committee and 
the Board. Warren Finegold joined us in August 
2017 and I’m delighted that he is contributing 
so well so quickly. We will review the size and 
composition of the Board over 2018.
We hope the information in this Report will 
help you to understand how your Board runs 
the Company, manages risks, monitors internal 
controls, and how decisions have been made.

with you how we operate 
as a Board and explains 
the responsibilities we 
have as Directors to all our 
stakeholders. We describe 
the different Board 
Committees and how they 
are accountable for clearly 
defined responsibilities, 
each headed by a 
Non-Executive Director
The Board is committed to the highest 
standards of governance and it does this 
whilst being responsible for the overall 
conduct of the Group’s business and by 
providing leadership and guidance.
BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2017

This section provides an overview of the Board 
and how it and its Committees work together.
Details of the type of activity considered by the 
Board and also some of the core responsibilities 
for certain Directors are also explained.
As part of the Board evaluation process, 
the Directors comment on the wide range of 
discussions it considers and this is reflected 
in the following summary.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
It is important to have strong leadership from 
the Board as a whole to support the Executive 
Directors and management in their day-to-day 
running of the business.
The Board supports an open and transparent 
culture which is endorsed by the Executive 
Directors and the Executive Management Team.

LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY
REMUNERATION
IN THIS SECTION
This section of the governance report 
provides a review of what remuneration has 
been paid to Executive Directors in 2017 
and what is intended to be paid in 2018 
(called the implementation report) and how 
we operate within an agreed remuneration 
policy. Shareholders are asked to vote at 
the AGM annually on the implementation 
report, and every three years on the 
Remuneration Policy.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Our Remuneration Committee carries the 
responsibility to deliver a clear articulation 
of our Remuneration Policy and consider 
this in the context of the pay arrangements 
for all our employees. It is important for 
stakeholders to understand how remuneration 
is determined and that the appropriate 
links between remuneration, strategy, 
risk and KPIs are made.
SEE PAGES 76 TO 98
EFFECTIVENESS
IN THIS SECTION
In the Report from the Nominations Committee 
Chairman, we reflect on the elements of how 
the Board is made up, how we plan to ensure 
success in the future and how we make 
sure on an annual basis that we are being 
held accountable to each other as Board 
members and also to our stakeholders.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Having an effective and contributing Board, 
with the right skills, experience and willingness 
to contribute to the Company’s culture, is 
very important to our success as a company 
and therefore to our stakeholders.
It is incumbent on the Board to make sure 
that it is diligent in its succession planning –  
at Board level and also contributing to what 
happens at the Executive Management 
Board level and understanding succession 
planning across the Company.
SEE PAGES 67 TO 69
IN THIS SECTION
Our Audit Committee Chairman has now 
gone through his second full annual cycle 
and we have a new Committee member 
who joined in August 2017.
The work of the Audit Committee extends 
and expands as the number of new auditing 
and governance requirements grows.
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Two of our Board Committees have 
responsibility for oversight of our telecoms 
regulatory requirements and audit reporting.
These are significant areas of focus for our 
business and it is important for stakeholders 
to know that this is recognised at the highest 
level in the Company.
It is critical to know that there is a process 
of accountability running throughout the 
Company with good processes in place 
and defined levels of responsibility.

HOW THE BOARD OPERATES
To ensure effective governance, your Board 
has structured its governance framework 
as set out below.
The Board has established Committees 
to assist it in exercising its authority. 
The permanent Committees of the Board 
are the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations 
and Telecoms Regulatory Committees. 
Each Committee has Terms of Reference 
under which authority is delegated by the 
Board. Copies can be found on our website 
at inmarsat.com. Reports of the Committees 
can be found on pages 67 to 98.
ROLE OF THE BOARD
Our Board is responsible for the overall conduct 
of the Inmarsat Group’s (the ‘Group’) business. 
It is the primary decision-making body 
for all material matters affecting the Group. 
It provides leadership and guidance and 
sets our strategic direction.
Our Board is ultimately accountable to the 
shareholders for:
 › the performance and proper conduct 
of the business
 › being responsible for the long-term 
success of the Company, having regard 
for the interests of all stakeholders and
 › being responsible for ensuring the 
effectiveness and reporting on our 
system of governance
Responsibility for implementing strategy within 
the Group’s operations and for day-to-day 
management of the business is delegated 
to the Chief Executive Officer who, as part 
of the Executive Management Board, 
cascades this responsibility through the Group. 
The CEO is empowered by the Board to handle 
all business activities up to a designated level 
of authorisation and to report to the Board 
for guidance, support and approval on other 
matters which require Board input. A list of 
the members of the Executive Management 
Board is provided on page 61.
A formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for decision or consideration 
by the Board as a whole has been agreed 
by the Directors. This schedule covers 
areas such as:
 › the Group’s business strategy  
and long-term plans
 › major capital projects

are considered to be independent and free of any 
circumstances that could materially interfere 
with their ability to provide a strong and valuable 
contribution to the Board’s deliberations, 
or which could interfere with the individual 
Director’s ability to also act in the best interests 
of the Group. The Nominations Committee 
additionally considers the independence 
carefully once a Non-Executive Director has 
served for nine years or more to assess whether 
their contribution to the Board remains 
valuable and valid to support the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
Executive Management Board
The Chief Executive chairs the Executive 
Management Board which meets on a monthly 
basis for generally 1.5/2 days. As part of its 
remit, this team focuses on the Group’s 
strategy, financial reviews and long range 
business planning, the competitive landscape, 
strategic updates from all areas of the business, 
risk reviews, culture, learning and development 
and organisational development. It has regular 
executive development days. The Executive 
Management Board includes the Executive 
Directors, the Business Unit Presidents and 
the key functional heads. The names of the 
Executive Management team are shown 
on page 61.
GOVERNANCE AND CONDUCT 
OF BOARD MEETINGS
Our Board meets as often as necessary 
to effectively conduct its business. During 
2017, the Board met eight times, with one 
of those meetings being held over two days 
in Washington DC. The meetings in local 
offices provide the Board with exposure to 
our staff and business operations outside 
the London headquarters.
Key management are invited to attend 
all Board meetings to present on specific 
business issues which will include an 
operations update from each of the Business 
Units and central services divisions, covering 
commercial, technology and operational 
matters. Unscheduled supplementary meetings 
also take place as and when necessary. 
At each meeting, the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer provide reports 
to the Board. The Board is therefore given 
exposure to the next layer of management 
at the Executive Board level and often to 
their direct reports. This is helpful to the Board 
as it provides it with additional insight into 
internal talent and provides additional inputs 
for discussion for management succession. 
Strategy sessions are attended by several 
or ongoing independence as set out in the Code 
and recommendations are made to the Board 
for election or re-election. Following such 
review, the Board considers Sir Bryan Carsberg 
to be now a non-independent Non-Executive 
Director because of his length of service with the 
Company, and his tenure being alongside that 
of the Chairman. Despite this reclassification 
of Sir Bryan’s Non-Executive directorship, he 
fulfils his responsibilities with an independent 
view, providing critical thinking and contributions 
and continues to act in the best interests of the 
Company. All other Non-Executive Directors

The diverse experience and backgrounds 
of the Non-Executive Directors ensures that 
they can provide a strong independent element 
on the Board, debate and constructively 
challenge management both in relation to 
the development of strategy and review of the 
Group’s operational and financial performance.
To determine their independence, all 
Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by 
the Nominations Committee annually against 
any circumstances relevant to their current

KEY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 64 Governance | Leadership noted in the changing content and improved 
presentations presented to the Audit 
Committee and Board.
The Board has annual updates on the 
Company’s policies for compliance with the 
UK Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (‘FCPA’) requirements and 
health and safety. As part of our commitment 
to preventing bribery and establishing a culture 
that does not tolerate corruption wherever 
and in whatever form it may be encountered, we 
have a formal Board-approved anti-corruption 
policy and a summary of the anti-bribery policy 
is included on our website. We have appropriate 
procedures in place to ensure compliance with 
current legislation. An independently managed, 
confidential whistleblowing helpline (email and 
telephone) is available to employees to use. 
There was no use of it during 2017. Additionally, 
the Board is updated on the Company’s 
compliance with the recent legislation 
concerning a Corporate Criminal Offence 
relating to failure to prevent tax evasion.
The Company recognises the importance of 
electronic information, systems and network 
security (cyber security) and this is included as 
an agenda item in its own right and also included 
in strategy discussions and other key projects. 
We are increasingly required to be compliant 
with, or align to, various legal, contractual 
and regulatory standards and codes of practice 
relative to information security governance and 
the preservation of the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of customer or internal data 
and services. This is part of a broader programme 
supported by a dedicated cyber security team 
whose primary role is to safeguard the Company 
to meet its legal and regulatory obligations, 
maintain business continuity and limit damage 
to business interests by preventing and reducing 
the occurrence of security incidents and their 
impact upon business operations. In recognition 
of this importance, we have committed to seek 
certification to the ISO 27001 standard which 
requires us to have an information management 
security procedure in place and also increased 
our investments on cyber security during 2017 
in terms of resources and on tools.
There has been focus within the Company 
during 2017 and into 2018 on the work required 
to ensure compliance with the new General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) which 
comes into effect in May 2018.
identified. The Company’s Articles of Association 
contain provisions to allow the Directors to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest so that 
a Director is not in breach of his/her duty under 
company law. As noted above and happens 
in practice, should a Director become aware 
that they have an interest, directly or indirectly, 
in an existing or proposed transaction with 
the Company, they are required to notify this 
to the Company Secretary. Directors have a 
continuing duty to notify any changes to their 
conflicts of interest and to their external Board 
commitments to the Company Secretary and 
any changes are noted in the conflicts register.

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS
An overview of the Group’s framework 
for identifying and managing risk, both at 
an operational and strategic level, is set out 
on pages 50 and 51 in the Strategic Report. 
The Board has responsibility for managing 
risk and although the Audit Committee 
has responsibility for the risk management 
process the Board does not delegate overall 
responsibility for risk to either the Audit 
Committee or management. There has been 
additional work undertaken in 2017 on risk 
processes and assessment and updates were 
senior executives. Elements of the business 
strategy and business development are reviewed 
as appropriate at each Board meeting throughout 
the year ensuring that all Directors are kept 
up to date with discussions and activities. 
All Committee Chairmen report verbally on the 
proceedings of their Committees at the next 
Board meeting. Meeting proceedings and any 
unresolved concerns expressed by any Director 
are minuted by the Company Secretary.
In instances where a Director is unable to attend 
Board or Committee meetings, any comments 
which he or she may have arising out of the 
papers to be considered at the meeting are 
relayed in advance to the relevant Chairman 
or the Company Secretary who would then 
report to the Board or Committee thereon.
The Senior Independent Director will convene 
meetings with the Non-Executive Directors 
at least annually and on an ad-hoc basis as 
required to discuss Board balance, monitor 
the powers of individual Executive Directors 
and raise any issues between themselves 
as appropriate. The Chairman will attend these 
meetings but will not be in attendance where 
there is discussion about his own performance.
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover has 
been established for all Directors and Officers 
to provide cover against their reasonable actions 
on behalf of the Company. In accordance with 
our Articles of Association and to the extent 
permitted by the laws of England and Wales, 
Directors, the Company Secretary and certain 
employees who serve as directors of subsidiaries 
at the Group’s request have been granted 
indemnities from the Company in respect of 
liabilities incurred as a result of their office. 
Neither our indemnity nor the insurance 
provides cover in the event that a Director is 
proven to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. 
No amount has been paid under any of these 
indemnities during the year.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Company has in place procedures for 
managing conflicts of interest and is aware of 
any potential conflict through an annual review 
of the other commitments of its Directors. 
We are satisfied these commitments do not 
conflict with their duties as Directors of Inmarsat. 
During the year, where there were agenda items 
being raised for discussion which could have 
the perception of a conflict of interest for 
the individual Director, these were discussed 
at the relevant Board meeting and agreed 
in each case there were no conflicts of interest

CONTINUED
 › Information systems: information systems 
are developed to support the Group’s long-term 
objectives and are managed by professionally 
staffed teams. Appropriate policies and 
procedures are in place covering all significant 
areas of the business.
 › Contractual commitments: there are 
clearly defined policies and procedures 
for entering into contractual commitments. 
These include detailed requirements that 
must be completed prior to submitting 
proposals and/or tenders for work, both in 
respect of the commercial, control and risk 
management aspects of the obligations 
being entered into. Business plan approval 
and procurement process procedures 
also strengthen the review of contractual 
commitments before any such commitment 
is agreed to.
 › Monitoring of controls: the Audit Committee 
receives regular reports from the internal 
and external auditors and assures itself that 
the internal control environment of the Group 
is operating effectively. There are formal 
policies and procedures in place to ensure 
the integrity and accuracy of the accounting 
records and to safeguard the Group’s assets. 
Significant capital projects and acquisitions 
and disposals require Board approval. 
There are formal procedures by which staff 
can, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in financial and 
pensions administration and other matters –  
often referred to as ‘whistleblowing’ 
procedures. There is a worldwide anonymous 
whistleblowing programme in place and 
monthly reports are issued by the external 
provider to the Company Secretary and 
Head of Internal Audit. No issues were 
reported in the year. Where there are any 
reports made, arrangements are in place for 
proportionate and independent investigation 
and appropriate follow-up action with the 
results being reported to the Audit Committee. 
The annual anti-bribery and corruption 
training also highlights the ways in which 
an employee can raise an issue in a 
confidential way.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Details of the Company’s remuneration policy 
and Directors’ remuneration are contained 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 76 to 98.
 › Risk management: an overarching risk 
management policy is in place which sets out 
the tolerance for risk within the Group and 
how this is measured across identified macro 
and business risks. As required by the policy, 
management operates a risk management 
process to identify, evaluate and report 
significant risks within the business and to 
report to the Board on how those risks are 
being managed and mitigated. Risks are 
highlighted through a number of different 
reviews and culminate in a risk register, 
monitored by Risk Committees across 
the Group, which identify the risk area, the 
probability of the risk occurring, the impact 
if it does occur and the actions being taken 
to manage the risk to the desired level. 
All the risk registers are reviewed by senior 
management and provided quarterly to the 
Board and to the Audit Committee. Details 
of the risk process and key risks are shown 
on pages 50 and 51 in the Strategic Report.
 › Management structure: there is a clearly 
defined organisational structure throughout 
the Group with established lines of reporting 
and delegation of authority based on job 
responsibilities and experience. The delegation 
policy has recently been updated to operate 
in an improved clearer way for employees to 
understand how their levels of accountability 
fit within the levels of approved authorisation. 
Within the business, senior management 
meetings occur regularly to allow prompt 
discussion of relevant business issues. 
A process of self-certification is used where 
Directors and senior managers are required 
to detail and certify controls in operation 
to mitigate risk in key process areas. 
The Presidents of the Business Units also 
confirm every quarter that they are not 
aware of any breach of key policies including 
our sensitive information policy (which 
relates to protection of partner data) and 
any anti-bribery activities.
 › Financial reporting: monthly management 
accounts provide relevant, reliable and 
up-to-date financial and non-financial 
information to management and the Board. 
Analysis is undertaken of differences between 
actual results and the annual budget on 
a monthly basis. Annual plans, forecasts, 
performance targets and long-range business 
plans allow management to monitor 
the key business and financial activities, 
and the progress towards achieving the 
financial objectives. The annual budget is 
approved by the Board, as is the long-range 
business plan. The Group reports half-yearly 
based on a standardised reporting process, 
and in addition, also reports on a quarterly basis.
Internal controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility 
for establishing and maintaining the Group’s 
system of internal controls and it receives 
regular reports from management identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks within the 
business. The system of internal controls is 
designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. The Audit Committee reviews the system 
of internal controls through reports received 
from management, along with those from both 
internal and external auditors. Management 
continues to focus on how internal control and 
risk management can be further embedded 
into the operations of the business and to 
deal with areas of improvement which come 
to management’s and the Board’s attention.
The Company has an established Disclosure 
Committee with responsibility for reviewing 
and approving controls and procedures over 
the public disclosure of financial and related 
information and other procedures necessary 
to enable the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer to provide their 
certifications in relation to publicly disclosed 
information. The Disclosure Committee 
comprises the Chairman, both Executive 
Directors, Company Secretary and other 
senior executives.
The Board and the Audit Committee have 
carried out a review of the effectiveness of 
the system of internal controls during the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and for the period 
up to the date of approval of the consolidated 
financial statements contained in the Annual 
Report. The review covered all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management systems. The 
Board confirms that the actions it considers 
necessary have been, or are being taken to 
remedy any significant failings or weaknesses 
identified from its review of the system of 
internal control. This has involved considering 
the matters reported to it and developing plans 
and programmes that it considers are reasonable 
in the circumstances. The Board also confirms 
that it has not been advised of material 
weaknesses in the part of the internal control 
system that relates to financial reporting.
The key elements of the Group’s system 
of internal controls, which have been in place 
throughout the year under review and up to 
the date of this Report, include:

Report of the Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee will also make 
recommendations to the Board concerning 
the annual reappointment by shareholders 
of any Non-Executive Director as he or she 
reaches their sixth year of reappointment 
and separately with a view to assessing 
their continuing independence thereafter, 
particularly when Directors are seeking 
to be reappointed after serving nine years. 
The Committee also has responsibility for 
approving any changes to Executive Directors 
including senior management appointments.
All currently appointed Directors will retire 
at the 2018 AGM and offer themselves 
for election or re-election as appropriate. 
As noted earlier in the Governance Report, 
the Committee has reviewed Sir Bryan’s 
contribution and determined he participates 
effectively at Board meetings. We are 
recommending to shareholders therefore, 
that he be re-elected as a non-independent, 
Non-Executive Director. The Committee 
will review his continued appointment to 
the Board on an annual basis.
Independent Non-Executive Directors make 
up a majority of members of the Committee. 
The Nominations Committee meets as and 
when necessary, generally formally twice 
a year although in 2017 the second meeting 
was postponed to allow for further time for an 
update on a detailed management succession 
planning to be given in 2018. Dr Abe Peled 
became Chairman in November 2015. Other 
members of the Committee are Andrew Sukawaty, 
Stephen Davidson (up to his retirement in 
January 2017) and Dr Hamadoun Touré.
The Committee has responsibility for nominating 
candidates for appointment as Directors to 
the Board, bearing in mind the need for diversity 
(including gender, nationality and experience) 
and ensuring a broad representation of skills 
across the Board. In doing this, the Committee 
will give full consideration to succession planning 
and the leadership needs of the Company. 
The Committee also makes recommendations 
to the Board on the composition of the 
Board’s Committees and will review and make 
recommendations in relation to the structure, 
size and composition of the Board including 
the diversity and balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience, and the independence of 
the Non-Executive Directors, including the 
tenure of each Director.
An area of continued focus 
for the Committee has been 
Non-Executive Director 
succession planning, 
with the retirement of two 
longer-term directors early 
in the year, an additional 
director joining in August 
2017 and a decision to 
propose the re-election 
of Sir Bryan Carsberg 
to continue on the Board 
as a non-independent 
non-executive director

CONTINUED
INDUCTION AND ONGOING 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
To ensure that each Director receives 
appropriate support on joining the Board, 
they are given a comprehensive, formal 
and tailored induction programme organised 
through the Company Secretary, including 
the provision of background material on the 
Company and briefings with each of the Executive 
Management Board members. These meetings 
will ensure that the on-boarding process for 
a new Director provides a view of each area 
of the business with the opportunity for further 
discussion as appropriate. Each Director’s 
individual experience and background is taken 
into account in developing a programme 
tailored to his or her own requirements. 
The induction programme was reviewed and 
updated in 2017 for Mr Finegold and took place 
over a number of days to allow sufficient time 
for each meeting.
For professional ongoing development, 
the Board receives presentations relevant 
to the Company’s business and updates on 
any changes in legislation which may affect 
the Company’s operations. The Company 
Secretary supplies all Directors with information 
on relevant legal and best practice. As part 
of their annual performance evaluation, 
Directors are given the opportunity to discuss 
training and development needs. Whilst the 
Chairman takes ultimate responsibility for this, 
each Director is expected to ask about any 
specific training needs. They also take steps 
to ensure they are adequately informed 
about the Company and their responsibilities 
as a Director and attend external briefings 
and receive information updates. The Board is 
confident that its members have the knowledge, 
ability and experience to perform the functions 
required of a Director of a listed company.
In considering the skills required for the new 
Non-Executive Director, there was focus on 
seeking an individual who had broad corporate, 
strategic and financial knowledge as we felt that 
this would be additive to the current experience 
of the Board and provide a complementary 
overlay to other Board members’ experience. 
Mr Finegold’s 10 years’ experience on Vodafone’s 
executive management team as Group Strategy 
and Business Development Director and with his 
previous investment banking experience, met 
the requirements for the role. We are delighted 
that Warren decided to join Inmarsat. As part 
of the recruitment process, Warren met several 
people including the Chairman of the Board, 
the CEO, CFO, Senior Independent Director 
and Chairman of the Nominations Committee, 
and the Company Secretary. Other members 
of the Board were also given the opportunity 
to meet him.
The Committee, when reviewing succession 
planning, considers diversity in its broadest 
sense and takes this into account in its 
recommendations to the Board. It takes into 
account the challenges and opportunities 
facing the Company; diversity, including 
gender; and what cultural experience, skills 
and expertise are needed on the Board and 
from senior management in the future. 
Gender is one element of the considerations 
made in appointing senior management 
and Board members and as part of general 
recruitment practices across the Group. 
The Committee has not set quotas for the 
percentage of women in the workforce but is 
supportive of the need generally to encourage 
diversity when employees and Directors 
(Executive and Non-Executive) are recruited. 
The Committee gives full consideration to 
succession planning in the course of its work 
and receives updated management succession 
plans which look at succession planning for 
the Executive Management Board and identifies 
the next layer of management below them 
who are identified as those with potential for 
promotion to senior management positions. 
During 2017 there was significant work 
undertaken by the Chief People Officer and 
her team in identifying a high performing 
talent programme across the organisation 
which will contribute to an updated management 
succession programme for presentation 
during 2018 to the Committee and the Board.
COMPOSITION
Our Board comprises Directors drawn from 
a wide range of professional backgrounds. 
All our Directors bring strong judgement to 
the Board’s deliberations. The Non-Executive 
Directors we appointed in 2016 and more 
recently in 2017 have contributed very effectively 
to Board discussions and have demonstrated 
their increasing knowledge of how the Company 
operates and its business. We took the decision 
to appoint these additional Directors to 
complement the skills of the existing ones so 
that future succession planning is enabled on a 
smoother retirement basis. In 2016 we appointed 
Phillipa (‘Pip’) McCrostie and in 2017 we 
appointed Warren Finegold. Stephen Davidson 
and Kathleen Flaherty both retired from the 
Board in January and March 2017 respectively.
As at March 2018, the composition of 
the Board is two Executive Directors, nine 
Non-Executive Directors and a Non-Executive 
Chairman. With the exception of Warren Finegold, 
all current Directors served throughout 
the year. The names of the Directors on our 
Board, their relevant skills and experience 
are set out in their biographical details and 
can be found on pages 58 to 61.
The composition of the Board and its various 
Committees is regularly reviewed and evaluated 
so as to reflect the balance of skills, knowledge, 
diversity (of which gender is one component), 
experience and the ability of Directors to provide 
sufficient time to fulfil their Board responsibilities.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Appointments to the Board are made on 
merit, against objective criteria and with 
due regard to the benefits of diversity on the 
Board. This process is led by the Chairman 
of the Committee, with support of the Board 
Chairman, which, after evaluating the 
balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
of each Director, makes recommendations 
to the Board.
In appointing Non-Executive Directors, 
the Board’s practice is to use a combination 
of external consultants and personal referrals. 
The Non-Executive Director who was appointed 
in 2017 was through an external consultancy.
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 68 Governance | Report of the Nominations Committee EXTERNAL DIRECTORSHIPS
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefit 
of Executive Directors accepting non-executive 
directorships of other companies in order to 
widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit 
of the Company. All such appointments require 
the prior approval of the Board and the number 
of public company appointments is generally 
limited to two. Details of external appointments 
for the CEO can be found in his biography 
on page 59. There were no fees paid to the 
CEO for these duties.
APPOINTMENT AND 
REAPPOINTMENT
The Directors may appoint additional 
members to join the Board during the year. 
Directors appointed in this way will, upon the 
recommendation of the Board, offer themselves 
for election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) after their 
appointment. The reappointment of Directors 
is subject to their ongoing commitment to 
Board activities and satisfactory performance. 
All Directors will stand for re-election annually 
in accordance with the provision of the Code 
and Mr Finegold will stand for election. The 
Nominations Committee confirmed to the Board 
that the contributions made by the Directors 
offering themselves for re-election at the 2018 
AGM continue to benefit the Board and the 
Company should support their re-election. 
Non-Executive Directors are appointed initially 
for three years and all Non-Executive Directors 
may not, unless agreed by the Board, remain 
in office for a period longer than six years, 
or two terms in office, whichever is the shorter.
As already set out earlier in this Report on 
page 67, one of our Non-Executive Directors, 
Sir Bryan Carsberg is being supported by the 
Board for re-election at the 2018 AGM as 
a non-independent Non-Executive Director.
BOARD EVALUATION
In 2015 the Company undertook an external 
evaluation, facilitated by Duncan Reed of 
Condign Board Consulting. This was the second 
time Mr Reed had undertaken the external 
evaluation. Neither Mr Reed nor Condign 
Board Consulting have any other commercial 
relationships with Inmarsat. The 2016 and 
the most recent 2017 Board evaluation was 
undertaken by the Company Secretary on 
behalf of the Chairman. This took the form of 
a questionnaire to all Directors and a meeting 
between the Company Secretary and each 
of the Directors.
We have continued to build on themes identified 
in the 2016 evaluation so that we ensure the 
Board and Committee meeting times are used 
effectively and are focused on items which 
are strategic and key to supporting the 
Company’s objectives.
Board presentations are more focused with 
delivery at Board meetings leading to discussion 
at higher strategic levels. Keeping this improved 
standard is noted as something from the 2017 
evaluation process to maintain.
Board agendas are sometimes lengthy 
and Board members have suggested that it 
might be helpful for meetings sometimes to 
run for an extra half day. This will be considered 
within the 2018 Board meeting schedule and 
for future years.
Ensuring that the Board continues to receive 
early updates on proposals from management 
on significant transactional issues is a theme 
continued from the 2016 evaluation. This allows 
the Board to be informed and able to contribute 
as these matters develop up to decision stage.
The main outputs from the exercise confirmed 
that the new Non-Executive Directors had 
performed well and the whole Board was 
operating effectively, with mutual respect 
for each other’s experience and contributions. 
The review completed by the Directors regarding 
the Board Chairman’s own performance 
reflected their continued support of how he 
managed the Board, seeking to ensure that 
all Directors contributed to the discussion 
and that he managed the discussion 
effectively and fairly.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
MATTERS
During 2017, the Audit Committee considered 
the significant accounting matters described 
below. In addressing these issues the Committee 
considered the appropriateness of management’s 
accounting estimates and key judgements, 
outlined in note 4 to the consolidated financial 
statements. The Committee discussed these 
with the external auditor during the year and, 
where appropriate, details of how they have 
been addressed are provided in the Independent 
Auditors’ Report on pages 105 to 111.
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
An in-depth review of revenue accounting, lease 
accounting and financial instruments has been 
completed in preparation for the implementation 
of IFRS 15, IFRS 16 and IFRS 9 respectively in 2018. 
IFRS 16 is to be early adopted in 2018 as the 
overall impact on the financial statements 
is considered low. As part of the assessment, 
management has outlined the Group’s updated 
accounting policies to align with each of the 
standards. For revenue recognition, installation 
and Ligado revenue will have their recognition 
policies updated and the comparatives will be 
adjusted within the 2018 financial statements as 
permitted by IFRS 15. For lease accounting, a right 
to use asset will be recorded on the statement 
of financial position with a corresponding lease 
liability, while changes in the income statement 
will be mainly presentational. For financial 
instruments, there are no material changes 
expected. Further details of the expected 
adjustments are outlined in note 1.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The timing of revenue recognition is a key area of 
judgement, especially in the telecommunications 
industry. The Group’s accounting policy on 
revenue recognition remains unchanged from 
the prior year, refer to note 2 for more details. 
The Group’s Internal Audit team have kept 
significant revenue systems, processes and 
recognition as a focus area during the year 
and the external auditor performed detailed 
audit procedures on revenue recognition, 
with the findings of both being reported to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has 
therefore concluded that the Group’s revenue 
recognition policies continue to be in line 
with IFRS requirements.
 › Monitor changes in the approach to 
assessing the carrying value of goodwill 
and intangibles for possible impairment and 
review the conclusions of the assessment
 › Reviewing key accounting judgements 
relating to specific transactions as well as 
changes to any accounting policies affecting 
the Group’s financial position and
 › Regular monitoring of key programmes 
across the Group including the plans for 
the implementation of a new billing and 
account payable system
Reviews by the Committee of audit plans 
and risk reports include all Group operations. 
Detailed risk reporting is used for all Group 
companies and business operations. One of 
our subsidiary companies, Inmarsat Group Ltd, 
is required to produce quarterly financial 
statements, as required by its loan agreements, 
which are reviewed and approved by the 
Committee. The quarterly review of the risk 
reports and the process adopted to manage 
risk is a key area of focus for the Committee.
With several significant changes to IFRS 
reporting being implemented, the Committee 
received detailed briefings and updates from 
management regarding progress.
The risk management process which had 
benefited from the Committee’s input during 
2016 continued to progress in being more 
focused on how mitigation activities would 
be implemented. This contributed to the 
quality of the viability statement review which 
is contained in the risk section of this Annual 
Report. New requirements for publishing 
a tax statement and compliance with new 
governance regulations were also part 
of the Committee’s work schedule.
Audit Committee meetings generally take 
place just prior to a Board meeting to maximise 
effectiveness and time planning efficiency of 
those attending. The Committee’s Chairman 
reports to the Board as part of a separate 
agenda item, on the activity of the Committee 
and matters of particular relevance to the 
Board in the conduct of their work. All members 
of the Board have access to Audit Committee 
papers and minutes of meetings, and may, on 
request to the Chairman, attend the meetings.
The Company Secretary, as Chairman of 
the Disclosure Committee (the role of which 
is detailed on page 66), reported on matters

The Audit Committee ensures that the external 
audit process and audit quality are effective. 
It does this by:
 › Monitoring the engagement between 
the Audit Committee Chairman and the 
lead audit engagement partner which will 
generally be through face-to-face meetings
 › Monitoring the reports which are brought to 
the Committee by the lead audit engagement 
partner and other senior members of the 
audit team
 › Monitoring the quality of the management 
responses to audit queries
 › Monitoring meetings held by the CEO 
and the Chairman with the lead audit 
engagement partner which are reported 
to the Audit Chairman and Committee
 › Monitoring a review of independence 
and objectivity of the audit firm and also 
the quality of the formal audit report 
given by the Auditor to shareholders and
 › Seeking feedback from members of the 
finance team, the Company Secretary and 
the Head of Internal Audit. The Committee 
is considering the use of a formal auditor 
assessment tool for future review of audit 
effectiveness
During the reporting year to 31 December 2017 , 
the activities of the Audit Committee were:
 › To ensure a smooth running of the Audit 
Committee following the addition of two 
new members over a 15-month period
 › Confirming to the Board that the Annual 
Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable
 › Review and endorsement, prior to submission 
to the Board, of half-year and full-year 
financial statements, interim management 
statements and results announcements
 › Review and approval of internal audit reports, 
and findings and recommendations arising 
from the reports
 › Review and approval of risk management 
updates and the annual risk management 
process
 › Agreement of external and internal annual

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 72 Governance | Report of the Audit Committee assets. The key judgements involved in 
the capitalisation of space segment assets 
and associated borrowings costs are:
 › Whether the capitalisation criteria 
of the underlying IFRS have been met
 › Allocation of an appropriate asset 
class and associated useful economic 
life in accordance with Group policies
 › Whether an asset is deemed to be substantially 
complete and as a result capitalisation of 
borrowing costs should cease and
 › Whether an asset is ready for use and as a 
result further capitalisation of costs should 
cease and depreciation should commence
The external auditor examined the capitalisation 
of development costs in the year, particularly 
in relation to the Global Xpress and S-band 
satellite programmes and reported its control 
findings to the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that space segment 
assets and associated borrowing costs have 
been capitalised correctly in the year. 
We acknowledge the Auditor’s advice and 
will review how any weaknesses will be remedied 
during the coming year.
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The Audit Committee received a detailed 
paper from management setting out both 
the Directors’ obligation to include a viability 
statement in the Annual Report and a 
detailed assessment of the Group’s viability. 
The Committee endorsed the selection of a 
three-year time horizon as a basis for the 
statement and reviewed the detailed viability 
assessment including the assumptions that 
had been made in conducting the assessment. 
Further detail on the assessment of viability and 
the viability statement are set out on page 55.
INTERNAL AUDIT
Monitoring and review of the scope, extent 
and effectiveness of the activity of the Internal 
Audit Department is an agenda item at each 
Committee meeting. Moreover the Chairman 
of the Committee meets regularly with the 
Internal Auditor.
Internal Audit prepares its annual audit plan 
based on the principal risks of the Company 
for the Committee to approve. Internal Audit 
conducts reviews of business operations, 
financial and internal controls, IT and cyber 
security, and legal and regulatory compliance 
etc. It presents its reports at each meeting 
covering updates on Internal Audit activities, 
results of audits and follow-up actions required.
the appropriateness of management’s 
views including the degree to which these are 
supported by professional advice from external 
legal and other advisory firms. This is also 
an area of higher audit risk and accordingly, 
the Committee received detailed verbal and 
written reports from the external auditor 
on these matters. Following these procedures, 
the Audit Committee deemed the income 
tax assets and liabilities balances for the year, 
as well as the Group’s disclosure in respect 
of income taxes and related liabilities, 
to be appropriate.
To ensure that the Group’s tax risk is managed 
conservatively and professionally, through 
observing laws and meeting our compliance 
obligations in all territories in which we operate. 
We seek to work proactively and collaboratively 
with our stakeholders, including tax authorities 
and colleagues within the business, whilst 
ensuring that the Group’s tax strategy is aligned 
with the wider business and its commercial 
strategy of generating sustainable value 
for our shareholders.
Our tax principles are a clear articulation of our tax 
mission statement. These are subject to review 
by the Board of Inmarsat plc on an annual basis.
Inmarsat’s tax function is committed to:
 › Observing all applicable laws, rules and 
regulations in meeting our tax compliance 
and reporting responsibilities everywhere 
we operate
 › Applying diligent professional care and 
judgement to ensure that the tax risk is 
managed with a high degree of certainty
 › Working positively, pro-actively and 
transparently with tax authorities to minimise 
the extent of disputes, to achieve early 
agreement on disputed issues when 
they arise and achieve certainty wherever 
possible and
 › Ensuring that tax strategy is aligned with 
the wider business and commercial strategy
The Group’s tax strategy is available on 
our website.
CAPITALISATION OF SPACE 
SEGMENT ASSETS AND ASSOCIATED 
BORROWING COSTS
Space segment assets comprise satellite 
construction, launch and other associated 
costs, including ground infrastructure. In 
addition, borrowing costs attributable to 
qualifying space segment assets are added 
to the cost of those assets. Given the nature 
of the Group’s business, significant capital 
expenditure is incurred on space segment 
REVENUE IN RESPECT OF THE LIGADO 
NETWORKS COOPERATION AGREEMENT
The Audit Committee continues to review the 
accounting treatment for the recognition of 
revenue and costs in respect of each phase of 
the Ligado Networks (formerly LightSquared) 
Cooperation Agreement.
In March 2016, Ligado Networks agreed to 
take the 30MHz option (the ‘30MHz Plan’) 
under the Cooperation Agreement between the 
companies. In exchange for the deferral of some 
payments from Ligado to Inmarsat, the parties 
agreed to delay the transition to the 30MHz 
Plan, with Ligado providing Inmarsat enhanced 
spectrum usage rights for its satellite operations 
for a minimum period of two years. With this 
in mind, Ligado made quarterly payments to 
Inmarsat of $111m during the course of 2017 and 
will make aggregate payments of approximately 
$118m in respect of 2018, payable in quarterly 
instalments. This revenue is currently recognised 
on an accruals basis. Under IFRS 15, the allocation 
of the revenue over the contract period will 
result in additional revenue of $4.5m being 
recognised in 2018 when compared to the 
current accounting policy.
Deferred income in respect of Phase 1 from 
Ligado continues to be carried on the balance 
sheet. Although the cash has been received, 
the timing of the recognition of this deferred 
income, together with any related future 
costs and taxes, is dependent upon a number 
of factors that continue to be uncertain. 
The impact of the foregoing on the deferred 
revenue balance of $181.8m (at 31 December 
2017) carried by Inmarsat in respect of the costs 
of implementation of this agreement is still to 
be determined. During 2017 , Inmarsat recognised 
$16.0m of deferred income; $2.0m on a $ for 
$ basis against any costs incurred in freeing 
up spectrum for Ligado and $14.0m as revenue 
to reflect the impact of the revenue deferral 
arising under the revised transition agreement.
The Audit Committee has deemed the current 
accounting treatment of all phases of the 
Cooperation Agreement appropriate.
TAXATION
The calculation of some of the Group’s 
potential tax assets and liabilities involves a 
degree of estimation and judgement in respect 
of certain items, whose tax treatment cannot 
be finalised until resolution has been reached 
with the relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, 
through a formal legal process. Issues can, 
and often do, take a number of years to resolve.
The Committee addresses these matters 
through a range of reporting from senior 
management and a process of challenging

Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Governance | Report of the Audit Committee REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
CONTINUED
In particular, the Committee considered 
the same themes as it had in 2016:
IS THE REPORT FAIR?
 › Is the whole story presented and has any 
sensitive material been omitted that 
should have been included?
 › Is the reporting on the business segments 
in the narrative reporting consistent with 
those used for the financial reporting in 
the financial statements?
 › Are the key messages in the narrative 
reflected in the financial reporting?
 › Are the KPIs disclosed at an appropriate level 
based on the financial reporting and are they 
the right ones to use to describe the business?
IS THE REPORT BALANCED?
 › Is there a good level of consistency between 
the narrative reporting in the front and the 
financial reporting in the back of the report, 
and does the messaging reflected in each 
remain consistent when read independently 
of each other?
 › Is the Annual Report a document which 
is understandable by shareholders?
 › Are the statutory and adjusted measures 
explained clearly with appropriate prominence?
 › Are the key judgements referred to in the 
narrative reporting and the significant issues 
reported in this Audit Committee Report 
consistent with the disclosures of key estimation 
uncertainties and critical judgements set 
out in the financial statements?
 › How do these compare with the risks that 
Deloitte plan to include in their audit report?
IS THE REPORT UNDERSTANDABLE?
 › Is there a clear and understandable 
framework to the report?
 › Are the important messages highlighted 
appropriately throughout the document?
 › Is the layout clear with good linkage 
throughout in a manner that reflects 
the whole story?
CONCLUSION
Following its review, the Committee was of 
the opinion that the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts is representative of the year and 
presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
overview, providing the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position, 
performance, business model and strategy.
A formal policy is in place in relation to the 
provision of non-audit services by the Auditor 
to ensure that there is adequate protection of 
their independence and objectivity. Inmarsat’s 
policy is to adopt a strict 70% cap for allowable 
non-audit services. To ensure the policy 
is adequately controlled, we adopt several 
processes, which were enforced during 2017. 
Fees charged by Deloitte in respect of non-audit 
services require the prior approval of the Audit 
Committee, except where the fee is less than 
£50,000. Any commitments above this amount 
will require the Audit Committee Chairman’s 
approval. A summary is supplied to the Audit 
Committee at each meeting where amounts 
have been committed below £50,000. Separate 
engagement letters are signed by our CFO 
for each audit and non-audit engagement 
with Deloitte.
No non-audit services for 2017 were received 
from Deloitte compared to $0.2m in 2016. 
A breakdown of the fees paid to Deloitte during 
the year is set out in note 6 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
It is the Company’s practice that it will seek 
quotes from several firms, which may include 
Deloitte, before work on non-audit projects 
is awarded. Contracts are awarded to our 
suppliers based on individual merits. The 
Committee and the Company’s management 
are aware that the level of fees paid to Deloitte 
for non-audit services compared to audit 
services was significantly higher several years 
ago due to work undertaken regarding specialist 
tax advice on certain transactions and has 
worked to ensure that the non-audit fee levels 
have reduced over the last few years.
We receive advice from other firms for 
specific projects and other long-term projects. 
We have continued to use PwC, KPMG and EY 
for various projects – some are new projects 
and some have been continuing for several 
years. Areas where we have used other 
firms relate to the new IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 
standards and undertaking a review of our 
current accounting standards manual. 
We also use different firms to support us 
on VAT and ad hoc PAYE issues.
FAIR, BALANCED AND 
UNDERSTANDABLE
When forming its opinion as to whether the 
Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced 
and understandable, the Committee reflected 
on the information it had received and its 
discussions throughout the year.
EXTERNAL AUDITOR
The Financial Reporting Council issued a guide 
for Audit Committees to help them evaluate 
auditor effectiveness. There are several criteria 
included within the report and the Committee 
is in the process of completing its work on this 
assessment for the most recent audit work using 
as a gauge for this the effectiveness guidelines 
provided by Deloitte. The Committee receives 
inputs from different sources such as the 
Auditors themselves, as well as management and 
the input from the members of the Committee 
which assisted it to determine that the Auditor 
and its work were effective. At each of the Audit 
Committee meetings, the Auditor would report 
on any issues it perceived related to quality 
control and where it thought judgements had 
been applied by management and if it agreed 
with these, or offered an alternative view if 
appropriate. The findings and reports from 
the Auditor help the Audit Committee make 
any assessments about the need to update 
processes or undertake further review 
work on any particular issues.
Deloitte LLP were reappointed at the 2017 
Annual General Meeting and will also be put 
forward for reappointment at the 2018 Annual 
General Meeting. Under the EU directive, Deloitte 
are now capable of being reappointed for a further 
10 years after the retender (2016), however 
shareholder approval will be required each year.
Auditor objectivity and independence is 
safeguarded through a variety of mechanisms. 
To ensure the Auditor’s independence, the 
Committee annually reviews the Company’s 
relationship with Deloitte and receives 
summaries at each Audit Committee meeting 
from the Auditor as to their independence. 
The Committee concluded that it continues to 
have an objective and professional relationship 
with Deloitte and that there are sufficient controls 
and processes in place to ensure the required 
level of independence. The External Auditor is 
required to change the audit partner responsible 
for the Group audit every five years. In the prior 
year, a new audit partner was identified and took 
over as the lead for the 2016 reporting period 
after Deloitte’s successful reappointment. During 
the year, Deloitte charged the Group $1.2m 
(2016: $1.1m) for audit and audit-related services.
NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Company’s Auditor may also be used 
to provide specialist advice where, as a result 
of their position as Auditor, they either must, or 
are best placed to, perform the work in question.

INVESTOR COMMUNICATION 
CHANNELS
The Board is responsible for ensuring 
that a consistent and open dialogue with 
shareholders is maintained, with the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Head of Investor Relations being the Company’s 
principal representatives with the investment 
community. Furthermore, the Chairman, 
Andrew Sukawaty, and Senior Independent 
Director, Dr Abe Peled, are available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which 
cannot be raised through the normal channels 
or if such concerns have not been resolved.
In total, senior management participated 
in over 500 meetings or conference calls 
with buy side and sell side institutions in 
2017, both in the equity and debt markets, 
including existing shareholders and 
potential shareholders.
The Board obtains feedback from senior 
management as well as from its joint 
corporate brokers, J.P. Morgan Cazenove 
and Credit Suisse, and financial advisors, 
Oakley Advisory, on the views of institutional 
investors on a non-attributed and attributed 
basis. As a matter of routine, the Board receives 
regular reports on issues relating to share price 
and trading activity, and details of movements 
in institutional investor shareholdings. The 
Board is also regularly provided with current 
analyst opinions and forecasts.
COMMUNICATING WITH THE 
INVESTMENT COMMUNITY
Given the importance placed by the Company 
in communicating with our investors, we seek 
to maintain a regular and open dialogue with 
current equity shareholders, potential equity 
investors, debt investors and sell side and 
credit analysts through a comprehensive 
investor relations programme.
This programme is based around investor and 
analyst presentations by senior management, 
covering the full year and interim results (in 
person), and quarterly results announcements 
(by webcast and conference call). The shareholder 
communication programme incorporates the 
AGM, investor roadshow meetings, investor 
conference participation as well as presentations 
to analysts and investment banks’ equity sales 
teams. Management participated in meetings 
with investment communities in the UK, 
the U.S. and in Europe in 2017.
The key objective of the Company’s investor 
communication programme is to ensure that 
the investment community continues to have 
a comprehensive and clear understanding of 
the various dynamics and elements relating to 
Inmarsat’s business, market environment, strategy, 
operational performance and future outlook.
The Board is aware that institutional 
shareholders and bondholders may be in more 
regular contact with the Company than other 
shareholders, but care is exercised to ensure 
that any price-sensitive information is released 
to all shareholders, institutional and private, 
at the same time in accordance with the 
Financial Conduct Authority requirements.

will now be assessed on an independent basis, 
ie there will no longer be an opportunity 
to ‘offset’ any underperformance against 
one measure with outperformance against 
the other. Secondly, payout for target 
performance will be reduced from 100% to 
80% of maximum, and a stretch target will 
be introduced, the achievement of which 
will be required for full payout. The Committee, 
Company Chairman and the Executive Directors 
wanted to acknowledge the strong views 
of some shareholders on this matter quickly 
and decisively. We therefore took the decision 
to apply these changes on a retrospective 
basis to awards made to Executive Directors 
in 2017, as well as to future awards.
The Committee engaged with major 
shareholders and proxy advisors on these 
changes prior to the 2018 AGM, and received 
strong support. During consultation, we also 
received comments from some shareholders 
around the current mix of performance 
measures in our incentive plans and these 
have already been reported back to the 
Remuneration Committee. We intend 
to review this area more fully during 2018, 
and will consult again ahead of making 
any 	 si gni fi cant 	 c h an ge s . 	 W e 	 t h ank 	 o ur	
shareholders for your valued input into 
the engagement process and continued 
support for the Company, and remain

were not met and therefore there was no vesting 
for that portion of the PSA.
The Committee took careful account of the 
external environment when reviewing Executive 
Director salaries for the year; a 2% increase was 
applied, in line with RPI and below the average 
increase across the Company. The 2017 single 
figures 	 for	 total	 remuneration	 are	 down	 20%	
for the CEO and 15% for the CFO compared

the BSA arrangements retrospectively for 2017 , 
and the fall in the Company’s share price.
CHANGES TO BSA
As a reminder, we undertook a remuneration 
review in 2016, and at the 2017 AGM put forward 
a revised Remuneration Policy for shareholder 
approval. The new Policy was approved with 
over 90% votes in favour, but the advisory vote 
for the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration 
received just over 51% support. As a Board, 
we take seriously the views of our shareholders, 
and in light of the voting outcome, the Committee 
commenced a fresh review of the Company’s 
approach to remuneration and spent considerable 
time engaging with shareholders during 2017 
and early in 2018. The review focused on the BSA, 
which was the main area of shareholder concern.

we had received, and are making two key 
changes to the implementation of the BSA.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2017.
During 2017, the Company has made steady 
progress	 against	 plan	 in	 terms	 of	 both	 financial 	
performance and achievement of strategic 
objectives, which has positioned us well for 
the future. However, at the same time, we have 
experienced	 a	 significant 	 decline	 in	 our	 share	
price, driven in part by the market’s view of 
the satellite sector. The Committee has taken 
a holistic view of performance and made 
its decision to ensure that pay outcomes for 
Executive Directors this year have appropriately 
taken into account the progress made against 
o ur 	 fi n an c i al 	 an d 	 st rate gic 	 o bje c t i ve s 	 as 	 w e l l	
as the decline in share price.

achieved despite the impact of the costs of 
the workforce reduction exercise during 2017. 
We chose to retain these costs as part of this 
year’s operating costs. This has the impact 
of lowering the outcome of both the BSA 
and annual cash bonus.
There is also partial vesting under the 2015 
Performance Share Award plan (‘PSA’) for 
the delivery of the strategic objectives portion

REMUNERATION DECISIONS 
IN 2017
Based on 2017 performance, the CEO and 
the CFO will receive annual cash bonuses 
of 82% and 88% of salary, respectively. The 
b o n u s e s 	 r e fl e ct 	 b o th 	 the 	 fi na n ci a l 	 pe r f o rma n c e	
of the Company and the individual contributions 
made by each of the Executive Directors 
over the last year. Based on performance and 
taking into account the changes set out above, 
81% of the 2017 BSA will be awarded in March 
2018 and will vest in equal tranches in March 
2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to continued 
employment. Summaries of performance 
against bonus and BSA targets are included 
on pages 87 and 88.
Based on performance to 31 December 2017, 
30% of the share award made under the 2015 
PSA will vest in March 2018, driven by strong 
progress against long-term strategic targets. 
We introduced strategic objectives in the 
PSA in 2015 as we believed it was important 
for management to be focused on delivering 
critical strategic programmes, which would 
in turn drive long-term shareholder value 
creation. The Committee considered strategic 
performance over the three-year period, 
including quantitative and qualitative 
outcomes; detailed information is set out 
on page 89.
After taking into account overall performance 
against the individual strategic objectives, 
as well as taking a holistic view of the Company’s 
performance over the period, 30% out of 40% 
will vest for strategic performance. Targets 
for the relative TSR (30% of total award) and 
EBITDA (30% of total award) elements were 
not met and as such there will be no vesting 
for either element.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
REMUNERATION POLICY  
IN 2018
For 2018, the maximum annual bonus 
opportunity will remain 125% of salary. The 
fi na n ci a l 	 e l e me nt 	 of 	 the 	 b o n us 	 ( re pre s e nti ng	
70% of maximum) will continue to be measured 
by reference to EBITDA and revenue. The element 
on personal performance and contribution 
will continue to be weighted 30% of maximum.
BSA opportunities for 2018 will remain 185% 
and 175% of salary for the CEO and the CFO, 
respectively. Payout will continue to be linked 
to the achievement of EBITDA (67% of total 
award) and revenue (33%) targets. The two 
measures will be considered independently, 
and payout for target performance will 
be reduced to 80% of maximum, with 60% 
payout delivered for threshold performance 
and full payout for stretch performance.
No changes are proposed to award levels 
or performance measurement for the PSA 
for 2018. The CEO and the CFO will receive 
awards of 185% and 175% of salary, respectively. 
Vesting will continue to be based on relative 
TSR against the constituents of the 
FTSE 50-150 excluding investment trusts 
(30% of total award), EBITDA (30%) and 
the 	 d e l i ve r y 	 of 	 spe ci fi c 	 stra te g i c 	 o bj e c ti ve s	
considered key drivers to our future success 
(40%). A two-year holding period, which 
was introduced to awards starting in 2017, 
will apply to vested PSA shares, during 
which time shares may not be sold except 
to cover taxes.
Further detail on the implementation of our 
Policy for 2018 is included on pages 93 to 95.
SUMMARY
I would like to thank shareholders for their 
input during the year, and my fellow members 
of the Remuneration Committee and all the 
Non-Executive Directors for their valuable 
contribution to the remuneration agenda for 
2017 and discussions held in 2018. I hope we 
can count on shareholders’ support at the 
2018 AGM, where I will be available to respond 
to any questions shareholders may have on 
this report or in relation to the Committee’s 
activities. As always, I am available to meet 
and discuss our remuneration arrangements 
with shareholders.
SIMON BAX  
CHAIRMAN,  
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

WE REFLECTED ON SHAREHOLDERS’ 
COMMENTS AND ARE MAKING TWO KEY 
CHANGES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THE BONUS SHARE AWARD
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 78 Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Policy
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was approved by a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 Annual General Meeting and took effect from the 
date of the AGM. This section presents the full Policy, for ease of reference. The sections presented are as disclosed in the 2016 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, save the following changes:
 › Payout	 profile 	 for	 the	 BSA	 has	 been	 updated	 to	 refl ect 	 the	 reduced	 payout	 at	 target	 and	 the	 addition	 of	 a	 stretch	 level	 of	 per formance
 › Refe re n ce s 	 to 	 fi na n ci a l 	 ye a r s 	 ha ve 	 be e n 	 upd a te d 	 w he re 	 ap pro pr i a te
 › Pay	 scenario	 char ts	 have	 been	 updated	 to	 refl ect 	 the	 latest	 salaries	 and
 › Details of current Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment
The Group’s Remuneration Policy is designed to deliver rewards that enable it to attract, retain and motivate talent of the highest appropriate quality, 
linking	 rewards	 to	 the	 achievement	 of	 financial 	 and	 strategic	 goals	 of	 the	 Group.	 When	 determining	 Remuneration	 Policy ,	 we	 take	 into	 account	 all	 factors	
which we deem necessary, including the Group’s overall business strategy, business performance in the current year and expectations for future years 
as incorporated into our Long Range Business Plan (‘LRBP’), pay arrangements in the wider Inmarsat workforce, and the global economic situation. 
Where appropriate, we will consult with shareholders in advance of major changes in the Remuneration Policy or where we consider there are material 
changes to individual remuneration arrangements. The Committee is committed to the principle that the Company should pay at the appropriate 
level to recruit and retain executives, and incentivise them to achieve the Company’s objectives which will create value for shareholders.
How does this link to strategy What happens in practice What amounts can be paid How do we assess performance
BASIC SALARY
Paying market-competitive 
base salaries, commensurate 
with the individual’s role, 
responsibilities and experience, 
allows us to recruit and retain 
Executive Directors of the 
calibre required to implement 
our strategy.
Salaries are reviewed annually with any increase 
generally made in July or following a material change 
in responsibilities. The Committee will determine 
any increases to be made.
Any increase is determined by a formal appraisal 
by the Committee, taking into account market pay 
levels, a review of salaries against companies of 
similar size, complexity and type, Group performance, 
as well as the remuneration arrangements operated 
throughout the Group, with reference to UK-based 
employees in particular for pay comparison levels.
Salary increases will be applied in line with 
the outcome of an annual salary review.
The maximum annual salary increase 
will normally be in line with the average 
increase applied to the UK workforce. 
However, larger increases may be 
awarded in certain circumstances 
including, but not limited to, an increase 
in scope or responsibility of the role; 
to apply salary progression for a 
newly appointed Director; where the 
Director’s salary has fallen behind 
market positioning. Where increases 
are awarded in excess of that for the UK 
employee population, the Committee 
will provide the rationale in the relevant 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Based on Company performance 
and individual contribution.
BENEFITS IN KIND
We provide cost-effective 
benefits which support the 
wellbeing of employees.
Provision of death, long-term sickness and medical 
and dental insurance cover (which can include 
spouse and dependents cover). Life assurance 
of four times salary, paid holiday and medical 
check-ups are also provided.
If required, the Company would provide access 
to independent financial and legal advice on a 
case-by-case basis.
Provision of other reasonable benefits in the 
event of relocation, eg temporary accommodation 
and other related costs will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.
These benefits are non-pensionable.
The benefits provided may vary 
by role and levels of cover provided 
will reflect market practice and 
the individual circumstances of the 
Executive Directors.
It is not anticipated that the current 
cost of benefits (as set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration) 
would increase materially over the 
period for which this Policy will apply.
The Committee retains the 
discretion to approve a higher 
cost in exceptional circumstances 
(eg relocation) or in circumstances 
where factors outside the Company’s 
control have changed materially.
Not applicable.
PENSION
We provide defined 
contribution pension 
arrangements, or  
cash in lieu of pension.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate 
in the Company’s defined contribution pension plan 
arrangements or other similar pension plans as 
appropriate to the Executive Director’s nationality 
or location. The Company also operates an auto-
enrolment pension scheme which an Executive Director 
could participate in instead of the main pension plan.
Contributions are based on a percentage of salary 
which is currently limited to a pensions cap.
Maximum employer contributions are 
currently 12.5% of the capped salary 
under the terms of the UK pension plan.
The Committee may review pension 
contribution levels in the future. 
Any increase in contributions would 
not result in a pension contribution 
in excess of 20% of the uncapped 
basic salary.
Not applicable.

ANNUAL CASH BONUS
We provide an annual 
bonus to incentivise the 
achievement of annual 
financial and operational 
goals in line with Group 
strategy.
Performance metrics are 
selected to support the 
annual business strategy 
which we believe also 
lead to enhancement 
of shareholder value.
Bonus payment levels are determined by the 
Committee annually by reference to performance 
against targets set at the start of the financial year. 
Personal objectives are set annually by the Committee.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee 
has the ability to exercise discretion to override the 
formulaic bonus outcome within the limits of the 
scheme where it believes the outcome is not truly 
reflective of performance, and to reflect the actual 
delivery of value to shareholders. Any discretionary 
adjustments will be detailed in the following year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
The Committee may exercise its discretion to claw 
back bonuses in certain exceptional circumstances 
which may include (but are not limited to) gross 
misconduct, fraud or a significant downward 
revision of the financial results of the Group.
Maximum opportunity:
 › 125% of salary
Threshold and Target opportunity:
 › 0% and 75% of salary respectively
Bonus is based on achievement 
of annual financial and personal 
objectives.
The personal element will not 
be weighted more than 30% 
of the total in any year.
Details of the measures and 
weightings applicable for the 
financial year under review are 
provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
The Committee may change 
the measures used if other 
measures are deemed more 
suitable to allow delivery of 
the Company’s strategy.
BONUS SHARE AWARD (‘BSA’)
We provide the opportunity 
to participate in the BSA 
as it links the delivery of 
short-term financial and 
operational performance 
to sustained shareholder 
value creation.
Participation in the BSA 
reinforces continued 
delivery of the LRBP as 
vesting of shares occurs 
over three years after 
performance has  
been tested.
We make annual allocations of conditional shares 
which are confirmed the following year, subject to 
achievement of agreed annual performance targets. 
The resulting shares vest over the subsequent three 
years, subject to continued employment.
Additional shares in lieu of accrued dividends over 
the vesting period are awarded only on the number 
of shares that vest.
Unvested awards and vested awards that have 
not yet been transferred to the Executive Director 
are subject to adjustment for malus and clawback, 
ie forfeiture or reduction in exceptional circumstances. 
Such circumstances may include (but are not limited 
to) gross misconduct, fraud or a significant downward 
revision of the previously reported financial results 
of the Group.
Maximum opportunity for all Executive 
Directors is up to 200% of salary 
(300% in exceptional circumstances, 
as permitted in the Executive Share 
Plan Rules).
Threshold and Target performance 
result in 60% and 80% conversion 
of the monetary award into shares, 
respectively.
The Committee sets annual 
performance measures 
(currently based on the same 
financial objectives as for 
the annual cash bonus plan) 
and may change these 
for future awards as it 
considers appropriate.
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD (‘PSA’)
We believe the PSA aligns 
executives’ interests with 
long-term shareholder 
value creation through 
rewarding the delivery 
of a mix of financial and 
strategic measures.
The performance measures 
in the PSA reflect the value 
drivers in the LRBP.
We make annual awards of conditional shares, 
which vest after a minimum of three years subject 
to performance over a three-year period.
A mandatory two-year holding period applies 
to vested awards commencing with the award to 
be made in 2017.
Additional shares in lieu of accrued dividends over 
the vesting period are awarded only on the number 
of shares that vest.
Unvested awards are subject to adjustment for malus 
and clawback, ie forfeiture or reduction in exceptional 
circumstances. Such circumstances may include 
(but are not limited to) gross misconduct, fraud or 
a significant downward revision of the previously 
reported financial results of the Group. 
Maximum opportunity for all 
Executive Directors is up to 200% 
of salary (300% in exceptional 
circumstances, as permitted in 
the Executive Share Plan Rules).
Threshold performance will result 
in the vesting of 30%/0%/0% 
of the maximum award under the  
TSR/EBITDA/strategic performance 
elements (which are the current 
performance measures being used).
The performance measures 
and respective weightings may 
vary year-on-year to reflect 
strategic priorities, and will 
include a financial measure. 
Strategic measures, if included, 
will not be weighted more than 
40% of the total award in 
any year.
Details of the measures and 
weightings applicable for the 
financial year under review are 
provided in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. Changes to 
weightings and performance 
targets will be retrospectively 
explained to shareholders.
EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
To encourage share 
ownership across all 
employees as allowed 
by HMRC and relevant 
local laws.
We operate employee share savings plans 
for our global workforce where, depending 
on location, savings periods of between 
two and three years operate.
We will look at opportunities to offer other 
employee share plans in the future.
Participation levels set by HMRC or 
relevant local laws from time to time.
Not applicable.
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 80 Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report PAYMENTS FROM EXISTING VARIABLE PAY AWARDS
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made 
prior to the approval of the 2017 Remuneration Policy, eg awards made 
under the 2014 Policy. Any commitment made which is consistent with the 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time the commitment was made will be 
honoured, even when it is not consistent with the Policy prevailing at the time 
such	 commitment	 is	 fulfilled . 	 Details	 of	 any	 such	 outstanding	 share	 awards	
to Executive Directors are provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SELECTION
Our incentive plans (excluding restricted share awards and all-employee 
s h ar e 	 p l an s ) 	 al l 	 i nc lude 	 fi n anc i al 	 p er f or m anc e 	 r equir em en t s . 	 P er f or m anc e	
targets are set to be stretching, taking into account the Company’s 
strategic priorities and the economic environment in which the Company 
operates. Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points 
including the Group’s LRBP, the market in which the Company operates, 
the expected performance of competitors in these same markets, broker 
forecasts and latest internal forecasts. Achievement of these targets 
delivers to shareholders the value inherent in the LRBP.
The	 annual	 cash	 bonus	 plan	 and	 BSA	 reflect 	 the	 financial 	 targets	 which	 the	
Board	 believes	 are	 key	 to	 driving	 the	 business.	 Revenue	 and	 EBI T DA	 reflect 	
the 	 u nd e r l y i ng 	 fi na n ci a l 	 succe s s 	 of 	 the 	 b usi ne s s 	 a nd 	 sup p o r t 	 the 	 a n n u a l	
business strategy as well as value creation for Inmarsat’s shareholders.
The PSA currently has three performance requirements, which are 
EBITDA growth, the Company’s total shareholder return performance 
against the FTSE 50-150 excluding investment trusts, and delivery of 
strategic objectives. All three performance metrics are linked to our 
long-term business strategy, and support shareholder value creation.
The Committee retains the ability to adjust and/or set different 
performance measures following a corporate event (such as a change 
in strategy, a material acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business) 
o r 	 a 	 si g n i fi ca nt 	 cha ng e 	 i n 	 pre va i l i ng 	 ma r k et 	 co nd i tio ns 	 e i the r 	 spe ci fi c 	
to the Company’s sector or macro-economic events which causes the 
Committee to determine that the measures are no longer appropriate and 
that amendment is required so that they achieve their original purpose.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Inmarsat Group are determined 
on the same principles as for remunerating Executive Directors, in that 
reward	 should	 suppor t	 our	 business	 strategy.	 It	 should	 be	 suf ficient 	 to	
attract and retain high-performing individuals.
As a global business we accept that there may be different local arrangements 
that are appropriate to apply but, overall, this principle applies across the 
different geographies in which we operate. Employees receive variable pay 
which gives them incentives appropriate to their role in the organisation 
and	 is	 refl ective 	 of	 how	 we	 deal	 with	 E xecutive	 Directors	 too.
In general, the remuneration policy and principles which apply to other 
senior executives is consistent with that set out in this report for Executive 
Directors. All employees participate in bonus schemes. Group senior 
executives are eligible to participate in the BSA and some also participate 
i n 	 the 	 P S A . 	 T he 	 B S A 	 ma y 	 f ro m 	 ti me 	 to 	 ti me 	 o pe ra te 	 w i th 	 d i v i sio n-spe ci fi c 	
targets for some participants and the PSA may have slightly different 
performance measures in place than those used for the Executive 
Directors, as appropriate.
All employees are eligible to participate in employee share plans which are 
generally the UK Sharesave Scheme, Employee Share Participation Plan 
(for U.S. and Canadian employees) or an equivalent international plan. 
Participation is on generally the same terms subject to local regulations.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
The guideline for Executive Directors is that they hold Company shares 
equivalent	 to	 fi ve 	 times	 base	 salar y.	 For	 the	 purpose	 of	 this	 guideline,	
sha re s 	 o w ne d 	 i n cl u d e s 	 be ne fi ci a l l y 	 o w ne d 	 sha re s 	 a nd 	 sha re s 	 tha t	
are unvested and subject to continued employment only, under the 
BSA and PSA plans.
For new Executive Directors, we would expect the individual to build 
up	 a	 shareholding	 to	 the	 fi ve 	 times	 guideline	 over	 a	 period	 of	 time,	
generally	 within	 fi ve 	 to	 seven	 years .
PAY SCENARIO CHARTS FOR THE CEO AND CFO
The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward 
opportunities for the two current Executive Directors (CEO and CFO), 
and the potential split between the different elements of pay under three 
different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘Target’, and ‘Maximum’. 
Potential reward opportunities are based on Inmarsat’s current incentive 
opportunities, applied to salaries as at 1 January 2018. Note that the 
projected values exclude the impact of any share price movement.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
In the event we hire a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the approved Remuneration Policy.
In determining appropriate remuneration arrangements on hiring a new Executive Director, we will take into consideration all relevant factors (including 
but not limited to current remuneration, the type of remuneration arrangements for other Inmarsat executives, external market data and the jurisdiction 
the candidate was recruited from and may be based in) to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of both our Company and its shareholders. 
The Remuneration Policy in place will apply to the new appointment unless there are variables to the appointment which are noted below and are 
agreed by the Committee as appropriate to offer.
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to ‘buy-out’ remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. 
In doing so, we will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted 
(for example, cash or shares), the time over which they would have vested and the share price at the time of buy-out. Generally buy-out awards will be made 
on a comparable basis. The Committee has the discretion to determine whether such buy-outs shall be granted as Bonus Share Awards, Performance 
Share Awards or Restricted Share Awards under the ESP. The Committee may also avail itself of the provision in the Listing Rules (Chapter 9.4.2) 
regarding long-term incentive awards in relation to the buy-out of awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
Component Approach Maximum annual value
Basic salary To be determined by reference to relevant market pay levels, experience and skills 
of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent  
in the role.
Pension and benefits To be eligible to receive benefits in line with the current Policy, and as well as any 
expatriation allowances and any necessary expenses relating to an Executive 
Director’s relocation on appointment.
Sharesave Scheme To be entitled to participate on identical terms to other employees.
Annual cash bonus The scheme as described in the Policy table will apply to new appointees. 
The Committee will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the executive on 
joining the Company will receive the full annual payment or a pro-rata amount.
125% of salary
Bonus Share Awards To participate in annual awards on the same terms as other Executive Directors, 
as described in the Policy table.
The Committee will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the executive on 
joining the Company will receive the full annual allocation or a pro-rata amount.
Up to 200% of salary  
(300% in exceptional circumstances)
Performance Share Awards To participate in annual awards on the same terms as other Executive Directors, 
as described in the Policy table.
The Committee will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the executive on 
joining the Company will receive the full annual award or a pro-rata amount.
Up to 200% of salary  
(300% in exceptional circumstances)
Restricted Share Awards To make awards of shares which vest in accordance with a schedule agreed by the 
Committee, subject to continued employment only. Awards will typically be made to 
facilitate the ‘buy-out’ of awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer, and the 
vesting schedule will typically match that of the awards forfeited. Additional shares 
in lieu of accrued dividends over the vesting period are awarded only on the 
number of shares that vest.
Up to 200% of salary  
(300% in exceptional circumstances)
INTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Any individual who is promoted to become an Executive Director will be treated on the same basis as if they were an external hire in respect of the elements 
of 	 re m u ne ra tio n 	 a nd 	 be ne fi t s . 	 W he re 	 the 	 new 	 ap p o i nte e 	 has 	 a n 	 i n i ti a l 	 s a l a r y 	 s et 	 be lo w 	 ma r k et , 	 a ny 	 sh o r t fa l l 	 w i l l 	 be 	 ma na g e d 	 w i th 	 phas e d 	 i n cre as e s 	 ove r	
a period of several years, subject to the executive’s development in the role. Such individuals are also eligible to receive payment from any award made 
prior to their appointment to the Board.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS AND EXIT PAYMENT POLICY
Executive Director Date of service contract Term of office Notice period
Rupert Pearce 18 January 2012 Indefinite until termination by either party 12 months’ written notice by Company 
or Director
Tony Bates 21 February 2014 Indefinite until termination by either party 12 months’ written notice by Company and 
six months’ written notice by the Director
The Company in its absolute discretion may agree a shorter notice period with the departing Director. All Directors have a clause to allow a payment 
in lieu of notice to be made. For the Executive Directors, the Company may make such payments monthly (up to 12 months) and these payments shall 
be 	 re d uce d 	 i f 	 the 	 e xe cu ti ve 	 fi nds 	 a l te r na ti ve 	 e m ploy me nt .

Committee believes this is unreasonable given the circumstances for departure or unless dictated by applicable law.
The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith:
 › In discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or
 › B y	 way	 of	 settlement	 or	 compromise	 of	 any	 claim	 arising	 in	 connection	 with	 the	 termination	 of	 a	 Director ’s	 of fice 	 or	 employment
The Committee retains discretion to determine appropriate bonus amounts and vesting of share-based awards, as well as the timing of vesting, taking 
into consideration the circumstances in which an Executive Director leaves. The rationale for any discretion if exercised will be provided in the following 
year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Annual bonus
Good leaver

are treated as owned by the individual and are subject to clawback provisions.
RSA
Good leaver

Any outstanding awards will be pro-rated for time.
All other reasons Awards lapse. Not applicable.
Employee Share Plans

(see below for definition)
Share options can be exercised for a 
certain period of time after departure.
The individual will be entitled to exercise his share options in accordance 
with HMRC approved rules or local equivalent rules.
All other reasons Awards lapse. Not applicable.
A ‘good leaver’ is the departure of an Executive Director for reasons of ill health, redundancy, retirement, death or any other reason which the 
Committee in its absolute discretion permits. Termination for cause is regarded as a bad leaver and no awards shall vest.
Upon a change of control of the Company, share awards may be transferred to participants in accordance with the Executive Share Plan Rules, 
based on the extent to which the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met. For the annual bonus, the Committee 
will assess performance against targets at the point of change of control and any resulting bonus will be pro-rated for time and paid immediately. 
T he 	 fi na l 	 tre a tme nt 	 fo r 	 the 	 a n n u a l 	 b o n us 	 re ma i ns 	 subj e c t 	 to 	 the 	 Co m m i t te e ’ s 	 d i s cretio n .
In the event that the Company terminates an Executive Director’s service contract other than in accordance with the terms of his contract, 
the Committee will act in the best interests of the Company and ensure there is no reward for failure. When determining what compensation, if any, 
is to be paid to the departing Executive Director, the Committee will give full consideration to the circumstances of the termination, the Executive 
Director’s performance, the terms of the service contract relating to notice and payments in lieu of notice, and the obligation of the Executive Director 
(where it is in the service agreement) to mitigate any loss which he may suffer as a result.
Although the Company would seek to minimise termination costs, the Committee may in appropriate circumstances provide other elements in 
a leaving Executive Director’s termination package, including (without limitation) compensation for the waiver of statutory rights in exchange for 
him executing a settlement agreement, payment of the departing Executive Director’s legal fees in connection with his termination arrangements, 
and payment of outplacement fees. In addition, the Committee may determine that the Director should continue to be engaged by the Company 
on a consultancy arrangement or other terms following cessation of his directorship.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
For the recruitment of a new Non-Executive Director (‘NED’), the individual will receive a letter of appointment which will summarise the time requirement 
expected of them and set out details of their fees (base fee and Committee membership fee). Fees will be the same level as for other NEDs, except where 
the Nominations Committee determines that a different level is appropriate based on individual contribution.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum
NED fees To attract and retain 
high-calibre NEDs 
by offering a market 
competitive fee level
The NEDs are paid a basic fee.
The Committee Chairmen and other members of the Board Committees 
(Audit, Remuneration, Nominations and Telecoms Regulatory Committees) 
and the Senior Independent Director are paid supplements to reflect their 
additional responsibilities.
The Chairman of the Board will be paid a single fee for all his responsibilities, 
and receive healthcare cover.
NED fee levels are reviewed periodically by the Chairman and Executive Directors with 
reference to market levels in comparably sized FTSE companies and a recommendation 
is then made to the Board. The Chairman’s fee is reviewed by the Committee taking 
into account fee levels at the same set of companies, and is then approved by 
the Board. If any changes are to be made, they are usually effective in July.
To avoid setting expectations, 
there is no maximum fee level.
The maximum annual aggregate 
fee for all Group NEDs is £1,000,000, 
as set out in the Company’s Articles

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 84 Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
Executive Directors serving as Non-Executive Directors on the Board 
of other companies are permitted to retain all remuneration and fees 
earned from outside directorships subject to a maximum of two external 
Board appointments. Directors accepting such positions shall take into 
account any guidelines for external directorships as contained in the UK

CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE 
IN THE COMPANY
Although we do not consult directly with employees on executive 
Remuneration Policy, the Committee takes into consideration the 
remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in 
making its decisions on remuneration for senior executives. This relates 
to our philosophy around levels of base salary, operating bonus plans 
fo r 	 a l l 	 e m ploye e s , 	 pe nsio n 	 e nti tl e me nt 	 a nd 	 prov i sio n 	 of 	 be ne fi t s 	 a l s o	
being available across the Group. With the upcoming proposal from 
the UK Financial Reporting Council for greater employee engagement 
expected to be implemented during 2018, the Company is already 
considering how it will respond to this to ensure a productive and 
supportive environment for such dialogue to occur and will report 
on it in the 2018 Annual Report.
The Group already consults with its employees on general employment 
policies in a range of ways, including formal consultation forums in 
some countries where it operates. Our staff are encouraged to provide 
feedback directly to their line managers or to the HR team or to 
a 	 co n fi de nt ial 	 e m ai l 	 addre s s 	 w hic h 	 w i l l 	 re ce i ve 	 que r i e s 	 o n 	 al l 	 is sue s	
including anti-bribery.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
When determining remuneration, the Committee considers shareholder 
views and the guidelines of investor bodies. The Remuneration Committee 
Chairman, Company Chairman, Senior Independent Director and 
Company Secretary engage proactively with major shareholders and 
shareholder representatives whenever appropriate. The Committee is 
always open to feedback from shareholders on its Remuneration Policy 
or individual arrangements, and is committed to consulting shareholders 
in advance of major changes. Details of votes cast for and against the 
resolution to approve last year’s Annual Report on Remuneration are 
provided in the Annual Report on Remuneration section of this Report.

ADVISORS
During 2017, the Committee was advised internally by Andrew Sukawaty (Chairman), Rupert Pearce (CEO), Tony Bates (CFO), Alison Horrocks 
(Chief	 Corporate	 Af fairs	 Of ficer 	 and	 Company	 Secretar y),	 Natasha	 Dillon	 (Chief	 People	 Of ficer) 	 and	 Matt	 Smith	 (Head	 of	 Reward).	 Dr	 Abe	 Peled,	
the Senior Independent Director, also attended meetings. No member of management is present at a Committee meeting when their own 
arrangements are being discussed.
Mercer Kepler was appointed by the Committee after consultation with the Board in September 2012 following a tendering process, and has continued 
to act as the Committee’s independent external advisor during the year. Mercer Kepler reports directly to the Committee Chairman and is a signatory 
of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Mercer Kepler provides 
no non-remuneration-related services to the Company and is therefore considered independent. Mercer Kepler’s parent, the MMC Group, provides 
unrelated services to the Company in the areas of pension investment advice and actuarial services to the Trustee to the Inmarsat UK Pension Plan. 
During 2017, Mercer Kepler’s fees were based on time and materials, and fees in relation to advice to the Committee (excluding VAT and expenses) 
totalled £49,520 (2016: £84,250).

In light of the voting outcome on the Annual Report on Remuneration, the Committee commenced a fresh review of the Company’s approach to 
remuneration, focusing on the Bonus Share Award plan, which was the main area which drew shareholder comment. The Committee spent considerable 
time reviewing the operation of the plan and concluded that whilst the BSA has served both the Company and the shareholders well since its adoption 
on	 IP O	 in	 2005,	 some	 aspects	 of	 it	 could	 be	 clarified 	 and	 improved .
Two key changes to the implementation of the BSA have therefore been made, to be applied retrospectively to the award made in March 2017 as well 
as in future years. Firstly, performance against each measure is now assessed on an independent basis, ie there will no longer be an opportunity to ‘offset’ 
any underperformance against one measure with outperformance against the other. Secondly, payout for target performance is reduced from 100% 
to 80% of maximum, and a stretch target is introduced, the achievement of which is required for full payout. Payout for threshold performance remains 
60% of maximum as set out in the approved Policy.
The Committee remains committed to ongoing dialogue with shareholders to facilitate the Committee’s understanding of shareholders’ views, 
and shareholders’ understanding of the Company, the environment in which it operates and how this translates into remuneration decisions.

1 Taxable benefits: include healthcare and benefits relating to staff entertaining. The tax due in respect of the staff entertainment benefit is settled by the Company. The Company also reimburses the 
travel costs incurred by Directors for travel to Board meetings where these do not take place in the country in which they are domiciled. These travel expenses are subject to a specific deduction under 
HMRC rules and are not taxable
2 Pension: payment made by the Company as cash in lieu of pension (see page 92 for details)
3 Annual cash bonus: cash bonus payments in relation to the financial years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 (see pages 87 and 90 for details)
4 BSA: values the BSA shares in relation to the financial years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. Performance is tested prior to grant for BSA shares. For 2016, the value is based on the spot share 
price on the grant date (being 9 March 2017) of £7.62. The award value has been revised from last year’s report to reflect the actual share price on grant. For 2017, as the share price on the grant date 
(expected to be around 12 March 2018) is currently unknown, the award is valued using the average share price over the last quarter of 2017 of £5.40
5 PSA: the value at vesting of awards vesting on performance over the three-year periods ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. For 2016, the 2014 PSP is valued based on the spot share price 
on the vesting date of £7.92. The award value has been revised from last year’s report to reflect the actual share price on vesting, plus additional shares representing reinvested dividends. For 2017, 
as the share price on the vesting date is currently unknown, the 2015 PSA is valued using the average share price over the last quarter of 2017 of £5.40
Note: the figures provided for the BSA and PSA awards in the table above have been valued in line with the single figure methodology, and based on share price assumptions at or around the time of grant. 
The actual value received by the individual may differ, as the individual will receive the value of the award only when the award vests and is released at future dates, subject to the individual still being in 
employment on the future vesting dates.
INCENTIVE OUTCOMES FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 (AUDITED)
ANNUAL CASH BONUS IN RESPECT OF 2017 PERFORMANCE
In	 2017 ,	 the	 annual	 cash	 bonus	 was	 based	 on	 the	 achievement	 of	 Group	 financial 	 targets	 and	 individual	 performance	 objectives.	 Financial	 performance	
was measured by reference to revenue (33%) and EBITDA targets (67%). Revenue and EBITDA are two measures which have strong line-of-sight, 
are easily understood and are two of our key reporting metrics to shareholders. The same performance metrics are used in the annual bonus plan for 
all employees. The Committee has the ability to apply up to 30% of the maximum bonus opportunity potential in consideration of the achievement 
of personal objectives.

the targets used are commercially sensitive if made public in the same reporting period to which they apply.
Some of the key personal objectives for the Executive Directors for 2017 are noted below. Some have been excluded where we believe they may be 
commercially sensitive if published.
CEO:
 › Maritime: successful ramp up of Fleet Xpress and transition of XpressLink users to Fleet Xpress
 › Aviation: increased number of airline contract wins and ramping up of installs and service delivery for Global Xpress services
 › Digital:	 created	 new	 digital	 of fice 	 with	 hiring	 of	 Chief	 Digital	 Of ficer 	 with	 a	 focus	 and	 mandate	 on	 digital	 business	 commercialisation
 › China: engaged with local companies to develop manufacturing opportunities across all Inmarsat services
 › Key projects: reviewed technology roadmap to consider business model for Connected Car opportunity and decided not to actively process 
until the market opportunity matured
CFO:
 › Smart pricing: developed new product and pricing architecture and improved pricing process
 › Optimised procurement: instigated a programme to maximise value delivered by procurement activities through cost reduction and avoidance
 › Balance sheet management: ensured improved careful management of overdue receivables, inventory and cash management
 › Key business programmes: introduced new simpler distribution agreements and associated terms and conditions for partners
 › Long-term operational efficiency: implemented new billing system and ERP enhancements
 › Investor relations: focused on increased education of satellite industry to extend shareholder base

BSA IN RESPECT OF 2017 PERFORMANCE
An	 allocation	 of	 shares	 was	 made	 on	 9	 March	 2017	 at	 a	 share	 price	 of	 £ 7 .62	 in	 respect	 of	 the	 March	 2017	 BSA .	 T he	 confirmation 	 of	 these	 awards	 is	
based	 on	 Company	 per formance	 for	 the	 financial 	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2017 .	 67%	 of	 the	 2017	 award	 was	 linked	 to	 E BI T DA	 and	 33 %	 to	 revenue.
Two key changes to the implementation of the BSA have been made for 2017 and future years, in response to shareholder feedback. Performance against 
each measure is now assessed on an independent basis. Further, payout for target performance is reduced from 100% to 80% of maximum, and a stretch 
target is introduced, which needs to be met for full payout. Payout for threshold performance remains 60% as referenced in the Policy. Actual performance 
relative to the targets was as follows:

with Ligado for L -band spectrum usage
The relationship with Ligado has continued to be collaborative with a new significant agreement signed in 2016 
putting in place a new payment profile and arrangement for accessing the spectrum in North America; there was 
a 	 step 	 up 	 fr om 	 $50m 	 p. a . 	 t o 	 c . 	 $ 130m 	 p. a . 	 for 	 agreed 	 periods
The total amount that will vest in 2018, subject to continued employment, will therefore be 30% of the maximum award. Messrs Pearce and Bates will 
receive 33,327 and 25,301 shares respectively, plus dividends reinvested as additional shares which are added to the number of shares that are awarded 
on the vesting date of 30 March 2018.

The Committee also considered the Executive Directors’ achievement of personal objectives during the year (see the 2016 report for disclosure of 
examples of personal objectives for 2016), and payout in respect of personal performance was 27% out of a maximum of 30% of total bonus for both 
the CEO and the CFO. Therefore, the formulaic bonus outcome was 88.3% of salary for both the CEO and the CFO. The Executive Directors volunteered 
a reduction of 3% of target bonus to their bonuses in order to enhance the staff bonus pool to support retention and engagement. The actual 
post -reduction	 bonus	 outcome	 was	 therefore	 86.1%	 of	 salar y.	 T he	 Committee	 believes	 these	 outcomes	 were	 warranted	 and	 reflective 	 of	 Company	
and individual performance in 2016.

Non-financial measure linked to the management of a strategic contract 10% Renegotiation and management of this strategic 
contract were successful with benefits being received by 
the Company through increased annual payments and 
giving the Company protected rights for a further period 
of time. Based on these combined factors, performance 
targets for this element were judged by the Committee 
to have been met in full
Under the previous BSA structure, and as reported in the 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration, the maximum number of shares was awarded for the 
achievement	 of	 target	 per formance,	 and	 per formance	 against	 the	 t wo	 financial 	 measures	 was	 considered	 on	 a	 blended	 basis .	 T his	 had	 been	 the	 first 	
time since the operation of the BSA since Inmarsat became a listed company that there had been a need for consideration of the blended approach 
(as revenue performance was below the level of performance required to deliver 100% of the target). As a result, all of the shares originally allocated in 
March 2016 were awarded in March 2017 , and will vest in equal tranches in March 2018, 2019 and 2020. In response to shareholder comments following 
the publication of the outcome of this award last year, the BSA structure has been revised for 2017 and future years to require independent assessment 
of performance measures and to include stretch targets (see page 88 for further information).

The award levels, which are unchanged from last year, fall within the normal maximum permitted amount of 200% under the Remuneration Policy, 
and were determined taking into account the overall market pay data, and the performance of the Company against its prior year business performance.
Vesting of the awards is dependent on three-year TSR vs. the FTSE 50-150 (excluding investment trusts), three-year EBITDA growth, and achievement of 
specific 	 strategic	 objectives.	 Strategic	 objectives	 were	 first 	 introduced	 as	 a	 performance	 measure	 in	 our	 long-term	 share	 plan	 in	 2015.	 The	 Company	 continues	
to believe that it is important for management to be focused on delivering critical strategic programmes which will drive long-term shareholder value creation. 
T he	 strategic	 objectives	 described	 below	 are	 the	 ones	 identified 	 to	 deliver	 this	 value	 for	 the	 three-year	 period	 to	 31	 December	 2019.	 Relative	 T SR,	 EBI T DA	
and strategic objectives will all be measured over the three years to 31 December 2019 and weighted 30%, 30% and 40%, respectively. There will be no 
re-testing of performance. Performance targets for these awards, and part-cycle updates on achievement against the strategic objectives, are as follows:

Part-cycle update: In 2017 we launched our fourth GX Ka-band satellite successfully and it is operational. 
We have continued to make good progress with GX take-up in maritime, government and aviation sectors. 
The	 Company	 is	 on	 track	 to	 meet	 its	 target	 of	 $500m	 GX	 revenues	 by	 the	 end	 of	 year	 five	 after	 global	 launch
 ›
Aviation: put in place all key building blocks of the aviation business case (to support material revenues 
forecast over the LRBP period)  
Part-cycle update: In 2017 there was double-digit revenue growth reflecting IFC installation revenues 
and strong BGA and SoS growth. We have around 3,000 aircraft in our new business pipeline. I-5 F4 and 
the S-band satellites were successfully launched
 ›
L-band: work assiduously to sustain L -band revenues despite GX migration and both ongoing tight 
budgets and strong competition in all markets  
Part-cycle update: Our Enterprise Business Unit has focused on new business segments such as 
transportation to identify future revenue growth and our Government business continued to open new 
country market opportunities and secured new contracts in the U.S. We opened, with BSNL our partner 
in India, a GSPS gateway and see additional opportunities in this market. We have seen increased 
competition and also experienced faster migration of our FleetBroadband service to Fleet Xpress
 ›
Strategic contract: maximise the overall net contribution of the contract to Inmarsat  
Part-cycle update: Our focus has been to continue to operate collaboratively and in a focused way to 
maintain the benefits of this contract and we have delivered a material increase in contract revenues
Achievement against strategic objectives will be considered as a whole. There are specific objectives within 
each area, and further details of the objectives and key achievements will be disclosed in detail at the end of

The current employer contributions to the pension scheme (subject to the cap of £149,400 for the 2016/17 tax year and £153,600 for the 2017/18 
tax year) are 12.5% of capped salary. The current arrangement is to pay 12.5% of capped salary, with the capped salary level increasing nominally 
each year.
Neither	 Mr	 Pearce	 nor	 Mr	 Bates	 is	 a	 member	 of	 the	 UK	 defined 	 contribution	 pension	 plan .	 T hey	 receive	 a	 cash	 supplement	 of	 12. 5%	 of	 capped	 salar y ,	
with the capped salary level increasing nominally each year. This amount is reduced for the cost to the Company of the employer national insurance, 
the effect of which is that the Executive Directors receive an equivalent 11% of capped salary. The contribution levels are equivalent to approximately 
3% of salary for each Executive Director.

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2018
BASE SALARY
Salaries are typically reviewed annually in July for the Executive Directors and the general workforce. In 2017, the Company made the decision that 
due to business circumstances at the time, the 2016 salary review would be deferred for the Executive Directors and Executive Management Board 
to January 2017. Based on the subsequent review, the Committee approved a salary increase of 2% for both Executive Directors, effective from 
1 January 2017 (see 2016 Annual Report on Remuneration for further details).
The Committee conducted its 2017 salary review in July 2017, and approved an increase of 2% for both the CEO and the CFO. This is consistent with the 
increase across the Executive Team, and is below the average salary increase across the Group of 2.4% and across eligible UK employees of 2.7%. The 
Committee believes the new salaries are appropriate in the context of market pay data and continued strong individual performance. Salaries will next be 
reviewed in July 2018, which is the same time for the general workforce. The table below shows the Executive Directors’ salaries as at January 2017 and July 2017.
Executive Director

1 July 2017 % change

PENSION
No change to pension provision is currently anticipated for 2018.
ANNUAL CASH BONUS
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in 2018 will remain unchanged from the opportunity in 2017, and will be 125% of salary.
T he	 annual	 bonus	 will	 continue	 to	 have	 a	 financial 	 element	 and	 an	 element	 linked	 to	 personal	 per formance.	 T he	 financial 	 element	 of	 the	 bonus,	 totalling	
70% of maximum bonus opportunity, will continue to be measured by reference to EBITDA (67% of the maximum award) and revenue (33%). As in 2017, 
30% of the maximum opportunity will be linked to the achievement of personal objectives.
BSA SHARES
In March 2018, a monetary BSA award will be made and nominally converted to shares immediately as happened in 2017. As in previous years, the level 
of	 award	 will	 not	 be	 confirmed 	 until	 the	 results	 for	 2018	 have	 been	 determined	 and	 may	 be	 lower	 (but	 not	 higher)	 than	 the	 initial	 award.	 T here	 is	 no	 change	
to the vesting timetable: the shares will vest in equal tranches in March 2020, 2021 and 2022, subject to continued employment. With the nominal 
conversion of the shares at the outset, this more closely aligns the value delivered to participants under this award with the value created for shareholders 
over the same period. The number of the shares actually awarded will be determined in March 2019 after performance has been assessed.
The level of award in March 2018 will be 185% and 175% of salary for Mr Pearce and Mr Bates, respectively, the same levels as in 2017. The performance 
measures	 will	 be	 the	 same	 as	 the	 financial 	 metrics	 used	 in	 the	 2018	 annual	 bonus.	 67%	 of	 the	 award	 will	 be	 linked	 to	 EBI T DA	 and	 33 %	 to	 revenue.	 We	 made	
two key changes to the implementation of the BSA for 2017 and future years, in response to shareholder feedback. Therefore, for 2018, performance 
against each measure will be assessed on an independent basis. Further, payout for target performance will be 80% (rather than 100%) of maximum, 
and a stretch target is introduced, the achievement of which will result in full payout. Payout for threshold performance will remain 60% of maximum as 
stated in the Policy.
As in previous years, the BSA performance targets relate to annual performance and will therefore be disclosed in full on a retrospective basis. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the award levels, and believe they are appropriate in the context of the Company’s ambitions for growth and 
how each of the Executive Directors will contribute personally towards overall Group performance.
PSA SHARES
A PSA award will be made in March 2018, and the level of award will be 185% of salary for Mr Pearce and 175% for Mr Bates, the same levels as in 2017. 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the award levels, and believe they are appropriate in the context of the Company’s ambitions for growth 
and how each of the Executive Directors will contribute personally towards overall Group performance.
The PSA awards in 2018 will operate on the same basis as they did in 2017. Awards vest after three years based upon the same three performance 
conditions, measured over the three years to 31 December 2020. The targets are as follows:

Strategic objectives 40% The key areas are:
 ›
Capture the maximum number of broadband platforms for our high speed GX services 
and EAN aviation service
 ›
Reposition L -band for new growth by focusing on additional targeted market opportunities
 ›
Establish our Digital Platform and business to drive new services and product innovation
 ›
T ransform	 our	 operating	 environment	 to	 be	 more	 ef ficient 	 in	 service	 delivery	 for	 customers	
and	 ef ficiency 	 for	 all	 stakeholders
 ›
Maximise the overall contribution from an ongoing key strategic contract
 ›
Create a high-performance organisation which enhances our employee value proposition 
and encourages a high-performance culture
Achievement against strategic objectives will be considered as a whole. There are specific objectives 
within each area, and further details of the objectives and key achievements will be disclosed in detail 
at the end of the performance period
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 94 Governance | Directors’ Remuneration Report The EBITDA range for the 2018 PSA was considered by the Committee taking into account the long range business plan which was approved by the 
Board in February 2018 as well as recognising the dynamic competitive market where the Company would need to maintain its position in its existing 
key markets and seek how to maximise revenue opportunities through targeted expenditure to invest for the future. The Committee also considered 
the market consensus as part of its deliberations as well as performance of other satellite operators.
In line with the 2017 Remuneration Policy, a mandatory two-year holding period for Executive Directors will apply to vested PSA awards, effective 
from awards made in 2017. No shares may be sold during the holding period except to cover tax liabilities. Vested but held shares are treated as owned 
by the individual, and count towards shareholding for the purpose of calculating achievement of shareholding guidelines.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEES
The current NED fee levels are set out in the table below. Fees were reviewed during the year in the context of market fee levels and time commitment, 
and increased by 2% with effect from July 2017.
NED fees as at 31 December 2017 Amount
Basic fee £55,080
Senior Independent Director (inclusive of any additional Committee fees) £85,680
Non-Executive Chairman (inclusive of any additional Committee fees) £315,690
Additional Committee fees:
Chairman of the Audit Committee £15,300
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee £15,300
Chairman of the Nominations Committee £10,200
Chairman of the Telecoms Regulatory Committee £10,200
Committee membership (per Committee) £5,610
Fees will next be reviewed in July 2018 and any increases will be for the decision of the Board, excluding the Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman 
also receives international healthcare cover (£17,986 in 2017).
TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN 
The following graph shows the Company’s performance over the last nine years, measured by total shareholder return on a holding in the Company’s 
shares compared to a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE 350 index (excluding investment trusts). The FTSE 350 index has been selected as 
it provides a view of our performance against a broad equity market index, and Inmarsat is a constituent of the index. The Committee will review the 
appropriateness of the comparator group used in future reports to shareholders.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Group is committed to maintaining high 
standards of health and safety for its employees, 
customers, visitors, contractors and anyone 
affected by its business activities. During 2017, 
we continued to work closely with our subsidiary 
companies to harmonise health and safety 
best practice. Rupert Pearce, our CEO, is the 
Director designated for health and safety matters 
at Board level. One of the objectives for the 
CEO includes how health and safety is managed 
across the Company.
ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE 
AND STRATEGY
We operate in over 50 locations with a combined 
workforce of approximately 2,000 staff. Due to 
our diversity of activities the Company recognises 
it has impacts affecting the local and global 
environment. However, it should be noted that 
the satellite industry and our own business is low 
covenant calculations were stress tested 
by applying a set of downside scenarios. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
Inmarsat continues to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
fi na n ci a l 	 sta te me nt s .
VIABILITY STATEMENT
The viability statement containing a broader 
assessment by the Board of the Company’s 
ongoing viability is set out on page 55.
ON-MARKET PURCHASE 
AUTHORITY
The Directors’ authorities are determined by 
UK legislation and the Articles of Association. 
At the 2017 AGM, the Directors were authorised 
by shareholders to allot ordinary shares up 
to agreed limits and to have the ability to 
make market purchases of ordinary shares. 
Shareholders are being requested to renew 
these authorities at the 2018 AGM.

on the scale of carbon generators. The satellite 
launch industry is reviewing how it becomes 
more accountable for carbon generation through 
innovative new satellite launch techniques and we 
will	 work	 with	 them	 to	 see	 how	 we	 can	 benefit 	 from	
improved techniques for our future launches. 
We have provided details of our objectives for 
how we manage our environmental activities on 
page 49. The following information summarises 
the report generated over the year regarding 
our actual performance.
Our environmental impacts include the use of 
natural resources, the consumption of energy 
and water, the production of a variety of waste, 
as well as staff and visitors who travel extensively.
All energy and waste management activities are 
controlled by the Business Environment team 
which is based in London and are supported by 
inputs from colleagues across the Group.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
This section has been prepared in accordance with 
our regulatory obligation to report greenhouse 
gas (‘GHG’) emissions pursuant to Section 7 of 
the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. The table 
below shows our greenhouse gas emissions 
for the years ended 31 December 2017, 2016 
and 2015. We are in the process of having 
o u r 	 e m i s sio ns 	 i nd e pe nd e ntl y 	 ve r i fi e d 	 to 	 the	
ISO 14064-3 standard to ensure continuous 
improvement of our GHG reporting.
Methodology
We quantify and report our organisational 
GHG emissions according to the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol. Consumption data has been 
collated by our sustainability consultant, 
Carbon Credentials, and has been converted 
into CO
2
 equivalent using the UK Government 
2017 Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
and the International Energy Agency international 
electricity conversion factors in order to calculate 
emissions from corresponding activity data.
This report has been prepared in accordance 
with the GHG Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance; we 
have therefore reported both a location-based 
and	 market -based	 Scope	 2	 emissions	 figure. 	
T he	 Scope	 2	 market -based	 figure 	 refl ects 	
emissions from electricity purchasing decisions 
that Inmarsat has made. When quantifying 
emissions using the market-based approach 
we	 have	 used	 a	 supplier	 specific 	 emissions	 factor	
where possible. If these factors were unavailable, 
a residual mix emissions factor was then used, 
and as a last option the location-based grid 
emissions factor was used. This approach 
is in line with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Data Hierarchy.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group continues to invest in new services and 
technology necessary to support its activities

POLITICAL DONATIONS
During the year, no political donations were 
made. It remains the policy of the Company not 
to make political donations or incur political 
expenditure. There are occasions when the 
Company will sponsor dinners and take tables at 
dinners and we have carefully assessed whether 
the s e 	 fa l l 	 to 	 be 	 cl as si fi e d 	 as 	 p o l i ti ca l 	 do na tio ns	
and	 are	 satisfied 	 they	 do	 not,	 however	 we	 are	
being transparent that we participate in these 
events. The Directors recognise however that 
occasions arise where it may be in the best 
interests of shareholders for the Company 
to be able, if appropriate, to participate in 
public debate and opinion-forming on matters 
which affect its business. To avoid inadvertent 
infringement of the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006, shareholders are asked 
annually to give authority at the Annual General 
Meeting for the Company to make political 
donations and to incur political expenditure.

In 2017 we set an interim target to reduce absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 10% compared to 
2016. We have over-achieved this target with 
our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions having 
decreased by 17% since 2016, and 35% since 2015 
(using the market-based Scope 2 accountancy 
method). We continue to expand the number of 
low emissions sources of electricity across the 
Group and during 2017 we switched to a renewable 
electricit y	 supply	 at	 our	 London	 Head	 Of fice, 	
our largest electricity-consuming site.
Our emissions intensity has decreased by 9% from 
6.2 to 5.6 tCO
2
e/FTE (using the market-based 
Scope 2 accounting approach).
We have also chosen to voluntarily disclose 
a selection of our Scope 3 emissions, including 
water, waste, business travel and WTT electricity 
emissions. We have increased the scope of 
our reporting in 2017 to also include emissions 
associated with the transmission and distribution 
of electricity. As such our Scope 3 emissions 
have increased by 52%. This is due to the increase 
in reporting boundary as well as an increase in 
business travel.
In 2018 we will be working with Carbon Credentials 
to assess our full value chain (Scope 3) emissions 
with the ambition of setting a science-based 
emission reduction target in line with the 
UK’s commitment under the UN Paris Agreement, 
thereby contributing to the global effort to prevent 
the worst consequences of climate change.
Reporting boundaries and limitations
We consolidate our organisational boundary 
according to the operational control approach 
and have adopted a materiality threshold 
of 5% for GHG reporting purposes. As a result, 
emissions from locations with fewer than 15 
staff on-site have been reasonably estimated 
as immaterial and are thus excluded from our 
G H G 	 dis c l osure . 	 E mis si o ns 	 fo r 	 al l 	 si gni fi cant 	 si te s	
have	 been	 disclosed,	 which	 includes	 our	 top	 fi ve 	
highest consuming locations: London, Burum, 
Auckland, Paumalu and Perth. The GHG sources 
that constitute our operational boundary for 
the 2017 reporting period are:
 › Scope 1: Natural gas combustion within boilers, 
gas oil combustion within generators, road 
fuel combustion within owned and leased 
vehicles, and fugitive refrigerants from 
air-conditioning equipment

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF INMARSAT PLC 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
OPINION 
IN OUR OPINION: 
› 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s 
profit for the year then ended  
› 
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by  
the European Union 
› 
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and 
› 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
We have audited the financial statements of Inmarsat plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) which comprise: 
› 
the consolidated income statement 
› 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
› 
the consolidated and parent company balance sheets 
› 
the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity 
› 
the consolidated cash flow statement and 
› 
the related notes 1 to 36 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by  
the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable  
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. 
BASIS FOR OPINION 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards  
are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.  
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements  
in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: 
› 
accuracy, completeness and occurrence of manual adjustments to airtime revenue 
› 
accounting for capitalised development expenditure 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $18.0m which was determined on the basis of a number  
of relevant benchmarks including EBITDA. Materiality represents 2.5% of EBITDA. 
Scoping We have performed full-scope audit procedures for components which contribute 99% of net assets, revenue and profit  
before tax. 
Significant changes  
in our approach 
Last year our report included the key audit matter of accounting for the Ligado Cooperation Agreement and Take or Pay revenue 
cut-off. These were not considered to be key audit matters in the year. 
In the prior year we determined materiality solely on profit before tax.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INMARSAT PLC CONTINUED 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT 
Going concern 
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so  
over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. 
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material  
to report, add or draw attention to in respect  
of these matters. 
Principal risks and viability statement 
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of  
the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
› 
the disclosures on pages 50 to 55 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated 
› 
the directors' confirmation on page 51 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity or 
› 
the directors’ explanation on page 55 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions. 
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. 
We confirm that we have nothing material  
to report, add or draw attention to in respect  
of these matters. 
KEY AUDIT MATTERS 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which  
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. 
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  
a separate opinion on these matters. 
Last year our report included the key audit matter of accounting for the Ligado Cooperation Agreement. This is not included in our report this year as the 
significant judgements relating to the timing of revenue recognition and the quantum of potential future costs were taken by management in previous years  
and there have been no developments this year which would trigger the need to update these judgements. Furthermore, last year we included a key audit  
matter for ‘Take or Pay’ revenue cut-off which has not been included since there is only one material such contract which is well understood.

REVENUE RECOGNITION – ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS AND OCCURRENCE OF MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS  
TO AIRTIME REVENUE 
Key audit matter 
description 
 
Airtime revenue, both subscription and usage-based, is the largest revenue stream within the business. This revenue principally 
relates to I-3 and I-4 services sold on a wholesale and retail basis, along with the resale of capacity from other satellite providers. 
Airtime revenue of $799.5m (2016: $822.9m) was earned in the year.  
Each month manual postings are made to revenue accounts to adjust for items such as deferred revenue, accrued income, sales 
provisions, bundled transactions and breakage recognised under Take or Pay agreements to ensure revenue recognition meets  
the requirements of IAS 18 Revenue.  
Due to the highly material nature of airtime revenue, the high volume of transactions and the inherent risk that manual postings  
are susceptible to manipulation, a significant risk, whether due to fraud or error, has been identified that if these postings are not 
accurate, complete or related to transactions which have occurred. 
The accounting policy for the recognition of revenue is set out in note 2 to the financial statements and includes the policies on  
the deferral of revenue and multiple-element contracts. 
Refer to page 72 where this is included as a significant matter in the Audit Committee report. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter 
We have evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of the key automated and manual 
controls relating to the recognition of airtime revenue across the Group’s principal billing systems. This included evaluating  
the design and implementation of controls and testing the migration of data associated with management’s implementation  
of a new billing system.  
We have met with management, both from within finance and in the market-facing business to discuss results in each business  
unit and as a whole to gain an understanding of significant trends and transactions and to inform our substantive testing. 
We have tested the mechanical accuracy of the underlying schedules for a sample of manual postings to determine their 
completeness and accuracy and whether they are prepared consistently with the principles of IAS 18. 
Additionally, we performed a monthly profit margin analysis by product and a monthly revenue trend analysis, corroborating and 
understanding unusual variances. 
Further, we used subscriber numbers, usage reports and pricing information in order to develop an independent expectation  
of airtime revenue by product type to compare to airtime revenue recognised in order to assess the completeness, accuracy  
and occurrence of recorded revenue and to respond to the risk of fraud or error. 
Key observations The results of our testing were satisfactory. We identified no misstatements in manual adjustments to airtime revenue required  
in relation to our substantive audit work which required reporting to the Audit Committee.

ACCOUNTING FOR CAPITALISED DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE  
Key audit matter 
description 
The Group capitalised significant internal labour costs, external costs and qualifying borrowing costs in respect of major capital 
projects, most notably relating to satellite programmes and associated infrastructure such as the Global Xpress programme, 
European Aviation Network and Inmarsat-6 fleet of satellites. 
There is a significant risk, whether due to fraud or error, in respect of valuation and allocation of assets, that costs which do not 
meet the criteria for capitalisation in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 38 Intangible Assets and IAS 23 
Borrowing Costs are inappropriately recorded on the balance sheet rather than expensed or that costs continue to be held on  
the balance sheet despite no longer meeting the relevant capitalisation criteria. The Group’s policy on the capitalisation of assets 
is included in note 2 to the financial statements.  
As shown in note 13 to the financial statements, property, plant and equipment of $599.5m was capitalised in the year, of which 
$174.9m relates to space segment assets and $351.6m relates to assets in the course of construction. 
As shown in note 14 to the financial statements, intangible assets of $76.0m were capitalised in the year. As disclosed in note 9  
to the financial statement, capitalised borrowing costs totalled $40.2m in the year. Refer to page 73 where this is included as  
a significant matter in the Audit Committee report. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter 
We have evaluated the design and implementation of controls in respect of the processes and procedures which govern  
the capitalisation of development costs. 
We have met the project leaders for the most financially significant capital projects, which account for 89% of current year capital 
expenditure, to corroborate the project status, feasibility of completion, and performance against budget, including investigation  
of any deviations from budget. This process enabled us to focus on projects we considered to have a higher risk of misstatement. 
In addition, we have carried out sample-based testing in relation to each element of capitalised costs including inspecting 
supporting evidence for a sample of the costs capitalised, understanding the nature of these costs and considering whether  
they meet the capitalisation requirements of IAS 16 and IAS 38.  
We reviewed the ageing profile of assets in the course of construction, to determine whether the ongoing technical feasibility  
and intended completion of the project could be demonstrated. For a sample of assets which entered service in the period  
we inspected supporting evidence to determine whether depreciation was commenced at a time in accordance with IAS 16. 
In relation to borrowing costs we obtained the supporting calculations and verified the inputs to the calculation, including testing  
a sample of cash payments. Additionally, we tested the mechanical accuracy of the model and reviewed the model to determine 
whether the borrowing costs for completed projects are no longer being capitalised and accounting is therefore in line with  
the requirements of IAS 23. 
In relation to internal labour costs capitalised we carried out sample-based testing which included tracing to approved timesheets 
and testing the daily rates applied. 
Key observations We identified a number of deficiencies in key controls within the capital expenditure cycle, which were reported to the Audit 
Committee. As a consequence, we determined we would not test the operating effectiveness of controls in this area. 
Our audit testing was completed satisfactorily, and we concur with the judgements management has taken in determining that 
capital assets meet the capitalisation criteria of IAS 16, IAS 23 and IAS 38. We did not identify any audit adjustments that 
warranted reporting to the Audit Committee.

OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Materiality $18.0m (2016: $16.7m) for the Group. $15.7m (2016: $14.5m) for the parent company financial statements. 
Basis for determining 
materiality 
We determined materiality using a range of forecast benchmarks and this represented 2.5% of EBITDA, 1.3% of revenue and 7.6% 
of profit before tax adjusted to remove the volatility described above.  
Last year, materiality was based solely on profit before tax and represented 6% of actual profit before tax. 
EBITDA is reconciled to statutory profit before tax on page 39. 
Parent company materiality was determined based on a benchmark of profit before tax but was then capped at the highest level 
of component materiality. 
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied 
We consider the use of a number of benchmarks in determining materiality to be appropriate since a number of measures are 
relevant to the users of the financial statements, including EBITDA. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $900,000 (2016: $825,000) for the group  
and the parent company, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit 
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work performed in the following locations: 
› 
London, United Kingdom 
› 
St. John’s, Canada 
› 
Reston, United States 
With the exception of one specific part of the U.S. Government business, where we used a component audit team, we performed the Group audit with one 
integrated audit team led from London. The supervision of the audit team included the London team visiting the members of the audit team located in  
St. John’s and Reston. 
We determined there to be three components in the Group, as follows: 
› 
The core Inmarsat business unit headquartered in London with operations also in St. John’s 
› 
The U.S. Government retail business in Reston and  
› 
Non-core entities, which include Inmarsat Australia Pty Ltd, based in Sydney, Australia 
The U.S. Government retail business and non-core entities are considered to be separate components as they had a separate financial control environment 
during the year. The core Inmarsat and U.S. Government components were subject to a full scope audit, whilst limited procedures were performed on the  
non-core component due to its relative financial significance. 
The components subject to a full scope audit represent the principal business units and account for 99.8% (2016: 99.9%) of the Group’s net assets, 99.0%  
(2016: 99.7%) of the Group’s revenue and 98.8% (2016: 99.4%) of the Group’s profit before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the three locations was executed at levels of materiality 
which were lower than the Group materiality and ranged from $5.4m to $15.7m (2016: $5.0m to $15.0m). 
At the Parent Company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were  
no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified  
account balances. 
The Senior Statutory Auditor visited the U.S. Government component in the prior year. For this component we involved the component audit partner and 
manager in our team briefing, discussed their risk assessment and reviewed documentation of the findings from their work.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF INMARSAT PLC CONTINUED 
 
 
OTHER INFORMATION 
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to 
determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement 
of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that: 
› 
Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
› 
Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee or 
› 
Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
We have nothing to report in respect of  
these matters. 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the 
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to  
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these  
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. 
USE OF OUR REPORT 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
OPINIONS ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
› 
the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent  
with the financial statements and 
› 
the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have  
not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. 
MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
› 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit or 
› 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for  
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us or 
› 
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns 
We have nothing to report in respect of  
these matters. 
Directors’ remuneration 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. 
We have nothing to report in respect of  
these matters. 
OTHER MATTERS 
AUDITOR TENURE

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
1. GENERAL INFORMATION 
Inmarsat plc (the ‘Company’ or, together with its subsidiaries, the ‘Group’) is  
a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and domiciled in England and 
Wales. The address of its registered office is 99 City Road, London EC1Y 1AX, 
United Kingdom.  
2. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial 
statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently  
to all the years presented unless otherwise stated. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the 
European Union, the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention except for certain financial instruments that have been 
measured at fair value, as described later in these accounting policies. 
GOING CONCERN 
The Group has a robust and resilient business model, positive free cash flow 
generation and is compliant with all banking covenants. Because of this, the 
Directors believe that the Company and the Group are well-placed to manage 
its business risks successfully. After considering current financial projections 
and facilities available and after making enquiries, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, Inmarsat plc continues to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. 
Further discussion of the Group’s business activities, together with factors likely  
to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report which encompasses the Chairman’s review, the Chief Executive’s 
review, the financial review and the viability statement on pages 1 to 55.  
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is  
the functional currency of the Company and most of the Group’s subsidiaries. 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts  
of revenue and expenses during the year. Although these estimates are based 
on management’s best estimate of the amount, event or actions, the actual 
results ultimately may differ from these estimates. Further discussion on these 
estimates and assumptions are disclosed in note 4.  
ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES 
New and amended accounting standards adopted by the Group 
There are no new IFRS or IFRIC Interpretations that are effective for this 
financial year that have had a material impact on the Group.  
New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but  
are not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group 
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
IFRS 15 will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.  
The standard sets out the requirements for recognising revenue from 
contracts with customers, and will supersede the current revenue recognition 
guidance including IAS 18 ‘Revenue’, IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ and the 
related interpretations.  
When IFRS 15 is adopted, it can be applied either on a full retrospective basis, 
requiring the restatement of the comparative periods presented in the financial 
statements, or with the cumulative retrospective impact of IFRS 15 applied as 
an adjustment to equity on the date of adoption. The Group will adopt the full 
retrospective approach from 1 January 2018 and will show comparative figures 
for the December 2017 financial year under IFRS 15 as part of the 2018 
financial statements. 
The Group has performed a review of all significant revenue streams to identify 
the impact of applying the IFRS 15 five-step recognition model, as follows: 
1. Identify the contract with the customer 
2. Identify the distinct performance obligations 
3. Determine the transaction price 
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations 
5. Recognise revenue as or when a performance obligation is fulfilled 
The restatement of 2017 comparatives in the 2018 accounts is expected to 
result in a decrease in 2017 revenue of $9m and an increase in 2017 EBITDA  
of $8m. Profit before tax is expected to increase by $4m while opening 2017 
retained earnings are expected to decrease by $10m. Trade receivables and 
deferred revenue specific to Ligado are expected to increase by $20m and 
$24m respectively.  
The Group has established internal controls to monitor the materiality  
of unadjusted differences that are immaterial and not expected to change  
in the near future.  
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
IFRS 16 is mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019,  
with early adoption allowed subject to the adoption of IFRS 15. The standard 
sets out requirements for recognising assets and liabilities in respect of leases, 
and will supersede the existing accounting guidance in IAS 17 ‘Leases’ and  
the related interpretations. The Group will early adopt IFRS 16 in the period 
beginning 1 January 2018 using the modified retrospective approach which 
allows for certain practical expedients on transition. Under the modified 
retrospective approach, the lease liability and asset are recognised as  
at 1 January 2018 (the implementation date) with no restatement of prior  
period financial statements. 
The core principle of the standard is to provide a single lessee accounting 
model, requiring lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and lease liability  
for all leases unless the term is less than 12 months or the underlying asset  
has a low value. IFRS 16 will substantially change lease accounting for operating 
lessees which will now need to be recognised on the balance sheet. Lease  
costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right-of-use  
asset and interest on the lease liability over the lease term.  
The Group has assessed the impact that IFRS 16 will have on the financial 
statements. The area of material impact relates to property leases where  
the Group is the lessee. The expected adjustments as at 1 January 2018 in the 
Group’s Balance Sheet are the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities amounting to $76m and $87m respectively. In terms of the Group’s 
financial performance for 2018, EBITDA is expected to be $13m higher under 
IFRS 16 compared to the previous standard, as lease costs will be expensed  
as depreciation and interest rather than operating costs. Profit before tax  
is expected to be $2m lower. 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ 
IFRS 9 will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and 
supersedes IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The 
new standard covers the accounting treatment of the following three areas:  
› 
classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities 
› 
hedge accounting 
› 
impairment of financial assets 
The Group anticipates minimal impact from changes in classification  
and measurement of financial assets and liabilities and hedge accounting  
(with the Group opting for the policy choice allowed by IFRS 9 to continue 
hedge accounting as under IAS 39).  
IFRS 9 will impact the recognition and measurement of impairment of financial 
assets, but this is not expected to be material. The IAS 39 ‘incurred loss model’ 
is replaced by the IFRS 9 forward looking ‘expected credit loss model’. The  
new model requires either 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECLs’), or lifetime  
ECLs to be recognised for all financial assets at initial recognition before an 
impairment event occurs.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
Under the expected credit loss model, there are three approaches for 
measuring and recognising impairment losses on financial assets, namely  
the general approach, simplified approach and credit adjusted approach.  
For short-term trade receivables, IFRS 15 contract assets and lease 
receivables, the Group will apply the simplified approach. 
The Group has performed a review of all categories of financial assets and 
expects the impact on the financial statements from applying IFRS 9’s ECL 
model to be immaterial.  
IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’ 
IFRIC 22 will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, 
subject to endorsement by the EU. The interpretation clarifies how to account  
for transactions that involve advance consideration paid or received in  
a foreign currency. The interpretation is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group.  
IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’ 
IFRIC 23 will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.  
The interpretation clarifies the application of recognition and measurement 
requirements in IAS 12 for uncertain tax positions. Guidance is provided  
on a number of areas including whether uncertain tax positions should  
be considered separately or together, the appropriate method to reflect 
uncertainty, and how to account for changes in facts or circumstances.  
The Group does not intend to early adopt and is currently performing  
an assessment to determine if the interpretation will have a material impact.  
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
IFRS 17 will be effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 and 
supersedes IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts,’ subject to endorsement by the EU. 
Neither standard is applicable to the Group.  
Amendments to accounting standards that are effective for 
the current period 
The following standards have all been endorsed by the EU and are effective  
for the current period. The Group has considered all the below amendments 
and has determined that these do not have a material impact.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION 
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of  
the Company and all its subsidiaries, and incorporate the share of the results  
of associates using the equity method of accounting.  
The results of subsidiary undertakings established or acquired during the  
period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of 
establishment or acquisition of control. The results of subsidiary undertakings 
disposed of during the period are included until the date of disposal. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries  
to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.  
All transactions, balances, income and expenses with and between subsidiary 
undertakings have been eliminated on consolidation. 
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries,  
which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original 
business combination and the non-controlling interests’ share of changes  
in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the Group’s  
financial statements. 
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.  
When the Group acquires a business, it identifies the assets and liabilities  
of the acquiree at the date of acquisition and measures them at fair value.  
Only separately identifiable intangible assets are recognised. Any assets  
or disposal groups held for sale at the acquisition date are measured  
at fair value less costs to sell.  
Consideration is the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets transferred  
and liabilities incurred in acquiring the business and includes the fair value  
of any contingent consideration. Changes in fair value of contingent 
consideration after the acquisition date are recognised in the income 
statement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included  
in operating costs. 
Goodwill is initially measured at cost as the difference between the fair value  
of the consideration for the acquisition and fair value of the net identifiable 
assets acquired, including any identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill.  
If the assessment of goodwill results in an excess of the fair value of net  
assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the  
gain is recognised in the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill  
is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose  
of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-
generating units (‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree 
are assigned to those units. 
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION 
The functional currency of the Company and most of the Group’s subsidiaries, 
as well as the presentation currency of the Group, is US Dollar. This is as the 
majority of operational transactions and financing are denominated in  
US Dollars. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement  
of transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates  
are recognised in the income statement line which most appropriately  
reflects the nature of the item or transactions. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated  
into the Group’s presentation currency at the prevailing spot rate at year end.  
The results of foreign operations are translated into US Dollars at the average 
rates of exchange for the year. Foreign currency translation differences 
resulting from consolidating foreign operations are recognised in equity. 
REVENUE 
Mobile satellite communications service revenues result from utilisation 
charges that are recognised as revenue in the period during which the services 
are provided. Deferred income attributable to mobile satellite communications 
services or subscription fees represents the unearned balances remaining  
from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid contracts. 
Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the 
customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires. The Group also enters into 
minimum spend contracts with customers, known as ‘take-or-pay’ contracts, 
whereby customers agree to purchase a minimum value of mobile satellite 
communications services over a fixed period. Any unused portion of the 
prepaid contracts or the take-or-pay contracts (‘breakage’) is recognised  
as revenue in line with service provision when reasonable assurance as  
to the breakage amount exists, or otherwise when the contract expires.  
Mobile satellite communications service revenues from capacity sold are 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract concerned, 
which is typically between one and 12 months, unless another systematic  
basis is deemed more appropriate.  
Revenue also includes income from spectrum coordination agreements  
(such as Ligado Networks), services contracts, other communications  
services and income from the sale and installation of terminals and other 
communication equipment. Revenue from spectrum coordination agreements 
is recognised using the percentage of completion or a straight-line approach 
depending on the underlying terms of the agreement. Revenue from service 
contracts is recognised as the service is provided over the contract period. 
Sales of terminals and other communication equipment are recognised when 
the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer. Revenue  
from installation of terminals and other communication equipment is 
recognised when the installation is completed.

The Group offers certain products and services as part of multiple deliverable 
arrangements. Multi-deliverable arrangements are divided into separate  
units of accounting, provided: 1) the deliverable has a stand-alone value to  
the customer if it is sold separately; and 2) the fair value of the item can be 
objectively and reliably determined. Consideration for these items is measured 
and allocated to each separate unit based on their relative fair values and the 
relevant revenue recognition policies are applied to each. 
FINANCING INCOME AND FINANCING COST 
Financing income comprises interest receivable on funds invested in short-
term deposits.  
Financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings including the  
Senior Notes and Convertible Bonds, accretion of the liability component  
of the Convertible Bonds, amortisation of deferred financing costs, the unwind 
of the discount on deferred satellite liabilities and interest on the net defined 
benefit asset and post-employment liability. Finance charges are recognised  
in the income statement at the effective interest rate.  
The change in fair value of the derivative liability component of the 2023 
Convertible Bond is presented within net financing costs in the income 
statement. Further details on the accounting for derivative financial 
instruments is provided below. 
FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables, including prepaid and accrued income, are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated 
uncollectable amounts.  
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents, measured at fair value, comprises cash balances, 
deposits held on call with banks, money market funds and other short-term,  
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank 
overdrafts are shown as current liabilities within borrowings on the balance sheet.  
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY 
Equity instruments  
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the 
net assets of the Group. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded 
at the proceeds received, net of direct issue cost.  
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Borrowings 
Borrowings, comprising interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts, are initially 
recognised at fair value which equates to the proceeds received, net of direct 
transaction and arrangement costs. They are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. Finance charges related to borrowings, including amortisation 
of direct transaction costs, are charged to the income statement over the term 
of the borrowing using the effective interest rate method.  
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has the 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
after the balance sheet date, in which case borrowings are classified as  
non-current liabilities. 
Convertible Bonds 
The Group has issued Convertible Bonds which are net share settled 
instruments. Upon conversion the Group will repay the principal in cash  
and satisfy the remaining conversion value by issuing ordinary shares of  
the Company (if the market value of the Company’s shares at settlement  
date exceeds the conversion price). Upon issuance, in accordance with  
IAS 32, the instrument is bifurcated between a debt component and  
a derivative liability component. 
The cash debt component is initially recognised as the present value of the 
principal and interest payments using a discount rate for a similar instrument 
with the same terms and conditions but without the conversion option. After 
initial recognition, it is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method with the interest expense recognised in the income statement and a 
cash outflow resulting from coupon payments to bond holders. The derivative 
liability component is initially assigned the residual amount after deducting 
from the fair value of the instrument as a whole, the amount separately 
determined for the debt component. The derivative liability is sensitive  
to changes in the bond price and is marked-to-market at each reporting  
date with the increase or decrease recognised in the income statement. 
Senior Notes 
The Group has issued Senior Notes that are included within borrowings,  
and are initially recognised at fair value which equates to the proceeds 
received, net of direct transaction costs and any premium or discount.  
These instruments are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Finance 
charges, including amortisation of direct transaction costs and any premium  
or discount, are recognised in the income statement over the term of the 
borrowing at the effective interest rate method. 
Net borrowings 
Net borrowings consists of total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents  
and short-term investments. Borrowings exclude accrued interest and any 
derivative financial liabilities. 
Derivative financial instruments 
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue 
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is 
entered into and subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on 
remeasurement is recognised in the income statement, except where the 
derivative is used to hedge against risks such as fluctuations in interest rates  
or foreign exchange rates. The accounting policy for hedging follows below.  
Cash flow hedges 
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, 
while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement within financing costs. 
Where there is a material contract with a foreign currency exposure, a specific 
hedge to match the specific risk will be evaluated. At present the Group only 
hedges certain foreign currency milestone payments to Airbus and Thales for 
the construction of the I-6 and GX-5 satellites. 
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit 
or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the 
hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised, or when a forecast 
sale occurs. When the hedged item is the future purchase of a non-financial 
asset or non-financial liability, the amount recognised as other comprehensive 
income is transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset 
or liability. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, accumulating annual leave, 
bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the 
associated services are performed by the employees of the Group. 
Termination benefits are payable whenever an employee’s employment  
is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it has demonstrably committed to either 
terminate the employment of current employees or to provide termination 
benefits, as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. 
The Group recognises liabilities relating to defined benefit pension plans  
and post-employment benefits in respect of employees. The Group’s net 
obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans and post-employment 
benefits are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount  
of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in  
the current and prior periods. The estimated future benefit is discounted  
to its present value, from which the fair value of any plan assets is deducted  
to calculate the plan’s net asset/liability position. The calculations are 
performed by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 119 Financial Statements | Consolidated financial statements 120 Financial statements | Consolidated financial statements Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
 
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are immediately 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. 
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are charged to the income 
statement when the related employee service is rendered. 
The Group issues equity-settled share options and awards to employees. 
Equity-settled share option awards are measured at fair value of the options  
at the date of the grant. The fair value of the options is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares  
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions. 
TAXATION 
Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted  
by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising between assets and 
liabilities’ tax bases and their carrying amounts (the balance sheet method). 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability  
is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the temporary deductible 
differences or tax loss carry forwards can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on all taxable temporary differences except 
on those: 
› 
arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit 
› 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, but only to the 
extent that the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the differences 
and it is probable that the reversal will not occur in the foreseeable future 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable 
right to set them off, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority and if the Group intends to settle its current tax assets  
and liabilities on a net basis. 
Uncertain tax positions 
The Group’s policy is to comply with all enacted laws in the relevant jurisdictions 
in which the Group prepares its tax returns. However, tax legislation, especially 
as it applies to corporate taxes, is not always prescriptive and more than  
one interpretation of the law may be possible. In addition, tax returns in many 
jurisdictions are filed in arrears a year or more after the end of the accounting 
period to which they relate. The tax authorities often have a significant  
period in which to enquire into these returns after their submission. As a result, 
differences in view, or errors in returns, may not come to light until some time 
after the initial estimate of tax due is determined. This necessarily leads to  
a position of uncertain tax positions.  
Where the Group is aware of significant areas where the law is unclear and 
where this has been relied upon in a filing position of a tax return, or, in an area 
where different outcomes and interpretations are possible and may lead to a 
different result, the Group provides for the uncertain tax position. A provision  
is made when, based on the available evidence, the Group considers that it is 
probable that further amounts will be payable, or a recoverable tax position  
will be reduced, and the adjustment can be reliably estimated. The Group 
calculates the uncertain tax position using a single best estimate of the  
most likely outcome on a case-by-case basis.  
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
General 
Property, plant and equipment assets are initially recognised at cost and 
subsequently treated under the cost model: at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.  
Space segment assets 
Space segment assets comprise satellite construction, launch and other 
associated costs, including ground infrastructure. Expenditure charged to 
space segment projects includes invoiced progress payments, amounts 
accrued appropriate to the stage of completion of contract milestones, 
external consultancy costs and direct internal costs. Internal costs, comprising 
primarily staff costs, are only capitalised when they are directly attributable  
to the construction of an asset. Progress payments are determined on 
milestones achieved to date together with agreed cost escalation indices. 
Deferred satellite payments represent the net present value of future 
payments dependent on the future performance of each satellite and are 
recognised in space segment assets when the satellite becomes operational. 
Depreciation on space segment assets is recognised over the life of the 
satellites from the date they become operational and are placed into  
service. The associated liability is stated at its net present value and included 
within borrowings. 
Assets in the course of construction 
These assets are carried at cost with no depreciation charged whilst in the 
course of construction. The assets will be transferred to space segment assets 
and depreciated over the life of the satellites or services once they become 
operational and placed into service.  
Capitalised borrowing costs 
The Group incurs borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of assets that necessarily take a substantial  
period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Such borrowing costs 
are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Capitalisation commences when  
the Group begins to incur the borrowing costs and related expenditures for the 
asset, and when it undertakes the activities that are necessary to prepare the 
asset for its intended use or sale. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when 
substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended 
use or sale are complete.  
Other fixed assets 
Other fixed assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured  
at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation is calculated to write-off the historical cost less residual values,  
if any, of fixed assets, except land, on a straight-line basis over the expected 
useful lives of the assets concerned. The Group selects its depreciation rates 
and residual values carefully and reviews them annually to take into account 
any changes in circumstances or expectations. When determining useful lives, 
the principal factors considered are the expected rate of technological 
developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the 
intensity at which the assets are expected to be used. Any change in useful  
lives are accounted for prospectively. The Group also reviews the residual 
values and depreciation methods on an annual basis. 
Derecognition 
An item of property plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when 
no future economic benefit is expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or 
loss arising on derecognition of the asset, calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognised 
in the income statement.  
GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance  
that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied  
with. A grant that relates to an expense item is recognised as income on  
a systematic basis over the period(s) that the related costs are expensed.  
A grant that relates to an asset is deducted from the cost of the relevant  
asset, thereby reducing the depreciation charge over the useful life of  
the asset. 
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 120 Financial Statements | Consolidated financial statements 121 Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements | Consolidated financial statements 
 
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Intangible assets comprise goodwill, trademarks, software, terminal 
development and network access costs, spectrum rights, orbital slots  
and licences, customer relationships and intellectual property. 
Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Intangible 
assets acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised  
at their fair values as determined at acquisition date. After initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Research and development costs  
Research costs related to internally generated intangibles are expensed in  
the period that the expenditure is incurred.  
Development costs are expensed when the costs are incurred unless it meets 
criteria for capitalisation under IAS 38. Development costs are only capitalised 
if the technical feasibility, availability of appropriate technical, financial  
and other resources and commercial viability of developing the asset for 
subsequent use or sale have been demonstrated and the costs incurred can be 
measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future benefit.  
Amortisation 
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line  
basis over the useful life of the asset. The amortisation period and method  
are reviewed on an annual basis. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful  
life, such as goodwill, are not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment. 
IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is tested annually for impairment at 31 December 
each year.  
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  
full carrying amount may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment may 
include changes in technology and business performance. An asset is tested 
for impairment on an individual basis as far as possible to determine its 
recoverable amount. Where this is not possible, assets are grouped and  
tested for impairment in a cash generating unit. A cash generating unit is  
the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.  
An asset will be impaired if the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell the asset and the 
value in use. The impairment loss will be recognised in the income statement.  
In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to  
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.  
Subsequent to an impairment loss, if indications exist that an asset’s 
recoverable amount might have increased, the recoverable amount will be 
reassessed and any impairment reversal recognised in the income statement. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount will not exceed the depreciated historical cost (what the carrying 
amount would have been had there been no initial impairment loss).  
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. 
LEASES 
Leases where significantly all of the risks and rewards pertaining to ownership  
of the underlying leased assets are retained by the Group as lessor are 
classified as operating leases. Rentals receivable and income generated from 
operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. Rentals payable under operating leases where 
the Group is the lessee are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease. 
NON-CURRENT ASSETS AND DISPOSAL GROUPS HELD FOR SALE 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as ‘held for sale’ when their 
carrying values will be recovered through a sales transaction rather than through 
continued use. This classification is subject to meeting the following criteria:  
› 
management is committed to a plan to sell and the asset is being actively 
marketed for sale at a sales price reasonable in relation to its fair value 
› 
the asset is available for immediate sale 
› 
the sale is highly probable to be concluded within 12 months of classification 
as held for sale and 
› 
it is unlikely that the plan to sell will be significantly changed or withdrawn 
Disposal groups are groups of assets and associated liabilities to be disposed 
of together in a single transaction. At the reporting date they are separately 
disclosed as current assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.  
When non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale, 
depreciation and amortisation will cease and the assets are remeasured  
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.  
Any resulting impairment loss is recognised in the income statement,  
except for assets treated under the revaluation model, where the adjustment 
would first decrease the revaluation reserve before any excess will be 
recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement. Any remainder  
in the revaluation reserve will be released to the income statement on  
the date of sale. 
INVENTORIES 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined by the weighted 
average cost method) and net realisable value. Allowances for obsolescence 
are recognised in other operating costs when there is objective evidence  
that inventory is obsolete. 
PROVISIONS 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal  
or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow  
of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  
The expense relating to a provision is recognised in the income statement, 
except where the obligation is to dismantle or restore an item of property,  
plant or equipment, in which case the amount is capitalised to the cost of  
the asset. The capitalised amount is subsequently depreciated to the  
income statement over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset.  
Provisions are discounted to a present value at initial recognition where  
the effect of discounting is deemed to be material. Discounted provisions  
will unwind over time using the amortised cost method with finance cost 
recognised in the income statement. Provision estimates are revised each 
reporting date and adjustments recognised in line with the provision’s initial 
recognition (either in the income statement or recognised against the cost  
of the asset). 
Asset retirement obligations 
The fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible 
property, plant and equipment is recognised in the financial statements in the 
period in which the liability is incurred. Upon initial recognition of a liability for  
an asset retirement obligation, a corresponding asset retirement cost is added 
to the carrying amount of the related asset, which is subsequently amortised  
to income over the remaining useful life of the asset. Following the initial 
recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the carrying amount of the 
liability is increased for the passage of time by applying an interest method  
of allocation to the liability with a corresponding accretion cost reflected  
in operating expenses. 
Revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate  
of undiscounted cash flows are recognised each period as an adjustment  
to the carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation.

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
In response to the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (‘APM’s) 
issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’), we have 
provided additional information on the APMs used by the Group including 
definitions which are included in the Glossary on page 157. The Directors use 
APMs to better understand the underlying financial performance of the Group 
and to provide comparability of information between reporting periods and 
business units. The measures are also used in discussions with the investment 
analyst community and the credit rating agencies. Given that APMs are not 
defined by International Financial Reporting Standards they may not be 
directly comparable with other companies who use similar measures. APMs 
considered to be KPIs include EBITDA (including adjusted EBITDA), Cash Capex 
and adjusted EPS and are defined on page 16. 
3. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 
The Group’s operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety  
of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, 
foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates. 
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit 
adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using forward 
exchange contracts to limit exposure to foreign currency risk and to limit the 
impact of fluctuating interest rates by minimising the amount of floating rate 
long-term borrowings. 
The Board of Directors has delegated to the treasury department the 
responsibility for setting and implementing the financial risk management 
policies applied by the Group. The treasury department has an operating 
manual that sets out specific guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and credit risk (see note 31). The Group does not hold or  
issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. 
(A) MARKET RISK 
(i) Foreign exchange risk 
The functional currency of Inmarsat plc is the US Dollar. Apart from the 
deferred satellite liability, all of the Group’s long-term borrowings are 
denominated in US Dollars, the majority of its revenue is earned in US Dollars 
and the majority of capital expenditure is denominated in US Dollars, which  
are therefore not subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency 
rates of exchange. 
However, the Group operates internationally, resulting in approximately 3% and 
24% of total revenue and total expenditure, respectively, being denominated  
in currencies other than the US Dollar. Approximately 27% (2016: 32%) of  
the Group’s operating costs are denominated in Pounds Sterling. The Group’s 
exposure therefore needs to be carefully managed to avoid variability in future 
cash flows and earnings caused by volatile foreign exchange rates. 
As at 31 December 2017 it is estimated that a hypothetical 1% increase in the 
US Dollar/Sterling year-end exchange rate (US$1.34/£1.00 to US$1.35/£1.00) 
would have increased the 2017 profit before tax by approximately $0.1m  
(2016: $0.6m). Management believes that a 1% sensitivity rate provides  
a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in foreign 
exchange rates. 
(ii) Price risk 
The Group is not exposed to significant equity securities price risk or commodity 
price risk. 
(B) INTEREST RATE RISK 
The Group’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent  
of changes in market interest rates. The Group has interest-bearing assets 
such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and non-current 
other receivables however interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest  
rate risk; however, as at 31 December 2017, the Group has no borrowings issued  
at variable rates following the full repayment of the EIB loan in October 2016. 
The Senior Notes due 2022 and 2024, the Convertible Bonds due 2023 and 
the Ex-Im Bank Facilities are all at fixed rates. 
(C) CREDIT RISK 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual 
obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Financial instruments  
that potentially subject the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist  
of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, other 
receivables, accrued income and derivative financial instruments. The credit 
risk on liquid funds (cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits) and 
derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are  
highly rated financial institutions. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December is: 
($ in millions) Note 2017 2016 
Cash and cash equivalents 16 144.9 262.0 
Trade receivables, other receivables and 
accrued income 31 275.3 250.7 
Derivative financial instruments 31 1.5 1.8 
Total credit risk  421.7 514.5 
The Group’s average age of trade receivables as at 31 December 2017 was 
approximately 57 days excluding Ligado and approximately 52 days including 
Ligado (2016: 63 days excluding Ligado and 58 days including Ligado).  
At 31 December 2017, $170.0m (2016: $165.6m) of trade receivables were  
not yet due for payment. No interest is charged on trade receivables until the 
receivables become overdue for payment. Thereafter, interest may be charged 
at varying rates depending on the terms of the individual agreements.  
The Group has credit evaluation, approval and monitoring processes intended 
to mitigate potential credit risks, and utilises both internal and third-party 
collection processes for overdue accounts. The Group maintains provisions  
for potential credit losses that are assessed on an ongoing basis. The provision 
for uncollectible trade receivables has decreased to $12.5m as at 31 December 
2017 (2016: $13.7m). 
For 2017, no customer comprised greater than 10% of the Group’s total 
revenues (2016: no customer).  
The ageing profile of past due but not impaired trade receivables is: 
($ in millions)  2017 2016 
Between 1 and 30 days overdue  18.8 35.3 
Between 31 and 120 days overdue  9.0 7.9 
Over 120 days overdue  – 1.5 
As at 31 December  27.8 44.7 
(D) LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group is exposed to liquidity risk with respect to its contractual obligations 
and financial liabilities. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining 
sufficient cash and short-term deposits and the availability of funding through 
an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast  
and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets  
and liabilities. 
The available liquidity of the Group as at 31 December is: 
($ in millions) Note 2017 2016 
Cash and cash equivalents 16 144.9 262.0

meet its needs for the foreseeable future.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND  
KEY JUDGEMENTS 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue 
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. The more significant judgements and estimates are discussed below: 
(A) TAXATION 
The calculation of the Group’s uncertain tax provisions involves estimation in 
respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until 
resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, 
through a formal legal process. Issues can, and often do, take a number of 
years to resolve. The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived from the 
Group’s best estimation. However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the 
outcome of these means eventual realisation could differ from the accounting 
estimates and therefore impact the Group’s results and cash flows.  
The Group maintains tax provisions in respect of ongoing enquiries with  
tax authorities. In the event that all such enquiries were settled as currently 
provided for, we estimate that the Group would incur a cash tax outflow of 
approximately $90m, excluding interest, during 2018. The enquiries remain 
ongoing at this time. 
(B) REVENUE IN RESPECT OF THE LIGADO NETWORKS  
COOPERATION AGREEMENT 
In December 2007, Inmarsat and Ligado Networks (formerly LightSquared LP, 
Skyterra (Canada) Inc. and LightSquared Inc.) entered into a Cooperation 
Agreement for the efficient use of L-band spectrum over North America. The 
Cooperation Agreement was segregated into phases and designed to enable 
and support the deployment of an ATC network by Ligado in North America. 
Key estimates and judgements have been made regarding the future of Ligado 
and the Cooperation Agreement.  
To date total cash payments of $885.7m have been received under the 
Cooperation Agreement, including $110.7m in 2017 (2016: $126.2m).  
The Group has, thus far, recognised $703.9m of revenue and $43.1m of 
operating costs under all phases of the agreement. For the year ended  
31 December 2017, the Group recognised $126.7m of revenue with $2.0m 
operating costs (year ended 31 December 2016: $119.4m and $nil, respectively). 
In March 2016, Ligado Networks agreed to take the 30MHz option (the ‘30MHz 
Plan’) under Phase 2 of the Cooperation Agreement between the companies. 
In exchange for the deferral of some payments from Ligado to Inmarsat, the 
parties agreed to delay the transition to the 30MHz Plan, with Ligado providing 
Inmarsat enhanced spectrum usage rights for its satellite operations for a 
minimum period of two years. Over the three-year period approximately $35m 
of additional contracted payments will be deferred. With this in mind, Ligado 
made quarterly payments to Inmarsat totalling $110.7m during the course of 
2017 and will make aggregate payments of approximately $118m in respect  
of 2018, payable in quarterly instalments. This revenue is recognised on an 
accruals basis.  
At 31 December 2017, deferred income in respect of the Cooperation 
Agreement of $181.8m was recorded on the balance sheet. Although the  
cash has been received, the timing of the recognition of this deferred income, 
together with any related future costs and taxes, is dependent upon when 
Ligado receive their FCC licence, which remains uncertain. During 2017, 
Inmarsat recognised $14.0m of deferred income as revenue to reflect the 
impact of the revenue deferral arising under the revised transition agreement. 
$2.0m was recognised in relation to costs incurred on interference.  
(C) CAPITALISATION OF SPACE SEGMENT ASSETS AND  
ASSOCIATED BORROWING COSTS 
The net book value of space segment assets is currently $2,510m  
(2016: $2,037m). There have been additions of $175m in the year.  
The key judgements involved in the capitalisation of space segment  
assets and associated borrowings costs are: 
› 
whether the capitalisation criteria of the underlying IAS have been met; 
› 
whether an asset is ready for use and as a result further capitalisation  
of costs should cease and depreciation should commence and; 
› 
whether an asset is deemed to be substantially complete and as a result 
capitalisation of borrowing costs should cease. 
(D) PROXY BOARD ARRANGEMENT 
The Group has made key judgements in determining the accounting treatment 
of Inmarsat Government Inc. 
The U.S. Government element of Inmarsat’s Government business unit is 
managed through the U.S. trading entity, Inmarsat Government Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Group. The business is managed through a Proxy 
agreement as required by the U.S. National Industrial Security Program 
(‘NISP’). A Proxy agreement is an instrument intended to mitigate the risk of 
foreign ownership, control or influence when a foreign person owns, acquires  
or merges with a U.S. entity that has a facility security clearance under the 
NISP. The Proxy agreement conveys the foreign owner’s voting rights to the 
Proxy Holders, comprised of the Proxy board. There are three Proxy holders 
who are U.S. citizens cleared and approved by the U.S. Defence Security  
Service (‘DSS’).  
The Proxy holders have a fiduciary duty, and agree, to perform their role in the 
best interests of the Group (including the legitimate economic interest), and  
in a manner consistent with the national security interests of the U.S. 
The DSS requires Inmarsat Government Inc. to enter into a Proxy agreement 
because it is indirectly owned by the Group and it has contracts with the 
Department of Defence which contain certain classified information. The Proxy 
agreement enables Inmarsat Government Inc. to participate in such contracts 
with the U.S. Government despite being owned by a non-U.S. corporation. 
Under the Proxy agreement, the Proxy holders have the power to exercise  
all privileges of share ownership of Inmarsat Government Inc. In addition, as a 
result of the Proxy agreement, certain limitations are placed on the information 
which may be shared, and the interaction which may occur, between Inmarsat 
Government Inc. and other Group companies.  
The Group maintains its involvement in Inmarsat Government Inc.’s activities 
through normal business activity and liaison with the Chair of the Proxy Board. 
Inmarsat Government Inc.’s commercial and governance activity is included  
in the business update provided in regular Executive reports to the Board.  
This activity is always subject to the confines of the Proxy regime to ensure  
that it meets the requirement that Inmarsat Government Inc. must conduct  
its business affairs without direct external control or influence, and the 
requirements necessary to protect the U.S. national security interest. 
In accordance with IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’, an assessment 
is required to determine the degree of control or influence the Group exercises 
and the form of any control to ensure that the financial statement treatment  
is appropriate. On the basis of the Group’s ability to affect the financial and 
operating policies of the entity, we have concluded that the Group meets the 
requirements of IFRS 10 in respect of control over the entity and, therefore, 
consolidates the entity in the Group’s consolidated accounts.

5. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker to allocate resources  
and assess the performance of the Group.  
The Group’s operating segments are aligned to five market-facing business units, being:  
› 
Maritime, focusing on worldwide commercial maritime services 
› 
U.S. Government, focusing on U.S. civil and military government services 
› 
Global Government, focusing on worldwide civil and military government services 
› 
Aviation, focusing on commercial, business and general aviation services 
› 
Enterprise, focusing on worldwide energy, industry, media, carriers, and M2M services 
Details of these business units are given on pages 20 to 37.  
These five business units are supported by ‘Central Services’ which include satellite operations and backbone infrastructure, corporate administrative costs,  
and any income that is not directly attributable to a business unit (such as Ligado Networks). The Group has aggregated the U.S. Government and Global 
Government operating segments into one reporting segment as the segments have a similar type of customer for the products and services and meet the  
criteria for aggregation under IFRS. Therefore, the Group’s reportable segments are Maritime, Government, Aviation, Enterprise, and Central Services. 
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 2. Segment results are assessed by the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker at the EBITDA level without the allocation of central costs, depreciation and amortisation, net financing costs and taxation.

For the 2017 interim dividend, the Group offered a scrip dividend election allowing shareholders to take their cash dividend entitlement in Inmarsat shares.  
This option was taken up by shareholders holding approximately 63.3m shares (2016 interim dividend: 43.0m shares), representing 13.9% (2016 interim dividend: 
9.5%) of our issued share capital. The scrip amounted to 1,617,973 new shares (2016 interim dividend: 946,283 new shares) and 0.35% (2016 interim dividend: 
0.21%) of the issued share capital, which represented a $13.7m (2016 interim dividend: $8.9m) cash dividend savings. These shares were issued and made available 
for trading on 20 October 2017 (2016 interim dividend: 21 October 2016). 
For the 2016 final dividend, the Group offered a scrip dividend election allowing shareholders to take their cash dividend entitlement in Inmarsat shares.  
This option was taken up by shareholders holding approximately 93.6m shares, representing 20.7% of our issued share capital. The scrip amounted to 2,973,025 
new shares and 0.66% of the issued share capital, which represented a $31.3m cash dividend savings. These shares were issued and made available for trading on 
26 May 2017. The option of a scrip dividend election was not in place for the 2015 final dividend.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is charged using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, as follows: 
Space segment assets: 
Satellites      13–15 years 
Other space segment, including ground infrastructure   5–12 years 
Fixtures and fittings, and services-related equipment   3–15 years 
Buildings       50 years 
Freehold land is not depreciated. At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group was carrying certain freehold land and buildings with a net book value of nil.  
Had they been revalued on a market basis, their carrying amount at 31 December 2017 would have been $30.4m (2016: $33.2m). Market valuation is based  
on the Directors’ best estimates. 
In 2017 the Group received government grants in relation to the purchase and construction of certain assets. The grants have been deducted from the cost  
of the relevant asset to arrive at the carrying amount. Government grants received in 2017 were $5.7m (2016: $3.1m).

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid on an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired  
at the date of acquisition.  
Trademarks are being amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are between seven and 20 years. 
The capitalised software includes the Group’s billing system and other internally developed operational systems and purchased software, which are being 
amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three to eight years. 
The Group capitalises costs associated with the development and enhancement of user terminals and associated network access costs as intangible assets and 
amortizes these over the estimated sales life of the related services, which range from five to ten years. 
Customer relationships acquired in connection with acquisitions are being amortised over the expected period of benefit of between 12 and 14 years, using the 
straight-line method. 
Orbital slots and licences relate to the Group’s satellite programmes, and each individual asset is reviewed to determine whether it has a finite or indefinite useful 
life. Amortisation of the GX programme finite life assets commenced when the Inmarsat-5 satellites went operational in December 2015.

ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW: GOODWILL 
Impairment reviews of goodwill are performed at the level of the Group’s cash-generating units (‘CGUs’). For the Group, these are considered to be the Maritime, 
Enterprise, Aviation, U.S. Government and Global Government business units. The recoverable amount of each CGU has been determined based on value in  
use calculations. The key assumptions used by management in these calculations are the cash flow projections, long-term growth rates and discount rates  
for each CGU.  
The impairment review conducted annually has identified sufficient headroom in the recoverable value of each CGU above their carrying value. A sensitivity 
analysis has been undertaken by changing key assumptions used for each CGU. Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the 
assumptions resulted in the recoverable amount of the CGUs being reduced to their carrying value. We do not anticipate any changes over the next 12 months 
that would result in the recoverable amount of the CGUs being reduced to their carrying value. 
Key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of the CGUs were as follows: 
($ in millions) Allocated goodwill Pre-tax discount rate Long-term growth rate 
Maritime 215.5 9.0% 2.0%  
Enterprise 54.8 9.0% 2.0% 
Aviation 46.4 9.0% 2.0% 
U.S. Government 50.6 9.0% 2.0% 
Global Government 54.8 9.0% 2.0% 
Total Group 422.1   
Cash flow projections 
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on the value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from the most recent financial  
budgets and forecasts approved by management covering a five-year period. The short and medium-term cash flows reflect management’s expectations  
of future outcomes taking into account past experience, adjusted for anticipated growth from both existing and new business in line with our strategic plans  
for each segment of our business. The cash flows also take into consideration our assessment of the potential impact of external economic factors.  
Long-term growth rates 
A long-term growth rate has been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity. The growth rate has been determined using long-term industry growth 
rates and management’s conservative expectation of future growth. 
Discount rates 
The discount rates reflect the time value of money and are derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risk associated with the 
CGUs. The risk premium, when compared with the Group discount rate, was consistent across each of the CGUs given the similarities in exposure to economic  
and competitive conditions.

Interest in associates represents the Group’s investments which have been treated as associates and have all been accounted for using the equity method  
of accounting. Individually, all of the investments in associates are deemed to be immaterial and as a result the associates’ assets, liabilities, revenues and  
profits have not been presented.  
Cash dividends received from the associates for the year ended 31 December 2017 total $2.1m (2016: $1.3m). The Group’s aggregate share of its associates’ 
profits for the year is $4.0m (2016: $2.4m) and has been recognised in the income statement.

EX-IM BANK FACILITIES 
The Group has two direct financing agreements with the Export-Import Bank (the ‘Ex-Im Bank Facilities’) of the United States. The $700.0m facility signed in  
2011 was available to be drawn down for four years and is now repayable in equal semi-annual instalments over a further 7.5 years. Drawings under this facility  
incur interest at a fixed rate of 3.11% for the life of the loan. In November 2014, the Group signed a seven-year $185.9m facility which has a total availability period 
of two years and is now repayable in equal semi-annual instalments over a further five years. Drawings under this facility incur interest at a fixed rate of 1.96% for 
the life of the loan. 
SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 AND 2024 
On 4 June 2014, the Group issued $1.0bn of 4.875% Senior Notes due 15 May 2022. The aggregate gross proceeds were $992.1m, net of $7.9m issuance 
discount. On 22 September 2016, the Group issued $400.0m of 6.5% Senior Notes due 1 October 2024. 
SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY 
On 22 May 2015, the Group signed a five-year $500.5m revolving credit facility (‘Senior Credit Facility’). Advances under the facility bear interest at a rate equal  
to the applicable USD LIBOR, plus a margin of between 0.70% and 1.70% determined by reference to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. At 31 December 2017,  
there were no drawings under the Senior Credit Facility.

CONVERTIBLE BONDS 
On 9 September 2016, the Group issued $650m of 3.875% Convertible Bonds due 9 September 2023. The bonds are convertible into ordinary shares of the 
Company and have a 3.875% p.a. coupon payable semi-annually and a yield to maturity of 3.681%. The bond is a net share settled instrument, meaning upon 
conversion the Group will repay the principal of $650m in cash and satisfy the remaining conversion value in ordinary shares (if the market value of the Company’s 
shares at settlement date exceeds the conversion price of $13.41 and the option is exercised by the Bondholder).  
Upon issuance, in accordance with IAS 32 the instrument was bifurcated between a cash debt component and a derivative liability component, being $545.5m 
and $104.5m respectively. The debt component meets the definition of net borrowings and over the term of the bond will accrete up to the principal value of 
$650.0m with the cost of that accretion recognised in net financing costs. The derivative liability represents the value of the conversion rights associated with  
the instrument and is accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. It is excluded from net borrowings with the mark-to-market movements recognised  
in net financing costs as this represents the movement in fair value of the derivative component of the bond.

Fair value of Convertible Bond at 31 December 2017 680.7 674.9 
The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 6.8% to the liability component. The total interest charge is split between 
the coupon interest charge of $33.0m and accreted interest of $16.1m, with both charges recognised in net financing costs in the income statement. The coupon 
interest is paid semi-annually in March and September with the liability recognised in accrued interest (note 20). Similarly, the bonds accrete semi-annually in 
March and September with the liability recognised in borrowings.  
The Directors consider the carrying value of borrowings, other than the Senior Notes, Convertible Bonds and the Ex-Im Bank 2011 Facility to approximate to their 
fair value (see note 31). The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 
Effective interest rate %  2017 2016 
Bank overdrafts  6.5% 3.8% 
Senior Notes due 2022  4.9% 4.9% 
Senior Notes due 2024  6.5% 6.5%

Overseas dividends received are largely exempt from UK tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. The unrecognised gross temporary difference in 
respect of the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is $nil (2016: $nil), resulting in a deferred tax liability of $nil (2016: $nil).  
The Budget announced by the Chancellor on 16 March 2016 included changes to the main rates of corporation tax for UK companies. The standard rate of 
corporation tax reduced to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017, and there will be a further reduction to 17% from 1 April 2020. The deferred tax assets and liabilities  
at the balance sheet date are calculated taking account of the forecast impact of the reduction of the corporation tax rate from 20% to the substantively 
enacted rate of 17%. 
On 22 December 2017 the U.S. President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which included changes to the Federal tax rate. The Federal tax rate reduced from  
35% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2018. The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated taking account of this reduction  
of the Federal tax rate.

25. EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTIONS AND AWARDS 
The Group operates a number of share plans used to award options and shares to Directors and employees as part of their remuneration packages. In 2014,  
the Inmarsat plc Executive Share Plan (‘ESP’) was approved by shareholders and replaced the previous Executive Share Plans. Share awards since May 2014  
have been made in accordance with the new share plan rules. Under the ESP, the Company can grant Bonus Share Awards (‘BSA’) and Performance Share Awards 
(‘PSA’), which replicate the previous Bonus Share Plan (‘BSP’) and Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) awards. The costs of these awards are recognised in the income 
statement (see note 7) based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Further information on how these are calculated can be found on the next page 
and under ‘Employee benefits’ in the principal accounting policies on page 120. 
INMARSAT EMPLOYEES’ SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN TRUST 
Under the legacy Staff Value Participation Plan (the ‘2004 Plan’), shares were transferred to the Inmarsat Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (the ‘Trust’) 
(resident in Jersey). These options have now vested and expired, but some remaining shares are still held by the Trust and can be used to satisfy vesting under 
other existing share plans.  
A summary of all share activity within the Trust as at 31 December 2017, is as follows:

1 Includes shares allocated within the Trust from the 2004 Plan 
BONUS SHARE AWARD 
Awards have been made regularly under the BSA to Executive Directors and certain members of senior management. Further information on awards granted  
to Directors can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 76 to 98. 
Awards are made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares. The performance conditions attached to the BSA are non-market-based performance 
conditions. Any dividends paid by the Company will accrue and be added as additional shares upon vesting.  
Under the rules of the BSA, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares. It is, however, the intention to 
generally satisfy the awards using newly-issued shares. 
As the BSA provides non-contributory share awards that have an entitlement to dividends and no market-based performance conditions attached, the fair value 
of the awards is the value of the grant. This is due to the fact that regardless of the market price at the time the award of shares is made, the total value of shares 
to be awarded (excluding shares added in lieu of dividends) will not change. 
In June 2017, an award was granted under similar conditions to existing BSA schemes for one of the business units.  
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD 
The PSA makes regular annual awards to Executive Directors and certain members of senior management. Further information on awards granted to Directors  
can be found in the Remuneration Report. Participants are entitled to receive the value of any dividends that are paid between the date of award and the date  
of vesting in the form of additional shares. Any such additional shares are only added to the number of shares which will vest subject to performance conditions 
being satisfied. 
The PSA shares will not ordinarily be transferred to participants until the third anniversary of the award date. The transfer of shares is dependent upon performance 
conditions being satisfied over the three consecutive financial years starting in the financial year the award date falls. The rules of the PSA provide that the 
Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares. It is, however, the intention to satisfy the awards using newly-
issued shares at the end of the relevant three-year period. 
The performance conditions for the PSA are based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) relative to constituents of the FTSE 50-150 and FTSE 350 
Indices (excluding investment trusts), depending upon the year of the award, and on EBITDA or revenue growth measured over a three-year period. For the  
award made in 2014, the vesting schedule is structured so that 50% of the reward is linked to the performance of TSR and 50% is linked to EBITDA, as individual 
performance measures. The market-based performance condition has been incorporated into the fair value. For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 awards, the vesting 
schedule has been restructured so that 30% of the reward is linked to the performance of TSR for Executive Directors (for any participants below Executive 
Director level this is linked to revenue growth over the three-year period of the awards), 30% is linked to EBITDA and 40% is linked to strategic objectives set  
out prior to the grant date of the scheme.

Fair value per share option (below Executive Director level) £7.63 £9.43 £9.41 
Both the BSA and PSA share awards expire 10 years after date of grant or such shorter period as the Remuneration Committee may determine before the  
grant of an award. For share awards outstanding at the period end the weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the BSA and PSA share awards  
at 31 December 2017 is 0.8 and 1.3 years, respectively. 
UK SHARESAVE SCHEME AND INTERNATIONAL SHARESAVE PLAN 
The UK Sharesave Scheme is an approved HM Revenue and Customs scheme. A grant made in June 2017 with an option price of £6.04 (reflecting the maximum 
discount permitted of 20%) will mature in August 2020. A grant made in June 2016 with an option price of £5.68 (reflecting the maximum discount permitted  
of 20%) will mature in August 2019.  
The International Sharesave Plan mirrors the operation of the UK Sharesave Scheme as closely as possible. Participants are given either the opportunity  
to receive options in the same way as the UK Sharesave Scheme, or the spread between the share price at the date of exercise and the grant price, delivered  
(at the Company’s discretion) in cash or shares. It is the Company’s intention to satisfy the awards using shares, some of which are held by the Trust and some  
of which will be newly-issued. A grant made in June 2017 with an option price of £6.04 (reflecting the maximum discount permitted of 20%) will mature in  
August 2020.  
Options under the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan expire after a maximum of 3.5 years following the initial savings payments having been 
made. The weighted average of the remaining contractual life for the current grant of the UK Sharesave Scheme and International Sharesave Plan at 31 December 
2017 is 2.1 years for each plan. 
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (‘ESPP’) is for U.S. and Canadian employees to purchase the Company’s stock at a 15% discount using funds accumulated 
from monthly contributions. A grant made under the scheme in December 2015 with an option price of £9.22 (reflecting the maximum discount permitted of 15%) 
will mature in March 2018. A grant made under the scheme in June 2017 with an option price of £7.16 (reflecting the maximum discount permitted of 15%) will 
mature in July 2019.

27. EARNINGS PER SHARE  
Earnings per share for the year ended 31 December 2017 has been calculated based on profit attributable to equity holders for the year and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue (excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust).  
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. 
These represent share options and awards granted to employees under the employee share plans. The convertible bonds due 2023 could potentially dilute basic

28. PENSIONS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 
The Group operates pension schemes in each of its principal locations. The Group’s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit schemes and defined 
contribution arrangements. 
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom, regulated by the Pensions Regulator, and The Netherlands. The Group’s principal 
defined benefit pension plan is the Inmarsat Global scheme, which is a UK funded scheme with assets held in a separate fund administered by a corporate trustee; 
the scheme is closed to new employees and the Company closed the defined benefit plan to future accruals during 2017. The trustee is required by law to act in 
the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the scheme. The trustees of the pension schemes are responsible for the investment policy with regards 
to the assets of the fund. 
The Group is required to ensure that the plan is fully funded where the future liabilities for benefits are covered by the fund’s assets. The Group is also required  
to make employer contributions at 15% of the members’ salary to the fund assets. The size of the asset that can be recognised as a result of a pension surplus 
should not exceed the recoverable amount and is restricted to the asset ceiling per IAS 19. 
The Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with the valuation undertaken by professionally qualified and 
independent actuaries as at 31 December 2017. The results of the valuation, which have been updated for any material transactions and material changes  
in circumstances (including changes in market prices and interest rates) up to 31 December 2017, are set out below. 
The Group also provides post-employment benefits for some of its employees. The Group’s principal scheme is the Inmarsat Global post-retirement healthcare 
benefit scheme, which is the provision of healthcare to retired employees (and their dependants) who were employed before 1 January 1998. Employees who have 
10 years of service at the age of 58 and retire are eligible to participate in the post-retirement healthcare benefit plans. Membership of this plan is multinational, 
although most staff are currently employed in the UK. The plans are self-funded and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid. The cost of providing 
these benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee groups. The Group’s post-retirement medical liability is 
capped at CPI plus 1%. 
Schemes denominated in local currencies are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between US Dollars and local currencies. 
The primary risk to which the Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan exposes the Group is the risk arising through a mismatch between the plan’s assets and its 
liabilities. This is primarily made up of a number of strategic investment risks. The key strategic investment risks inherent in the current investment strategy  
are as follows: 
› 
market risk (the risk that investment returns on assets are lower than assumed in the actuarial valuation, thereby resulting in the funding level being lower  
than expected) 
› 
interest rate risk (the risk that the assets do not move in line with the value placed on the liabilities in response to changes in interest rates) 
› 
inflation risk (similar to interest rate risk but concerning inflation) 
› 
credit risk (the risk that payments due to corporate bond investors may not be made) 
› 
active management risk (the risk that active managers underperform the markets in which they invest, resulting in lower-than-expected investment returns) 
and 
› 
currency risk (the risk that currency market movements adversely impact investment returns) 
In addition to the investment-related risks, the plan is also subject to the risk that members live longer than expected, or that the financial assumptions used in 
valuing the liabilities are not borne out in practice. This could lead to unexpected contributions from the Group being required to meet the benefit payments due. 
The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the Group’s pension and post-employment benefits liabilities under IAS 19 are: 
 
At 
31 December 
2017 
At 
31 December 
2016 
Weighted average actuarial assumptions:   
Discount rate 2.6% 2.7% 
Future salary increases 2.3% 3.2% 
Medical cost trend rate 3.2% 3.6% 
Future pension increases 2.9% 2.8% 
Mortality assumptions have been updated to reflect experience and expected changes in future improvements in life expectancy. The average life expectancy 
assumptions for the Company’s pension and post-employment benefits liabilities are as follows: 
 
Life  
expectancy 
2017 
Life  
expectancy 
2016 
Male current age 65 88.8 88.6 
Female current age 65 90.0 89.7 
  
Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 142 Financial Statements | Consolidated financial statements 143 Inmarsat plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financial statements | Consolidated financial statements 
 
 
Mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the individual scheme actuaries and reflect the latest available tables, adjusted for the 
experience of the Group where appropriate. For the Inmarsat Global defined benefit pension scheme and the Inmarsat Global post-retirement healthcare benefits 
for 2017, mortality has been assumed to follow the SAPS tables with -1 year age rating for males and CMI 2013 improvement with a long-term trend of 1.5% p.a. 
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, expected salary increase, mortality and healthcare  
cost trend rates. The sensitivity analysis below is for the Group’s principal pension and post-employment benefits schemes, and has been determined based  
on reasonable possible changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period assuming that all other assumptions are held constant.

of which are priced daily, except for the High Income UK Property, Liquid Alternative Strategies Alternatives and Multi Asset Credit funds which are priced monthly 
and the UCITS Alternative Strategies fund which is priced weekly. With regard to private debt, the portfolio will be valued on an absolute basis, using the ‘best 
efforts’ value on a quarterly basis. Therefore, fund investments are primarily valued based on the market value/capital account statements received from the 
underlying general partners of the underlying funds. Capital account statements and unaudited financial statements are distributed approximately 90 days  
after each quarter. The fund also distributes U.S. GAAP audited financials, including capital account statements, for each 31 December fiscal year-end around  
30 June of the subsequent year.

The investment portfolio seeks to mitigate the investment risks identified above through a combination of asset class diversification, underlying investment 
manager diversification and the use of currency hedging where appropriate. The assets are split into two portfolios, the growth portfolio and the matching 
portfolio. The assets within the growth portfolio are invested so as to achieve an appropriate level of growth above that of the plan’s liabilities, ensuring a sufficiently 
diversified portfolio of investments provides the plan with a variety of sources of return, without unduly exposing the plan to a single type of risk. The assets within 
the matching portfolio are invested so as to minimise the level of unrewarded risk and ensure the portfolio broadly matches changes in the value of the plan’s 
liabilities. This is achieved by investing in a range of pooled investment funds as outlined in the table above, with the allocation to each fund determined by a 
combination of the following: the nature of the plan’s liability structure, the target level of hedging deemed appropriate to reflect the Trustee’s risk tolerance  
and a ‘fair value’ assessment of market levels. Some of these funds achieve their objectives by utilising a range of bond or bond type instruments, resulting in 
leveraged exposure which enables the plan to match a greater proportion of its liabilities than would be possible by only holding physical securities. Instruments 
utilised within the funds include fixed interest gilts, index-linked gilts, corporate bonds, gilt repos, interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and total  
return swaps. 
The plan does not hold any direct investments in the Group; however, due to the pooled nature of the investment funds, there may be some indirect investment. 
The duration of the defined benefit liabilities within the Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan is approximately 26 years. The defined benefit obligation as at 
December 2017 is split as follows: 
Active members  0% (following the closure of the plan to future accrual effective 1 April 2017, all former active members have become deferred members)  
Deferred members 90% 
Pensioner members 10%

The average age of the active, deferred and pensioner members at the date of the last statutory funding valuation for the Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan  
(31 December 2014) was 54 years, 55 years and 68 years, respectively. 
The estimated contributions expected to be paid into the Inmarsat Global defined benefit pension plan during 2018 are $0.1m. In 2017 actual contributions under 
this plan were $0.2m (2016: $0.7m). 
Under the current Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan Recovery Plan and Schedule of Contributions there are no further contributions due in respect of the  
past service deficit revealed as part of the last statutory funding valuation as at 31 December 2014. The current Schedule of Contributions requires the Company 
to pay 15% of pensionable salary in respect of the additional accrual of future benefits for members of the defined benefit tier of the Pensionbuilder section and 
any notional member contributions payable under the SMART arrangement. Contributions in respect of the Defined Contribution tier and the Pensionsaver 
section are paid in addition.  
The next statutory funding valuation of the plan will be carried out as at 31 December 2017. As part of this, the Trustees and Company will be required to agree  
a pattern of contributions to cover any deficit revealed by the valuation, along with the rate payable for future accrual of benefits. This could lead to an increase  
or decrease from the current level of contributions.

non-cancellable contractual commitments relate to network service contracts and maintenance contracts, which have varying terms. 
The total of future sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 December 2017 relating to the aforementioned head office 
lease is $0.1m over one year (at 31 December 2016: $0.2m over one year).

Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent 1,254.7 1,239.7 
Capital 3,333.3 3,134.5 
The Group’s objective when managing its capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits 
for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The Group continually evaluates sources of capital and may 
repurchase, refinance, exchange or retire current or future borrowings and/or debt securities from time to time in private or open-market transactions, or by any 
other means permitted by the terms and conditions of borrowing facilities and debt securities. Additionally, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid  
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group uses a maximum ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA as an internal planning parameter and in regular forecasting and monitoring activities.  
In addition, movements in cash and borrowings as well as total available liquidity are monitored regularly. 
The net borrowings to EBITDA ratio for the year ended 31 December 2017 is 2.8 (2016: 2.4). The Group’s liquidity is disclosed in note 3(d). No changes were made 
in the Group’s objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the current or preceding year. 
31. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
TREASURY MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY 
The Group’s treasury activities are managed by its treasury department which reports into the Chief Financial Officer. The treasury department operations are 
bound by the Board-approved treasury policy and related treasury operating manual. The overriding objective of treasury activities is to manage financial risk. 
Key features of treasury management include: 
› 
ensuring that the Group is in a position to fund its obligations in appropriate currencies as they fall due 
› 
maintaining adequate undrawn borrowing facilities and 
› 
maximising return on short-term investments based on counterparty limits and credit ratings 
Treasury activities are only transacted with counterparties who are on the approved counterparty list approved by the Board. 
The Group’s foreign exchange policy is not to hedge its foreign currency transactions. Where there is a material contract with a foreign currency exposure,  
a specific hedge to match the specific risk will be evaluated and must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer prior to any hedge being undertaken.

FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group’s derivative financial instruments consist of forward foreign currency contracts which are primarily designated as cash flow hedges and the conversion 
liability component of the convertible bonds due 2023.  
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value (see further below) on the contract date and are re-measured at each reporting date.  
The change in the fair value is accounted for differently depending on whether the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting (eg where a forward foreign currency 
transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge) or not (eg undesignated cash flow hedges and the conversion liability component of the 2023 convertible bond). 
Under hedge accounting, the change in fair value initially goes through other comprehensive income. At the point hedge accounting is discontinued, ie when  
the hedging instrument expires, is exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the amounts sitting in other comprehensive income are recycled to the 
income statement or, where appropriate, capitalised to the balance sheet. Where hedge accounting does not apply, the change in fair value is included in net 
financing costs in the income statement.

Non-current portion of derivative financial liabilities 127.8 153.5 
The full value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and,  
as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. 
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are based on the difference between the contract amount at the current forward rate at each period  
end and the contract amount at the contract rate, discounted at a variable risk-free rate at the period end. The fair value of the conversion liability component  
of the Convertible Bonds due 2023 is determined as the difference between the market value of the Convertible Bond and the carrying amount of the liability 
component of the Convertible Bond. Both are classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 7.  
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values that are determined by reference to significant unobservable inputs, ie those that would be classified as 
level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, nor have there been any transfers of assets or liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy. There are no non-recurring  
fair value measurements.

The Group has entered into contracts to build the I-6 satellite. The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts (for terms equivalent to when  
the milestone payments fall due) to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these anticipated milestone payments, which are designated as cash flow hedges. 
As at 31 December 2017, the aggregate amount of losses under forward foreign exchange contracts deferred in the cash flow hedging reserve relating to the 
exposure on these payments is $7.7m. The milestone payments will take place at irregular periods throughout each year until 2021, at which time the related  
cash flow hedges deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit and loss. 
NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Non-derivative financial assets consist of cash at bank, short-term investments, trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income. 
Non-derivative financial liabilities consist of borrowings, trade payables, deferred consideration, other payables and accruals.

FAIR VALUE OF NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
With the exception of the Senior Notes, the Ex-Im Bank Facilities and the Convertible Bonds, the fair values of all non-derivative financial instruments approximate 
to the carrying value in the balance sheet. The fair value of Senior Notes, Ex-Im Bank Facilities and Convertible Bonds are classified as level 2 in the fair value 
hierarchy according to IFRS 7. 
The following methods and assumptions have been used to determine fair values: 
› 
the fair values of cash at bank, overdrafts and short-term deposits approximate their carrying values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments 
(see note 16) 
› 
the fair value of trade and other receivables and payables, accrued income and costs, and deferred consideration approximate their carrying values (see notes 
17 and 20 respectively) 
› 
the carrying amount of deferred satellite payments represents the present value of future payments discounted, using an appropriate rate, at the period end. 
This carrying amount approximately equals fair value (see note 19) 
› 
the Senior Notes due 2022 are reflected in the balance sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs and net issuance premium of $5.1m and $4.5m, 
respectively (see note 19). The fair values of the Senior Notes due 2022 are based on the market price of the bonds and are reflected in the next table 
› 
the Senior Notes due 2024 are reflected in the balance sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs of $4.9m (see note 19). The fair values of the Senior 
Notes due 2024 are based on the market price of the bonds and are reflected in the next table 
› 
the Ex-Im Bank Facilities are reflected in the balance sheet net of unamortised arrangement costs of $14.9m (2016: $18.6m). The fair value of the 2011 facility 
has been based on the implicit interest rate of the 2014 facility (see note 19) and 
› 
the liability component of the Convertible Bonds is reflected in the balance sheet on an amortised cost basis, net of unamortised arrangement costs  
of $6.6m (2016: $7.7m) (see note 19). The fair value of the Convertible Bonds is based on the market price of the bonds and is reflected in the table below

32. CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
The Group had authorised and contracted but not provided for capital commitments as at 31 December 2017 of $968.0m (2016: $972.2m). These amounts 
primarily represent commitments in respect of the Group’s I-6 satellite programmes. The Group has not reported the split between tangible assets and intangible 
assets for these capital commitments, as the necessary information is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive. 
33. CONTINGENT LIABILITY 
In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to contingencies pursuant to requirements that it complies with relevant laws, regulations and standards. 
Failure to comply could result in restrictions in operations, damages, fines, increased tax, increased cost of compliance, interest charges, reputational damage  
and other sanctions. These matters are inherently difficult to quantify. 
In cases where the Group has an obligation as a result of a past event existing at the balance sheet date, and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources 
will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated, a provision will be recognised based on best estimates and 
management judgement.  
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be 
measured with reasonable reliability. At 31 December 2017, the Group had no material contingent liabilities. 
34. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE 
Since the balance sheet date there have been no other significant events which would require disclosure in the 31 December 2017 financial statements. 
35. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
In the normal course of operations the Group engages in transactions with its equity-owned investees Navarino UK and JSAT Mobile Communications Inc.  
These transactions represent sales of airtime and equipment and are measured at the amounts exchanged. Group revenue from the related parties for the 2017 
financial year was $38.1m and $16.9m, respectively (2016: $33.1m and $18.2m, respectively). The amount receivable from the related parties at 31 December 2017 
was $12.6m and $1.7m, respectively (2016: $9.3m and $1.8m, respectively). 
Amounts owing to the Executive as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 were $1.2m and relate to remuneration earned in the normal course of operations (see note 8).

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the year ended 31 December 2017 
 
A) PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
