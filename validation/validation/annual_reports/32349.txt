Strategic report
 > Strategy focused on delivering 
shareholder value
 > Long-term cash generation from 
our Hull and East Yorkshire segment
 > Sustainable growth in our 
Enterprise segment
Dear Shareholder
Our objective is to deliver long-term, sustainable value for our 
shareholders. Our strategy is designed to offer shareholders 
a combination of income generation and value accretion. 
Strategic focus
Hull and East Yorkshire is core to the strategic direction 
of KCOM, and receives the majority of the Group’s investment. 
We are fully committed to completing the fibre deployment 
across our market to deliver premium services both to homes 
and businesses. This should deliver long-term sustainable cash 
generation, to continue to support our dividend policy. 
Our Enterprise business is focused on market areas, where we 
have seen good growth and where we have market leading skills. 
We are targeting development in this area to provide momentum 
in shareholder value. A key part of our growth this year comes 
from additional business from existing customers who recognise 
the value we can add to their business. This helps to give us 
confidence that our strategy is the right one. The Board expects, 
over the coming 24 months to see further substantial progress, 
in support of this strategy.
Clear focus 
on the future 
Chairman’s statement
Graham Holden 
Non-Executive Chairman 07 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Strategic report
While we continue the investment in our fibre deployment 
and the further development of our Enterprise business, I am 
pleased to confirm that the Board is recommending, subject to 
shareholder approval, a final dividend of 4.00 pence per share, 
in accordance with our existing commitment to deliver a 
minimum full year dividend of 6.00 pence per share for both this 
year and the year ending 31 March 2018. This reflects both our 
confidence in the strategy being executed by the management 
team and longer term prospects.
Board appointment
In October, Jane Aikman joined the Board as Chief Financial 
Officer. Jane previously held a number of Executive level 
positions, including her most recent role as Chief Financial 
Officer and Chief Operating Officer for Phoenix IT Group Plc 
until its acquisition by and merger with Daisy Group.
Jane has quickly established herself as a valued member of the 
Board and her fresh perspectives are already bringing additional 
strength and focus to the business. Jane will stand for election 
by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in July.
Board effectiveness
We continually consider the effectiveness of the Board and have 
a formal evaluation annually, which in 2016 was carried out by 
our Company Secretary. The conclusion from the evaluation was 
that we are operating effectively but there were some minor 
areas for improvement. We continue to monitor against our set 
of Board objectives which are detailed further in the Corporate 
governance section. In 2017, we will conduct an externally 
facilitated evaluation.
“ We remain in an environment 
of change and transition 
both internally and for our 
customers and markets. 
Each presents new challenges 
and exciting opportunities.”
We seek always to ensure that we have appropriate succession 
plans in place both for the Board and for the senior management 
team of the business as well as recognising talent right across 
the organisation. This has been a regular topic of discussion 
during the year and is covered in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 44. 
Good governance and responsible business 
Good governance is essential to the business and we seek 
to adopt best practice where it is beneficial.
In line with best practice, we have recently completed a 
consultation with major shareholders around some proposed 
changes to our Remuneration policy. I am pleased to say that 
they received widespread support and the policy will be 
presented to shareholders for approval at the AGM.
As a major business headquartered in Hull, we are delighted to 
be a Principal Partner for Hull’s 2017 City of Culture celebration. 
This 12 month programme is designed to bring a wide variety 
of cultural and artistic events to the city and provide a range 
of opportunities for the local community to experience the 
positive impact that this will bring. As well as supporting the 
events themselves, the business is supporting a number of our 
employees who are volunteering as City of Culture ambassadors.
We hope that the legacy left by the City of Culture programme 
will support the continued regeneration of the region for many 
years to come.
We remain in an environment of change and transition both 
internally and for our customers and markets. Each presents 
new challenges and exciting opportunities and we value and 
appreciate the energy and enthusiasm that our colleagues 
across the business show in making life easier and better for 
our customers. 
I would like to thank them all for their continuing contribution. 
This, coupled with the clear focus that we have on the future, 
gives the Board every confidence that we can achieve our 
ambitions as a business.

CEO’s statement
Continued 
transition
Progress towards the creation of
 > A regional fibre based services provider 
through continued deployment of fibre and 
development of over-the-top services
 > A provider of complex IP-based solutions 
in the Enterprise market, driven in the near 
term by expanding presence in contact 
centre and cloud services
Dear Shareholder
We are reporting another period of strategic and operational 
progress and remain focused on continuing to reposition the 
business as a provider of fibre-enabled services and IP-based 
solutions. Our fibre deployment in Hull and East Yorkshire 
remains on schedule to reach 150,000 premises by December 
2017 and we continue to see high levels of customer take-up. 
In Enterprise, we have strengthened our sales, delivery 
management and technical capability to respond quickly 
to customer demand and create a scalable operating model 
as that demand grows.
Our business is focused on three distinct market segments.
Hull and East Yorkshire: a stable, income-generating segment 
focused on our regional market. Our plan here is to grow 
through continued broadband penetration and the introduction 
of additional services that exploit our continued investment 
in the market leading fibre network.
Enterprise: our engine for future growth. Our focus is to grow 
scale and capability in the provision of complex IP-related 
communications and IT solutions to the Enterprise market.
National Network Services: our national, connectivity-based 
segment, where we seek to maximise the value from our legacy 
investment in national network infrastructure with a tight focus 
on the mid-market’s need for connectivity-based services. 
Bill Halbert
Chief Executive 09 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Strategic report
Progress
At the beginning of the financial year, we aligned all of our 
business activities under a single brand. This is enabling us to 
simplify the way we work and to adapt the size and skills of our 
teams in support of our core markets. We strengthened our 
management team at Group level and across our Enterprise 
segment to help to align the business behind our core market 
strategy and to drive performance.
As we indicated at the half year, we have tightened our focus on 
the two segments (Hull and East Yorkshire and Enterprise) that 
provide sustainable opportunities for the business in terms of 
delivering dividend support and future growth in overall 
shareholder value. 
The disposal of certain national network assets last year was a 
fundamental part of this repositioning. The proceeds received from 
this sale are being re-invested in the deployment of fibre in Hull and 
East Yorkshire and continuing the transformation of the business.
During the second half of the year we analysed our shared costs in 
order to allocate them more appropriately to our market segments. 
This improved insight is helping us to optimise our cost base 
going forward. 
Hull and East Yorkshire
In our Hull and East Yorkshire segment, our focus is on exploiting 
the value from the continuing investment in our network, 
particularly our ultra-fast fibre capability, through the introduction 
of quad-play services to consumers and additional network-based 
services to businesses. We have a total of approximately 145,000 
consumer and business customers in this segment. 
Demand for our fibre broadband across both business and 
consumer markets has remained high during the year with 
average take-up rates in excess of 30 per cent, where our fibre 
is available and we remain on target to make those services 
available to more than two thirds of premises by December 2017. 
Building on this fibre capability, towards the end of the calendar 
year, we plan to introduce an innovative approach to a TV 
proposition, which importantly will provide also the platform for 
further in-home ‘over the top’ content services and applications.
The anticipated decline in revenue generated from our contact 
centre and media services has continued and we expect this 
contribution to further reduce over the next year. 
Enterprise
Our best growth opportunity is within our Enterprise segment 
providing IT and integration services to UK-based enterprises. 
We have a primary focus on the development and support of 
IP-based solutions and services and have particular skills and 
experience in taking complex multi-location on-premise call 
centres to the cloud. This growing market for Contact Centres 
as a Service and professional cloud deployment for enterprises 
should mean that our Enterprise segment continues to develop 
as an asset light business with strong margins. 
This segment represents the biggest opportunity for growth and we 
remain optimistic about future progress and our ability to exploit the 
opportunities available. Current customers include Bupa, HMRC, Rail 
Delivery Group and Shoosmiths and each has grown from its initial 
contract size. New business has been signed with clients across a 
range of sectors, including Hastings Direct (Insurance), C Hoare & Co 
(Financial Services) and Dugout (Entertainment). 
The growth in our IP solutions activity is encouraging and the 
potential for this continues to develop, exploiting our unique 
combination of capabilities across cloud, internet, IT and 
communications. While we have seen early signs of revenue 
growth in this segment, margins were held back in the year, as 
we recognised the impact of incurred and anticipated cost 
overruns on the development stages of two fixed price, complex 
software implementations for a single customer. We continue to 
maintain a strong relationship with the customer, which we 
expect to continue to grow successfully. 
Following those early successes and the valuable experience 
we have gained in their implementation, we have invested in 
strengthening our sales leadership and delivery capabilities, 
including flexible resourcing systems and resource pooling. 
We expect these actions to result in a stronger pipeline of 
opportunities and margin expansion in the coming year. 
National Network Services
Our National Network Services segment focuses on delivering 
connectivity-based services to national organisations in both the 
direct and indirect market. 
This segment seeks to maximise the value of our historical 
investment in national network platforms and, while we expect 
overall revenues to decline in this segment as a number of legacy 
contracts come to an end, there are some areas of this market in 
which we can compete without the need for substantial investment. 
Primarily this is in the provision of multi-site wide area networks and 
other associated services. Existing customers for such services 
include RNLI, One Stop, Furniture Village and Domino’s.
We continue to seek ways to limit the effect of the decline and 
explore other solutions as appropriate.
Outlook
Evidenced by the progress made over the past year, the Board is 
confident in the transition of KCOM into a regional fibre-based 
services provider and a provider of complex IP solutions to the 
Enterprise market. We remain focused on creating a simplified 
business, with a cost base better aligned to the growth 
opportunities in our core markets, that the Board believes 
will generate long-term sustainable returns and growth for 
shareholders. Whilst we expect to make further progress in both 
Hull and East Yorkshire and Enterprise, as we transition away from 
commoditised services, we expect there to be a further decline 
in revenues and margins associated with our legacy activities. 
Consistent with our existing commitment to a minimum full year 
dividend of 6.00p per share, the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.00p per share, subject to shareholder approval at 
the company’s Annual General Meeting on 21 July 2017.

Market opportunities and trends
Enterprises are undergoing a digital disruption
 > The requirement to find technology solutions to 
business challenges is being driven by increasing 
customer expectations, growth in the number of 
communication channels and the need to adapt 
to rapid change
 > As a result, key priorities in digital transformation 
within enterprises include:
 > Increased focus on monitoring and improving 
customer experience
 > IT infrastructure consolidation and virtualisation
Contact and cloud services are key digital 
transformation strategies  
 > One of the key digital transformation strategies to 
improve customer experience is the enhancement 
of communications with customers. This has 
resulted in contact centres becoming a key step in 
the customer journey, and a route to a transformed 
customer experience
 > Contact Centre as a Service (CCaaS) offers 
enterprises access to a model that can provide 
multi-channel customer engagement in a more 
flexible and scalable way than traditional 
on-premise options
 > A further key digital transformation strategy 
is the transition to flexible IT models and cloud 
infrastructures that can adapt to changing 
technologies and be scaled to meet changing 
demand and customer requirements
Growth drivers for CCaaS and cloud
 > The market for CCaaS and cloud is estimated 
at £1 billion today and growing rapidly
 > 75 per cent of contact centre seats are still 
on-premise, and the opportunity to transition to 
CCaaS delivers opportunities not just to enhance 
customer experience flexibility and responsiveness 
but also to reduce costs
 > As enterprises have become reassured of the 
security of public cloud solutions, growth in the 
market for cloud consultancy professional services 
is being driven by the increasing complexity of 
projects and the lack of specialist skills in-house
Responding to market opportunities
Leveraging our CCaaS expertise
 > We are seeking to leverage our proven track record 
in migrating the largest UK contact centre to the 
cloud and delivering subsequent improvements to 
both customer experience and efficiency  
 > Our capability in this market is enhanced by 
our preferred partner status with Cisco and 
our Workplaces proposition, which is capable 
of customisation through technology from 
multiple vendors
 > Our target market for our CCaaS proposition, where 
we can deliver the greatest value, is larger enterprises 
that require complex integrations
Distinctive cloud capabilities provide competitive 
advantage
 > Our strengths in the cloud professional services 
market include a team of architects with significant 
experience on cloud assignments, partnerships with 
two of the three key vendor partners and a premier 
reference client that required high-end consulting, 
architecting and development work
 > We are differentiating our service in this market 
by targeting complex projects requiring public 
cloud-specific architecting and development 
skills associated with infrastructure migrations 
(Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)) and application 
architecture/development (Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)) as opposed to competing in the mainstream 
Software as a Service (SaaS) market
Medium and long term focus on expanding the 
markets served
 > While our current focus is on the CCaaS and cloud 
professional services markets, our capabilities will 
allow us to expand the range of markets we serve in 
the medium term to include the security and identity 
access management markets

Market opportunities and trends
Connectivity is key for businesses
 > While connectivity services are viewed increasingly 
as a commodity, they remain the foundation of many 
businesses’ technology platforms by enabling access 
to value-added services and applications
 > Large, multi-site organisations rely heavily on 
managed connectivity services, requiring flexible 
and scalable solutions and robust support to meet 
their business needs 
 > The needs of channel partners vary: service 
providers want best value connectivity with supply 
arrangements that allow differentiation and service 
excellence; carriers require access or backbone 
services to bridge their capability or add network 
reach; and systems integrators and business process 
outsourcers are seeking strong technical advice, 
support with service design, and innovation that 
translates into value for their clients
Responding to market opportunities
Helping customers navigate the complexity 
of connectivity
 > Our long-established communications expertise 
means we are well-positioned to provide not just 
reliable voice and data connectivity but also support 
and advice to businesses that enables them to 
innovate and go to market quickly with value-added 
applications for their customers
 > For large, multi-site organisations who are also 
potential future customers of our Enterprise services, 
we are focusing our efforts on the development of 
innovative wide area network propositions 
 > For service providers, carriers, systems integrators 
and business process outsourcers our focus is on 
developing call management propositions that allow 
their customers to handle inbound contact effectively 
and efficiently and present a uniform contact 
experience regardless of the channel used

Performance review
Jane Aikman
Chief Financial Officer
 > Revenue shows the effect of strategic 
repositioning away from traditional 
commoditising services
 > EBITDA is additionally affected by the cost 
of the national fibre network outsource and 
overrun of certain project costs
 > Re-investment of proceeds from sale of certain 
national network assets in the fibre deployment 
in Hull and East Yorkshire is progressing well, 
attracting strong customer take-up
 > Strong net debt management with favourable 
year-on-year underlying working capital 
movement
 > Proposed final dividend of 4.00 pence per 
share (2016: 3.94 pence)
Group performance
Our results for the period show an anticipated decrease in 
revenue and EBITDA. These arose, as expected, from our 
strategic repositioning away from our commoditising legacy 
business towards IP-based solutions, coupled with the additional 
cost of our national fibre network outsource, following the sale 
of certain national network assets in the prior year.
The performance in our Hull and East Yorkshire segment 
continues to benefit from strong fibre take-up, funded in part by 
the proceeds from the sale of these network assets.
In the Enterprise market, where we are uniquely positioned, we 
continue to shift our focus towards significant integration and 
collaboration contracts with key customers. The results for the 
year show growth and good progress strategically. Margins 
however were held back, as a result of cost overruns on two 
fixed price contracts relating to some complex software 
development projects for a particular customer. 
In September, we completed the extension of our banking 
arrangements, securing a facility of £180.0 million for a further 
five years through to December 2021, on existing favourable 
terms. This medium-term certainty reduces the Group’s risk and 
provides further opportunities for growth.

Segmental analysis 
In the prior year, we explained the changes to our segments, 
which arose as a result of the move to one KCOM brand. During 
the year, we have continued to refine our segments to align with 
the way the business is managed and financial performance 
is analysed. 
This included:
 > further analysing our shared cost base in order to allocate 
costs to the appropriate market segment; and
 > refining the customers and related activities allocated to our 
Enterprise segment. Contracts that relate to connectivity and 
network only business are now managed with our other contracts 
of this nature in the National Network Services segment. 
Enterprise is now focused on growth IP solutions business. 
Management makes decisions and manages the business in line 
with the segmental analysis set out below. This information is 
presented before exceptional items in order to provide a better 
understanding of the Group’s underlying performance. A 
reconciliation of the Group’s pre-exceptional results, along with 
the definition of contribution is set out in the glossary1.
Hull and East Yorkshire 
The success of our ultra-fast Fibre-to-the-Premise (FTTP) 
continues, in part funded by the sale of certain national network 
assets in the prior year. Our FTTP deployment cost compares 
well with our peers. We believe both our cost to pass and cost to 
connect are the lowest in the UK based on available comparable 
benchmark information. In Europe, lower costs exist in areas of 
multiple dwellings. Our costs to date are 7% lower than we had 
initially anticipated and our take-up rates are 3% higher.  
Our deployment is ahead of target and we expect to pass 
150,000 premises (more than two thirds of our addressable 
market) by December 2017.
During the year we have passed 45,000 premises, taking our 
total to 137,000 and take-up remains strong with 19,000 
premises connected in the year (including 1,400 businesses), 
taking the total connected to 43,000. 
Revenue has increased from prior year by 3% in our consumer 
channel. Our fibre deployment has enabled us to access more 
customers and has supported a 3% increase in Average-Revenue-
per-User (ARPU
1
). We continue to achieve market leading take-up 
rates in excess of 30% of homes passed to date. Broadband 
connection volumes have grown in the year and we have 
progressed our product development roadmap and plan to 
introduce new over the top services during the remainder of 2017. 
The small decline in revenue in the business channel can be 
explained by:
 > the impact of the Government’s superfast broadband scheme 
in the prior year, with over 1,000 small businesses connecting 
to our fibre service under this voucher scheme (£1.1 million 
revenue); and
 > lower year-on-year public sector spend, following migration to 
a Public Services Network (£0.7 million revenue).
After taking account of these factors, underlying revenue 
increased in our business channel. 
Wholesale revenues have declined slightly during the year as a 
result of lower voice revenues and, as anticipated, our non-core 
contact centre and publishing revenues have continued to decline.
Despite a small overall decrease in revenue within this segment, 
our underlying contribution has increased by 1% in comparison 
to the prior year.
1. Refer to glossary on page 114.
Enterprise
During the year, we have seen year-on-year revenue growth, 
through growing relationships with key customers such as 
HMRC and NFU Mutual. Our reputation in this segment is 
continuing to strengthen, as we develop our unique capability of 
delivering IP-based solutions which combine cloud, internet, IT 
and communications. Revenue has increased by 5% from prior 
year and our year-on-year revenue to our top five customers has 
grown by 16%.
Despite the revenue growth, margin and contribution for the 
year were lower than prior year due to the recognition of an 
estimated overall cost overrun on two fixed price, complex 
software developments for one customer. These estimated 
overrun costs have been recognised as a loss of £3.6 million for 
this stage of the contract.
We have strengthened the delivery management for those 
projects, together with other changes and we continue to 
maintain a strong relationship with the customer.
In the prior year we benefited from higher margin project 
development based revenues from our largest customer, HMRC. 
National Network Services
Without scale, it is increasingly difficult to differentiate our 
services in this highly commoditised market and, as expected, 
this segment has seen a year-on-year decline in both revenue 
and contribution. 
Our focus during the year has been at the larger end of the 
mid-market, where we can provide more value, this has resulted 
in higher churn with some of our smaller customers. 
This segment includes network customers which were formerly 
reported in our Enterprise segment (Large Corporate). As 
indicated previously, revenue from these customers has declined 
year-on-year. We anticipate a further decline of c£25.0 million in 
the year ending 31 March 2018, however, we expect the rate of 
decline to slow after the end of that year.
Central
Central costs include PLC and corporate costs, where allocation 
to the underlying segments would not improve understanding of 
those segments. These costs include share based payments and 
pensions, along with the residual Group cost of finance, HR, risk, 
legal and communications, once appropriate recharges have 
been made to the three business segments. 
Year-on-year, underlying central costs remain broadly flat, with 
slightly higher overall costs being attributable to a higher share 
based payment charge. 19 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Strategic report
Exceptional items
Our continued business transformation has resulted in the need 
to continue the restructuring of our business to ensure we have 
the right number of employees with the right skill sets as well as 
bringing together our activities under a single brand. As a result, 
and in line with our accounting policy, the Group incurred 
exceptional costs of £7.3 million during the period. These costs 
relate to the KCOM rebrand, alongside redundancy costs, 
systems costs and advisory costs as we ‘right-size’ the business. 
Exceptional items also include £0.7 million relating to 
regulatory matters. See Note 7 on page 95.
Refinancing, net debt and cash flow
Net debt at 31 March 2017 is £42.4 million (31 March 2016: Net funds 
of £7.4 million), representing a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.6x.
We aim to cover the Group’s core obligations (pensions, tax and 
run-rate capital investment), as well as our dividends, from the 
cash generated from our trading performance. In the year ended 
31 March 2017 it covered our core obligations and part of our 
dividend commitment. We remain committed to the stated 
dividend policy of a minimum of 6.00p per share for the year 
ended 31 March 2017 and the year ending 31 March 2018. 
The year-on-year increase in net debt arises as a result of 
capital investment (£47.2 million), dividends (£30.7 million), 
pensions (£7.7 million), tax (£8.0 million) and cash exceptional 
items (£8.3 million). As previously reported, the movement 
during the year also includes an £18.0 million VAT payment 
to HMRC in relation to the disposal of certain network assets 
in the prior year.
Underlying working capital was favourable year-on-year. 
Our days’ sales outstanding was 27 (31 March 2016: 32).
In September 2016, we agreed a new five year £180.0 million 
revolving credit facility, on the same terms as our 
existing arrangements.
Dividend 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.00 pence per share 
(2016: 3.94 pence), representing a total dividend for the year of 
6.00 pence per share (2016: 5.91 pence) consistent with the 
Board’s previously stated commitment of a dividend of no less 
than 6.00 pence per annum for both the year ended 31 March 
2017 and the year ending 31 March 2018.
Subject to shareholder approval at the KCOM Group PLC Annual 
General Meeting on 21 July 2017, the final dividend will be paid 
on 1 August 2017 to shareholders registered on 23 June 2017. The 
ex-dividend date is 22 June 2017. 
Pensions 
The IAS 19 pension liability at 31 March 2017 is £19.7 million 
(31 March 2016: £14.4 million). The increase from 31 March 2016 
arises as a result of a lower discount rate used to calculate the 
schemes’ liabilities, offset by a strong asset performance.
Our triennial valuation (as at 31 March 2016) has now been 
agreed with deficit repair payments of £6.7 million across both 
schemes until the year ending 31 March 2020. In addition to this 
amount, the Group makes pre-agreed payments to its pension 
schemes through the asset backed partnerships. The full year 
payment for both the current year and prior year is £2.7 million.  
Capital investment 
The Group’s capital investment during the year is consistent 
with previous guidance. The disposal of certain national network 
assets in the prior year enabled increased capital investment 
in order to continue to reposition the business.
Cash capital expenditure during the year was £47.2 million 
(31 March 2016: £31.3 million). 
The Group’s depreciation and amortisation charge for the period 
is £26.9 million (31 March 2016: £24.0 million), the increase 
resulting from the higher capital investment in recent years, 
which has an ongoing impact on profit before tax. 
Tax 
The Group’s tax charge is £5.7 million (31 March 2016: £17.6 million). 
The effective tax rate is 19%, this is slightly lower than the 
prevailing rate of corporation tax due the impact of prior year 
items, offset by the re-measurement of deferred tax balances. 
The prior year tax charge includes the impact of the disposal 
of certain national network assets during the year ended 
31 March 2016.

and share knowledge.
Customers People
Driving operational excellence
Our value creation is underpinned by four strategic pillars 21 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Strategic report
We recognise that our customers’ needs are better met 
if we work seamlessly with carefully selected partners 
to create combined service offerings.
Priorities for 2016/17
We aimed to:
 > seek to expand our ecosystem of technology partners that 
improve our speed to market, extend the reach of our 
propositions and increase the depth of our capability 
within the Enterprise market;
 > seek to identify and secure acquisition opportunities in 
line with our strategy within the Enterprise market; and
 > continue to support our customers on their digital 
transformation journeys by creating disruptive 
solutions with agile methodologies and a responsive 
ecosystem of partners.
Progress for 2016/17
We have:
 > worked increasingly with providers of niche technologies 
that, when integrated with the scalable, mature 
platforms offered by best-in-class providers such as 
Amazon Web Services, CA Technologies, Cisco and 
Microsoft, offer a balance of stability and innovation in 
customer solutions. For example, we worked with 
leading voice biometrics specialist Nuance to introduce a 
system for HMRC that allows its customers to use their 
voice to self-authenticate their identity. It is the first time 
a government organisation has adopted voice biometric 
technology for large scale, public facing use;
 > established a new partnership with EE for the 
provision of mobile services to customers;
 > exploited the increased flexibility we have, following 
the sale of some of our national network infrastructure, 
to choose the most appropriate provider of network 
services as part of customer solutions; and
 > worked increasingly with hosted platform providers 
for the delivery of services to customers, rather than 
developing our own platforms.
Priorities for 2017/18
We will:
 > review our long-established partnership with BT to ensure 
that it remains fit for purpose to meet our future needs;
 > seek partners for the development of over-the-top services 
for consumers in our Hull and East Yorkshire market; 
 > continue to develop and leverage our ecosystem of 
technology partners to increase our capability in the 
Enterprise market and achieve the most effective 
outcomes for our customers; and
 > continue to seek new critical partnerships.
Our customer service excellence is underpinned 
by robust processes and systems.
Priorities for 2016/17
We aimed to:
 > consolidate existing HR systems and applications 
within a single platform that allows us to deploy our 
resources more flexibly to support customer 
requirements; and
 > invest in technology to improve the customer 
experience at each touchpoint of their journey 
from order to delivery. 
Progress for 2016/17
We have:
 > completed a programme of investment in our critical 
systems infrastructure that has significantly increased 
its reliability and improved its performance; 
 > begun the transition to an API-centric IT architecture 
model, an agile and future-proof approach that 
enables us to benefit from the integration of third 
party applications within our infrastructure. This 
approach has been applied to our investment in HR 
Systems and during the year we introduced an online 
recruitment system and an HR service portal; 
 > invested in systems that allow us to align our IT system 
delivery roadmap with business goals and strategy; and
 > invested in implementing agile software development 
techniques that enable common ways of working and 
the earlier delivery of system enhancements.
Priorities for 2017/18
We will:
 > add capabilities to consolidate and build resilience into 
our existing IT systems; 
 > continue to develop our API-centric IT architecture; 
 > introduce an engineering mobility and scheduling 
system that will increase the efficiency of our 
engineering workforce in Hull and East Yorkshire and 
improve the experience customers receive during 
new service installations or fault repairs; and 
 > deliver system enhancements that improve 
the experience of customers in our Hull and 
East Yorkshire market.

Managing risk in our business
Risk appetite
The Board set out a clear risk appetite for the business last year 
and has spent time reviewing this again in the current year, 
concluding that it should remain unchanged. The risk appetite 
statement approved by the Board sets out the risk appetite of the 
business in a number of key areas in relation to commercial risk, 
customer experience, people, service availability, reputation, 
health and safety and compliance.
The risk appetite continues to show that as a business we are 
moderate in our risk taking, but we are willing to take greater risk 
for greater reward in the commercial decisions that we make. We 
are also risk averse in our approach to our reputation and to health 
and safety risk and will seek to reduce the inherent risks in these 
areas through risk avoidance or mitigation.
As a business we seek to obtain the right balance between risk 
and reward. We believe that all businesses have to accept some 
level of risk but we want to make sure we are taking the right 
risks and that we understand and manage the risks that we take. 
Last year we clarified our risk appetite as a business and now 
we consider our risks in relation to that risk appetite and the 
longer-term viability of the business.
In order to satisfy themselves that our risks are being managed 
appropriately, the Board and Audit Committee spend time 
during the year reviewing reports on risks and controls to obtain 
the assurance it needs. This assurance comes from a variety of 
sources. Further information on our risk management processes 
can be found on page 42.
As a result of this review of risks and controls, the Board can 
confirm that it has carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten the 
business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

Risk management
Our principal risks and uncertainties
As with all businesses, we are affected by a number of risks and uncertainties. The table on pages 26 to 29 shows the principal risks 
and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, that could have a material adverse effect on the business and have been 
identified through our risk management framework. This list is not exhaustive and there may be risks and uncertainties of which we 
are currently unaware, or which are believed to be immaterial, that could have an adverse effect on the business.
Longer-term viability
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
Directors have assessed the longer-term viability of the Group, 
taking into account KCOM’s business model along with the 
principal risks affecting the business.
Assessment period
Although there is no reason to believe that the Group will not be 
viable over a longer period, three years is believed to be the 
appropriate period of assessment as this aligns with the Group’s 
financial planning process and also represents the length of time in 
which we are able to confidently forecast financial performance 
taking into account both contract lives and the degree of change 
in our strategic segments of Enterprise and Hull and East Yorkshire.
Despite KCOM’s business model, particularly in Hull and East 
Yorkshire, reflecting the investment and operation of long life 
assets, the Directors believe that the pace of technological 
change and the level of market uncertainty support a three 
year assessment period. 
Stress tests
Stress tests have been performed on KCOM’s three year plan 
in order to assess the Group’s longer-term viability. This plan 
reflects KCOM’s strategy and planned investment for the next 
three years. The plan is supplemented by a rolling forecast 
which is updated on a monthly basis. 
We have stress tested our forecast cash flows in order to take 
into account severe but plausible scenarios which are linked to 
the KCOM Group risk register. These scenarios have been 
tested both individually and in aggregate and include the 
impact of principal risks such as a loss of market share in 
Hull and East Yorkshire, loss of strategic customer contracts 
in Enterprise, or a significant security or compliance breach 
alongside a material disruption to a key location.
Our stress testing assessed the likelihood of each scenario 
and the remote situation where all of our scenarios occur 
over a three year period. 
Whilst it is impossible to foresee all risks (or take into account 
risks which are currently immaterial which could turn out to be 
significant) further mitigation activities could be performed, 
for example reducing capital expenditure or discretionary 
spend or making changes to our dividend policy.
In making its assessment, the Board has made an assumption 
around the continued availability of funding. This includes the 
extension to our banking facilities which are now in place until 
December 2021.
Overall assessment
The results showed that for the period under review, our 
existing arrangements provide sufficient headroom on both 
an individual and aggregated basis. 
Based on the results of this review, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three year period ending 31 March 2020. 26 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17

Substitute technologies entering the consumer market
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
Much of our consumer business is 
currently based on the provision of 
services over a fixed-line network. If 
substitute technologies were 
developed to the extent where 
similar services could be provided 
without the use of a fixed-line 
network then this would clearly 
present a competitive threat to the 
consumer part of our business.
We are always seeking to improve our services to our 
consumers and to provide a speed and quality of service that 
would not be achievable over a wireless network. Our fibre 
deployment is part of this aim.
We also provide bundles of products and services that offer our 
consumers value for money and which would provide a clear 
alternative to a substitute technology, should one enter the market. 
We have also appointed a Director of Product and Technology 
Innovation in the year to drive our thinking around new and 
innovative products and services that we can offer to our consumers, 
either on our own or through our partnership arrangements.
The level of 
risk continues 
to increase as 
technologies 
develop.
How does this link to our strategy?
We are focusing more on new technologies and applications; therefore the mitigation of this 
risk is very much aligned with our strategy.
Growing revenue in our Enterprise segment to offset the decline of network-based revenues 
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
As noted last year, we continue 
to move away from the delivery 
of network-based services and 
are focused strategically on 
the provision of complex 
communications solutions and 
cloud-based services. There is 
a risk that, during this transition 
from old to new technologies, 
revenue from legacy activities 
may decline faster than revenue 
from the new services grows.
There has been a lot of focus internally over recent years on clearly 
defining the strategy for the business. The Executive Leadership 
Team (ELT) has participated in a number of strategy days where the 
strategy has been discussed and tested using various scenarios. 
There has also been strategic advice sought externally from industry 
experts, all of which has supported the strategic direction of KCOM.
We believe that our experience and skill-set give us a unique 
position in the market to provide our customers with new and 
more efficient ways to collaborate and interact, which in turn will 
lead to significant growth in the Enterprise segment, to offset the 
decline of legacy revenues.
As seen in the changes to segmental reporting in Note 4 on pages 91 
to 94, we have updated our reporting in the year to separate out the 
legacy network customers from the complex IP solutions 
customers, which gives us greater transparency in relation to the 
progress being made in the strategic focus area.
Whilst the sector 
continues to evolve 
rapidly, this specific 
risk to KCOM has 
reduced as the 
proportion of 
network-based 
revenue in the 
business decreases.
How does this link to our strategy?
We have made the strategic decision to move away from the declining network-based 
services, which means we are now focusing on the propositions that use newer 
technologies. This is the cornerstone of our Enterprise strategy. 27 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Upgrading of our network equipment
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
The equipment used to run our copper 
network in Hull and East Yorkshire, and 
to provide some of our national 
network-based services, requires 
regular upgrading as demand for 
broadband and cloud-based services 
continues to increase at a fast pace.
We are continuing with our investment plan to mitigate the risk 
of service failure from obsolete equipment. At the same time 
we are investing in the continued deployment of our superfast 
fibre-based broadband in Hull and East Yorkshire which 
provides market leading broadband speeds and which is on 
track to be available to approximately 150,000 properties by 
the end of December 2017.
The risk is increasing 
as the equipment 
nears the end of its 
life but the mitigation 
in place means that 
the net risk remains 
the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
Investing appropriately in our network equipment is part of our ongoing commitment 
to customer service.
Customer service and delivery
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
Our aim is to provide exceptional 
service wherever we can. The risk 
of not achieving this is therefore 
a key risk for the business.
Last year we reported that we were aware of some issues in 
the customer experience we were providing in our Hull and 
East Yorkshire business. During the year we have implemented 
new technology in our call centres and provided additional 
training to our people which has resulted in a reduction in our 
call waiting times. Our fibre deployment is key to ensuring the 
service received by our customers meets or exceeds expectations 
but we also continue to invest in our copper network to improve 
the experience for all of our customers where possible.
The level of risk 
remains the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
This links directly to the customer service element of our strategy.
Accuracy, security and confidentiality of customer data
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
The security, confidentiality and 
accuracy of our customer data is of 
paramount importance to us and to 
our customers.
We have clear and comprehensive policies in place and run 
mandatory training in this area for all employees. The forthcoming 
implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation, in May 
2018, means that there will be more stringent requirements in this 
area and we have formed a Steering Group, consisting of 
representatives from across the business, to focus on compliance 
with the new requirements. We also have a Data Strategy team in 
place to look at other data matters across the business, whose 
primary focus in the year has been the accuracy of customer data.
The risk is increasing 
as the volume 
and nature of 
cyber-attacks 
continues to grow 
and evolve.
How does this link to our strategy?
Our commitment to customer service requires accurate and secure customer data and 
this therefore forms a fundamental part of our strategic thinking.

Managing risk in our business continued
A breach of our regulatory obligations
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
As a provider of telecommunications 
services, we are regulated by Ofcom 
and there are multiple conditions 
and regulations with which we need 
to comply. We take our regulatory 
responsibilities extremely seriously 
and seek to ensure we are compliant 
in all regards.
We have an in-house Regulatory team which is responsible for 
ensuring we understand our obligations and that these are 
communicated to the appropriate people across the business so 
that we can ensure the necessary controls are in place. We have 
undertaken a number of internal reviews in the year to check our 
compliance and also work closely with our suppliers to make sure 
that our obligations are passed on and complied with in areas 
where we are reliant on third parties for the provision of services.
The level of risk 
remains the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
Our regulatory compliance requirements are embedded in our strategy in relation to processes 
and systems and also our partner strategy, due to the need to ensure our partners take 
compliance as seriously as we do.

Security and resilience of our networks and IT systems
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
We need our networks and IT 
systems to continue operating in 
order to continue to provide service 
to our customers. It is therefore 
essential that we have secure and 
resilient systems and networks 
in place.
We hold a number of standards that relate to security and 
resilience, including ISO 27001, the Information Security 
Management standard, and ISO 22301, the Business Continuity 
Management standard. We have a Head of Security and 
Compliance who is responsible for ensuring a consistent approach 
to security and resilience across the business and we have detailed 
policies and processes in place. We regularly test our resilience 
plans and have held a specific test in relation to our systems 
resilience in the year. Any lessons learnt from such tests are 
fed back into the resilience planning process, which in 
turn is continually reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.
The level of risk 
remains the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
This links directly to our strategy in relation to customer experience. Secure systems and 
networks underpin our ability to achieve this.

Health and safety
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
The health and safety of our people 
is of paramount importance to us 
and we have a number of people 
who undertake high risk activities, 
such as climbing telegraph poles, 
working in confined spaces, 
working alone or working next to 
roads. It is important to us to 
mitigate health and safety risk as far 
as possible to try to prevent incidents 
from occurring.
We have an in-house Health and Safety team which has significant 
experience in the health and safety issues specific to our industry. 
We have a comprehensive training programme in place which 
provides general training to all of our people through mandatory 
e-learning and specific training to those who undertake higher risk 
activities, which is then followed up by on-the-job checks to ensure 
our engineers are practising what they have learnt. For large 
projects which contain increased health and safety risks, such as 
our fibre deployment, we have brought in external health and safety 
advisors to work on the project full-time to ensure we are complying 
with all of the appropriate health and safety requirements.
The level of risk 
remains the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
This relates directly to the people element of our strategy and to the processes and systems 
as we seek to ensure that we have the appropriate safe systems of work in place for the health 
and safety risks we face.
Flooding
Why is it important? What are we doing to mitigate the risk? Change in level of risk
Flooding has become an 
increasingly regular occurrence in 
many parts of the country in recent 
years and Hull, where much of our 
business is based, is no exception. 
There were extreme floods 
experienced in Hull in June 2007 
and there has been smaller-scale 
flooding experienced at times since. 
There is a risk that such flooding 
could impact upon our business if 
we do not take the necessary steps 
to mitigate the risk where possible.
Prior to the 2007 floods we had already sought to mitigate the 
risk of flooding in the design of our telephony network and 
through using raised floors in some of our buildings. This meant 
that the impact of the floods in 2007 on our business was 
minimal. We have continued to improve our defences further 
since that time, installing powerful water pumps and flood alarms 
at key sites and flood defence barriers where appropriate. We 
monitor flood risk closely and are always alert to increased risks 
caused by extreme weather and high tides, so that we can 
activate our defences as necessary if and when required.
Where we rely on partners to provide services we seek to work 
with them to ensure that their services are resilient to flooding 
wherever possible.
The level of risk 
remains the same.
How does this link to our strategy?
This links to our customer pillar as it is important for our customers that service can continue 
uninterrupted in the event of a flood affecting our premises. We are also seeking to protect 
our people from the dangers arising from flooding by being alert and having comprehensive, 
tested plans in place to keep people safe in such an event.

Sustainability
Operating with a positive effect 
on our stakeholders and society
There are three key objectives that underpin 
our sustainability strategy:
  1
  To use our expertise in communications technology 
to create a positive impact on all our stakeholders 
and the communities in which we operate. 
2 
To promote our values, both internally and in the 
way we do business with external stakeholders. 
 
3 
To engage and empower our people so they can make a 
positive contribution to our sustainability strategy and 
the causes that matter to them. 
Our sustainability strategy covers four main 
areas that are taken into account when 
making key business decisions: the 
communities in which we operate, our 
people, our customers and suppliers and the 
environment. The Board receives reports on 
each of these as appropriate. Responsibility 
for the overall sustainability strategy 
sits with our Chief Executive, Bill Halbert.
Our sustainability strategy and initiatives are 
fully integrated and aligned with the key 
pillars of our business strategy.

Community
Charity and community support
During the year we supported 156 community groups and 
charities in Hull and East Yorkshire through the donation 
of funds, employee time and business services. Our 
employees spent 1,820 hours volunteering during the year 
by taking part in charity collections, delivering 
educational activities in schools and supporting internet 
skills sessions in the community.
Beyond Hull and East Yorkshire, we have continued 
our support of Teenage Cancer Trust, which provides 
life-changing care and support to young people in the 
UK who are affected by cancer. In the second year of our 
three year partnership our employees raised more than 
£70,000 to the charity, taking the total raised through the 
partnership to date to more than £162,000. 
We have also continued our patronage of The Prince’s 
Trust, the UK’s leading youth charity, which aims to change 
lives by offering training, personal development, business 
start-up support, mentoring and advice to young people.
During the year we 
engaged with 48 local 
schools and colleges.
We operate in a way that benefits local communities 
as well as supporting our strategic aims as a 
business. Our significant presence in Hull and East 
Yorkshire means we make business decisions with 
the potential impact on that community in mind.
Achievements in the year
 > Our employees spent 1,820 hours volunteering 
in the community.
 > We delivered learning activities in 48 local 
schools and colleges to help young people 
develop technology and employability skills.
 > Our employees raised more than £70,000 to 
our charity partner, Teenage Cancer Trust. 
The continued focus of our community relations programme is 
on activities that support the growth and sustainability of Hull 
and East Yorkshire’s economy and which increase life opportunities 
for local residents. 
Contributing to the local economy
Our commitment to supporting the region’s economy is reflected 
in our investment in becoming a Principal Partner of Hull UK City 
of Culture 2017, the programme for which is expected to deliver 
economic, cultural and social benefits to the region throughout 
the year and beyond.
We continue to be an active member of local business organisations 
including Humber Bondholders, which promotes the region as 
a destination for inward investment; For Entrepreneurs Only, 
a community interest company that helps local entrepreneurs 
create jobs and wealth; and C4DI (Centre For Digital Innovation), 
a technology hub that is helping to drive the development of the 
digital economy locally. 
We are also supporting the region’s economy through our 
ongoing deployment of fibre-based broadband, which is giving 
local businesses the fastest connectivity in the UK. More than 
4,000 firms are using it to become more productive and serve 
their customers better. 
Supporting the region’s young people
As potential future customers and employees, we want to 
support the region’s young people to fulfil their potential and 
become work-ready. During the year we engaged with 48 local 
schools and colleges, delivering educational activities designed 
to raise aspirations, support employability skills and encourage 
young people to consider careers in science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM). As an employer sponsor of the 
Ron Dearing University Technical College (UTC), which opens 
in Hull in September 2017, we expect to further increase our 
activities supporting STEM education in the region.

Employee engagement 
We communicate and consult with representatives from 
across the business on proposed organisational changes, 
and regularly carry out employee engagement surveys. 
In addition, our Change Network, made up of employees 
from across the business, exists to support and increase 
engagement with our strategy and the adoption of ways 
of working that are aligned with our strategy. Projects 
supported by the Change Network during the year 
included the internal launch of our new brand and the 
creation of a new framework for managing performance 
and development.
Our Change Network 
supports and increases 
engagement with 
our strategy.
Much of the value we deliver to customers is 
through the expertise and experience of our people. 
Our sustainability relies on our ability to attract 
people with the right skills and behaviours and 
to provide ongoing motivation, development, 
recognition and reward.
Achievements in the year
 > We have established professional communities 
and clear career pathways for each main area 
of the business.
 > We have introduced a new recruitment system 
and careers portal that will make it easier to 
attract and recruit people with the skills we need.
 > We have introduced a new HR advisory service 
to provide support for people managers and help 
them develop their skills in handling employee 
relations issues.
We encourage our people to make the most of the learning 
and development opportunities we offer throughout their 
employment with us. 
During the year we have continued our drive to develop 
professional communities as a method of fostering collaborative 
learning among colleagues within particular fields, as well as a 
way of identifying and addressing potential skills gaps. From two 
communities at the start of the year we now have eight, covering 
all the key areas of our business. 
Having brought together all our people within a single, 
integrated business, we have introduced regular events where 
they are encouraged to explore our shared ways of working and 
collaborate with colleagues from other business areas. These 
were attended by 180 people during the year.
Fifty-six people took part in our leadership development 
programme aimed at new people managers and potential 
future leaders. 
Gender diversity
We have clear policies in place which mean that men and women 
are given equal opportunities, both when we are recruiting and 
in developing and progressing once with us. As at the year end

Tackling digital exclusion 
88-year-old George Marsh recently joined the other 
1.94 billion people on Facebook.
The retired driving instructor took his first steps on social 
media at one of KCOM’s monthly internet drop-in sessions.
George is a regular visitor to the sessions, where he has 
been proving you are never too old to learn new skills.
Brandishing his iPad, he said: “I just like to keep my mind 
active. I have used computers before but at my age I keep 
forgetting things so it’s nice to come back in for a refresher.
“I really enjoy coming in because the people are really 
helpful and help you get to where you want to be. 
“I mainly use the computer for keeping up to date with the 
news and the weather. It keeps me informed with what’s 
going on in the world.
 “These sessions are a godsend really, without them I 
wouldn’t have much use for my iPad. It’s a lifeline.”
Sustainable relationships with customers and 
suppliers are vital to our success. We have a 
responsibility to treat them fairly and with the 
highest ethical standards, and to do business in a 
way that has a positive effect not just on them but 
on wider society.
Achievements in the year
 > We introduced an online feedback platform that 
allows us to engage more closely with customers 
and develop a better understanding of their needs 
and views so we can improve the service we 
deliver to them.
 > As part of our efforts to improve digital inclusion 
we introduced regular online skills sessions at 
more Hull and East Yorkshire locations.
Relationships with customers
We believe we have a responsibility to our customers to tackle 
the issues that are important to them in relation to the products 
and services they buy from us.
While being online brings many benefits including better access 
to government services, the ability to buy goods and services at 
lower prices and reduced social isolation, many people lack the 
equipment, skills and confidence to use the internet. 
We are striving to address this in our Hull and East Yorkshire 
market by making available affordable internet packages and by 
offering support to customers to develop their online skills in a 
relaxed environment and at a pace that suits them. 
Online safety continues to be a cause for concern among 
customers and as we engage with a growing number of local 
schools through our community programme we are making the 
most of opportunities to raise awareness among young people 
of how to protect themselves from potential online risks. We are 
members of the Internet Watch Foundation, an international 
organisation focused on making the internet a safer place.
As part of our efforts to ensure customers get the best possible 
experience from the internet services we provide, during the year 
we developed materials to help customers identify and resolve 
broadband problems caused by factors in the home, such as 
wiring and radio interference, that are outside of our control.
Relationships with suppliers
As well as treating our suppliers fairly and doing business with 
them in a sustainable way, we also have a responsibility to make 
sure that our suppliers operate with the same ethics and 
standards as us. 
All our suppliers are expected to sign up to our Supplier and 
Partner Code of Conduct, which sets out our expectations in 
relation to laws and ethical standards, labour practices, risk 
management and business continuity. We work closely with our 
key suppliers to ensure that we understand the way in which 
their business operates and their approach to sustainability.
Contracts with key partners and suppliers include provisions 
relating to mitigation of risks that may affect their ability to 
provide us with goods and services, and we carry out regular 
credit checks on all suppliers.
During the year we rationalised our supplier base to achieve 
economies of scale wherever possible and worked with individual 
suppliers to identify ways in which we can reduce their costs by 
introducing efficiencies such as streamlining ordering and 
delivery processes. These activities are aimed at ensuring 
we achieve maximum value from our purchasing. 34 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17

Reducing our energy consumption
During the year the following energy-saving measures have 
helped us to keep our electricity usage low despite 
installing additional street cabinets in the year. 
LED lighting 
We have replaced fluorescent lighting with LED lighting in our 
main offices, reducing our energy usage for lighting by up to 
40 per cent at these sites. We will include LED lighting in the 
specification for future refurbishments across our estate. 
Motion sensor controls
We have installed PIR (passive infrared) motion sensors 
to control lighting in buildings where this will achieve 
significant reductions in energy usage, such as in 
exchange sites, where visitors are infrequent, and our 
largest offices. We have reduced our energy usage for 
lighting by up to 40 per cent in these areas. 
Air conditioning 
We have installed inverter-driven and variable speed drive 
air conditioning in technical buildings (exchanges, switch 
sites and hosting facilities) where it can have the greatest 
impact in addition to reducing the volume of cooling 
required. Where we have done this it has achieved reductions 
in energy usage for air conditioning by up to 77 per cent. 
Our use of electricity still makes up the vast majority 
of our environmental impact, with 83.3 per cent of our 
CO
2
e emissions coming from the electricity we use at 
our offices, data centres and various network sites both 
nationally and in the Hull and East Yorkshire region.
Each year we seek to reduce our emissions wherever 
possible and we continually review and improve the 
recycling facilities we have in place at our offices, 
with the aim of making it as easy as possible for 
our people to recycle any waste we produce. 
Achievements in the year
 > Over 93 per cent of our waste has been recycled, 
with the actual tonnage of waste that has gone to 
landfill remaining broadly consistent at 17 .9 tonnes 
compared to 17 .4 tonnes in the prior year.
 > In the year the CO2e tonnes produced from 
our electricity usage has fallen by 1,861 tonnes 
or 11.1 per cent.

During the year the CO
2
e created from the combustion of fuel 
and operation of facilities has risen by 9.5 per cent. This is mainly 
due to an increase in the usage of refrigerant gases in the year, 
as a result of our phase-out of the R22 refrigerant gas to comply 
with the Ozone Depleting Substances regulations, which has 
meant the replacement of R22 when any work is performed 
on R22 air conditioning assets.
The CO
2
e created from our business travel has increased in the 
year by 3.7 per cent, reflecting a slight increase in mileage, 
rail travel and air travel in the year. We continue to encourage 
our employees to travel only when necessary, although we 
acknowledge that some travel is essential in order to do 
business and it is important that we are able to meet face-to-
face with our customers whenever necessary.
In the year the CO
2
e tonnes produced from our electricity usage 
has fallen by 1,861 tonnes or 11.1 per cent. This reflects a 
relatively flat number of kilowatt hours of electricity used in the 
year, but a lower carbon factor published by the Department for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which are the factors 
we use each year to calculate the conversion of our electricity 
usage and other carbon emissions into CO
2
e tonnes.

Directors’ report
Corporate governance
Appointment and replacement of Directors
It is the policy of the Board that all Directors wishing to 
continue in office will stand for election or re-election each 
year at the AGM.
The Articles of Association allow the Board to appoint a new 
Director at any time; however, the Articles state that the new 
Director will only hold office until the next AGM, at which 
point he or she must stand for election or vacate the office.
The Nomination Committee, and the Board as a whole, has 
reviewed the performance and contribution of Graham Holden, 
Liz Barber, Patrick De Smedt, Bill Halbert and Peter Smith, 
and has no hesitation in proposing the re-appointment of each 
of these Board members. We believe we have a diverse and 
balanced Board with a combination of skills that meets 
the current needs of the business and therefore all of these 
Directors are recommended for re-election on the basis 
of their contribution.
In addition, the Nomination Committee is delighted to have 
recommended Jane Aikman for election to the Board. Jane 
joined us on 17 October 2016 as our Chief Financial Officer 
and brings with her a huge amount of financial and sector 
experience, having previously been Chief Financial Officer 
and Chief Operating Officer for Phoenix IT Group Plc. She has 
also previously been the Chief Financial Officer of Infinis plc, 
Wilson Bowden plc and Pressac plc. The Nomination Committee 
believes that Jane is already making a significant contribution to 
the business and has further enhanced the range of skills that we 
have on our Board. Further biographical details for each of the 
Directors can be found on pages 36 and 37.
The Articles of Association state that the Company may remove 
a Director by ordinary resolution with special notice before the 
expiration of their period of office. There have been no Directors 
removed from office during the year.
Independence
The Board reviews the independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors each year, taking into account their tenure, 
relationships and circumstances as well as considering the 
behaviour of each Director at Board meetings and whether or 
not they contribute to unbiased and independent debate. All of 
the Non-Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Chairman 
were independent upon appointment and the Board believes that 
all three Non-Executive Directors remain wholly independent 
in relation to the criteria set out in Provision B.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
Commitments of the Non-Executive Chairman
Our Non-Executive Chairman, Graham Holden, does not 
currently have any other significant commitments.
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board considers that it has complied with all the detailed 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code throughout 
the year ended 31 March 2017.
The Board as a whole is committed entirely to the 
principle of achieving and maintaining a high standard 
of corporate governance.
The UK Corporate Governance Code is available on the 
Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk.
Board Committees
The Board has established and delegated specific 
responsibilities to Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees. Each Committee reports back to the Board after 
each meeting to ensure that the whole Board is aware of the 
matters considered by the Committees.
Each Committee has its own report which sets out the 
membership and attendance at the Committee meetings 
during the year, as well as further information on the role of 
the Committee. The Audit Committee report can be found 
on page 45, the Nomination Committee report on page 43 
and the Remuneration report on page 50.
How the Board operates
The Board has eight scheduled meetings a year, with other 
ad hoc meetings held as needed. During the year, the Board met 
nine times. The additional meeting was specifically held to 
consider the appointment of our new Chief Financial Officer. 
Attendance at the meetings during the year is shown in the table 
on page 39. Eight of the meetings were preceded the evening 
before by an informal meeting, allowing more time to debate 
issues in depth.
The Board agenda is set for each meeting by the Chairman with 
input from the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary. 
In addition, any of the Non-Executive Directors can request a 
matter to be added to the agenda at any time. At each meeting 
the Board considers business performance, which includes 
reviewing past performance but also looking at the future 
long-term success of the business. There is considerable focus 
at each meeting on the strategy of the business and updates on 
the progress in each of the key strategic areas are provided at 
each meeting, which form the basis for discussion and debate 
around all aspects of strategy.

Directors’ report
The Board receives monthly reports on financial performance, 
people matters, investor relations, governance, compliance and 
risk, regardless of whether or not a Board meeting is scheduled. 
There are also regular updates on key projects and strategic 
programmes, information security and health and safety. The 
Board also hears from external experts when it is believed useful to 
do so and during the year received a presentation from Forrester on 
the market opportunities open to the Enterprise segment, which 
reinforced the current strategy for the Enterprise business.
Board meetings are held at various KCOM offices throughout 
the year and the Board seeks to regularly meet both formally and 
informally with senior management from across the business to 
gain further insight into the day-to-day operations and the key 
risks and opportunities facing each part of the business. 
Members of the ELT and other key senior managers are regularly 
invited to attend the Board dinner or Board meetings to provide 
updates and give the Non-Executive Board members regular 
direct access to the management team.
There is a schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board which is 
reviewed and updated each year. This schedule requires that 
specific matters relating to budgets, strategy, performance against 
objectives, financial reporting, internal controls, communications, 
remuneration and governance, along with any proposed changes to 
business operations or the structure and capital of the Company, 
are referred to the Board for consideration and approval.
The Board also reviews contractual clauses escalated to the 
Board through our Contracting Risk framework and business 
cases escalated in accordance with our business-wide 
delegations of authority.
The Board considers the role of the Company Secretary to 
be key in ensuring that the Group and the Board have the 
right governance in place and that Board processes follow 
best practice. The Company Secretary meets with each 
of the Directors individually as necessary to discuss 
governance-related matters and provides a governance 
report to the Board on a monthly basis. The Directors are 
also able to obtain independent professional advice at the 
Group’s expense whenever necessary.

a prior commitment.
Training and development
The Board receives monthly updates on governance-related 
matters and more formal training where appropriate. Potential 
training needs are discussed as part of individual performance 
evaluations, plus each Director is given the opportunity to flag 
any additional training requirements which they may have 
identified as part of the annual Board evaluation process.
New Directors joining the Group are given a broad and 
comprehensive induction to the business, consisting of site 
visits, meetings with key personnel and detailed information 
relating to each customer segment and the Group as a whole, 
as well as any training specifically required in relation to the 
duties of Directors and their role on the Board.
Relations with shareholders
It is essential that we communicate effectively with our 
shareholders and understand their views. Our Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer meet regularly with our institutional 
shareholders to discuss the strategy, performance and 
governance of the Company and to obtain feedback. During the 
year, meetings have been held with 30 such shareholders. There 
are also general presentations following the half year and final 
results announcements each year.
The Chairman ensures that an investor relations report setting 
out any feedback from shareholders is provided to the Board 
each month and discussed at each Board meeting, so that all 
of our Directors are kept informed of investor views. 
Any member of our Board, including our Senior Independent 
Director, is available to meet face to face with our institutional 
shareholders if requested to do so and one such meeting has 
been held during the year.
We have a large number of shareholders who live in the Hull 
and East Yorkshire region and the KCOM business is very much 
involved in local life in the area. There is more information about 
our community activities in the Sustainability section on page 31. 
We believe that being involved in the local community in Hull 
and East Yorkshire helps us to better understand our local 
shareholders and the issues that are important to them.
We consider our AGM to be an important means of 
communication between our shareholders and Directors. All of 
our Directors will be available at the AGM to answer questions 
and we would encourage our shareholders to come along to 
speak with them.
We use electronic voting at our AGM each year. The results 
of voting, including the proxy votes lodged, are shown to 
shareholders in the meeting and are made available after 
the meeting on our website.
All of our Company announcements are published on our 
website, www.kcomplc.com, together with presentation 
materials and financial reports, so that all of our shareholders 
can keep up to date with our news.
Business model and key performance indicators
The details of our business model can be found on pages 10 and 
11 and our key performance indicators are on pages 22 and 23.
Proposal to re-appoint the external auditors
During the year there was a comprehensive external audit 
retender process held, to which six external audit firms 
were invited. There is further information on the process on 
page 46. As a result of the process, the Audit Committee has 
recommended to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
are re-appointed and a resolution to re-appoint them will be 
proposed at the AGM. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have 
advised of their willingness to continue in office and have 
confirmed their continued independence. They have provided 
an independent audit opinion on these accounts which can 
be found on page 74. 40 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17
Directors’ report
Corporate governance continued
This year the evaluation review confirmed that the Board 
continues to operate effectively and there were a number of key 
strengths identified, including:
 > the support and constructive challenge of the Chairman;
 > the productive and inclusive debate in the boardroom;
 > the balance of skills and experience on the Board;
 > the approach to governance, which is perceived to be taken 
seriously and handled well; and
 > effective interaction with the senior management team to 
enhance Board understanding of the business.
The areas where improvement could be made or where it was 
important to continue work already begun were noted to be in 
relation to a requirement for increased visibility of non-financial 
data to enhance business understanding and in relation to 
succession planning at a senior management level, to identify 
and nurture future leaders as well as developing skills across 
the business to meet future skills requirements.
The objectives that were consequently adopted by the Board for 
the current year were therefore:
 > to have visibility of an increased volume of non-financial data 
to enhance the Board understanding of operational matters 
and to enable continued consideration of a broad range of 
stakeholders in Board discussions;
 > to focus on succession planning for the senior management 
team, with reference to current skills in comparison to future 
skills requirements, as well as continuing the discussion in 
relation to Board succession;
 > to invite a thought leader from the IT services sector to speak 
openly with the Board regarding the future of the sector, to 
enable a full debate around the future strategy of the business;
 > to continue the increased contact time and frequency 
between the Board and the senior management team, to 
enable detailed understanding of relevant operational and 
strategic matters; and
 > to continue to ensure a full debate in the boardroom with input 
encouraged from all Board members, to safeguard this as a 
key strength of the Board.
In addition to the annual Board evaluation, the Non-Executive 
Chairman meets with each Board member individually on at least 
an annual basis to discuss their own performance and to identify 
any areas for development or potential training needs. The 
Non-Executive Directors also meet separately to evaluate the 
performance of the Non-Executive Chairman. The feedback 
from this meeting is then passed on to the Non-Executive 
Chairman by the Senior Independent Director.
Non-Executive Director meetings
The Non-Executive Directors have regular dialogue with each 
other concerning Board matters and the Non-Executive 
Chairman met with the Non-Executive Directors, without the 
other Directors present, at regular intervals during the year.
Powers of the Directors
The business of the Company is managed by the Directors, who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company, subject to the 
provisions of the Articles of Association, relevant statutes and 
any special resolution of the Company.
Performance evaluation
Our annual Board evaluation took place in the summer of 2016 and was conducted by our Company Secretary, Kathy Smith, who 
met with each Board member individually to obtain their feedback on the Board and its Committees. The last external Board 
evaluation took place in the summer of 2014 and the Board has committed to seek another external evaluation in 2017.
Last year the Board defined five objectives as a result of the annual Board evaluation:
Objective What has the Board done to meet this objective?
1.  To ensure full debate around agenda items, with 
everyone having a chance to provide their input.
The Chairman ensures that every member of the Board is asked for 
their input on each topic so that the views of the whole Board are 
known and included in the debate. This was identified as a particular 
strength in the 2016 evaluation.
2.  To increase the contact time between Board members 
and senior management, both formally and informally.
The Board meets for dinner the evening before each scheduled Board 
meeting and throughout the year members of the senior management 
team have attended the dinner, where there is extended discussion on 
specific areas of the business. In addition there have been a number of 
informal meetings between the Non-Executive Directors and members 
of the senior management at the various KCOM sites throughout the year.
3.  To focus on City matters in Board meetings to raise the 
knowledge and awareness of the way in which KCOM 
interfaces with the City.
Our brokers attended a Board meeting during the year to present to 
the Board. In addition, feedback from shareholder meetings is a 
standing agenda item for the Board at each meeting. The amount of 
City knowledge on the Board has also increased through the 
appointment of Jane Aikman during the year, who has considerable 
experience as a listed company director.
4.  To continue to consider a broad range of stakeholders in 
Board discussions, including customers, shareholders, 
colleagues, suppliers and the communities and 
environment in which KCOM operates.
The diversity and experience of the Board brings different perspectives 
to the Board discussion and there is a review ongoing to identify 
any additional reporting to the Board which would further enhance 
discussions and understanding to ensure continued consideration 
of a broad range of stakeholders.
5.  To complete the development and documentation of a 
clear plan for Board and senior management succession.
Succession planning has been discussed at both the Board and 
Nomination Committee and clear progress has been made in this area. 41 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
The Articles of Association give the Directors the power to 
authorise conflicts of interest in relation to transactions or 
arrangements with the Company, in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006. Conflicts of interest are a standing agenda 
item at Board meetings and each Director proposes any potential 
conflicts for consideration as soon as they become aware of them. 
The Director with the potential conflict is excluded from the vote 
to authorise the transaction or arrangement.
Any conflicts that are authorised are then logged on a register, 
along with details of any specific terms imposed upon 
authorisation. Internal controls are in place to ensure that 
transactions or arrangements which may lead to a potential 
conflict of interest are conducted on an arm’s length basis.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have prepared the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU). Under 
company law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website, www.kcomplc.com. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules
Each of the Directors as at 31 March 2017 whose names and 
functions are listed on pages 36 and 37 confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge:
 > the financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group and Company; and
 > the Strategic report and Directors’ report contained in the 
Annual Report include a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group 
and Company, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
Conclusion on the Annual Report
The Board is responsible for reviewing the Annual Report and, 
after consideration, has concluded that the Annual Report, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and that it 
provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess 
the Group’s position, performance, business model and 
strategy. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered 
the different types of shareholders that the Group has, the 
reports and presentations that the Board has received during the 
year and the reports submitted to the Audit Committee during 
the year by both the internal and external auditors and combined 
this with the Board’s collective knowledge of the business, 
gained through both formal and informal meetings and personal 
interactions across the Group at all levels. Further information on 
the reports submitted to the Audit Committee can be found in 
the Audit Committee report on pages 45 to 47.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 March 2017, the Company had been notified of the following interests amounting to three per cent or more of the voting

Directors’ report
We have a risk management framework in place to help us to 
identify, assess, measure, manage and monitor our key risks in 
a consistent way. We define key risks to be anything that may 
prevent us from meeting our objectives. The framework is aligned 
with guidance from the Financial Reporting Council to provide us 
with a single picture of the threats and uncertainties we face.
The risks that are identified and recorded by the framework are 
reviewed regularly by the ELT and then escalated twice-yearly 
to the Board.
The framework has been in place throughout the year under 
review, and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report.
Risk management responsibilities
The Board
The Board has overall responsibility for setting the risk appetite 
for the business and for ensuring that the overall risk profile is 
aligned with this. It is also responsible for ensuring that the 
business maintains sound internal control and risk management 
systems, as well as reviewing the effectiveness of those systems.
In order to do this, the Board has regular meetings with members 
of senior management and receives regular reports from each 
business area, the internal auditors and the external auditors 
on the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and risk 
management. The Board is satisfied that the systems are embedded 
within the day-to-day activities of the business and cover all material 
controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls, 
and that the business continues to be compliant with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to internal control.
Executive Leadership Team
The ELT is responsible for reviewing the risks that have been 
recorded, to ensure completeness and accuracy, as well as 
assessing the suitability of the mitigations in place and any 
proposed timescales for further controls to be implemented.
Audit Committee
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee in relation to risk 
management are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 
45 to 47.
Financial risk management
Each business area produces an annual budget which is 
reviewed by senior management and ultimately approved by the 
Board. A longer-term three year plan is also in place which is 
updated annually and approved by the Board to enable it to have 
a clear longer-term view of financial projections.
We also prepare a monthly rolling forecast; performance against 
budget and the forecast is monitored at monthly ELT meetings 
and reviewed by the Board each month. Further information 
about the financial risk management policies in place, and, in 
particular, the way in which credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate 
risk and foreign currency risk are managed, is in Note 27 to the 
financial statements.
Controls around consolidation
The basis of consolidation for the financial statements is detailed 
in Note 2 to the financial statements. Strong controls are in place 
around the process for preparing consolidated accounts. The 
work of consolidation is performed by experienced, qualified 
accountants and a review of the consolidation forms part of the 
audit work performed by our external auditors.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the business are set 
out on pages 24 to 29 of the Strategic report.
Our risk management framework
Amendments to the Company’s Articles 
of Association
Any amendments to the Company’s Articles of Association may 
be made by passing a special resolution at a general meeting of 
the shareholders.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that, having reviewed the Group’s budget 
and forecasts along with the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group, they are satisfied that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group continues to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Our risk management framework
For us, risk management is about taking the right amount of risk to 
support our business strategy and to align with our risk appetite. 
Further information on our risk appetite can be found on page 24.
We seek to understand our risks so that informed decisions can 
be taken from a risk perspective and so that risks can be either

Corporate governance continued
The membership and attendance at Committee meetings during 
the year are shown in the table above.
The Nomination Committee is a sub-committee of the Board 
and meets as often as required. It is responsible for reviewing 
the structure, size and composition of the Board and ensuring 
that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of the 
Board is right for the Group, both for the current challenges 
and opportunities facing the Group and the skills and expertise 
that are expected to be needed on the Board in the future.
Board Appointments policy
We have a Board Appointments policy, which sets out the 
procedure that will be followed in the event of a Board vacancy 
being identified along with our approach to diversity on the Board.
The key principle set out in the policy is that the Board will 
always seek to appoint on merit. The Board recognises the 
benefits of diversity of all types, including gender, professional 
and ethnic diversity, and will always aim to develop the diversity 
of the Board in order to promote a range of perspectives in the 
boardroom, while remaining true to the key principle of 
appointing on merit.
The Board Appointments policy also states that the Nomination 
Committee will only use firms that have signed up to the 
Executive Search Firms’ Voluntary Code of Conduct, addressing 
gender diversity and best practice; that female applicants are 
given the same consideration and opportunity as male applicants; 
and that gender diversity is considered specifically when 
drawing up a list of potential candidates.

Directors’ report
Corporate governance continued
Board Appointments policy continued
In addition, through the Board Appointments policy, the Board 
has committed to:
 > continue to seek to identify and develop the talented 
individuals in the business, regardless of gender;
 > review regularly the proportion of women at each level 
in the organisation to ensure that equal opportunities are 
being presented to individuals at every level; and
 > always ensure that there is a confidential way in which 
concerns can be raised without fear of repercussion if anyone, 
regardless of gender, has a concern about the opportunities 
available to them.
We are proud to note that whilst the number of females in the 
organisation is 34 per cent of our total number of employees, 
the number of females in our Executive Leadership Team sits 
at 43 per cent, which is reflective of the equal opportunities 
that we provide across the organisation. We also have two 
female Directors on the Board and a female Company Secretary 
who participates fully in our Board meetings.
When Board vacancies arise, the Nomination Committee is 
responsible for preparing a description of the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment and then 
identifying and nominating candidates for the approval of the 
Board. In order to identify suitable candidates the Committee 
uses open advertising or the services of external advisors to 
facilitate the search, where appropriate.

Succession planning
The Committee is also responsible for considering succession 
planning for the Directors and for key senior management across 
the Group, although this is a matter also considered by the full 
Board. This includes identifying future talent within the business 
and providing experience and training as appropriate to enable 
individuals to be ready to step up to the next level. 
For succession planning for the Board, the Committee works 
to the principle of continuity on the rest of the Board when 
planned changes take place at a senior level and that Executive 
succession will be largely event driven, dependent on the 
delivery of key strategic milestones. The Committee has 
considered both short-term emergency succession planning 
and longer-term succession planning in the year.
Other Committee responsibilities
The Nomination Committee reviews annually the time required 
from each of the Directors to perform their roles effectively. 
Following this review, the Committee is satisfied that each of 
the Directors has committed sufficient time during the year 
to fulfil their duties as Directors of the Company. 
The Committee reviews the re-appointment of all of the 
Directors standing for re-election at the AGM, giving regard 
to their performance and ability to continue to contribute to 
the requirements of the Board. The performance of Directors 
with more than six years’ service is given particular attention, 
including a review of their independence, where applicable. 
The Nomination Committee then makes recommendations to 
the Board on whether each Director should be put forward 
for re-election. Information on the recommendations for 
re-election this year can be found on page 38.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with the 
recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators' 
(ICSA) Guidance on Terms of Reference for Nomination 
Committees. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available 
from the Company Secretary and are on our website, 
www.kcomplc.com.

Appointment in the year
During the year we appointed Jane Aikman to the role of 
Chief Financial Officer. When the vacancy for the role 
arose, the Nomination Committee drafted the role profile in 
consultation with Bill Halbert, our Chief Executive. The 
Committee appointed Odgers Berndtson as independent 
external advisors to lead the search and they met with 
several key stakeholders within the KCOM business to 
further enhance their understanding of the role and the 
skills required.
Odgers Berndtson performed an external search and 
presented a shortlist of candidates to the Nomination 
Committee. The candidates were interviewed by 
Bill Halbert and our Chief People Officer, Clare Dyer, with 
the strongest candidate then meeting with Graham Holden, 
as Chairman of the Nomination Committee, and Liz Barber, 
as a member of the Nomination Committee with current 
experience of operating as a chief financial officer.
The preferred candidate then met with the other 
Non-Executive Directors and references were taken up 
before a Nomination Committee meeting was held to confirm 
the recommendation of the appointment of Jane to the Board.
The Committee believes that Jane was the outstanding 
candidate for the role and meets the requirements that were 
set out at the beginning in terms of skills and experience. 45 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

The table above shows the membership and attendance at 
Committee meetings during the year.
The Audit Committee is a sub-committee of the Board and is 
responsible for reviewing all aspects of the financial reporting of 
the business and of internal control. The Committee represents 
the interests of our shareholders in relation to the integrity of 
information and the effectiveness of the audit processes in place.
Composition
For most of the year under review, the Audit Committee has 
consisted of three Non-Executive Directors. In the period up to 
22 July 2016, Tony Illsley was also a member of the Committee 
but he stepped down from the Committee upon his retirement 
from the Board.
The Committee is chaired by Liz Barber, who is a Fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and 
who currently works as Group Director of Finance, Regulation 
and Markets at Kelda Group, having previously been the Head of 
Audit for the North of England at Ernst & Young. Given her 
current and previous roles, the Board considers that she has the 
relevant recent financial experience necessary to fulfil the role 
of Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Committee meetings are also attended by the Executive 
Directors, the Director of Group Finance Services, the Company 
Secretary and representatives from the internal and external 
auditors. The external auditors also meet with individual 
members of the Audit Committee during the year, without the 
other attendees present. The internal auditors also meet 
separately with the Chairman of the Audit Committee without 
the other attendees present.

of the disclosures made, although the ultimate responsibility 
for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and financial 
statements remains with the Board;
 > reviewing the effectiveness and independence of any 
whistleblowing investigations undertaken as a result of such 
concerns being raised;
 > reviewing the procedures in place for the detection of fraud 
and the prevention of bribery across the business; and
 > overseeing the relationship with the external auditors.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with the 
recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
the ICSA Guidance on Terms of Reference for Audit 
Committees. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available 
from the Company Secretary and are on our website at 
www.kcomplc.com.
External audit
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditors to ensure that the external auditors 
continue to be independent, objective and effective in their work.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were appointed as auditors in 2006 
and therefore during the year to 31 March 2017 the Committee 
undertook a competitive tender process in accordance 
with the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services Order.
The Committee invited six audit firms to confirm their 
independence and to participate in the process. Two were 
unable to confirm their independence and were therefore excluded 
from the process and a third firm chose not to participate. The 
remaining three firms were all provided with access to a data room, 
containing relevant information about the business, and were 
invited to a day of meetings with key individuals from KCOM. Each 
of the three firms then submitted a written proposal and all three 
were then invited to present to the Audit Committee, plus selected 
key stakeholders, before a final decision was taken.
The Committee set out criteria on which the decision would 
be based and measured each of the firms on the basis of team 
competence, service approach, communication, people, 
commitment, fees, message and style, rapport and cultural fit. 
The final decision was discussed at length at the conclusion of 
the Audit Committee meeting in March 2017 and it was decided 
to recommend that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-appointed 
as auditors at the AGM in 2017.
There are no contractual obligations in place which would 
restrict the choice of external auditors by the Committee.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the 
external audit process in the year through meetings and reviewing 
the reports from the external audit team. The Committee has 
concluded that the external audit process was effective and is 
satisfied that the scope of the audit is appropriate and that 
significant judgements have been robustly challenged.
Policy on non-audit work
Our Engagement of External Auditors policy was updated in the year 
to reflect the latest legislation. This policy covers the selection of 
firms to perform non-audit work. It specifically excludes the auditors 
from providing certain services, such as certain tax services, any 
services that play any part in the management or decision-making of 
KCOM, book-keeping and preparing accounting records or financial 
statements, payroll services, the design and implementation of 
certain internal control or risk management procedures, valuation 
services, certain legal or human resources services, internal audit 
services and certain services linked to the financing, capital structure 
and investment strategy of KCOM. All other non-audit work is 
assessed separately and is awarded to the firm considered best 
suited to perform the work. Any such work must be  agreed in 
advance by the Audit Committee chair, work with a fee greater than 
20 per cent of the annual audit fee must be approved by the Audit 
Committee before the external auditors may be appointed.
During the year, the fee for the external audit of the Group and its 
subsidiaries, along with other services pursuant to legislation, was 
£262,000 (2016: £283,000). In addition to this, the external auditors 
provided services to the value of £77,000 (2016: £165,000) relating 
to tax advisory services, work in relation to the pension scheme and 
Group structuring advice work. In these areas the auditors were 
considered the most appropriate firm to perform the work.
Risk management and internal control
The Audit Committee reviews the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems through the work performed by the internal 
and external auditors and reports to the Board on the effectiveness 
of such systems. The Committee is satisfied that any audit issues 
raised by either the internal or external auditors are being 
adequately followed up and closed on a timely basis. 47 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
Significant issues relating to the financial statements 
The specific issues considered by the Audit Committee in the year under review, in relation to the financial statements, are shown in the 
table below. There were fewer specific issues discussed than in the prior year, as the issue in relation to the valuation of intangible assets 
on internal projects was not significant in the year under review. The Committee was satisfied that all of the issues considered were being 
effectively managed. 
Nature of the issue 
How the Committee was satisfied with the treatment 
adopted by management 
Any changes arising from 
discussion by the Committee 
Valuation of goodwill
Testing goodwill for potential impairment 
is complex and requires a number of 
management estimates and sensitivities to be 
applied, which inevitably require judgement.
This is a recurring matter.
The re-segmentation of the financial reporting 
of the business meant that goodwill calculations 
had to be made on both the old and the new 
segmentation basis. The goodwill calculations 
were reviewed by the Committee, along with 
the assumptions made and the sensitivities 
applied. These were discussed in detail and it 
was concluded that no impairment or enhanced 
sensitivity disclosure was required.
The Committee reviewed 
the calculations in detail and 
challenged the assumptions 
and sensitivities. The 
conclusion was that no 
changes were required. 
Pension accounting assumptions
Pension accounting is complex and there are 
a number of assumptions that have to be 
made, which can have a significant impact on 
the valuation of scheme liabilities.
This is a recurring matter.
The assumptions that had been made in relation 
to the pension accounting were reviewed by the 
Committee, which was satisfied that these were 
in line with recognised market practice and with 
the previous assumptions made. No changes 
were therefore required.
The assumptions were 
reviewed and challenged 
by the Committee.
No changes were made as the 
Committee concluded that it 
agreed with the treatment 
adopted by management.
Classification of exceptional costs
The business has incurred significant 
exceptional costs in the year in relation to 
restructuring and regulatory matters. 
Management judgement around when one-off 
items should be treated as exceptional was 
therefore an area for review. 
This will be a recurring matter when there are 
significant exceptional items.
There is an established and well defined policy 
in place in relation to the classification of items 
as exceptional. Management had followed 
this policy and therefore the Committee 
was satisfied with the treatment adopted 
by management.
No changes were made 
as the Committee was 
in agreement with 
the treatment.
Significant contracts
There are a number of significant customer 
contracts that arise each year, as well as 
occasional large supplier contracts. These 
usually involve some judgement in relation to 
the timing of revenue and cost recognition on 
such contracts.
There have been a number of significant customer 
contracts that have either continued or arisen 
during the year. Judgements made in relation to 
some of the larger contracts have been reviewed 
by the Committee in the year.
No changes were made as 
the Committee was satisfied 
that the policies applied 
were appropriate and had 
been consistently followed.
Internal audit
During the year we appointed KPMG as our internal auditors. The 
Committee believes that outsourcing the work of internal audit 
enables a broader scope and gives access to subject matter 
experts, which would not be possible with a solely in-house team.
The audit plan each year is created by looking at the risks across 
the business and prioritising audits accordingly, focusing 
specifically on the areas where the Board would most like 
assurance in relation to the controls in place. The audit plan is 
brought to the Audit Committee at the beginning of the financial 
year and then updated for each meeting as appropriate.
The internal auditors report to the Audit Committee at each 
meeting on the adequacy and effectiveness of the financial, 
operational and compliance controls that have been tested 
across the Group. The Audit Committee is responsible for 
monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit 
work and does this through reviewing the internal audit reports 
presented to the Committee and through the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee meeting separately with the internal auditors 
outside of the Committee.
The Committee also reviews the adequacy of management 
responses to the audit issues raised and monitors the closure of 
issues on a timely basis through a regular report from the 
internal auditors.
The internal and external audit teams work closely together to 
ensure that all key risk areas are covered as appropriate and that 
the work performed by one team feeds into the work of the other.
During the year, the work performed by KPMG included detailed 
reviews of the key financial end-to-end processes, a review of 
the controls around payroll and a high level review of our 
compliance and governance in relation to privacy risks. 48 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17
Directors’ report
Other disclosures
General information
General information is provided in Note 1 of the 
financial statements.
Disclosure of all relevant information to auditors
The Directors who approved this report are satisfied that, as far 
as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined 
in the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware. Each of the Directors has taken all the steps that 
they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Directors
The names of the Directors who served during the year are 
on pages 36 and 37 along with the biographical details of the 
Directors serving at the date of signing of this report. Further 
information regarding the Directors who served during the year 
can be found on pages 50 to 72 in the Remuneration report.
Indemnification of Directors
The Company has indemnified each Director against liabilities 
incurred in connection with any claim brought against him or 
her, to the fullest extent permitted by the Companies Act 2006. 
The indemnity deed also obliges KCOM to maintain Directors' 
and Officers’ insurance throughout the directorship and for six 
years after an individual ceases to be a Director.
Employees
Our people make the difference to our customers and enable us 
to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We therefore 
want our employment strategies to help our people develop to 
their full potential while also driving our business performance. 
Our employment policies are designed to provide equal 
opportunities irrespective of age, disability, ethnicity, gender, 
gender reassignment, marital and civil partnership status, 
nationality, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion and belief, 
and sexual orientation.
All employees, whether part time or full-time, temporary or 
permanent, are treated fairly and equally. We select employees 
for employment, promotion, training or other matters affecting 
their employment on the basis of aptitude and ability.
We take every opportunity to involve and consult with our 
employees and we believe that employee involvement is an 
essential contributor to the development of our business. 
Our Change Network is made up of employees from across 
the business and they support and increase engagement with 
our strategy.
Our intranet is integrated with Yammer, which is a social media 
tool open to everyone in the business to post messages, share 
content and provide comments and feedback to others 
across the business. We have a weekly round-up email which 
keeps everyone informed of activities and developments across 
the Group, and a monthly newsletter called ‘Leadingedge’ 
which is sent to all people managers for them to share with their 
teams, which contains updates and useful information. There is 
also a quarterly video broadcast covering latest stories from 
across the business.
We also encourage our employees to become shareholders 
by offering a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) as we believe this is 
an opportunity to encourage greater employee engagement. 
Share capital
The Company has a single class of share capital which is divided 
into ordinary shares of 10 pence.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
In a general meeting of the Company voting is as follows: 
 > on a show of hands, every member present in person shall 
have one vote; 
 > on a show of hands, every proxy present who has been duly 
appointed by one or more members shall have one vote; and 
 > on a poll, every member who is present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he or 
she is the holder. 
A member is not entitled to vote in respect of any share in the 
capital of the Company held by him or her if there are sums 
payable to the Company in respect of such share which 
remain unpaid.
Full details of the deadline for exercising voting rights in 
respect of the resolutions to be considered at the AGM to 
be held on 21 July 2017 are set out in the Notice of Meeting.
All dividends are paid proportionately to the amounts paid up 
on the shares and are paid to those members whose names 
are on the share register at the date at which the dividend is 
declared, or at such other date as determined by the Directors 
or by an ordinary resolution of the Company.
If the Company is wound up, the liquidator, with the sanction 
of a special resolution of the Company or any other sanction 
required by law, may divide the whole or any part of the assets 
of the Company among the shareholders and may determine 
how the division of the assets will be carried out.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of uncertificated shares must be made in 
accordance with, and be subject to, the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001 as amended by the Uncertificated 
Securities (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and in accordance 
with any arrangements made by the Board.
All transfers of certificated shares must be in writing in a 
form which has been approved by the Directors; this is known 
as ‘the Instrument of Transfer’. The Instrument of Transfer must 
be signed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and the transferor 
will remain as the holder of the share until the name of the 
transferee is entered into the share register.
The Directors may refuse to register the transfer of any share which 
is not fully paid or which is in favour of more than four persons 
jointly. The Directors may also refuse to recognise an Instrument 
of Transfer if it is not lodged at the Company’s registered office 
or at any other place which the Directors have determined.
If the Directors refuse to register a transfer they will send to the 
transferee a notice of the refusal and the Instrument of Transfer 
within two months of the date on which the transfer was lodged 
with the Company. 49 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
Acquisition of own shares
At the AGM in 2016, the Company was authorised by members 
to purchase its own shares, up to a maximum of 51,660,391. 
During the year, the Company did not purchase any of its 
own shares.
The Company funds Employee Share Trusts (ESTs) to meet its 
obligations under the Company’s share schemes. During the 
year the ESTs purchased 2,130,491 (2016: 666,000) shares on 
the London Stock Exchange with a nominal value of £213,049 
(2016: £66,600), for which the Company provided funding of 
£1,778,051 (2016: £450,000). These shares represent 0.4 per cent 
of the called-up share capital and are held in trust until they vest; 
therefore the purchase of these shares does not reduce the share 
capital in issue. The total number of shares held in trust to meet 
obligations under the Company’s share schemes is:
000s of shares
As at 1 April 2016 6,614
As at 31 March 2017 5,882
Further details around the purchase of shares in the year are set 
out in Note 26 to the financial statements.
Shares held by ESTs
The trustees of the Kingston Communications 2000 EST and the 
Kingston Communications All Employee Share Plan vote any 
shares held in the ESTs as they wish, having due regard to the 
interests of the employees as potential beneficiaries. 
There are two other ESTs, the Kingston Communications 
Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust and KCOM Group 
PLC Employee Benefit Trust, that are currently dormant and hold 
no shares.
Requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.4R
None of the disclosures required by Listing Rule 9.8.4R are 
applicable to KCOM.
Significant agreements – change of control
The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling 
the counterparties to exercise termination or other rights in the 
event of a change of control of the Company:
 > under our £180.0 million multi-currency revolving facility 
agreement dated 30 September 2016, the Company must 
notify Lloyds Bank PLC, the Agent of the agreement, within 
seven days of becoming aware of a change of control of the 
Company. Any bank or financial institution named within the 
facility agreement may then notify the Agent within seven 
days that they wish to cancel their commitments. The Agent 
must then give at least 21 days’ notice to the Company of this 
and all outstanding amounts due to that bank or financial 
institution will become immediately due and payable. For 
these purposes, a ‘change of control’ occurs if any person 
or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the 
Company; and
 > the Company’s share schemes, details of which are contained in 
the Remuneration report on pages 50 to 72, contain provisions 
which take effect in the event of a change of control, as a result 
of which options and awards may vest and become exercisable. 
The provisions do not entitle participants to a greater interest in 
the shares of the Company than that created by the initial grant 
or award under the relevant scheme.
The Company does not have any agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office 
or employment resulting from a takeover.

Directors’ report Peter Smith 
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee and the Board, I am 
very pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration report for 
the year ended 31 March 2017.
Our current Remuneration policy was approved by our 
shareholders at our AGM in 2014 and we have undertaken a 
thorough review of the policy this year, with assistance from our 
external remuneration consultants, to ensure it continues to meet 
the requirements of the business, our shareholders and other key 
stakeholders. We are proposing a few minor amendments to bring 
the policy up to date with good practice, to ensure further 
strengthening of alignment between executive and shareholder 
objectives and to ensure the policy is sufficiently flexible to 
remain applicable over the next policy period. We are retaining 
the overall structure of the current policy to ensure continued 
simplicity in our remuneration arrangements. We will be asking 
our shareholders to approve the new Remuneration policy at our 
AGM in July 2017.
The proposed policy changes
The primary objective of the Remuneration policy is to promote the 
long-term success of the Company. To achieve this, our current 
remuneration structure is intended to be simple and consistent and 
to link pay to performance in relation to the shorter and longer-term 
success of the business and the creation of shareholder value. 
It is structured into five main elements – base salary, benefits, 
retirement benefits, annual bonus and a single Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP). The base salary, benefits and retirement benefits are 
fixed and paid at market competitive rates to enable us to attract 
the right individuals to the business. The annual bonus provides 
reward for financial performance above market expectations in the 
year and the LTIP focuses Executive Directors on the medium to 
long-term value created for shareholders.
Remuneration report
Statement from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Our information on Directors’ remuneration 
is structured as follows:
 > Annual statement from the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee, providing an overview of the 
key developments and remuneration decisions made 
during the financial year.
 > Remuneration policy report, setting out the proposed 
future policy that is being put to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM in July 2017.
 > Annual report on remuneration, showing how the 
current Remuneration policy has been applied in 
2016/17, how we intend to apply the proposed policy in 
2017/18 and a summary of the work of the Remuneration 
Committee in the year.
At our AGM in July 2017, shareholders will be asked to 
approve the Remuneration policy report in a binding vote, 
while the Annual statement, together with the Annual 
report on remuneration, will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote. 51 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
Having concluded that the structure of our current policy is 
effective and remains aligned with our strategy, we are proposing 
just four minor changes to enhance it further:
 > LTIP post-vesting holding period – We are introducing a 
two year post-vesting holding period for LTIP awards made 
from the year ended 31 March 2018 onwards to align Executive 
Director and shareholder interests over a five year period from 
the date of grant of an LTIP award. This means that any shares 
vesting, after tax, will have to be held for a minimum of two 
years beyond the vesting date. The Committee has decided to 
introduce this in response to feedback from our investors and 
to ensure increased focus by Executive Directors on the 
longer-term success of the business.
 > Additional flexibility on incentive plan metrics and targets – 
We are introducing some additional flexibility within the policy 
to allow for alternative metrics to be selected in future for the 
LTIP and annual bonus scheme, if the Committee believes this 
is appropriate. Currently the measures used are EBITDA for 
the annual bonus and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the 
LTIP. We are not planning to change these metrics for 2017/18 
but seek to have the flexibility to select different metrics, 
including non-financial metrics, if we feel this would better 
align remuneration with the strategic objectives of the 
business in the future. We would seek to consult with our 
major shareholders in advance if we propose to make any 
material changes to the metrics we use.
 > Additional flexibility on notice periods – We are increasing the 
maximum notice period allowed for Executive Directors to up 
to 12 months from six months, to ensure that we can be 
sufficiently competitive in recruitment situations. It became 
apparent to us during the recruitment process for our new 
Chief Financial Officer this year that the standard notice 
periods offered by other firms were set at 12 months and that 
therefore only being able to offer a six month notice period 
placed KCOM out of line with general market practice. It is 
therefore proposed to build flexibility into the policy to allow 
for notice periods of up to 12 months and, following approval 
of this change, the notice period for our Chief Financial 
Officer will increase from six months to 12 months for either 
party.
 > Increased shareholding requirement for the Chief Executive 
– We are increasing the shareholding requirement for our 
Chief Executive from 100 per cent of base salary to 200 per 
cent to give greater alignment of his interests with those of 
our shareholders.
In relation to the above proposed changes, we consulted with our 
largest shareholders, as well as shareholder advisory groups, and 
have incorporated their feedback into our proposals. We value 
feedback from our shareholders extremely highly and are always 
willing to hear your thoughts or arrange a meeting if there is 
anything that you would like more information on or would like 
to discuss further.
Performance and decisions in the financial year
The results for the year to 31 March 2017 show an anticipated 
decrease in revenue and EBITDA which arises, as expected, from 
a shift in focus away from commodity network business towards 
value driven solutions. We have shown growth and good 
strategic progress in our Enterprise segment and continued 
success in our deployment of Fibre To The Premises in our Hull 
and East Yorkshire segment. We remain focused on creating a 
simplified business as we continue to transform KCOM into a 
regional fibre-based services provider and a provider of complex 
IP-based solutions to the Enterprise market. During this 
transition we expect there to be continued decline in revenues 
and margins in our legacy activities. Consistent with our existing 
commitment to a minimum full year dividend of 6.00 pence per 
share, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 4.00 pence 
per share. Please see the Strategic report on pages 3 to 34 for 
more information on our performance in the year.
Salary review
Following a review of pay conditions across the Group, and taking 
into account the performance of the business, the Committee has 
decided not to award a salary increase to the Executive Directors 
in 2017/18. This is consistent with the approach taken elsewhere 
in the Group where salary awards will only be granted on an 
exceptional basis.
Annual bonus
The threshold EBITDA target for 2016/2017, required for a payment 
of 10 per cent of the maximum annual bonus entitlement, was set 
at £70.3 million with a maximum set at £85.0 million. The EBITDA 
achieved was £67.6 million which means no bonus is payable. 
Further information on the annual bonus scheme and the targets 
set in the year can be found on page 64.
LTIP awards
The LTIP awards granted in July 2013 had a performance period 
which ended on 30 June 2016. The TSR growth for KCOM during 
the performance period was 48.5 per cent relative to a median 
growth in the comparator group of 32.7 per cent. This resulted in 
a vesting of 62.09 per cent of the maximum award, which the 
Committee agreed was representative of the financial and 
non-financial performance of the business over the period. 
Further details on the LTIP, the amount vested and the 
performance measures can be found on pages 64 to 66.
The LTIP awards granted in July 2014 have a performance period 
ending on 30 June 2017. Current indications suggest that the 
awards will not vest, although this cannot be confirmed until the 
end of the performance period. Details of the final vesting result 
will be included in our Remuneration report next year.
As indicated in our Remuneration report last year, an LTIP award 
equivalent to 150 per cent of base salary was made to Bill Halbert 
in July 2016. An award equivalent to 150 per cent of base salary 
was also made to Jane Aikman in January 2017, following her 
recruitment. Both of these awards are subject to relative TSR 
performance measured over a three year performance period. 
Further information can be found on pages 64 to 66.

Policy report
This Policy report sets out the proposed Directors’ Remuneration 
policy for KCOM and will be put to a binding shareholder vote at 
the AGM on 21 July 2017. If approved, the policy will apply for 
a period of three years until the AGM in 2020, unless a revised 
Policy report is presented to shareholders before then. Any existing 
remuneration commitments or contractual arrangements agreed 
prior to the approval and implementation of this Policy report will 
be honoured in accordance with their original terms.
Once approved, remuneration payments and payments for loss 
of office can only be made during the policy period if they are 
consistent with the approved policy or are otherwise approved 
by our shareholders by an ordinary resolution.
Policy overview
The primary objective of the Remuneration policy is to promote 
the long-term success of the Company. In working towards this, 
the Committee takes into account a number of factors when 
setting the policy, including:
 > the need to provide a remuneration structure that is 
sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors of an appropriate calibre;
 > the need to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and 
performance-related variable pay by aligning reward with the 
achievement of the strategic objectives of the business and 
incentivising strong long-term performance and sustained 
shareholder value creation, whilst not encouraging unnecessary 
risk taking or irresponsible behaviour;
 > the alignment of interests between executives and shareholders 
through share ownership and recovery and withholding provisions;
 > internal levels of pay and employment conditions across the 
Group as whole;
 > the principles and recommendations set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the views of institutional 
shareholders and their representative bodies; and
 > periodic external comparisons of market trends and practices 
in similar companies taking into account their size and complexity.
Our remuneration structure is intended to be simple and 
transparent, and to link pay to performance in relation to the 
shorter and longer-term success of the business and the creation 
of shareholder value. Our policy ensures that performance-related 
components will form a significant proportion of the overall 
remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards 
earned only through the achievement of challenging performance 
targets based on measures selected to promote the long-term 
success of the Company.
The Committee will continue to review the Remuneration policy 
to ensure it takes due account of remuneration best practice and 
that it remains aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
Board changes
We were delighted to welcome Jane Aikman to the Board on 
17 October 2016, as our Chief Financial Officer. The package 
offered to Jane is fully in line with our Recruitment policy in 
relation to remuneration. Her base salary on appointment was 
set at £290,000, which is slightly higher than that paid to her 
predecessor, Paul Simpson, which is reflective of the considerable 
experience that Jane brings to the role. Jane was eligible to 
participate in the annual bonus scheme for 2016/17, pro-rated to 
the date of her joining; however the financial performance of the 
business to 31 March 2017 has not triggered a payment under the 
scheme. The Committee also exercised its discretion to make 
a LTIP award, equivalent to 150 per cent of salary, to Jane upon 
her joining the business and this was part of the competitive 
package offered. Unfortunately as the business was in a close 
period on the date of her joining, we were unable to do so 
immediately and instead made the award on 17 January 2017 
to coincide with three months since she started her role with us. 
Further details on the amounts paid to Jane since she joined the 
Company can be found on page 63.
As noted in the Report and Accounts last year, our previous 
Chief Financial Officer, Paul Simpson, left the Board on 
30 September 2016. Paul remained an employee of the 
Company and continued to receive his salary and benefits 
from the date he left the Board up until the end of his notice 
period on 26 May 2017. Paul was eligible to receive an annual 
bonus pro-rated to the date he left the Board; however no bonus 
was triggered for the year to 31 March 2017. He has also been 
treated as a good leaver for the purposes of the LTIP, with 
awards pro-rated and remaining subject to the original 
performance conditions. Details of the amounts paid to 
Paul during the year are shown on page 66.
Our Senior Independent Director, Tony Illsley, also retired from 
the Board at our AGM on 22 July 2016. The fee he received for 
his role in the year was pro-rated to that date. 
Feedback
We want to understand the views of our shareholders, 
including those in relation to remuneration. Any feedback would 
therefore be very welcome and may be directed to me via our 
Company Secretary, Kathy Smith, who can be contacted at  
kathy.smith@kcom.com.
The Committee believes that the revised Remuneration policy 
supports the objectives of the business and drives the right 
behaviour at a senior level. I hope that we can rely on your support 
for the resolutions relating to remuneration at our AGM in July 2017.

Directors’ report
How we take the views of shareholders into account
The Committee seeks to consult with its largest shareholders 
when any significant changes to the Remuneration policy are 
proposed. We also consider any shareholder feedback on 
remuneration received at the AGM each year, plus any other 
feedback received in relation to remuneration at other times. 
We also closely monitor developments in institutional investors’ 
best practice expectations.
How the Executive Directors’ remuneration relates 
to the wider workforce
The Committee considers the pay and employment conditions of 
employees across the business when setting the Remuneration 
policy for the Executive Directors, to ensure that these are 
aligned where appropriate. We regularly monitor pay trends 
across the workforce and salary increases for the Directors will 
normally be in line with those of the wider workforce, in 
percentage terms.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees when 
drawing up the Directors’ Remuneration policy; however, we 
encourage our people to give us feedback, including in relation 
to remuneration, through mechanisms such as our Change 
Network. We take any such feedback into account when 
considering our Remuneration policy. More information on the 
Change Network and how we encourage our people to get 
involved is on page 32.
Policy changes
We have undertaken a thorough review of the existing 
Remuneration policy, taking full account of the strategic 
objectives of KCOM and developments in the executive pay 
environment. We took external advice from our remuneration 
consultants and consulted with our largest shareholders and 
shareholder advisory groups, incorporating the feedback 
received into our final proposals.
This Policy report proposes four minor changes to the 
previous policy:
 > the introduction of a two year post-vesting holding period for 
LTIP awards made from the year ended 31 March 2018 onwards, 
to align with investor feedback and to ensure a longer-term 
focus from Executive Directors over a five year period from 
the date of grant;
 > the introduction of some additional flexibility for the 
Remuneration Committee to adopt alternative metrics in the 
future for the LTIP and annual bonus scheme, to ensure that 
the measures chosen are fully aligned with the strategic 
priorities at the time they are set; 
 > the introduction of additional flexibility to increase the maximum 
length of notice periods for Executive Directors, from six to 
up to 12 months, to provide more flexibility in recruitment 
situations and to align with current market practice; and
 > an increase of the shareholding requirement for our 
Chief Executive from 100 per cent of salary to 200 per cent 
of salary to ensure greater alignment of the interests of the 
Chief Executive with those of our shareholders.
How does the Committee intend to 
exercise discretion?
The Committee operates the annual bonus, LTIP and all employee 
share plans in accordance with the relevant plan rules and, where 
appropriate, the Listing Rules and HMRC legislation. The Committee, 
consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number 
of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plans. 
These include, for example, the timing of awards and setting 
performance criteria each year, dealing with leavers, discretion 
to retrospectively amend performance targets in exceptional 
circumstances (providing the new targets are no less challenging 
than originally envisaged) and in respect of share awards, to adjust 
the number of shares subject to an award in the event of a variation 
in the share capital of the Company.
The remuneration of our Executive Directors is made up of five elements:
The Remuneration policy covers each of these elements and sets out the approach to each of these for the policy period.

What has changed from the previous 
Remuneration policy and why?
Base salary 
Setting the base salary at the right level enables us 
to attract and retain the high calibre individuals 
required to deliver the strategic objectives of the 
business.
We normally review base salaries annually with changes typically 
effective from 1 July.
The review takes into account the salary increase budgeted for the 
workforce generally as well as any other key internal and external 
reference points, while also seeking to appropriately reflect the 
experience, calibre and performance of the individual.
There is no prescribed maximum annual basic salary or salary increase.
Increases will not normally exceed the general level of increase for employees 
across the business in percentage of salary terms; however, we may award 
higher increases in certain circumstances, for example, where there is a 
change in responsibility, progression in the role or a significant increase in 
the scale of the role or the size or complexity of the business.
Details of the base salaries for each of the Executive Directors are shown 
in the Annual report on remuneration on page 63.
No specific performance measures are 
used in relation to determining base salary, 
but individual and business performance 
are considered as part of the discussion 
when setting the base salary levels.
There are no provisions to recover any 
sums paid.
There is no change in our policy in relation 
to base salary.
Benefits 
Paying the right level of benefits helps us to attract 
and retain the right individual for the role.
The provision of benefits is set based upon general market practice, taking 
into account the benefits available to other employees across the business.
The benefits available to Executive Directors may include a combination of:
 > private medical insurance for the Executive and their immediate family; 
 > income protection;
 > life assurance;
 > car allowance of up to £16,000 per annum for the Chief Executive 
and up to £14,000 per annum for the Chief Financial Officer;
 > medical screening; and
 > the opportunity to participate in any all-employee Share Incentive Plans 
operated by the Company, in line with HMRC guidelines.
Executive Directors will be eligible for any other benefits which 
are introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms.
We also reimburse our Executive Directors for any normal 
business-related expenses.
The cost of benefits may vary from year to year and there is no maximum 
level set. The Executive Directors may purchase additional benefits via a 
deduction in salary through the flexible benefits arrangements that are 
available to all employees.
Benefits are not performance related. There are no provisions to recover any 
sums paid.
There is no change in our policy in relation 
to benefits.
Retirement benefits 
Retirement benefits are paid as part of a market 
competitive package which, in turn, helps us to 
attract and retain high calibre individuals.
Executive Directors are entitled to receive an employer defined 
contribution or cash allowance (or combination of the two) of up 
to 20 per cent of base salary.
Retirement benefits are not 
performance related.

Are there any provisions to recover

What has changed from the previous 
Remuneration policy and why?
Annual bonus 
The annual bonus is designed to incentivise 
and recognise the achievement of specific 
annual objectives in support of the short 
to medium-term strategy of the business.
The annual bonus is normally payable in cash.
The level of award is determined by the Committee after the year end, 
based on performance against the targets set at the beginning of the year.
All bonus payments are at the ultimate discretion of the Committee.
A sliding scale of targets is set, with 10 per cent of maximum being payable 
for achieving the threshold hurdle, rising to 50 per cent of maximum at 
target level and with payments of up to 100 per cent of salary at maximum.
The performance measures may be 
financial or non-financial measures but will 
be selected by the Committee each year. 
Group financial measures, such as 
profit-related measures, will apply for the 
majority of the bonus. If used, personal or 
strategic objectives will be applied for the 
minority of the bonus.
Measures and objectives will be determined 
over a one year performance period.
The measures in place for 2016/17 and 
those proposed for 2017/18 are set out in 
more detail on page 64. In both years we 
have chosen EBITDA as the most 
appropriate measure for the annual bonus. 
The Committee believes that any incentive 
compensation should be appropriately 
challenging and tied to the delivery of 
targets relating to profit.
Clawback provisions may be invoked 
for material misstatement, errors in 
assessing performance conditions or 
gross misconduct.
We have included some additional flexibility 
to select non-financial metrics alongside 
financial metrics in future years if the 
Committee believes it is appropriate to do 
so, to continue to align Executive Director 
remuneration with the strategic objectives of 
the business. For 2017/18 we are not proposing 
to change the use of EBITDA as the measure 
for the annual bonus.
Long-term incentives 
Long-term incentive schemes are used to drive 
growth in shareholder value and to ensure that 
there is a direct link between reward and superior 
shareholder returns.
Awards are normally made annually with awards taking the form 
of conditional rights or nil or nominal cost options.
The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually and monitors 
the continuing suitability of the performance measures.
A holding period will apply to awards granted in the year ending 31 March 2018 
and onwards. The holding period will require any shares that vest, after 
tax, to be held for a period of two years, even if this period extends beyond 
the Director leaving employment with KCOM.
The plan allows a maximum award of 150 per cent of salary per annum and 
this would be the normal level of award made to the Executive Directors.
The rules allow for awards of up to 200 per cent of salary to be made 
in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee may determine at grant whether an amount, in cash or shares, 
equivalent to the dividends paid or payable on vested shares up to the vesting 
date may become payable; any amount payable may assume the reinvestment 
of dividends over the vesting period.
Actual award levels will be disclosed each year in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
Awards will typically vest after no 
less than three years, subject to the 
achievement of pre-set performance 
criteria and continued employment.
The key performance measure used 
currently is relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) and stretching targets 
relating to this are set and assessed by the 
Committee. However, different financial, 
share price or strategic-based performance 
measures may be set for future award cycles 
as appropriate to reflect the strategic 
priorities of the business at that time.
In addition to the performance measures 
set out by the Committee, there will always 
be an underpin that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the financial and non-financial 
performance of the business over the 
performance period warrants the level 
of vesting.
As with previous awards, the performance 
measure for the 2017/18 LTIP awards will be 
relative TSR. This was selected on the basis 
that it is aligned with the delivery of 
long-term returns to shareholders.
Clawback and withholding provisions 
may be invoked for material misstatement, 
errors in assessing performance 
conditions or gross misconduct.
The two year post-vesting holding period is 
new this year and will apply for all LTIP awards 
made in the year ending 31 March 2018 
onwards. This will require Executive Directors 
to hold any shares vesting from future 
awards under the LTIP, after tax, for a 
period of two years.
We have also introduced additional flexibility 
in the performance measures used for the 
LTIP, to enable us to introduce different 
metrics for future awards if the Committee 
believes this to be appropriate.

Annual bonus 
The annual bonus is designed to incentivise 
and recognise the achievement of specific 
annual objectives in support of the short 
to medium-term strategy of the business.
The annual bonus is normally payable in cash.
The level of award is determined by the Committee after the year end, 
based on performance against the targets set at the beginning of the year.
All bonus payments are at the ultimate discretion of the Committee.
A sliding scale of targets is set, with 10 per cent of maximum being payable 
for achieving the threshold hurdle, rising to 50 per cent of maximum at 
target level and with payments of up to 100 per cent of salary at maximum.
The performance measures may be 
financial or non-financial measures but will 
be selected by the Committee each year. 
Group financial measures, such as 
profit-related measures, will apply for the 
majority of the bonus. If used, personal or 
strategic objectives will be applied for the 
minority of the bonus.
Measures and objectives will be determined 
over a one year performance period.
The measures in place for 2016/17 and 
those proposed for 2017/18 are set out in 
more detail on page 64. In both years we 
have chosen EBITDA as the most 
appropriate measure for the annual bonus. 
The Committee believes that any incentive 
compensation should be appropriately 
challenging and tied to the delivery of 
targets relating to profit.
Clawback provisions may be invoked 
for material misstatement, errors in 
assessing performance conditions or 
gross misconduct.
We have included some additional flexibility 
to select non-financial metrics alongside 
financial metrics in future years if the 
Committee believes it is appropriate to do 
so, to continue to align Executive Director 
remuneration with the strategic objectives of 
the business. For 2017/18 we are not proposing 
to change the use of EBITDA as the measure 
for the annual bonus.
Long-term incentives 
Long-term incentive schemes are used to drive 
growth in shareholder value and to ensure that 
there is a direct link between reward and superior 
shareholder returns.
Awards are normally made annually with awards taking the form 
of conditional rights or nil or nominal cost options.
The Committee reviews the quantum of awards annually and monitors 
the continuing suitability of the performance measures.
A holding period will apply to awards granted in the year ending 31 March 2018 
and onwards. The holding period will require any shares that vest, after 
tax, to be held for a period of two years, even if this period extends beyond 
the Director leaving employment with KCOM.
The plan allows a maximum award of 150 per cent of salary per annum and 
this would be the normal level of award made to the Executive Directors.
The rules allow for awards of up to 200 per cent of salary to be made 
in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee may determine at grant whether an amount, in cash or shares, 
equivalent to the dividends paid or payable on vested shares up to the vesting 
date may become payable; any amount payable may assume the reinvestment 
of dividends over the vesting period.
Actual award levels will be disclosed each year in the Annual report 
on remuneration.
Awards will typically vest after no 
less than three years, subject to the 
achievement of pre-set performance 
criteria and continued employment.
The key performance measure used 
currently is relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) and stretching targets 
relating to this are set and assessed by the 
Committee. However, different financial, 
share price or strategic-based performance 
measures may be set for future award cycles 
as appropriate to reflect the strategic 
priorities of the business at that time.
In addition to the performance measures 
set out by the Committee, there will always 
be an underpin that the Committee must be 
satisfied that the financial and non-financial 
performance of the business over the 
performance period warrants the level 
of vesting.
As with previous awards, the performance 
measure for the 2017/18 LTIP awards will be 
relative TSR. This was selected on the basis 
that it is aligned with the delivery of 
long-term returns to shareholders.
Clawback and withholding provisions 
may be invoked for material misstatement, 
errors in assessing performance 
conditions or gross misconduct.
The two year post-vesting holding period is 
new this year and will apply for all LTIP awards 
made in the year ending 31 March 2018 
onwards. This will require Executive Directors 
to hold any shares vesting from future 
awards under the LTIP, after tax, for a 
period of two years.
We have also introduced additional flexibility 
in the performance measures used for the 
LTIP, to enable us to introduce different 
metrics for future awards if the Committee 
believes this to be appropriate. 58 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17

Element and how it supports 
the KCOM strategy How does this operate and what is the maximum that may be paid?
Fees
Fees are set to recognise 
the responsibility and 
experience of the individual 
and enable us to attract and 
retain the right calibre of 
individual and the right 
blend of skills on the Board.
Fees are normally reviewed annually. Any increase will be guided by changes in market rates, time 
commitments and responsibility levels as well as by increases for the broader employee population.
The Chairman is paid an all-encompassing fee to take account of all Board responsibilities. 
The other Non-Executive Directors receive a base fee with additional fees paid for additional 
responsibility, such as the chairing of a Committee and performing the role of 
Senior Independent Director.
In exceptional circumstances, if there is a temporary yet material increase in the time commitments 
for Non-Executive Directors, the Board may pay extra fees to recognise the additional workload.
We reimburse our Non-Executive Directors for any normal business-related expenses.
What performance measures are used and why?
Fees are not performance related; however, performance is addressed through regular one-to-one 
meetings between the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director. The performance of the 
Chairman is reviewed at regular one-to-one meetings between the Chairman and the Senior 
Independent Director.
When and how might the Committee exercise discretion in this area?
Changes to the fees of Non-Executive Directors are a Board decision rather than a 
Remuneration Committee decision and there is discretion in relation to the level of 
fees set, within the parameters noted.
Are there any provisions to recover sums paid? 
There are no provisions to recover any sums paid.
Share ownership requirement
The Committee requires our Executive Directors to build a shareholding in KCOM at a level of at least 100 per cent of salary for our 
Chief Financial Officer and 200 per cent of salary for our Chief Executive. This represents an increase from the previous Remuneration 
policy in the requirement for the Chief Executive. We believe that requiring the Executive Directors to hold shares further reinforces 
the alignment between their interests and those of shareholders and reduces the potential for behaviours and actions which are 
detrimental to the long-term health of the Company. It is expected that Executive Directors will reach this level through the retention 
of shares that have vested in the LTIP, on a net of tax basis. 
The share ownership of all of our Directors, and their connected persons, as at 31 March 2017 is shown on page 71. 59 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
How does the Remuneration policy for Executive Directors differ from that of other employees?
Overall, the Remuneration policy set for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards performance-related variable pay 
than for other employees. As such, a greater proportion of their remuneration is dependent upon the successful delivery of the 
business strategy. The key differences are noted in the table below:
Element Difference
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed in the same way for Executive Directors as for other employees, taking 
into account market rate information, internal reference points, individual performance, the scope 
of the role, the financial performance of the business and the average increases across the rest of 
the business.
Benefits
An increasing level of benefits is offered to employees as their job level increases. Those offered to 
the Executive Directors are consistent with those offered to other senior employees, with a slightly 
higher car allowance for Executive Directors.
There is a range of flexible benefits open to all employees, and the Executive Directors, that can be 
purchased each year.
Retirement benefits
All employees are entitled to pension contributions from KCOM. The amount contributed increases 
as the employee contribution increases. Executive Directors receive a slightly higher maximum 
pension contribution than other employees, at 20 per cent of base salary.
We are aware of the support expressed by some shareholders for the downward harmonisation 
of executive pension allowances to bring them into line with the percentages for the wider 
workforce and we will continue to closely monitor how market practice and investor views 
develop in this area.
Annual bonus
All employees, other than those eligible for commission payments, are entitled to participate in the 
same bonus scheme as the Executive Directors. The maximum award is set as a percentage of 
salary, which increases with seniority.
Long-term incentives
Long-term incentive awards are made only to those individuals who are most able to directly 
influence the business strategy. Along with the Executive Directors, selected senior managers are 
also invited to participate in the LTIP. The performance measures and performance period are the 
same for all participants in the scheme each year. The level of award increases with seniority.
What might Executive Directors be paid under the Remuneration policy?
The charts below indicate how much each of the Executive Directors might receive under the proposed Remuneration policy on an 
annual basis on a fixed, on-target and maximum basis:
Bill Halbert Jane Aikman
Chart assumptions
The different scenarios shown in the graphs are:
 > fixed – where performance is below threshold and Executive Directors receive fixed pay only with no vesting under the LTIP and 
no annual bonus;
 > on-target – where Executive Directors receive their fixed pay plus a bonus at the mid-point of the range, representing 50 per cent 
of the maximum opportunity, and vesting of 25 per cent of the maximum under the LTIP for performance at the median of the 
comparator group; and
 > maximum – where performance meets or exceeds the maximum and the Executive Directors receive their fixed pay plus the 
maximum bonus and maximum vesting of the LTIP.

What might Executive Directors be paid under the Remuneration policy? continued
Fixed pay comprises:
 > base salary;
 > benefits, equivalent to the amount received by each Executive Director in the year to 31 March 2017, pro-rated to a full year for 
Jane Aikman; and
 > pension, equivalent to 20 per cent of the base salary for the year.
Any LTIP vesting would also lead to a cash payment for the equivalent dividends earned in the performance period on the vested 
shares. This has not been included in the charts on page 59.
It should be noted that since the analysis above shows what could be earned by the Executive Directors based on the 2017/18 
Remuneration policy described on pages 52 to 62, the numbers will be different to the values included in the table on page 63 
detailing what was actually earned by the Executive Directors in the year to 31 March 2017, since these values are based on the 
actual levels of performance to 31 March 2017.
Recruitment policy
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the prevailing approved 
Remuneration policy at the time of appointment, taking into account the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for 
a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
This table sets out our policy on the recruitment of new permanent Executive Directors for each element of the remuneration package.
Element Policy on recruitment
Base salary
The salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract the most appropriate candidate.
Where it is appropriate to set a lower salary initially, a series of increases above the level awarded to 
the wider workforce may be given over the proceeding few years until the desired position is 
achieved, subject to individual performance. This may apply to those promoted internally in the 
business as well as to those recruited from outside.
Benefits
The benefits package we will offer will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors.
In addition to the benefits currently available to existing Executive Directors, we may also offer an 
allowance to cover relocation, travel and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.
Retirement benefits
The maximum pension contribution will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive 
Directors at 20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus
We will offer an annual bonus in line with our policy for existing Executive Directors of up to 
100 per cent of salary.
Different performance measures may be set initially, at the discretion of the Committee, 
depending on the point in the financial year at which the individual joins. The opportunity for an 
annual bonus will be pro-rated to the period of employment.
Long-term incentives
On an ongoing basis awards will be made in line with the policy for other Directors. In the year of 
recruitment a higher award may be made, at the discretion of the Committee, within the approved 
limits of the plan (200 per cent of salary in exceptional circumstances) and at a date outside of the 
usual annual awards.
‘Buy-outs’
In addition to the above, we may also offer additional cash and/or share-based elements when we 
consider these to be in the best interests of shareholders and the business. Any such payments 
would be based solely on remuneration relinquished when leaving the former employer and would 
reflect (as far as possible) the nature and time horizons attaching to that remuneration and the 
impact of any performance conditions.
Our policy on the ‘buying-out’ of existing incentives granted by the Executive’s previous employer 
will depend on the circumstances of recruitment and will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. 
There will not be a presumption in favour of buy-out but it will be considered if necessary to attract 
the right candidate.
In total the maximum variable pay level in the year of appointment – excluding the value of any buy-out awards – will be 300 per 
cent of salary, consisting of up to 100 per cent annual bonus and up to 200 per cent LTIP award.
For an internal executive appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out 
according to its terms, adjusted as appropriate to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing remuneration 
obligations existing prior to appointment would be allowed to continue. 61 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
Recruitment of Jane Aikman
During the year we recruited Jane Aikman to the Board as our Chief Financial Officer. The recruitment package offered to Jane 
was consistent with the policy on page 60. Further details can be found on page 63.
Non-Executive Directors
The fee structure for Non-Executive Director appointments will be based on the Non-Executive Director fee policy as set out in the 
policy table.
Service contracts
It was previously the policy to set notice periods for Executive Directors at six months for either party; however, it became apparent 
to us during the year that this put KCOM out of line with general market practice. We are therefore proposing to change our policy 
to increase the maximum notice period for Executive Directors to up to 12 months, to enable us to be sufficiently competitive in 
recruitment situations. If our new Remuneration policy is approved by shareholders, we intend to increase the notice period for our 
Chief Financial Officer, Jane Aikman, to 12 months for either party.
Letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letters of appointment rather than service contracts and the notice period in all letters of 
appointment is set at six months for either party.
Copies of the Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection during office hours at our head 
office at 37 Carr Lane, Hull HU1 3RE. None of the service contracts or letters of appointment place obligations on us to make 
payments beyond those disclosed in this report.
Payments to Executive Directors who leave the business
The table on page 62 sets out our policy on payments in relation to Executive Directors who leave KCOM. This policy is unchanged 
from our previous Remuneration policy.
The Committee is clear that there will be a consistent approach to exit payments and no reward for poor performance. We will not 
pay anything if an Executive Director is dismissed for serious breach of contract, serious misconduct or under-performance or for 
acts that bring the Executive Director or KCOM into serious disrepute.
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not include any compensation for loss of office.
Exit of Paul Simpson
Our Chief Financial Officer, Paul Simpson, stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2016. All payments to Paul during 
the year have been made in accordance with our policy as stated on page 62. Further details on these payments can be found 
on pages 63 to 66. 62 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17
Directors’ report
Remuneration report continued
Policy report continued
Payments to Executive Directors who leave the business continued
Remuneration element Treatment on exit
Base salary
Salary will be paid over the contractual notice period. In all cases we will seek to mitigate any 
payments due and the Executive Directors have a contractual duty to use reasonable endeavours to 
obtain alternative income, which can then be used to reduce the salary if being paid by instalments. 
However, we have discretion to make a lump sum payment on termination in lieu of notice.
Benefits and 
retirement benefits
Benefits and retirement benefits will normally continue to be provided over the notice period. In all 
cases we will seek to mitigate any payments due. However, we have discretion to make a lump sum 
payment on termination equal to the value of the benefits payable during the notice period.
Annual bonus
Whether an annual bonus payment is made is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee and would in any event be pro-rated to the time of active service in the year of 
cessation. The decision of the Committee would take into consideration the performance of the 
individual, the circumstances of the departure and the financial performance of the business.
Long-term incentives
Normally awards will lapse on cessation of employment, unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines that the Executive is a good leaver. Good leaver status is usually conferred for one of 
the following reasons: death, ill health, injury or disability, retirement, redundancy, or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee. Good leavers will be treated in accordance with 
the rules of the LTIP, as approved by shareholders. In these circumstances a participant’s awards 
vest on a time pro-rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria over 
the original period, with the balance of the awards lapsing. The Committee retains discretion to 
decide not to pro-rate, to alter the basis of time pro-rating, and to alter the date on which 
performance is calculated if it feels such decisions are appropriate in particular circumstances.
In relation to a termination of employment, the Committee may make payments in relation to any statutory entitlement or payments 
to settle compromise claims as necessary. The Committee also retains the discretion to reimburse reasonable legal expenses 
incurred in relation to a termination of employment and to meet any transitional costs if deemed necessary. Payment may also be 
made in respect of accrued benefits, including untaken holiday entitlement.
Payments on a change of control, where a Director’s employment is adversely changed, will be as on termination. There will be no 
enhanced provisions on a change of control.
Policy on outside appointments
We believe that where Board members hold directorships in other companies, KCOM can benefit from their experience. As a 
result, and subject to the Board’s prior approval, Executive Directors may take on external non-executive directorships and retain 
the fees earned. 63 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Further details on Executive Director remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2017
Base salary
The base salaries for Bill Halbert and Paul Simpson were increased by two per cent on 1 July 2016 to £404,809 and £267,369 respectively, 
as approved in the Annual report on remuneration last year.
Taxable benefits
Bill Halbert received a car allowance of £16,000 but elected not to receive any other taxable benefits. The taxable benefits for Jane 
Aikman and Paul Simpson include private medical insurance, income protection, life assurance, medical screening and a £14,000 
per annum car allowance. The benefits for Jane Aikman were pro-rated in the year to the date she joined the business.
Retirement benefits
Bill Halbert has elected not to be a member of the KCOM pension scheme and, accordingly, we made no contributions on his behalf. 
Instead he received cash payments totalling £65,905 (2016: £65,905) which are disclosed above within retirement benefits.
Paul Simpson elected to receive part of his pension contribution entitlement in cash due to the Pension Lifetime Allowance 
contributions being reached. This amount was £8,914 (2016: £17,828) and is included in the table above within retirement benefits.
None of the Directors have any prospective entitlement to defined benefits or cash balance benefits in respect of qualifying services.
Long-term incentives 
The figures included above for long-term incentives that vested during the year relate to the LTIP awards granted in July 2013 which 
vested in July 2016. These include dividends of £46,988 (2016: £Nil) for Bill Halbert and £31,035 (2016: £Nil) for Paul Simpson in 
accordance with the rules of the LTIP scheme. Further details of the scheme and the vesting are on pages 64 and 65. 
Use of discretion:
The Committee used its discretion to set the base salary for Jane Aikman upon her recruitment. Her salary of £290,000 is 
slightly higher than that of her predecessor, Paul Simpson, which reflects her considerable experience prior to joining KCOM. 
The salary is in line with the parameters set by our Remuneration policy. 64 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17
Directors’ report

Annual report on remuneration continued
Annual bonus
The annual bonus scheme for 2016/17 used pre-exceptional EBITDA as its key measure. A target level of pre-exceptional EBITDA was 
set at which a bonus pot would start to accrue, with a proportion of profits above that level being set aside for a bonus payment to 
all the scheme participants, up to the maximum level of bonus for all participants. The pre-exceptional EBITDA targets for 2016/17 
are summarised in the table below:
Bonus level
EBITDA
 required
£’000
Maximum level – bonus fully paid 84,967
Target level – 50 per cent bonus paid 79,467
Threshold level – bonus starts to accrue 70,300
Why EBITDA?
Pre-exceptional EBITDA was chosen as the financial performance target for the annual bonus because this is a key performance 
measure used across our industry and one which is closely watched by our investors. Any significant movement in EBITDA has 
always led to a corresponding movement in our share price and therefore it is extremely important for our investors that the 
Executive Directors are incentivised to achieve an EBITDA above market expectations each year. Pre-exceptional EBITDA is one 
of the KPIs that we monitor throughout the year. More detail on our KPIs is on page 22.
The threshold level of EBITDA was set using the market consensus for pre-exceptional EBITDA at the start of the financial year. The market 
consensus was lower than the EBITDA of £74.9 million achieved in 2015/16 due to the transaction to dispose of our UK national network 
infrastructure to CityFibre, which was announced in December 2015. This transaction included an arrangement with CityFibre to support 
existing commitments and customer arrangements on the national network at a cost of £5.0 million per annum, over a five year term, 
starting in 2016/17. Taking this into account, a target of £70.3 million represents growth in pre-exceptional EBITDA on a like-for-like basis.
The pre-exceptional EBITDA achieved in the year was £67.6 million, which means a bonus payment has not been triggered for the year 
to 31 March 2017.
Long-term incentives
The current long-term incentive scheme, the LTIP, was approved by shareholders on 19 July 2012. The scheme authorises the 
Remuneration Committee to grant nil-cost share options to the Executive Directors and selected senior managers each year.
LTIP awards are usually made in July of each year. The scheme has a three year performance period and measures TSR over the 
performance period, relative to the TSR performance of each company within a comparator group. The comparator group comprises 
the companies that were within the FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts) at the start of the performance period.
The TSR performance for the period must rank at least median to the comparator group for there to be any vesting of the 
LTIP awards. Performance at median results in 25 per cent of the awards vesting, with performance between median and upper 
quartile resulting in a vesting of awards on a straight-line basis with 100 per cent vesting at upper quartile performance.
In addition, regardless of TSR performance, no awards vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the financial and 
non-financial performance of KCOM over the performance period warrants the level of vesting set out in the vesting schedule. 
The Committee will consider KCOM’s share price progression and dividend policy as part of this review.
On the exercise of an award participants receive an amount in cash equal to the dividends that were declared during the period from 
grant to exercise, but only in respect of the shares that vest.
The TSR performance is calculated as the percentage change in return index from the start to the end of the performance period. 
The return index is calculated by considering movements in share price together with dividends reinvested on the ex-dividend date. 
The base return index is averaged over each weekday in the three month period immediately preceding the start of the performance 
period and the end return index is averaged over each weekday in the three months prior to the end of the performance period.
Why TSR?
Our main objective is to create sustainable shareholder value. TSR measures the total shareholder return from share price 
movements and dividends over a period of time. By measuring TSR relative to other businesses we can see whether an investment 
in KCOM has yielded value for our shareholders in comparison to the same investment in another business. This therefore exactly 
aligns the objectives of the Executive Directors to those of our shareholders. The three year performance period, with a two year 
post-vesting holding period for any shares awarded from the year ending 31 March 2018 onwards, means that the Executive 
Directors need to be focused on the medium to long-term if they want to maximise their benefit from the LTIP. 65 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
On 30 June 2016 the LTIP awards made in July 2013 reached the end of their performance period. The TSR for KCOM during the 
performance period was 48.5 per cent. The median for the comparator group was 32.7 per cent and the upper quartile TSR began 
at 68.2 per cent. The performance for KCOM therefore fell between the median and the upper quartile which indicated vesting 
of 62.09 per cent of the maximum award, which was confirmed by the Committee. The Committee was satisfied that the vesting 
level was aligned with the underlying financial and non-financial performance of the business over the performance period.
The performance period for the LTIP awards made in July 2014 is due to end on 30 June 2017. Based on current performance it 
appears that the awards will not vest, but the actual figures, once confirmed, will be included in the single total figure table for 
2017/18.
Use of discretion:
The Committee exercised discretion in two ways in relation to the vesting of the 2013 LTIP award:
 > Vesting under the LTIP is always subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the vesting level reflects the 
true financial and non-financial performance of KCOM over the performance period. This discretion can only be used to 
reduce the amount that has vested, not to increase it. The Committee noted that the share price had increased from 81.0 
pence to 105.5 pence during the performance period and that dividends had grown by 21 per cent over the same period. The 
Committee therefore concluded that the level of vesting accurately reflected the performance of the business and that the 
vesting should therefore proceed.
 > The Committee has discretion regarding the treatment of companies within the comparator group which cease to be listed. It 
can elect to retain delisted companies within the comparator group at the value at which they delist or to remove them from 
the comparator group. The Committee chose to remove delisted companies from the comparator group as this is consistent 
with the approach taken in the prior year.
Awards made under the LTIP (audited)
An award of nil-cost options was made to Bill Halbert in July 2016, which was equivalent to 150 per cent of his base salary. This was 
consistent with the prior year in quantum and signalled the return to making awards in July each year, following the delay of the 2015 
award due to the inside information arising from the sale of UK national network infrastructure to CityFibre.
It was the intention of the Committee to make an equivalent award to the new Chief Financial Officer upon appointment, in order to 
align her incentives with the creation of shareholder value from the outset. This was not immediately possible due to the business 
being in a close period on the date of her appointment. The award of nil-cost options equivalent to 150 per cent of base salary was 
consequently made on 17 January 2017, to coincide with three months from her date of appointment.
Use of discretion:
LTIP awards are usually made within six weeks of the announcement of financial results by KCOM; however, the LTIP rules give the 
Committee discretion to make an award at any other time if the circumstances are ‘sufficiently exceptional to justify its grant’. The 
Committee agreed that the recruitment of an Executive Director and the ability to offer an LTIP award as part of a competitive 
package, in order to attract the right talent to the role, were sufficiently exceptional to justify a grant outside of the usual award 
period and therefore exercised its discretion to make the award.
Share dilution 
The rules of the LTIP scheme prevent awards from being granted if the award would cause the number of shares allocated in a rolling 
10 year period to exceed five per cent of the ordinary share capital of the Company when combined with any other Company 
executive share plan or 10 per cent of the ordinary share capital when combined with any other Company employee share plan. As at 
31 March 2017 the share dilution from share schemes in the preceding ten years was 0.32 per cent. Since 2009 the Company has met 
all share scheme obligations through the purchase of existing shares and intends to meet future obligations in the same way.   66 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17

1. Face value has been calculated using the share price at the date of grant.
2. 25 per cent of the award vests at threshold performance.
3.  The 2015 award was made in December instead of July due to the transaction to sell the UK national network infrastructure to CityFibre, which 
meant the Directors were privy to inside information from July until December 2015.
4.  Paul Simpson was granted good leaver status upon leaving the business, as noted in the Remuneration report in 2016, and therefore will be eligible to 
receive these awards, subject to vesting conditions being met. The awards have been pro-rated to the date his notice period ended on 26 May 2017.
Payments for loss of office
There have been no compensation payments for loss of office in the period under review.
Payments to past Directors
As noted in the Annual Report in 2016, Paul Simpson stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2016 but continued to receive his 
base salary, taxable benefits and retirement benefits as an employee of the business until the end of his notice period on 26 May 2017. 
The table below shows the additional remuneration he received following his stepping down from the Board and the total that he 
therefore received in the year.

Also during the year, Kevin Walsh, a previous Director of the Company, received 79,284 nil-cost share options and a dividend 
equivalent cash payment of £12,815 from the vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards. The amounts received had been pro-rated to the date 
of his departure from the business on 31 October 2014. 67 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

2. In 2015/16 there were also fees of £16,000 paid to Martin Towers who retired from the Board on 31 July 2015.
Some of the fees of the Non-Executive Directors were increased from 1 July 2016, as detailed in the Annual report on remuneration 
last year. The increases made were an increase from £125,000 to £127,500 for the Non-Executive Chairman and increases from 
£6,000 to £7,000 for the roles of Audit Committee Chairman and Remuneration Committee Chairman.
Implementation of policy for 2017/18
The table below sets out how we will implement the Remuneration policy for the 2017/18 financial year:
Executive Directors
Bill Halbert Jane Aikman
Base salary
Bill’s base salary will remain at £404,809. Jane’s base salary will remain at £290,000.
Benefits
The benefits to be provided remain unchanged from 2016/17. These include private medical insurance for the 
Executive and his or her immediate family, income protection, life assurance, a car allowance of £16,000 per 
annum for Bill and £14,000 per annum for Jane, medical screening and the opportunity to participate in the 
all-employee Share Incentive Plan. The Executive Directors are also able to purchase additional flexible 
benefits which are available to all employees.
Retirement 
benefits
Both Executive Directors will receive an employer pension contribution or cash equivalent of 
20 per cent of base salary.
Annual bonus
The performance measure for the annual bonus scheme for 2017/18 will remain as EBITDA. A threshold 
level of EBITDA has been set which, if achieved, will result in a bonus payment of 10 per cent of 
maximum entitlement. Achievement of EBITDA above this level will result in additional bonuses being 
accrued at a rate of 40 pence for every additional £1 of EBITDA. Payments will be made to all scheme 
participants on a sliding scale up to the maximum level of bonus entitlement, which for both Bill and 
Jane is 100 per cent of base salary. The EBITDA targets are considered to be commercially sensitive 
and will be disclosed in the Annual report on remuneration next year.
Long-term 
incentives
Consistent with previous years, it is proposed to grant LTIP awards to Bill and Jane in July 2017 under 
the current scheme, equivalent to 150 per cent of base salary at the date of grant. These awards will 
have a three year performance period and therefore will be due to vest in July 2020 subject to the 
achievement of relative TSR performance conditions. Any vested shares, after tax, will then be subject 
to a two year holding period following vesting. The performance conditions attached to the LTIP awards 
will be the same as for awards in previous years and are described further on pages 64 and 65. 68 | KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17

Annual report on remuneration continued
Implementation of policy for 2017/18 continued
Non-Executive Directors
The Board has reviewed the Non-Executive Director fees and has decided that these should remain the same in 2017/18, which is 
consistent with the Executive Directors receiving no pay increase in 2017/18 and the pay awards across the rest of the business, 
where increases will only be made on an exceptional basis. 
The fees to be paid in the year are shown in the table below.

Relative Group performance 
The graph below shows, for the financial year ended 31 March 2017 and for each of the previous eight financial years, the TSR on a 
holding of KCOM’s ordinary shares compared with a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE Fixed Line All-Share and the FTSE 
250. These indices have been chosen as appropriate comparators because they reflect the performance of other companies most 
similar to KCOM in terms of product and service offering and market capital.
Remuneration of the Chief Executive
Bill Halbert became our Chief Executive on 1 April 2014, having previously been the Executive Chairman and performing a dual role 
of both Chief Executive and Chairman. The table below sets out the remuneration for Bill in his role as either Executive Chairman or 
Chief Executive in each of the last eight years:

Remuneration Committee continued
The Remuneration Committee is a sub-committee of the Board and has four scheduled meetings a year, in May, November, February 
and March. Additional meetings are held as and when required. Two such meetings were held during the year: one in July 2016 to 
discuss the vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards and to approve the 2016 LTIP awards and another in September 2016 to agree the 
remuneration package to be offered to Jane Aikman upon her appointment.
The specific matters considered by the Committee at each of the meetings are shown in the table below.
Meeting Matter considered
Scheduled meeting in 
May 2016
 > The Committee reviewed the base pay of the Executive Directors and selected senior 
managers, taking into consideration the remit of the roles and the trends in pay across the 
rest of the business. It was agreed that the base salaries for the Executive Directors should be 
increased by two per cent, which was in line with the average pay increase across the 
business in the prior and current financial years.
 > The achievement of targets in relation to the annual bonus was reviewed and it was 
agreed that a bonus equivalent to 25 per cent of the base salary of the Executive 
Directors should be paid.
 > The bonus scheme for the 2016/17 year was discussed and it was agreed that it was 
appropriate to retain the same metrics as in the previous financial year and the specific 
targets for the year were confirmed.
 > The performance of the 2013 LTIP awards up to the end of April 2016 was reviewed and it 
was agreed that delisted companies should be excluded from the comparator group to be 
consistent with the treatment in the prior year.
 > A draft of the LTIP awards to be made in July 2016 was reviewed and discussed.
 > The draft Remuneration report for 2015/16 was reviewed and feedback was given.
 > The payments to be made to Paul Simpson during his notice period were discussed and agreed.
Additional meeting in 
July 2016
 > The achievement of TSR performance in relation to the 2013 LTIP awards was reviewed 
and the vesting of the 2013 LTIP awards was approved.
 > The LTIP awards to be made in July 2016 were discussed and confirmed.
Additional meeting in 
September 2016
 > The remuneration package to be offered to Jane Aikman, the new Chief Financial Officer, 
was discussed and agreed.
Scheduled meeting in 
November 2016
 > Our remuneration consultants attended the meeting and presented thoughts to the 
Committee on proposed revisions to the Remuneration policy, taking into account market 
trends, investor communications and the objectives of the Committee to ensure the 
policy was as simple and transparent as possible. These were discussed at length and a 
draft revised Remuneration policy was agreed, to form the basis of consultation with our 
largest shareholders.
 > The current share scheme dilution limits were noted for information.
 > An overview of the proposed bonus scheme for 2017/18 was presented and discussed.
 > The results of the Remuneration Committee annual evaluation were reviewed.
Scheduled meeting in 
February 2017
 > Feedback from the largest shareholders in relation to the proposed revised Remuneration 
policy was reviewed and the policy was discussed. 
Scheduled meeting in 
March 2017
 > Further feedback from shareholders on the proposed revised Remuneration policy was 
reviewed and the final version of the policy was discussed and agreed.
 > The pay award for 2017 for the Executive Directors was discussed and the likely pay 
award across the rest of the business was considered. Further information was sought 
on this prior to making a decision at the next Committee meeting.
 > A first draft of the Remuneration report for 2016/17 was reviewed and feedback was given.
During the year under review, the Committee received advice on all aspects of senior executive and non-executive director 
remuneration from independent remuneration consultants New Bridge Street, a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, an Aon plc 
company, which was appointed by the Committee in August 2011 following a comprehensive tender process. New Bridge Street also 
provided some minor related services to the Company, such as the benchmarking of non-executive roles outside the remit of the 
Committee. New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of Conduct and any advice received is 
governed by that code. The fee paid to New Bridge Street during the year for advice to the Committee was £50,403 (2016: £30,876), 
which is charged as a fixed annual fee for recurring work, with separate fees agreed as appropriate for additional ad hoc work. 71 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Directors’ report
The Committee has reviewed the way in which New Bridge Street operates and its relationship with the business and remains 
satisfied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aon Hewitt also provides actuarial and investment consultancy 
advice to the trustees of the two KCOM defined benefit pension schemes, which the Committee considers does not result in a 
conflict of interest.
In accordance with its Terms of Reference, the Committee is responsible for:
 > determining and agreeing the Remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and selected senior managers across the business;
 > having regard to remuneration trends across the business and remuneration in other companies when setting Remuneration 
policy, as well as to environmental, social and governance matters when appropriate;
 > selecting, appointing and setting the Terms of Reference for any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee;
 > approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the business and 
approving the total annual payments made under such schemes;
 > reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders and determining each year whether 
awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards and the performance targets to be used; 
 > determining the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each Executive Director and selected senior managers; and 
 > ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the business, that failure is 
not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised.
The Committee’s Terms of Reference are in line with the recommendations in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the ICSA 
Guidance on Terms of Reference for Remuneration Committees. Copies of the Terms of Reference are available from the Company 
Secretary or on our website, www.kcomplc.com.

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion:
 > KCOM Group PLC’s group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true 
and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of the group’s profit and the 
group’s and the Parent Company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 > the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union;
 > the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
The financial statements, included within the annual report and accounts (the “annual report”), comprise:
 > the consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets as at 31 March 2017;
 > the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 > the consolidated and Parent Company cash flow statements for the year then ended;
 > the consolidated and Parent Company statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the year then ended; and
 > the Notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the Notes to the financial 
statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, and applicable law and, as regards the parent company financial statements, as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit approach

and exceptional items.
Audit scope

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting 
estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, 
are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas 
in order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Valuation of goodwill
We focused on this area because the determination of whether 
or not goodwill is impaired involves subjective judgements and 
estimates about the future results and cash flows of the business. 
On an annual basis, management calculate the amount 
of headroom between the value in use of the Group’s Cash 
Generating Units (‘CGUs’) and their carrying value (or ‘value in 
use’) to determine whether there is a potential impairment of the 
goodwill relating to those CGUs. The value in use of the CGU is 
dependent on a number of key assumptions which include: 
 > Forecast cash flows for the next three years; 
 > A long-term (terminal) growth rate applied beyond the end 
of the 3 year budget period; and
 > A discount rate applied to the model. 
At the beginning of the year opening goodwill of £51.4 million was 
split between two CGUs, Enterprise (£29.1 million) and SMB National 
(£22.3 million). However due to the refinement of operating 
segments which took place during the year the goodwill was 
reallocated into new CGUs Enterprise (£19.1 million) and National 
Network Services (£32.3 million) to align with the management, 
reporting and forecasts used to run the business. 
Management allocated the goodwill to new CGUs management based 
on the profitability of customers transferred into each new CGU. 
As a result, in addition to the annual impairment review, an 
impairment review was performed by management immediately 
prior to restructuring which demonstrated that no impairment 
existed at that date. Having tested this model to ensure no 
impairment was required, we principally focused our testing on 
the model supporting the new CGUs.
See the accounting policies section within the financial statements 
for disclosure of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and Note 14 for detailed goodwill disclosures.
We evaluated the appropriateness of the key assumptions 
including discount rates and long-term growth rates and 
performed a range of sensitivity analyses across both CGUs. 
We also verified the underlying assets and cash flows included 
in the models.
In particular:
 > we verified that the three year forecasts are based on the 
annual budgets and forecast prepared by management and 
approved by the Board of KCOM Group PLC; 
 > we challenged the forecast growth rates over the three year 
period, assessing the current budget and forecasts in light 
of our knowledge and understanding of current business plans. 
Specifically we focused on management’s ability to accurately 
forecast and their history of meeting budget; the extent of 
recurring revenues and revenues which can be generated 
from existing customer relationships; the opportunity based 
sales pipeline; and the forecast growth in markets where 
the respective segments operate;
 > we compared the terminal growth rates in the forecasts to 
third party economic forecasts noting that those used by 
the directors were within an acceptable range; and 
 > we tested the calculation of the discount rate (weighted 
average cost of capital (“WACC”)) for the Group including 
assessing the inputs against comparable organisations 
noting that the rates used across the Group by the directors 
were within a reasonable range.
In addition to testing both models, we also tested the changes 
to CGUs by testing the allocation of both customers and goodwill 
at an individual customer level by agreeing the customer was 
allocated to the correct segment and that the contribution for 
that customer was correctly included in the calculation for the 
allocation of goodwill. 
Based on the evidence obtained we determined that no 
impairment is required.
Valuation of defined benefit pension 
scheme liabilities
We focused on the valuation of the Group’s defined benefit 
pension schemes because of the level of judgement required in 
determining the year end liability valuation. In addition the size 
of the gross assets (£251.5 million) and liabilities (£271.2 million) 
within the schemes are significant.
See the accounting policies section within the financial statements 
for disclosure of the related accounting policies, judgements and 
estimates and Note 29 for detailed pension disclosures.
We obtained the IAS 19 valuation report produced by the 
Group’s actuaries. We used our own actuarial experts to 
assess the judgemental assumptions used within the reports 
to form the valuation of the pension schemes’ liabilities, such 
as discount rate, inflation and mortality rates. We obtained 
the detailed reports underlying the valuation of the schemes’ 
assets, agreed the valuations to third party confirmations and 
performed independent valuation testing. We assessed the 
membership data used in valuing the schemes’ liabilities 
and tested any significant changes since the last valuation. 
We agreed a sample of contributions made by the Group 
to bank statements.
We have no exceptions to report as a result of this testing. Financial statements

Significant contracts
The Enterprise segment in particular enters into arrangements 
with customers which can involve an implementation phase as 
well as subsequent ongoing in-life services. Judgement is 
required in separating these into individual elements. 
In addition, revenue from the initial implementation phase is 
generally accounted on a percentage completion basis, by 
reference to progress in achieving delivery milestones or in 
relation to the proportion of expected costs incurred to date. 
Where the costs to deliver a separate element exceed the anticipated 
revenues a provision for losses on this element is required.
The accounting for these arrangements, as a result, requires 
judgement and can rely upon estimates of the costs to deliver the 
remaining services. A significant proportion of the Enterprise 
segment revenues of £91.0 million arise from these arrangements. 
See the accounting policies section within the financial 
statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, 
judgements and estimates.
We identified the more significant contracts and performed 
testing over a sample. We reviewed the contracts and the project 
management information available in respect of these contracts. 
We considered and evaluated the appropriateness of the basis 
for revenue recognised, whether based on performance milestones 
(which we then tied back to contracts) or the proportion of costs 
incurred, as evidence of the stage of completion. 
Where based on the proportion of costs incurred, we discussed 
the forecast costs to complete with project managers and obtained 
corroborative explanations in support of the estimated remaining 
costs. We performed testing over revenue billed to date and 
over the costs incurred including whether such costs had been 
allocated to the correct contract. Where a provision for forecast 
cost overruns on a contract element was required, we challenged 
management on the calculation of the provision and considered 
the extent of progress on these arrangements post year end.
We have no exceptions to report as a result of this testing.
Classification of exceptional items
Exceptional items consist of a number of one off costs relating to 
restructuring (£7.3 million) and regulatory matters (£0.7 million). 
Given the magnitude of these items we focused additional audit 
effort in this area to determine whether these items were 
appropriately classified as exceptional in accordance with the 
Group’s policy and that the description of the amounts incurred 
was consistent with the nature of the costs. 
See the accounting policies section within the financial 
statements for disclosure of the related accounting policies, 
judgements and estimates and Note 7 for detailed exceptional 
items disclosures.
We tested the classification of exceptional items by evaluating 
the treatment of each class of exceptional item for compliance 
with the Group accounting policy, noting that the policy had been 
applied consistently for all items across the Group. We tested the 
underlying transactions by:
 > testing a sample of redundancy costs to payments made 
and whether the costs incurred were linked to restructuring;
 > by agreeing external restructuring costs to third party 
invoices and by testing outstanding third party provisions 
to commitments and post year end payments; and
 > testing costs in relation to regulatory matters to 
correspondence supporting those matters.
Having performed this testing, we considered whether in our 
view the nature of the items supported separate classification 
as exceptional in line with the Group’s policy and whether the 
narrative descriptions were consistent with the nature of the 
items incurred. We are satisfied that, materially, this is the case. 77 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Our audit approach continued
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the 
group operates. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017 the Group operated using its simplified statutory structure which was implemented on 31 March 2016. 
From that date the majority of trade and associated assets were held within one statutory entity (KCOM Holdings Limited) alongside the 
KCOM Contact Centres business and a simplified holding company structure. Together these entities formed the consolidated 
financial statements.
We performed an audit of the KCOM Holdings entity together with KCOM Contact Centres and the associated holding companies and 
the consolidation. KCOM Holdings was considered to be the only financially significant component given that the vast majority of the 
Group’s revenue and the majority of profit before tax and exceptional items was derived from this entity, however full audits were 
performed over all other components.
Total coverage obtained through the audit of in scope components was 100% of Group revenue, Group profit before tax and exceptional 
items and net assets.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall group materiality £1.9 million (2016: £2.4 million).
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and exceptional items.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before tax and exceptional items is a primary measure used by the 
shareholders in assessing the performance of the Group. Profit before tax is a generally 
accepted auditing benchmark. Exceptional items have been excluded from our materiality 
calculation to ensure that a consistent underlying measure has been used.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1 million 
(2016: £0.1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 42, in relation to going concern. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to 
the Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements. The going concern basis presumes that the group and Parent Company have adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because 
not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the group’s and Parent Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. Financial statements

Companies Act 2006 reporting
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 > the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 > the Strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the group, the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the Strategic report and the 
Directors’ report. We have nothing to report in this respect.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > information in the Annual Report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge 
of the group and Parent Company acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
 > the statement given by the directors on page 41, in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), that they consider the Annual Report taken as a 
whole to be fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
members to assess the Group’s and Parent Company’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and parent 
company acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions 
to report.
 > the section of the Annual Report on page 45, as required by provision C.3.8 of the Code, 
describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
We have no exceptions

The Directors’ assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
 > the Directors’ confirmation on page 24 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.1 
of the Code, that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
 > the disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
 > the Directors’ explanation on page 25 of the Annual Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they 
have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to 
whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to 
add or to draw attention to.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group and the directors’ statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; 
checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the Code; and considering whether the statements are 
consistent with the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have nothing to report having performed our review.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 > the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 41, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Parent Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 > whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 > the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
 > the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic report and Directors’ report, we consider whether those reports 
include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

Financial statements
01 General information
KCOM Group PLC is a public limited company, limited by shares, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated 
and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the registered office is 37 Carr Lane, Hull HU1 3RE. The nature of the Group’s 
operations is described within the Strategic report on pages 3 to 34. 
02 Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These 
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU), IFRS Interpretations Committee and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair 
value through profit and loss. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are 
disclosed in Note 3. 
New accounting standards
There were no new standards, amendments or interpretations that were adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the 
financial year beginning 1 April 2016 that were material to the Group. 
A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 April 2016 and have 
not yet been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following accounting standards are expected to have an impact on 
the Group financial statements.
IFRS 15
In May 2014, IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ was issued for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. This new 
standard will be applicable to the Group for the year ended 31 March 2019. Adoption of IFRS 15 can be applied on a full retrospective 
basis (by restating comparative periods) or as an adjustment to equity at the date of adoption (which is our intended approach).
IFRS 15 sets out the principles for recognising revenue from contracts with customers and will require the Group to use a five step 
approach to allocate the revenue earned from contracts to individual performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.
We are still in the process of completing our detailed assessment and quantification, but we expect the following areas to have an impact:
Where goods or services sold together (for example as part of a ‘bundle’) represent distinct performance obligations, revenue will be 
recognised separately for each obligation either over the period the service is delivered or at the point in time control of an asset is 
passed to the customer. These principles are applicable to customers across all of our segments.
Within the Hull and East Yorkshire and National Network Services segments of our business this may result in more revenue up front and 
lower revenue though the course of the contract. Within our Enterprise business we expect the impact of IFRS 15 to be less significant. 
Under IFRS 15, certain incremental costs incurred in acquiring a contract will be deferred on the balance sheet and amortised in line 
with the recognition of revenue. This will generally relate to the costs of items such as commissions being deferred over the contract 
life.
The Group is continuing to assess the impacts of these and other accounting changes which arise as a result of IFRS 15.
IFRS 16
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’; the standard will be effective for KCOM’s year ending 31 March 2020 with early adoption permitted 
if IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ has been adopted. We have not yet decided whether to early adopt this standard. 
IFRS 16 has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
IFRS 16 will primarily change lease accounting for lessees. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is expected to be similar to IAS 17.
For lessees, operating lease arrangements will give rise to the recognition of a non-current asset representing the right to use the 
leased item and a loan obligation for future lease payables. Lease costs will be recognised in the form of depreciation of the right 
to use assets and interest on the lease liability.
The Group is continuing to assess the impact of IFRS 16, which is expected to have an impact on the Consolidated income statement 
and Consolidated balance sheet. We are yet to quantify this impact.

Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, 
potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements 
include the financial statements of the Company and its undertakings made up to 31 March 2017. The results of new subsidiary 
undertakings are included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation. Where a company has ceased 
to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation. 
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is 
credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line 
with those used by the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and 
are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s share of its associates’ profits or losses is recognised in the income statement. The 
cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. 
Partnerships are controlled when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the 
partnership so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are taken into account. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the KCOM Central 
Asset Reserve Limited Partnership and its undertakings made up to 31 March 2017. The results of new partnership undertakings are 
included from the dates of acquisition using the purchase method of consolidation. Where a company has ceased to be a partnership 
undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
Segment reporting 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker 
(CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identified as the KCOM Group PLC Board of Directors. 
The Group’s operating segments changed on 1 April 2016 and have been further refined, including an increased allocation of central costs, 
during the financial year, as set out in Note 4. The new operating segments continue to be based on customer type and geographic service 
location. The new operating segments are Hull and East Yorkshire, Enterprise, National Network Services and Central. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods 
supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value-added taxes. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be 
reliably measured, when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met 
for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. The Group bases its estimate of return on historical results, taking into 
consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Revenue from calls is recognised in the Consolidated income statement at the time the call is made over the Group’s network. 
Revenue from rentals is recognised evenly over the rental period.
Revenue from product sales is recognised at the point of effective transfer of risk and reward. Revenue from production of 
directories is recognised at the point when the directory is published. For large long-term annuity and multiple element customer 
contracts the Group is able to distinguish between the installation and the in-life service phases of a contract. Revenue is allocated 
based on the fair value of the consideration, which represents the market value of such services, or amounts per contracts, and will 
be recognised on the following basis for each phase:
 > installation – within this phase revenue relating to resources and services is accounted for on a stage of completion basis with 
reference to the proportion of total costs incurred to date or to contract milestones, dependent on the nature of the contract. 
Revenue related to equipment is accounted for based on the point of effective transfer of risks and rewards (shipment); and
 > in-life service – revenue for this phase is recognised in line with the obligation to provide service as dictated by customer contracts.
Pre-contract costs, such as bid costs, on key contract wins are expensed as and when incurred.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services, including maintenance contracts, is recognised in the accounting period in 
which services are rendered, by reference to stage of completion of the specific transaction, and assessed on the basis of the actual 
service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. 87 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

02 Accounting policies continued
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide better understanding of the 
financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance 
of their nature or amount. In particular costs associated with organisational restructuring, regulatory matters, costs and provisions 
associated with onerous contracts, profits or losses on the sale of an operation and one-off pension costs and credits are treated as 
exceptional items.
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and is the difference between the cost of the 
acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate potential impairment. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that 
are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is 
allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Development costs 
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s internal development activities is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 > an asset is created that can be identified (such as new processes); 
 > it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
 > the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. 
Internally generated intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis 
over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Research costs are expensed to the income statement as and when they are incurred. 
Customer and supplier relationships
Contractual customer and supplier relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. The contractual customer and supplier relations have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected life of the relationship. These intangible assets are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Technology and brand
Technology and brand acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Assumptions are 
used in estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets and include management’s estimates of revenue and profits to be 
generated by the acquired businesses. These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Software
Software comprises computer software purchased from third parties and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer 
software purchased from third parties and internally developed software is initially recorded at cost.
Software development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products 
controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the criteria detailed above are met. These intangible assets are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
Other software development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Software 
development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Amortisation  
Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
intangible asset. Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Customer and supplier relationships up to 8 years 
Technology and brand up to 10 years 
Software up to 10 years 
Development costs 3 years Notes to the financial statements continued

Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. Network infrastructure and related equipment (included within exchange equipment and external plant) is recorded 
at cost including labour costs directly attributable to the cost of the network construction. Depreciation is provided so as to write 
off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight-line basis over the assets’ useful estimated lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 years 
Leasehold buildings and improvements period of lease 
Exchange equipment 10 years 
External plant 10 to 40 years 
Vehicles, other apparatus and equipment 3 to 10 years
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Exchange equipment includes assets and equipment which relate to the network. External plant relates to assets which connect the 
network to our customers.
During the year the useful economic life of the Group’s fibre network (within external plant) was changed from 20 years to 40 years, 
as the directors considered this to be a better reflection of the period over which economic benefit is derived from the assets. Using the 
previous economic life, the depreciation charge for the year would have been £0.3 million greater than that recorded.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually. Depreciation of network infrastructure and related equipment is 
provided for from the date the network comes into operation. 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. 
Fixed asset investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. They are reviewed at each reporting date for possible 
reversal of the impairment. 
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill – are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units (CGUs) are allocated first to 
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to CGUs and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on 
a pro-rata basis.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method. Costs 
include raw materials and, where appropriate, direct overhead expenses. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, 
slow moving or defective items where appropriate. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
method, less any impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial 
difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in 
payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of provision is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the 
income statement within operating expenses. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account 
for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts written off are credited against operating expenses in the income statement. 89 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |
Financial statements
02 Accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, short-term deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the 
balance sheet, unless a right of offset exists. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax expense.
The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and/or items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised generally for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises or from the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor 
the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced or increased to the extent that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and 
interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that 
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly to equity. In this case the deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. 
Financial instruments and hedge accounting 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its Treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently recognised at fair value. Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair 
value is recognised immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of 
the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. 
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. The fair value of 
forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the 
time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other 
comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in recognition of 
an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged 
item affects net profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is transferred to the income statement in the period.  Notes to the financial statements continued

Foreign currency translation
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the Group operates. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. 
Leasing and hire purchase commitments 
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets held 
under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of 
the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives. The capital elements of future obligations 
under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet. The interest elements of the rental 
obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts. The finance charge is 
allocated to each period during the lease so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Bank borrowings and issue costs 
Bank borrowings are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the 
loan. Finance charges, including direct issue costs are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Borrowings are carried subsequently at amortised cost and any differences between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value are recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Pensions 
Defined contribution 
Obligations for contributions to the defined contribution (money purchase) scheme are charged to the income statement in the 
period they fall due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
Defined benefit 
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using a building block approach, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurements are recognised in full in the period in which they occur 
and are recognised in equity and presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The current and past service costs of the scheme (the increase in the present value of employees’ future benefits attributable to the 
current or prior periods) are charged to the income statement in the period. The cost or benefit of committed settlements and 
curtailments is recognised immediately in the income statement. The interest cost of the scheme is recognised in the income 
statement in the period to which it relates. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as 
adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation 
is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan. 
Employee share schemes and share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all 
grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. 
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and discretionary long-term incentive schemes, provide 
employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company. Employee share options and long-term incentive schemes are 
generally subject to performance or service conditions. 
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over 
the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met, or immediately where no performance or service 
criteria exist. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments granted is measured using either the Black-Scholes or Monte 
Carlo model, depending on the terms under which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to 
reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market-based performance 
criteria not being met. 
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the 
non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity.
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP) under which employees have the option to purchase shares in the Company each 
month and offers employees free matching and partnership shares on a sliding scale of between 1:3 to 2:1. The Group recognises the 
free shares as an expense over the period of any applicable service condition, or immediately when no service condition exists.  91 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

02 Accounting policies continued
Dividends 
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in 
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, 
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
03 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Impairment of non-current assets 
Determining whether a non-current asset is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use and/or the estimated recoverable 
amount of the asset derived from the business, or part of the business, or CGU, to which the non-current asset has been allocated. 
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU, 
by applying an appropriate discount rate to the timing and amount of future cash flows. 
The Directors are required to make judgements regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows applicable to the CGU, based 
on current budgets and forecasts, and extrapolated for an appropriate period taking into account growth rates and expected 
changes to selling prices and operating costs. The Directors estimate the appropriate discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the individual CGU. For further disclosure, see Note 14.
Post-employment benefits 
The Group operates two defined benefit schemes. All post-employment benefits associated with these schemes have been 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits (revised)’. As detailed within the accounting policies note, in 
accordance with IAS 19, all actuarial gains and losses have been recognised immediately through the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income. 
For all defined benefit pension schemes, pension valuations have been performed using specialist advice obtained from 
independent qualified actuaries. In performing these valuations, judgements, assumptions and estimates have been made. 
These assumptions have been disclosed within Note 29.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide better understanding 
of the financial performance of the Group. They are material items of income or expense that are shown separately due to the 
significance of their nature or amount. 
The Directors are required to make judgements regarding whether items are material to the users of the accounts and whether 
separate disclosure will aid the understanding of the financial performance. 
Significant contracts
The Group, at times, enters into significant contracts with customers, which include both an ‘installation’ and an ‘in-life service’. 
Revenue relating to the ‘installation’ phase is accounted for on a stage of completion basis. Revenue relating to the ‘in-life service’ is 
recognised in line with the satisfaction of the obligation to provide the service. 
The Directors are required to make judgements in order to separate the contract into the two phases. The Directors are also required 
to make judgements relating to the stage of completion of the installation phase, which includes estimating the work necessary to 
complete the phase. 
04 Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments are based on the reports reviewed by the KCOM Group PLC Board which are used to make 
strategic decisions. The chief operating decision-maker of the Group is the KCOM Group PLC Board. 
For the year ended 31 March 2017, the Board considered four segments in assessing the performance of the Group and making 
decisions in relation to the allocation of resources. These four segments are Hull and East Yorkshire, Enterprise, National Network 
Services and Central.
In our report and accounts for the year ended 31 March 2016, we explained the changes to our segments which arose as a result 
of the move from four brands (KC, Kcom, Eclipse and Smart 421), to one brand, KCOM.
The changes included three ‘go to market’ segments, along with a shared segment. In our disclosure notes we re-presented our 
results for the year ended 31 March 2016 on this new basis.
During the year, and as part of the Group’s evolution, we have continued to refine those segments to align with the way the business 
is run and financial performance is analysed.  Notes to the financial statements continued
for the year ended 31 March 2017

04 Segmental analysis continued
We have further analysed our shared cost base in order to meaningfully allocate to our go to market segments. This provides 
segmental performance at a lower level in the income statement than disclosed at the half year. This means that the level of residual 
cost relates only to costs of the central functions with all network costs being allocated to go to market segments. As a result, the 
costs shown in our shared segment are materially lower than disclosed in our re-presented results for the year ended 31 March 2016 
and our interim results for the period ended 30 September 2016. As a result of this change, this segment has been renamed Central.
We have further refined the customers allocated to our Enterprise segment. These are now fewer in number and relate solely to 
our largest customers where the revenue relates to complex communication and IP-based collaboration services. As a result, a 
greater proportion of our legacy network customers are now part of our National Network Services segment (renamed from 
SMB National).
A summary of these changes is set out below:

allocation to the underlying segments 
would not improve understanding of 
these segments. These costs include 
share schemes and pensions, alongside 
the residual cost of finance, HR, risk, 
legal and communications once 
appropriate recharges have been made to 
go to market segments. 
Change from 30 September 2016: Costs 
allocated out to segments, where they 
can be allocated meaningfully. Name 
changed to Central.
As disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016, KCOM Group continues to have one business-wide EBITDA 
with segment profitability (contribution) used as the metric of reporting segmental performance. Following the refinement and 
allocation of our shared costs, contribution represents gross margin less all costs directly attributable to the segment. 93 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Our continued business transformation has resulted in the need to restructure our business in order to provide the right number of 
people with the right skills and bring together our activities under a single brand. As a result, and in line with our accounting policy, 
the Group incurred costs of £7.3 million (2016: £4.1 million) during the period. These costs include:
 > £3.4 million of redundancy costs; 
 > £2.4 million of advisory and other costs; 
 > £1.0 million in relation to KCOM rebranding; and
 > £0.5 million of costs supporting the system changes required as part of our restructuring. 
The Group also incurred £0.7 million in relation to regulatory matters. As noted in our interim results announcement, we received a 
provisional notification from Ofcom in October 2016, stating that KCOM may have failed to comply fully with a required “General 
Condition” between 2009 and 2015. Following representations in response, Ofcom, in February, withdrew that provisional notification. 
Ofcom has continued its investigation and issued a revised provisional notification in June 2017, in response to which we will make 
further representations in order to reach a final conclusion with Ofcom. The regulatory matters item represents a provision for any 
potential liability in relation to this matter and a credit resulting from a further settlement of claims in relation to an industry wide 
regulatory ruling dating back to the previous year (2016: £2.8 million credit).
Other exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2016 relate to:
 > profit on the sale of the Group’s national telecommunications network (£44.5 million); and
 > onerous lease costs arising as a result of rationalisation of the Group’s property portfolio (£2.3 million).
The combined effect of these items is a credit of £1,596,000 (2016: charge of £16,520,000) in respect of current tax and 
£Nil (2016: credit of £8,343,000) in respect of deferred tax. 
The cash flow impact of exceptional items is £8.3 million.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in trust. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the 
exceptional items net of taxation and dividing this adjusted figure by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held in trust.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume 
conversion of all dilutive ordinary shares. The dilutive potential ordinary shares are in the form of share options. A calculation has 
been done to determine the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
13 Share-based payments 
The Group had three share-based payment schemes (2016: three) in existence during the year ended 31 March 2017. The Group

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) that is expected 
to benefit from that business combination. 
CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows 
from other groups of assets. As in previous years, KCOM’s CGUs are based on customer type and geographic service location.
As disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2016, our goodwill CGUs changed on 1 April 2016, following the move 
to one brand, KCOM, and the allocation of customers to three go to market segments.
As set out in our segmental analysis in Note 4, there have been certain changes to our customer allocation during the year which 
have refined the split of our customers between our three go to market segments. As set out below, this refinement (performed 
on a basis consistent with the exercise performed on 1 April 2016) has altered the allocation of goodwill between two CGUs.

14 Goodwill continued
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these value in use calculations relate to 
discount rates, growth rates and forecast cash flows. The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the level of risk. Growth rates reflect long-term growth rate prospects for the UK economy. 
Cash flow forecasts are prepared using the current operating budget approved by the Directors, which covers a three year period and an 
appropriate extrapolation of cash flows beyond this. The cash flow forecasts assume revenue and profit growth in line with our strategic priorities. 
The Directors have considered the level of headroom arising from the impairment tests of each of our CGUs. Where appropriate, further 
sensitivity analysis has been performed by changing the base case assumptions applicable to each CGU. The analysis indicated that no 
reasonably possible changes in any individual key assumption would cause the carrying amount of the business to exceed its recoverable

Impairment testing was also performed immediately prior to the changes in goodwill allocation set out above; these tests were performed 
on a consistent basis and also supported the carrying value of the Group’s goodwill balances.
The discount rate and growth rate (in perpetuity) used for value in use calculations are as follows: 
2017 2016
Discount rate (pre-tax) % 8.0 8.9
Growth rate (in perpetuity) % 2.0 2.0
The assumptions within the value in use calculation which have the most significant impact relate to forecast cash flows (both 
underlying trading performance and ongoing network costs), pre-tax discount rate and perpetuity growth rate. The estimates used 
within our value in use calculation take into account historical experience and the Board’s estimate of future events.

All of the Group’s receivables are due within one year in both 2017 and 2016. An allowance has been made for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods and services of £828,000 (2016: £1,548,000). The Directors consider that the carrying 
amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.

Note 27 provides further disclosures regarding the credit risk of the Group’s trade receivables.
As of 31 March 2017, trade receivables of £4,787,000 (2016: £6,834,000) were impaired. The amount of the provision was £828,000 
as of 31 March 2017 (2016: £1,548,000). The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly 
difficult economic situations. It was assessed that a portion of the impaired balance is expected to be recovered. There is no concern 
over the debt not yet due.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows:

Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The Directors 
consider that the carrying amount of current liabilities approximates to their fair value.
At 31 March 2016 other taxes and social security costs included a VAT creditor of £18.0 million resulting from the exceptional gain 
on the sale of the Group’s infrastructure relating to its national telecommunications network. 
Amounts owed to subsidiary undertakings are unsecured and have no fixed date of repayment. However, the subsidiary 
undertakings have confirmed that none of the amounts are due within one year. Interest at market rates is charged on amounts due 
to subsidiary undertakings after more than one year, except for amounts due to dormant entities where Nil interest is charged.

The loan facility was secured by guarantees given by all material subsidiaries of KCOM Group PLC in favour of the lending banks.
The bank borrowings are fully repayable in December 2021 and attract an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin dependent on specific 
covenants. For further information on interest rate swaps, see Note 27. The above bank facilities were refinanced in September 2016. 
See Note 27 for further detail.
In 2016 the Group repaid all outstanding loan borrowings and as a consequence associated outstanding loan issue costs (£1.2 million) 
were reclassified to other receivables. During 2017 the Group has drawn down on its loan facility and therefore loan issue costs have 
been classified against bank borrowings.

Deferred tax assets relating to property, plant and equipment and short-term timing differences of £0.4 million (2016: £2.1 million) 
have been recognised in those subsidiary companies in which there is sufficient available evidence that suitable taxable profits will 
arise against which these assets are expected to reverse. There are additional deferred tax assets of £0.6 million (2016: £1.1 million) 
which have not been recognised, as there is insufficient evidence as to the generation of suitable profits against which these assets 
can be offset. The utilisation of these assets would reduce the Group’s tax charge in future periods. Deferred tax has been provided 
at the rate at which it is expected to unwind.

(2016: 666,000) of the Company’s ordinary shares through purchases on the London Stock Exchange for a total cash consideration 
of £1,778,051 (2016: £450,000) in order to meet future obligations under the Company’s SIP and LTIP schemes. The total amount 
paid to acquire the shares, net of expenses and cash received for the exercise of share options, of £1,778,051 (2016: £450,000)

Financial statements
27 Financial instruments and risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised bank loans, cash on short-term deposits, and forward foreign 
exchange contracts. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations and to minimise the impact 
of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows. The Group has various other financial instruments such as short-term 
receivables and payables which arise directly from its operations.
The Group regularly reviews its exposure to interest, liquidity and foreign currency risk. Where appropriate the Group will take 
action, in accordance with a Board approved Treasury policy, to minimise the impact on the business of movements in interest rates 
and currency rates.
The Group only enters into derivative instruments with members of the banking group to ensure appropriate counterparty credit quality.
Liquidity risk
The Group keeps its short, medium and long-term funding requirements under constant review. Its policy is to have sufficient 
committed funds available to meet medium-term requirements, with flexibility and headroom to make minor acquisitions for cash 
if the opportunity should arise.
The Group’s bank facilities were refinanced in September 2016 to replace existing facilities. These bank facilities comprise a 
multi-currency revolving credit facility of £180.0 million, provided by a group of five core relationship banks. The facility matures in 
December 2021. The Group considers that this facility will provide sufficient funding to meet the organic and inorganic investment 
needs of the business. In addition, short-term flexibility of funding is available under the £8.0 million overdraft facility in Pound 
Sterling and $2.0 million overdraft facility in US Dollars provided by the Group’s clearing bankers.
The net funds position of £7.4 million at the beginning of the financial year has decreased during the year to net debt of £42.4 million. 
The Group generated negative cash flow after investing activities of £15.6 million for the year (2016: £141.9 million positive).
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based 
on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. Notional interest is included for the period from 
the year end up to the contractual maturity date of the debt, calculated on the amount of debt drawn down at the year end.

Foreign currency risk
Cash flow exposure
The Group’s only major foreign currency risk arises due to the purchase of equipment invoiced in US Dollars. Whenever possible the 
Group resells this equipment in US Dollars. The remaining exposure is managed principally through the use of forward foreign 
exchange contracts in order to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on future cash flows and gross margin.
The Group also has some Euro cash flows but these are not material on a net basis and are not hedged.
Net asset exposure
The Dollar-denominated trading described above results in a balance sheet exposure since debtor days are longer than creditor 
days. It is the Group’s policy not to hedge this exposure. Notes to the financial statements continued

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to business and 
retail customers.
Credit ratings of institutions which hold the Group’s financial assets are regularly monitored to ensure they meet the minimum credit 
criteria set by the Board through the Group Treasury policy. At the year end all the institutions holding the Group’s financial assets 
were rated A-/A- or higher by Standard and Poor’s.
The credit quality of customers is assessed by taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. 
Individual risk limits are set and the utilisation of credit limits monitored regularly. 
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers. For an analysis of 
the quality of the ageing of the Group’s trade receivables, see Note 19 for further disclosures. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. The 
Group does not hold any collateral as security. 
Currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets
The Group had net financial assets of £10.2 million at the year end (2016: £13.2 million), comprising cash on overnight money market 
deposits and cash at bank. This attracts floating rates of interest.
The currency profile of the Group’s financial assets at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was:
2017 2016
£’000 £’000
Currency
Sterling 4,705 9,139
US Dollar 5,130 3,925
Euro 355 148
Total 10,190 13,212
Foreign currency cash balances are held on a short-term basis to fund cash flow requirements in these currencies. All trade 
receivable balances are held in Sterling and bear no interest. There is no currency risk associated with these balances.
At the year end £1.3 million (2016: £1.3 million) of cash collateral was held by Barclays in respect of a bank guarantee given under 
Ofcom’s ‘Funds for Liabilities’ regulations.
Financial liabilities
The currency and interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial borrowings at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was:
2017 2016
Floating Fixed Total Floating Fixed Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
Sterling 50,000 — 50,000 — — —
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the year end were £130.0 million (2016: £200.0 million).
Interest on amounts drawn under the committed borrowing facility is based on the relevant LIBOR plus margin. All trade payable 
balances are held in Sterling and bear no interest. There is no currency risk associated with these balances.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, support the 
growth of the business and maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the 
Consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: 
 > quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
 > inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) 
or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2); and
 > inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
All of the Group’s financial instruments fall into hierarchy level 2.  109 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Under the Group’s £180.0 million revolving credit facility the Group is required to comply annually with certain financial and 
non-financial covenants. The Group is required to maintain a minimum interest cover ratio and a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio. 
Both financial covenants were tested and complied with throughout the year and at the year end. The Board monitors both covenant 
compliance and net debt performance on a regular basis.

29 Retirement benefit obligation – consolidated
Defined contribution schemes
The Company operates defined contribution schemes, which are open to all eligible employees. Contributions charged to the 
income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes amounted to £3.6 million (2016: £4.1 million).
Defined benefit schemes
The principal defined benefit scheme at 31 March 2017 was the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme, which is a funded 
scheme and provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary. The assets of the scheme are held separately from the 
assets of the Group in Trustee administered funds. The Company also operates a second funded defined benefit scheme, the 
Kingston Communications (Data) Pension Scheme. Both schemes are closed to both new members and future accrual.
The defined benefit schemes are operated in the UK under the same regulatory frameworks. Both of the schemes are final salary pension 
schemes, which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided 
depends on members’ length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. In the schemes, pensions in payment are 
generally updated in line with the Retail Price Index. In addition to this inflationary risk, the schemes face the same risks, as described below. 
All of the benefit payments are from Trustee administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and 
practice, as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees (or equivalent) and their composition. Responsibility 
for governance of the plans – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies jointly with the Group and the Trustees. 
The Trustees must be composed of representatives of the Group and scheme participants in accordance with the scheme’s regulations. Notes to the financial statements continued

Parent Company
KCH (Holdings) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, is responsible for all obligations and liabilities of the schemes. 
An equivalent liability has been provided in the accounts of KCH (Holdings) Limited.
The Parent Company provides a guarantee to both defined benefit schemes, whereby if KCH (Holdings) Limited is unable to meet its 
obligations to the schemes, such obligations would be met by the Parent Company. No liability has been recognised in respect of the 
guarantee at 31 March 2017 (2016: £Nil).
Most recent valuations
The most recent formal valuation for the Kingston Communications Pension Scheme was at 31 March 2013 (2016 valuation currently 
being finalised). The main long-term financial assumptions used in that valuation were:
Per annum

Rate of return on scheme assets 3.90
Rate of future salary inflation 2.90

Funding
Asset-backed partnership
On 31 March 2013, the Group reached an agreement with the Trustees to provide the Group with an efficient mechanism of funding 
the schemes’ current deficit position.
The Group established a general partner, KCOM (General Partner) Limited, and a partnership, KCOM Central Asset Reserve Limited 
Partnership (“the Partnership”), which are both consolidated within these financial statements. The Group takes advantage of the 
exception conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of 
the Partnership to these accounts. Separate accounts for the Partnership are not required to be filed at Companies House. The Group 
provided sufficient capital to the Partnership to enable it to procure freehold property assets with a market value of £12.6 million owned 
by fellow Group subsidiaries. These properties were immediately leased back and continue to be operated by those Group companies 
and not by the Partnership. The Group retains control over these properties including the flexibility of substituting the freehold 
property assets with other assets. As partners in the Partnership, the pension schemes are entitled to an annual income distribution.
On 24 March 2014, the Group reached an agreement with the Trustees to provide further funding of the schemes’ current deficit 
position through the Partnership.
As part of this agreement, a loan note of £20.0 million was secured over the Hull and East Yorkshire network asset. The security does 
not offer the Trustees any ‘normal’ rights of enforcement over the assets. Instead it provides first priority payment of any value that 
would be realised from the Hull and East Yorkshire network on an insolvency event.
As partners in the Partnership, the pension schemes are entitled to an annual income distribution of £1.6 million, rising in line with 
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) (capped at 5%) over a potential period of 15 years. The total value of this income distribution to the 
schemes is £16.0 million, which provided an immediate improvement to the funding deficit. 
Under IAS 19, the investment held by the pension schemes in the Partnership does not represent a plan asset for the purpose of the 
Group’s consolidated accounts. The distribution of the Partnership’s profits to the pension schemes is reflected as pension 
contributions in these Group accounts on a cash basis. 111 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 |

Employer contributions for the year ended 31 March 2017
The disclosures in the table below are for the two schemes combined.
Contributions into the two defined benefit schemes during the year were as follows:
2017 2016
£’000 £’000
Payments to the schemes 7,724 6,565
Main financial assumptions
2017 2016
per annum per annum
% %
RPI inflation 3.15 2.95
CPI inflation 2.15 1.95
Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.20 2.00
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 2.50 3.45
Our approach is to base the discount rate on the AA yield curve published by Merrill Lynch, over an 18 year duration for the schemes.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables, which allow for future improvements in life expectancy. 
The effects of these tables are that:
 > a future pensioner aged 65 at retirement will live on average to age 88.8 (2016: 89.1) if they are male and on average to age 90.7 
(2016: 91.3) if they are female; and
 > a current pensioner aged 65 will live on average to age 87.4 (2016: 87.4) if they are male and on average to age 89.1 (2016: 89.3) 
if they are female.
The key assumptions used for IAS 19 are discount rate, inflation and mortality. The sensitivity of the net retirement benefit obligation 
deficit to changes in the assumptions is as follows:
Impact on the deficit
Sensitivity Of increase Of decrease
RPI inflation 0.1% 20.8% (18.8%)
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 0.1% (23.9%) 24.4%
Mortality 1 year 42.2% (42.7%)
The sensitivity analysis in the table above is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the 
retirement benefit obligation deficit to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit 
liability calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the 
retirement benefit obligation deficit recognised in the Group balance sheet.
