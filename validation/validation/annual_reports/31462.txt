Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Ten Entertainment Group is focused 
on delivering family entertainment in 
a growing sector of the leisure market. 
Our mission is to make families and friends 
happy; to entertain and enthral profitably. 
The way that people and families interact 
has changed rapidly in recent times and 
we are able to bring families and friends 
together to play, and to have fun in a very 
modern way through the Tenpin brand. 
Our growth strategy is designed to support 
and strengthen our business model, and is 
focused on three simple routes: incremental 
organic growth; growth through acquisition; 
and ongoing investment into both our 
estate and into our support platform. 
This is because firstly, many more marginal 
gains exist across our operations; secondly, 
because value has been proven in acquiring 
single units, converting them to “The Tenpin 
Way” and of course accruing scale benefits; 
and lastly, because sustainability of profit 
growth derived from the lifeblood of a steady 
drip feed of capital to maintain modernity 
and relevance to our consumers and attract 
high-quality operating talent. The logic is 
entirely evident.
We have made very good progress with 
this strategy during recent years.
Our self-managed growth strategy 
is clearly defined and is driven by the 
three routes, but we are also determined 
to see our available market grow as 
consumers gain enthusiasm for spending 
time and their income on more experiences 
and less traditional product purchases. 
Ten Entertainment Group operates with a 
simple, profitable, proven business model 
and with a proposition that is entirely 
customer driven, underpinned by a 
strong culture formed and protected 
by our colleagues. 
2017 was a year of significant progress for 
the Group with the successful listing on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.
During April 2017, we welcomed our new 
shareholders to benefit from our robust, 
de-leveraged but growing business.
Ten Entertainment Group plc has 
performed well during FY17: good 
like-for-like sales growth again, the 
successful completion of a further three 
acquisitions and refurbishments at six 
of our centres. Following the successful 
pilot of a business transformation project, 
Pins & Strings, we are now extending this 
technology into ten more of our locations in 
2018 and in time, across each of our venues. 
The combination of these achievements 
has resulted in strong EBITDA growth 
of 14% during the year and therefore we 
can confidently propose a payment of a 
maiden full-year dividend. I am pleased 
to report Group adjusted earnings per 
share of 16.2p.
A key aspect of our sustained and 
most recent performance is our highly 
experienced and motivated leadership 
team, together with a very special culture 
which is focused on delivering consistently 
great experiences for our customers. 
One way we can see this is the most crucial 
measure: our impressive, sector-leading 
Net Promoter Score of 66%, up from 49% 
in 2016. We know it is a crucial correlate 
to sales growth, and therefore core 
underlying profit growth.
I believe operating teams across the 
Group, served by the senior leadership 
team and support group, has the right 
skillset to execute the Group’s strategy, 
deliver significant further growth and drive 
strong returns for shareholders. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to personally 
thank all of our teams and colleagues 
across the Group for their commitment 
and dedication to the Group during 2017. 
They are a remarkable group of people 
and we are privileged to enjoy their efforts 
and enjoyment in working for Tenpin.

6 | Strategic report We put our customers at the 
heart of everything we do
At Ten Entertainment Group, our people are focused on making 
each customer’s visit a memorable one, and our culture supports 
our teams to provide those consistently great customer experiences. 
This has resulted in our Net Promoter Score increasing 17 percentage 
points to 66% in 2017.
The Group believes that engaged employees leads to high 
customer satisfaction, and we are proud to have been accredited 
as a “Great Place to Work”. We have also maintained our Investors in 
People Gold standard since 2014. These awards are reflected by 
our own colleagues, with 90% saying they would recommend 
Tenpin as a great place to work.
We provide our people with bespoke training modules to ensure 
they have the skills required to provide great service, with both a 
management development programme and an area management 
programme available to colleagues. We also introduced our 
apprenticeship programme “Tenpin’s Got Talent” this year.

To develop and protect our business 
further we apply good corporate governance 
through a strong and independently minded 
Board which has been appointed to assist 
the Group achieve its aspirations and deliver 
its potential. It meets on a regular basis and 
all have already made substantial progress.
Our strong balance sheet is currently 
de-levered specifically to protect against 
any downside risk on future covenants 
and give us scope for assurance and flexibility 
to sensibly use free cash for dividends 
or acquisitions. The balance sheet also 
provides us with good access to capital 
to take advantage of current and future 
potential to deliver long-term value to 
our shareholders.
The Board are recommending a final 
dividend of 7.0p per share, resulting in 
a full-year dividend of 10.0p per share.
The business is in strong shape, with 
much potential remaining and has a simple 
and proven, low risk, but high growth 
strategy that will enable Ten Entertainment 
to continue to prosper further, delight its 
customers more and deliver consistent 
and stronger returns for shareholders. 
I strongly believe our business is well 
positioned in a growing sector of the 
wider leisure market, and can continue 
to provide our customers with great value, 
family-oriented entertainment, differentiated 
to many leisure propositions.
This ought to be a compelling case for 
many shareholders seeking security of 
income returns coupled with longer-term 
prospects of capital upside.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc “ We believe that the 
Group’s commitment 
to people and their 
development in turn 
results in exceptional 
customer service.”
We are pleased with the Group’s 
performance during FY17, achieving the 
Board’s expectations delivering total sales 
growth of 8.9%, adjusted EBITDA growth 
of 14% and adjusted earnings per share of 
16.2p. Reported profit after tax grew by 43%.
Putting families and friends at the heart 
of our strategy has been instrumental 
in driving our sustainable growth model. 
Our strategy of organic growth, growth 
through acquisition and growth through 
ongoing investment in our estate have 
all combined to support our growth 
during FY17.
Revenue grew by 8.9% to £71.0m when 
compared to the proforma 52-week sales 
for FY16 (proforma sales reflect comparison 
to the 52 weeks between week 2-53 of FY16 
to adjust for the impact of the 53rd week 
in FY16, explained further on page 26). 
This growth was driven by an encouraging 
combination of both like-for-like sales 
growth of 3.6%, driven by a combination 
of spend per head and footfall, and growth 
from the addition of new sites of 5.3%. 
Three site acquisitions were completed 
during the year, in line with our estate growth 
target range of two to four acquisitions per 
year. On a 52-week vs. 53-week reported 
basis revenue grew by 5.5%.
Like-for-like sales growth was driven by 
our continuing focus on good value family 
entertainment, improving our customer 
service standards and Net Promoter Score 
and our ongoing investment into the estate. 
The refurbishments completed at the end 
of FY16 at five of the sites acquired in FY15 
supported strong like-for-like growth in 
these sites, in what was their second year 
under the Tenpin brand. This is supportive 
of our unique Tenpinisation strategy, our 
proven process of converting acquisitions 
to the T enpin model, whereby on acquisition 
sites go through a seven-step integration plan, 
introducing new company controls and IT 
and embedding operational systems to create
multi-channel connectivity, maximise 
yield and review for further capital 
investment, all supported by our skilled 
people. Over and above this, we know 
there is further opportunity and potential 
for us to enhance our sales by better use 
of digital marketing. We have increased 
the size of our contactable database 
by 25% during the year and recruited a 
new digital marketing Director to drive 
engagement with both our existing 
and potential new customers.
Group adjusted EBITDA on the same 
proforma basis grew by 14.4% to £19.0m 
(FY16 PF: £16.6m), with growth driven by 
a combination of the like-for-like sales 
growth and sales growth from increasing 
the number of sites in the estate, together 
with good underlying cost control from 
our self-help programmes. These self-help 
programmes included the implementation 
of a new payroll management system late 
in FY16 and improved rents at four sites as 
a result of negotiated lease re-gears, both 
of which combined to drive underlying 
operating cost reductions of around 1%. 
On a 52-week vs. 53-week reported basis 
EBITDA grew by 8.0%.
As planned, we made good further progress 
with our acquisition programme during FY17, 
completing the acquisitions of three sites 
in Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. 
Tenpinisation has been completed at all 
three sites. Both Blackburn and Eastbourne 
were also refurbished during the year with 
Rochdale planned for refurbishment during 
FY18. The sites have transitioned well to the 
Tenpin model and, overall, are performing 
in line with our original expectations.
We remain confident in the pipeline of 
acquisition opportunities as we look ahead, 
and during FY18 we expect to grow the 
estate further, in line with previous guidance 
of two to four sites per year. We have made 
good early progress with this objective 
having completed the acquisition of two sites 
in Warrington and Chichester in February.

Putting families and friends at the heart 
of our strategy has been instrumental in 
driving our sustainable growth model
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
8 | Strategic report These sites have started their Tenpinisation 
programme and will undergo significant 
refurbishments during FY18.
During the second half of FY17, we 
completed refurbishments of existing 
estate sites in line with our plans at Derby, 
Swansea and Leamington Spa, together 
with a refurbishment at Ipswich (acquired 
in FY16). In total, across both the existing 
estate and acquired sites, six sites benefitted 
from Tenpinisation and refurbishment 
investment during FY17 at a total cost 
of £1.3m. During FY18 we will continue 
to invest in our sites, including a planned 
refurbishment and extension of our 
site in Fountain Park, and selective, 
return-focused, investment in 
refurbishments at a small number 
of further sites in the existing estate. 
Finally, on investment expenditure, 
and in line with our previous guidance, 
we completed the installation of the 
innovative Pins & Strings technology at 
a further five sites (Croydon, Parrs Wood, 
Northampton, Glasgow and Derby) during 
the second half of FY17 at a total cost of 
£1.0m. Pins & Strings is an innovative, new 
generation bowling machine that requires 
less maintenance, is simpler to operate and 
provides improved reliability for customers, 
demonstrated by improvements in the key 
games played per stop metric. We are 
encouraged with the early results at these 
sites and evidence confirms that Pins & 
Strings has the potential to both improve 
the cost efficiency of our sites and also 
improve the overall customer experience. 
As a result of the successful trial, we now 
plan to roll out Pins & Strings across the 
estate over time, and expect to introduce 
the technology to around a further ten 
sites during FY18.
Securing the future of our estate 
continues to be a key priority. During FY17 
we completed lease re-gears, both 
extending the leases and improving the 
terms at Derby, Colchester and Stafford,
reduced the rent at Maidenhead and also 
successfully renewed an expiring lease at 
our site in Swansea. We will continue to 
look for opportunities to both improve 
rental terms and secure the future of our 
estate during FY18.
I stated in our interim results in September 
that I was pleased with how our teams 
throughout the business performed during 
a very busy period which also included the 
completion of a successful IPO process, 
and I am delighted with how they continued 
to perform during a busy second half, 
allowing us to deliver results in line with 
our strategy. This hard work, together with 
the Group’s focus on people, achieved 
deserved recognition from the “Great 
Place to Work” awards, and enabled the 
Group to maintain the prestigious Investors 
in People Gold standard. We believe that the 
Group’s commitment to people and their 
development in turn results in exceptional 
customer service thereby delivering an 
exceptional experience. As a result, we 
achieved significant improvements in 
our Net Promoter Score during the year, 
moving from 49% in FY16 to 66% in FY17. 
I would like to thank all our colleagues for 
their support in providing our customers 
with a great experience.
Outlook 
We have plans in place to continue to 
drive growth in line with our strategy 
during the current financial year and 
expect to perform in line with the Board’s 
expectations. We continue to believe that 
there is further potential for growth in the 
experiential leisure market and the Group 
is well positioned to benefit from this trend.

Growth through acquisition of 
existing bowling sites is a key part of 
our strategy, and we are pleased to have 
acquired three sites this year, which is 
good progress on our strategy to add 
between two and four sites to our 
portfolio per year. 
We look for sites in good locations 
that are typically underinvested and 
that we feel can be improved by our 
Tenpinisation process, which aligns 
the sites with the Tenpin brand and 
processes. There is a good identified 
pipeline of sites that match our criteria

to deliver on our strategy.

Strategic report | 9
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Operating review
In April 2017, as part of its IPO process, 
the Group outlined its strategy to the market. 
The strategy has been designed to deliver 
sustainable growth in three key areas:
• organic growth;
• growth through investment in 
refurbishment and technology; and
• site acquisition and Tenpinisation.
Organic growth
Like-for-like sales growth in the period 
was 3.6%. Encouragingly, this growth was 
driven by a combination of both increased 
footfall and higher spend per head per visit. 
Spend per head grew by 0.6% in the year 
to £14.21 (FY16 PF: £14.12) with footfall 
growing by 3.0%. 
Like-for-like sales growth was underpinned 
by our continued focus on offering our 
customers great value family entertainment 
through our well-established deals and 
promotions, our ongoing focus on customer 
service to improve Net Promoter Scores 
and an improved reliability of our lanes 
as measured by games played per stop. 
In addition, our investment into 
refurbishments at both acquired sites 
and sites within the existing estate are 
delivering good returns and higher sales. 
There was growth across all four of our 
sales segments: bowling, food, beverage 
and other amusements, with bowling 
revenue growing at the strongest rate as 
we improved both the quality and reliability 
of our offer. Games played per stop is our 
key measure of reliability and this metric 
improved by 39% to 259 (FY16: 186) during 
the year, underpinning the growth in 
bowling revenue.
During FY18 we will develop our online 
presence primarily through focusing on 
visibility and conversion of our booking 
sites and by improving our CRM programme 
to engage more frequently and more 
personally with customers. The newly 
created and recently recruited role of 
Digital Marketing Director will be instrumental 
in developing and focusing our plans in 
this area. Our CRM database is an important 
tool in this process and our contactable 
database has grown by 25% since FY16. 
Our online revenue represented 22% of 
our sales in FY17 and we see an opportunity 
to leverage this to further grow sales. 
We will also continue to look for opportunities 
to leverage our integrated technology 
platforms, drive ancillary revenue spend and 
improve the overall customer experience.
The Group completed the planned 
disposal and closure of its underperforming 
site in Chelmsford during FY17, with the 
site closing on 19 July 2017. This site had 
a detrimental impact on trading, with sales 
declines of 37% year on year, contributing 
a reduction of (0.4%) to the Group’s overall 
like-for-like sales. There are currently no 
further plans to exit any other sites in 
the estate.
Inward investment
During FY17 we completed the refurbishment 
of six further sites within the estate, three 
from the existing estate (Derby, Leamington 
Spa and Swansea) and three from acquisition 
sites (Blackburn, Ipswich and Eastbourne). 
These refurbishments continue to improve 
the overall quality of both our estate 
and the customer experience and are on 
track to perform in line with our expectations 
for return on investment. A planned 
refurbishment and annex extension 
at Fountain Park in 2017 was delayed 
by planning and legal work and is 
now expected to happen during the 
second half of FY18.
We also completed the rebranding 
of a further eight sites to the new Tenpin 
branding and logo during FY17. A total 
of 37 sites in the estate have now been 
completed, with plans in place for the 
remaining sites dependent upon planning 
being granted by the relevant local authority. 
This underpins the strength of our single 
brand, with the new brand logo designed 
to reflect that we put the customer at the 
heart of everything we do.
In addition, during the second half of 
FY17 a further five sites were converted to 
Pins & Strings, extending the trial following 
the successful introduction into Feltham 
at the end of FY16. Pins & Strings is an 
innovative, new generation bowling machine 
that requires less maintenance, is simpler to 
operate and provides improved reliability for 
customers, demonstrated by improvements 
in the key games played per stop metric. 
The initial signs from the trial have been 
encouraging; in particular, we have seen 
an impact from improved reliability of the 
lanes with games played per stop averaging 
over 1,000 in the trial sites compared to 259 
for the estate overall. This improvement in 
reliability has enabled us to improve lane 
utilisation at peak times, leading to improved 
revenue and higher levels of Net Promoter 
Scores (NPS), with the trial sites reporting 
NPS in excess of 70%. We believe this 
technology has the potential to transform 
the operation of the business.
Installation costs during the trial have 
been broadly in line with our expectations, 
at c.£200k per site; we therefore anticipate 
a further capital cost of c.£7.2m in addition 
to the c.£1.0m spent to date, to fully roll 
this out to the current estate of 42 sites. 
We are encouraged by the performance 
of this new technology and the benefits 
are also broadly in line with our original 
expectations, through the combination 
of both cost reductions and improved 
revenue from better reliability.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
12 | Strategic report Inward investment continued
We therefore expect the returns on 
investment to be broadly in line with our 
expectations. The Group has a strong 
relationship with its main bowling equipment 
supplier, Qubica AMF, and we are currently 
working with them to develop an accelerated 
manufacturing and roll-out plan to introduce 
Pins & Strings across the estate. At this point, 
we anticipate introducing Pins & Strings on 
a phased basis to around a further 10 sites 
during FY18.
We also plan to invest at two to three 
sites within the existing estate during FY18, 
including the delayed refurbishment and 
addition of an annex extension to include 
four additional lanes at Fountain Park, 
originally planned for FY17, together with 
selective refurbishments at two or three 
further sites. The Group will continue to 
identify selective opportunities to invest in the 
quality of its sites through both refurbishment 
and ongoing maintenance programmes.
Site acquisitions 
and Tenpinisation
Net new space contributed 5.3% of 
the total proforma sales growth of 8.9% 
(proforma compared to weeks 2-53 
of FY16) during the year.
The Group continued Tenpinisation at 
Worcester and Ipswich during the year, 
which were both acquired during the 
second half of FY16. Site Tenpinisation, 
including rebranding, was completed at 
Worcester in January 2017. Investment in 
refurbishment work at Ipswich, including 
rebranding, was completed during 
August 2017.
Good progress with the strategy to add 
between two and four sites per year was 
made during FY17 with the completion 
of three site acquisitions at good locations 
in Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. 
These three sites were acquired for a total 
cost of £2.9m, including fees. The Group 
believes that following Tenpinisation these 
sites will deliver a return on investment in 
line with our expectations of around 30%. 
A major refurbishment was completed at 
Blackburn during the first half and 
Eastbourne was refurbished in the second 
half. All three sites are performing in line 
with the Board’s expectations. We plan to 
refurbish our acquired sites at Worcester 
and Rochdale during FY18.
The Group remains confident that there is 
an attractive pipeline of acquisitions available 
and will continue to seek to identify the 
right opportunities to continue to grow the 
estate. The Group has made progress in FY18 
by adding the acquisition of a further two sites 
at Warrington and Chichester at a total 
cost of £2.7m including fees. These sites 
are well located but underinvested. The 
Group will significantly invest into branding 
and refurbishment at both sites during the 
first half of FY18 bringing these sites to the 
well-invested standard of a Tenpin site 
whilst introducing the rest of the systems, 
processes and controls that have now been 
proven as part of our Tenpinisation process. 
Further opportunities to acquire sites will 
continue to be explored during FY18.
People and culture
People and culture remains an important 
focus, recognised with accreditation from the 
“Great Place to Work” 2017 best workplaces, 
achieved during the first half of the financial 
year. This is a significant achievement for 
the Group and complements its Investors 
in People Gold status. The Group believes 
that engaged colleagues provide better 
customer experiences and it measures 
how customers value their experience 
using Net Promoter Scores. Net Promoter 
Score for FY17 was 66% (FY16: 49%). 
This strong improvement is driven by the 
Group’s continued focus on its colleagues, 
which in turn helps make each customer’s 
visit a memorable one. The Group has also 
successfully recruited two important roles 
to its senior management team during the 
second half of the year. The roles of Digital 
Marketing Director and Operations Director 
will both support our ambitious plans for 
growth during FY18.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc The Group operates in the tenpin bowling 
sub-sector of the broader UK leisure market, 
which is estimated to be worth approximately 
£80bn annually. Within that market, 
approximately £10bn relates to family 
entertainment (including cinema, theatre, 
live entertainment and visitor attractions 
(including amusement parks) and other 
activities). Tenpin bowling, which has been 
estimated to have grown by 20% in the last 
three years, represented approximately 
£285m at the end of 2016, which is therefore 
around 3% of the wider family entertainment 
market. Growth in the bowling market is 
thought to have outgrown many other 
leisure sectors over the past three years. 
This bowling market is expected to see 
estimated overall growth of 23% between 
2016 and 2021. Significant investment 
from leading operators, such as Tenpin, 
together with market consolidation has 
helped this revival. From 2013 to 2017 
revenue at Tenpin has grown at a 
compound annual growth rate of 11.7%.
A consumer survey carried out indicated that 
only 32% of UK adults participated in tenpin 
bowling over the 12 months to March 2017. 
The Directors believe that there is a 
significant opportunity to continue to grow 
participation and engagement levels by 
targeting infrequent bowlers through the 
Group’s enhanced Customer Relationship 
Management (“CRM”) programme and 
maintaining a broader entertainment offering 
to attract a wider demographic group to 
the sites.
Competitive landscape
There are approximately 320 tenpin bowling 
sites currently operating in the UK and 
the market remains relatively fragmented. 
The ownership of these sites is broken 
down between:
• “Major Multiples” (including the Group, 
Hollywood Bowl, MFA Bowl, Big Apple 
and Namco Funscape, which operate 
between five and 58 sites);
• “Smaller Multiples” (operating fewer than 
five sites); and 
• “Independents” (operating only one site). 
Market overview
A significant opportunity
“ The Group operates in the tenpin bowling 
sub-sector of the broader UK leisure market, 
which is estimated to be worth approximately 
£80bn annually.”
The Smaller Multiples and Independents in 
aggregate operate approximately 170 sites. 
Due to the structure of the market, the Group 
believes that there are further opportunities 
for it to acquire additional sites, either 
individually from Independents or small 
groups of sites that other Smaller Multiples 
or Major Multiples may be seeking to divest 
through portfolio rationalisation. The Group 
has identified a pipeline of approximately 
60 sites which may be suitable for 
acquisition, taking into account a range 
of criteria including the local demographic, 
competition, recent trading history, type 
of location (e.g. within a leisure/retail park) 
and accessibility.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
14 | Strategic report “ The Group has evolved the traditional tenpin 
bowling model by providing a broader family 
entertainment offering.”
Tenpin’s market position 
and customers
The Directors believe that the Group has 
evolved the traditional tenpin bowling model 
by providing a broader family entertainment 
offering. The typical revenue mix of UK tenpin 
bowling operators over the last decade 
has been 57% bowling and 43% other 
revenue (principally food and beverage 
and amusement machines), whereas 
the Group’s revenue mix for FY17 was 
bowling: 47%; amusement machines 
and entertainment activities: 26%; 
beverages: 18%; and food: 9%.
The Directors believe that the focus 
on broadening the entertainment offering 
is one of the reasons why the Group has 
outperformed the wider market and has 
increased its market share and that a broader 
family entertainment offering makes the 
Group more appealing to a wider customer
base and encourages customers to spend 
more time and money at the sites. Other key 
factors include site refurbishments, improved 
booking processes (including simpler online 
booking) and pricing strategies that deliver 
value for money and maximise footfall.
The Directors also believe that Tenpin’s 
approach to site selection for acquisitions 
and its subsequent Tenpinisation approach 
have contributed to a strong competitive 
position. The majority of the Group’s sites 
are located on retail/leisure parks along 
with cinemas and casual dining restaurants. 
These sites are also, in most cases, very 
accessible and the Directors believe 
that co-location of the sites with other 
complementary leisure activities can help 
drive incremental footfall. Tenpin bowling 
can also represent a lower cost, accessible 
family entertainment activity compared to 
a number of other activities, such as the 
cinema or a meal at a casual dining venue.
Outlook
Overall growth in the tenpin bowling market 
looks set to continue in the period to at 
least 2021 supported by the expectation of 
further market consolidation and investment 
from the leading players. Whilst the bowling 
market is subject to changes in trends in 
consumer leisure spend, which in turn 
may be impacted by slower wage growth 
and higher cost inflation, it is anticipated 
that the potential for growth in the sector 
is underpinned by the ongoing investment 
in refurbishments and technology and 
therefore associated improvement in 
consumer perception, encouraging 
increased visitor frequency and higher 
levels of spend per head.

16 | Strategic report Nationwide locations 
We currently have 42 bowling centres located across England, 
Scotland and Wales. Our centres operate with c.24 lanes and on 
average have a footprint of around 30,000 square feet. Our centres 
are principally situated at prime locations on retail or leisure parks 
and are typically co-located with family leisure brands such as 
cinemas and casual dining restaurants. We invest in our sites to 
ensure they are well maintained and remain modern and relevant 
to our customers. We continually look for opportunities to grow 
the size of our estate in attractive locations, principally through 
acquisition of centres from other operators. 
Family entertainment offering 
We offer our customers a broad range of family-focused 
entertainment, centred around a growing trend of competitive 
socialising. Our product offering comprises bowling, family 
amusements, pool, table-tennis, soft play and Sector 7 laser 
games. These products are also complemented by a tailored 
food and beverage offer. Our products are designed to offer 
our customers multiple reasons to visit and to increase both 
their dwell time and average spend per visit when they do. 
We continually evaluate new opportunities to improve and 
expand our family-oriented product range.
Technology & innovation 
Tenpin operates from a fully integrated technology platform. 
Our scoring system and our booking system are interconnected, 
allowing us to offer real-time lane availability through all of our 
booking channels: online, via our contact centre or in each of our 
bowling centres. This improves both our lane utilisation and the 
customer experience. We operate lane-side food and beverage 
ordering through our “iServe” technology, which allows our customers 
to experience our range of food and beverage products without 
interrupting their bowling game. We are always looking for innovations 
to transform our business, such as the Pins & Strings technology, 
which we introduced into a number of sites during 2017, improving 
both the efficiency of our operating model and the reliability 
of our bowling equipment, which, in turn, enhances the 
customer experience.
Yield management 
We operate a differentiated pricing model, focused on maximising 
footfall, yield and dwell times whilst ensuring we offer our customers 
excellent value for money. We look to utilise our capacity efficiently 
at both peak and off-peak times through our well-established 
tariff, deals and promotions model. Our promotions model offers 
customers real value for money at off-peak times across four out 
of seven days per week, with offers such as “Tenpin Tuesday” offering 
50% off bowling and selected food and beverages. Our full-price 
tariff, coupled with our real-time lane management system, allows 
us to maximise revenue at peak occupancy periods.
Engaged colleagues 
Our ability to deliver our business model is underpinned by our 
c.1,100 dedicated colleagues who serve our customers every day 
and we are committed to their ongoing training and development. 
We are focused on developing a great employee culture, which 
has been independently recognised by attaining Investors in People 
Gold standard (since 2014) and accreditation as a “Great Place 
to Work”. In addition, our business is led by an established and 
experienced management team, both at the bowling centres 
and at the support centre.
Single, modern brand 
All of our family entertainment centres operate under the Tenpin 
brand. The Tenpin logo is a contemporary and modern design, 
well recognised by our customers. Our logo features iconography 
synonymous with bowling: balls and pins, and the heart at the 
centre represents our mission to put the customer at the heart 
of everything we do.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Strategy
Long-term value for stakeholders 
through investment-led growth
Ten Entertainment Group is a leading UK operator of bowling and family 
entertainment centres. 
We operate with a scale advantage against the majority of the 
bowling sector, derived from a well-invested infrastructure. 
Our strategy has been developed with the intention of creating 
long-term value for our stakeholders through investment-led 
growth. The Group is supported by a strong balance sheet and 
generates funds through its activities, which allows us to both 
continue to invest in growth and offer an attractive dividend yield 
to our shareholders.
Ten Entertainment Group’s vision is to deliver a fun and 
exciting customer experience for every customer. The Tenpin 
brand offers excellent customer service and value for money 
family entertainment. We continually invest in training and 
technology-led innovation to enhance the efficiency, quality 
and value of our offering while increasing the frequency of 
customer visits in a happy, vibrant and safe environment.
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
18 | Strategic report Organic growth
We will continue to increase like-for-like sales through: 
• increased capacity management using the unique Lane 
Arrangement System (“LAS”) which increases lane slots 
and maximises revenue per available lane;
• maximising pricing and retail strategy through tariffs, deals 
and promotions and simplified operations to increase average 
spend per head and increase revenue during non-core sessions;
• offer products and services that encourage repeat visits, increased 
dwell times and higher spend per head from our customers;
• attracting new customers through the development of our CRM 
capabilities; and 
• maximising our cost efficiency through increasing scale 
and improved operational efficiency.
Inward capital investment in 
existing estate 
We will continue to look for opportunities to invest in our estate, 
targeting three to four site refurbishments annually to maintain 
a modern and relevant offer for our customers. Our bowling 
centres typically operate on a six to seven year refurbishment 
cycle. Returns on investment are expected to track the historical 
average of 49% for the current refurbishment cycle.
Growth through the acquisition 
of under-managed sites 
There is significant opportunity to continue to grow the scale 
of the business in the medium term through the acquisition of 
bowling centres. We plan to acquire two to four existing bowling 
sites each year from other operators and improve their operations 
by converting them into Tenpin centres as per the current 
Tenpinisation rebranding strategy.
Culture, people and systems 
We love to make friends and families happy; we entertain and 
enthral profitably. We believe that engaged colleagues lead to 
higher levels of customer satisfaction, which we measure through 
our Net Promoter Score. We achieve this through our people, by: 
• focusing on their continued training and development; 
• providing an effective and safe environment to work in; and
• rewarding them for their hard work and continued loyalty.
Returns for our shareholders 
We believe our business model and our strategy will drive strong 
operating margins and high returns on capital with strong cash 
generation from mature sites. Embedded growth within our business 
model and strategy is supported by a well-developed pipeline of 
acquisition sites. This all supports our dividend policy to distribute 
approximately 60% of adjusted profit after tax to ultimately provide 
investors with good levels of returns on their investment.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
Like-for-like sales %
This is a very important measure of growth in the business and this 
period the Group’s main operating company, T enpin Limited, reported 
a 3.6% (2016: 2.8%) full-year increase in like-for-like sales. Proforma 
full-year sales increased by 8.9% from £65.2m for the 52-week period 
ended 1 January 2017 to £71.0m for the 52-week period ended 
31 December 2017 which was made up of 3.6% like-for-like growth 
and 5.3% net new space growth from the three sites acquired 
during the year.

Proforma 52-week period ended 1 January 2017
Gross profit %
The conversion of sales to gross margin is reviewed across our 
sites by looking at the conversion of bowling, bar, food, amusements 
and machine sales into gross margin. The total trading gross profit 
achieved for the period was 88.6% (2016: 88.0%). Income from 
machines continued to be a key strategic focus during the period 
for Tenpin Limited, as income from machines contributed 20.1% 
(2016: 20.0%) of total sales for Tenpin Limited. Bowling remains the 
largest contributor to sales, contributing 47.5% (2016: 46.7%) of sales.
Net debt £m
The Group’s net debt is (£4.7m) (2016: (£7.8m)), being bank 
borrowings of (£6.0m) (2016: (£12.9m)), plus finance leases of 
(£4.3m) (2016: (£5.1m)) less cash and cash equivalents of £5.6m 
(2016: £10.2m). The decrease in borrowings arose as part of the IPO 
when existing bank facilities were repaid and a new agreement 
entered into with the Royal Bank of Scotland. Though net debt has 
decreased by £3.1m the payment of £3.1m in IPO costs as disclosed 
in note 6 to the financial statements impacted on this metric.
Adjusted basic earnings per share
As calculated per note 9 in the financial statements, the Group reports 
an adjusted earnings per share which accounts for the underlying 
earnings of the business and excludes exceptional one-off costs 
such as the IPO costs incurred during the year. The adjusted earnings 
per share for the year is 16.2p (2016: 14.8p).
Financial KPIs
The Group’s solid performance and results during the period can 
be seen across many metrics and KPIs that are reviewed by the 
Group to understand our operational and financial performance.
Adjusted EBITDA £m
The Group’s underlying operational performance is 
measured using this metric, calculated as operating profit 
before depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and 
other income. Adjusted EBITDA for the period of £19.0m 
(2016: £17.6m) was up by £1.4m due to £0.7m of contribution 
from the three sites acquired during the year and £0.7m from 
increased sales, strong gross profit and good operating 
cost control in the core estate.

(2016: 186) for the period which has been driven an increased 
focus on this key metric and by the introduction of a more reliable

Non-financial KPIs
The Group also reviews the following key 
non-financial KPIs:
Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) %
The NPS for the period was up to 66% (2016: 49%) and is a measure 
of our customer service and the loyalty and engagement of the 
Group’s customers. It has increased from prior year due to the 
continued focus on the customers’ journey in our sites and thus 
increasing satisfaction. Factors such as improving games played 
per stop, and hence the customer experience, are fundamental 
to this. Continued training of our staff, rewarding our colleagues 
for great service and “memorable mentions” from customers, 
continually reviewing our food and drinks offer +and evolving 
our gaming machines estate with changing trends and tastes 
continue to see a positive impact on NPS.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Principal risks and uncertainties
The business faces a number of risks 
on an ongoing basis.
The Board has undertaken a robust assessment of what it believes 
are the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, its performance, delivery of its strategy 
or its ongoing viability. The following table summarises these principal 
risks, their possible impact and how they are managed or mitigated.
The risks in this table have been assessed on a multiplier effect basis, 
according to our current view of the likelihood of occurrence, the 
potential severity (being the financial impact) and the controls available 
to mitigate the risk. The environment in which we operate is constantly 
evolving; new risks may arise and the potential likelihood and impact 
of known risks may change. These risks therefore represent a 
snapshot of what the Board believes are the principal risks and are 
not an exhaustive list of all risks the Group faces. The full annual 
review process captures changes in these risks and also changes 
in the direction of travel of any given risk.
The Board has considered the risk posed by Brexit and has noted 
that there is the possibility of risk associated with potential labour 
cost increases and consumer uncertainty. The Board considers 
our exposure to labour cost pressures to be mitigated by our broad 
national presence, and limited Central London exposure. The Board 
also believes that, as a low-frequency and low-ticket activity, bowling 
is less exposed to a change in consumer sentiment than many other 
discretionary spend items. Therefore, at the moment, the Board 
does not consider Brexit to be a principal risk to the business 
model, but will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation. 
The Board regularly monitors changes to the regulatory environment 
in which the Group operates. This includes monitoring and evaluating 
potential impacts from changes to regulation of competition, 
gambling, licensing, health and safety, and General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”). The Group has robust processes, controls 
and Board oversight of the management of regulatory risk in place, 
including continuous training of colleagues, site compliance 
audits and use of independent, expert advisers where appropriate. 
The Board does not currently consider any individual area of 
regulation change to constitute a material risk to the business, 
but through its risk management process regularly reviews and 
evaluates the impact any changes in legislation may have.

Regular meetings are held between 
the Chief Commercial Officer and 
the Group’s key suppliers to discuss 
both operational issues and future

with market-leading suppliers in these 
fields. The Group maintains Service 
Level Agreements (“SLAs”) with its

whilst failure may lead to short-term

FY16 53rd week impact
FY16 reported figures, as disclosed in the prospectus issued on 12 April 2017, included 
a 53rd week in order to allow the year-end date for 2016 to remain close to the end 
of December. In order to provide a more useful comparative to understand the underlying 
trading performance, proforma (“PF”) sales, EBITDA and profit numbers for the 52-week period 
to 1 January 2017 (representing weeks 2-53 of FY16) have been provided. These proforma 
numbers exclude FY16 week 1 (w/e 3 January 2016), which is most comparable to FY16 
week 53 (w/e 1 January 2017). These weeks include the key Christmas holiday trading 
period in each year and are significant trading weeks for the Group. Balance sheet and 
cash flow performance are reported unadjusted versus the year-end date.

Financial review
Good track record 
of profitable growth
1  These are non-IFRS measures used by 
the Group in understanding its underlying 
earnings. Group adjusted EBITDA consists of 
earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, 
amortisation costs, exceptional items, profit 
or loss on disposal of assets, adjustments to 
onerous lease and impairment provisions 
and derecognition of finance leases. Group 
adjusted profit before tax is defined as profit 
before exceptional items, profit or loss on 
disposal of assets, amortisation of acquisition 
intangibles, shareholder loan note interest, 
adjustments to onerous lease and impairment 
provisions and derecognition of finance leases. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share represents 
earnings per share based on adjusted profit 
after tax. Like-for-like sales are a measure of 
growth of sales adjusted for new or divested 
sites over a comparable trading period.
2  Cost of sales and operating expenses 
are presented on the basis as analysed by 
management. Cost of sales in the financial 
summary are determined by management 
as consisting of the direct bar, food, vending, 
amusements and gaming machine related 
costs. Statutory costs of sales reflected in the 
Statement of comprehensive income also 
include the staff and call centre costs incurred 
by the sites. Operating expenses are split into 
more detail in the financial summary to obtain 
statutory operating profit, with overheads, 
support office, amortisation, depreciation 
and exceptional costs reflected separately.

1 Proforma growth measured against the 52 weeks to 1 January 2017, weeks 2-53 of FY16.
Total sales were up 5.5% at £71.0m (FY16: £67.3m) on a reported basis. Proforma sales for the comparable period were up 8.9% 
(FY16 PF: £65.2m). Like-for-like sales, were up 3.6%. Net new space contributed 5.3% in the period on a proforma basis. The drivers 
of this overall sales performance have been analysed as part of the preceding operating review.
Gross margin
The reported gross margin rate was up 10 basis points year on year at 88.6% (FY16 PF: 88.5%). The gross margin rate, combined with the 
growth in reported sales, resulted in gross margin being up 9.0% to £62.9m (FY16 PF: £57.7m). On a 53-week FY16 reported basis gross 
margin increased by 5.6% (FY16: £59.6m).

Other operating costs 5,157 4,871 4,962
Total operating costs 37,218 35,709 36,477
Total operating costs increased by 4.2% to £37.2m (FY16 PF: £35.7m), principally driven by costs associated with the net additional sites 
opened during the period, together with the full-year effect of the sites acquired in the previous financial year. Underlying operating costs 
excluding net new space were down 0.8%, driven principally by a reduction in underlying rent costs as a result of the rent re-gears achieved 
at four sites, together with good labour cost control, supported by the implementation of the Fourth Hospitality payroll management 
system in December 2016. These cost efficiencies more than offset underlying cost inflation. On a 53-week FY16 reported basis costs 
increased by 2.0%.
Central administration costs
Centrally allocated overheads were up 15% at £2.6m (FY16 PF: £2.3m), mostly driven by increased levels of expense in marketing, IT and 
training to support the business growth plans. Support office costs were up 31% at £4.1m (FY16 PF: £3.1m) principally driven by cost inflation, 
recruitment costs for the previously discussed senior management roles and the impact of additional PLC related expenses. On a 53-week 
FY16 reported basis central overheads increased by 12% and support office costs by 29%.
Strategic report | 27
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is up 14.4% at £19.0m (FY16 PF: £16.6m). The growth in EBITDA on a proforma basis is driven by a combination of the 
growth from like-for-like sales and good operational cost control within the core estate, together with the benefit of the additional sites 
within the estate. On a 53-week FY16 reported basis EBITDA grew by 8.0% (FY16: £17.6m).
Adjusted EBITDA is considered by management to be a key performance metric for the business as this is calculated excluding non-recurring 
costs to provide a measure that is more reflective of the underlying performance of the Group. 
Depreciation
Depreciation increased by 21% to £5.2m (FY16 PF: £4.3m) in the year, principally as a result of the growth in the overall size of the estate, 
combined with the investment in refurbishments at five of the six FY15 acquisition sites late in FY16 together with investment in refurbishment 
at a further six sites during FY17. On a 53-week FY16 reported basis depreciation increased by 19%.

Net interest (excluding shareholder loan 
note interest) decreased by 40% to £0.8m 
(FY16 PF: £1.3m) principally driven by the 
refinancing of bank debt at both a lower 
level and on more favourable terms, together 
with a reduction in finance lease charges 
as a result of the derecognition of two 
finance leases at the end of FY16. On a 
53-week FY16 reported basis net interest 
decreased by 41%.
Group adjusted profit before tax
Group adjusted profit before tax was 
£13.0m (FY16 PF: £11.0m) driven by the 
movements outlined above. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items recorded in the period 
were £5.0m (FY16: £1.9m). This includes a 
charge of £3.1m for costs relating directly to 
the IPO. Other exceptional items of £1.9m 
were driven by the write-off of capitalised 
loan arrangement fees in relation to existing 
term loans repaid on completion of the 
IPO (£0.7m), legal costs in association with 
the bank refinancing (£0.1m), legal costs 
associated with site acquisitions (£0.3m), 
other property-related fees and costs 
principally relating to lease re-gears and 
renewals (£0.5m) and other professional 
fees and one-off costs (£0.2m).
Disposal of assets
The loss on disposal of assets of £0.4m 
(FY16: gain of £0.1m) is largely driven 
by the removal of bowling equipment 
leading to a loss on disposal of £0.3m 
in relation to the replacement of the 
traditional pinsetters with Pins & Strings 
machines in the five trial sites.
Amortisation of 
acquisition intangibles
The amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
was a charge of £0.6m (FY16: £1.3m).
Shareholder loan note interest
Shareholder loan note interest 
charges decreased by 70% to £1.2m 
(FY16 PF: £3.8m), representing the interest 
payable against the balance of loan notes 
(FY16: £42.4m) up until 10 April 2017. 
The shareholder loan notes were converted 
to equity as part of the IPO process; there 
will therefore be no further interest charge 
incurred in future years in relation to these 
loan notes. On a 53-week FY16 reported 
basis interest charges decreased by 71%.
Adjustments in respect 
of onerous lease and 
impairment provisions
The adjustment in respect of onerous 
lease and impairment provisions is a 
credit of £1.4m (FY16: charge of £0.3m). 
The credit principally reflects improved 
performance together with rent reductions 
achieved and the exit of an underperforming 
site in Chelmsford.
Gain on derecognition 
of finance leases
The gain on derecognition of finance 
leases was £nil (FY16: credit of £0.9m).
Taxation
Taxation attributable to Group adjusted 
profit before tax was £2.5m (FY16 PF: £2.1m), 
representing an effective tax rate of 18.9% 
(FY16 PF: 18.8%). Taxation attributable to 
items outside of Group adjusted profit 
was a credit of £0.3m (FY16 PF: £0.4m). 
The total tax charge for the year was 
£2.1m (FY16 PF: £1.6m).

profit after tax increased by 43%.
Number of shares and earnings 
per share
The number of shares for the purpose of 
calculating basic earnings per share was 65m. 
This represents the average number of issued 
ordinary shares. The earnings per share was 
8.0p. Adjusted basic earnings per share grew 
by 18% to 16.2p (FY16 PF: 13.7p). FY16 
earnings per share has been restated to 
reflect the new Group capital structure. 
Dividends
The Board decided with its interim results 
in September to announce a dividend for 
FY17 based on the full-year earnings for the 
Group and not pro rata since Admission 
in April as previously stated, reflecting 
its confidence in the Group’s ability to 
deliver its long-term plans. It is therefore 
recommending a final dividend of 7.0p. 
This takes the full-year dividend to 10.0p 
per share. The final dividend, subject to 
approval by shareholders at the AGM, will 
be paid on 5 July 2018. The ex-dividend 
date is 24 May 2018 and the record date 
is 25 May 2018.

the IPO transaction. Other movements include an increase of £0.9m in goodwill & other intangible assets to £26.7m, driven by the addition 
of goodwill arising on the acquisition of new sites. Analysis of the movement in cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings is provided 
within the cash flow statement on page 30. In addition, there was a decrease in trade and other payables and provisions principally 
driven by the reduction in onerous lease and impairment provisions together with a lower level of capital accruals and other smaller 
provision movements.

Cash flows from operating activities were £17.6m (FY16: £16.7m). The increase in Group adjusted EBITDA was partially offset by a small 
movement in working capital in the year.
Acquisition investment was an outflow of £2.6m (FY16: £2.3m) utilised to purchase three new sites: Blackburn, Eastbourne and Rochdale. 
Net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and software was an outflow of £3.6m in the period (FY16: £3.0m), driven by 
Tenpinisation and refurbishment capital costs of £1.3m, investment of £1.0m in Pins & Strings machines at the five additional sites discussed 
earlier and an ongoing level of maintenance capital across the estate. 
The net movement in borrowings was an outflow of £6.9m (FY16: £3.6m), representing the repayment of existing term loan facilities 
of £12.9m, partially offset by the drawdown of the replacement revolving credit facility to the amount of £6.0m.
Finance costs paid were £0.6m (FY16: £1.0m) with the reduction driven by the movement in the cash element of the finance costs previously 
discussed. Tax paid was £1.9m (FY16: £nil), with no tax payment being due in FY16 due to the utilisation of remaining historical trading losses 
within Tenpin Limited. Exceptional items result in a cash outflow of £4.3m (FY16: £1.9m), as analysed on page 28, but were principally in 
relation to the costs associated with the Group’s IPO during the first half of the financial year.
The net movement in cash and cash equivalents was an outflow of £4.6m (FY16: inflow of £3.4m).

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
30 | Strategic report Financing arrangements
The Group finances its operations 
through a combination of cash, property 
leases, finance leases and access to 
committed bank facilities where necessary. 
On completion of its IPO, the Group 
agreed a new, three-year, £15m committed 
secured borrowing facility which, as at 
31 December 2017, the Group had drawn 
down £6.0m.
The Group has additional liabilities 
through its obligations to pay rents 
under a combination of both operating 
and finance leases (finance leases: 
FY17: one site; FY16: two sites). The rental 
charge for the period amounted to £11.2m 
(FY16 PF: £11.1m), with the increase principally 
a result of the additional sites compared to 
the same period last year. In addition, the 
Group has further liabilities through its 
finance lease arrangement with Namco 
for its gaming machines. The finance lease 
capital repayments were an outflow 
of £2.3m during FY17 (FY16: £1.5m).
Total property lease commitments 
were £142.7m at 31 December 2017 
(FY16: £127.4m) with the increase driven 
by the net two additional sites, together 
with the increase in average lease length 
from 11.3 years to 13.0 years, principally 
driven by the lease re-gears and renewals 
previously discussed. The total finance 
lease commitments as at 31 December 
2017 amounted to £4.2m (FY16: £5.1m).
Share price 
The Group’s opening share price on entry 
to the market on 12 April 2017 was 165p. 
The price has ranged from a low of 148p 
to a high of 271p. On 29 December 2017, 
the closing price was 248p, giving a market 
capitalisation of £161m.
Accounting standards and use 
of non-GAAP measures
The Group has prepared its consolidated 
financial statements based on International 
Financial Reporting Standards for the 
52 weeks ended 31 December 2017. 
The basis for preparation is outlined 
in the second paragraph to the financial 
statements on page 73.
The Group uses certain measures 
that it believes provide additional useful 
information on its underlying performance. 
These measures are applied consistently 
but as they are not defined under GAAP 
they may not be directly comparable 
with other companies adjusted measures. 
The non-GAAP measures are outlined 
in note 2 to the financial statements 
on page 81.

Strategic report | 31
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc In accordance with provision C.2.2 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Code”), the Directors have assessed 
the Group’s prospects and viability over a 
three-year period to 28 December 2020. 
This three-year assessment period was 
selected as it corresponds with the Board’s 
strategic planning horizon as well as the 
time period over which senior management 
is remunerated via its share performance 
scheme. Future assessments of the Group’s 
prospects are subject to uncertainty that 
increases with time and cannot be 
guaranteed or predicted with certainty.
In making this assessment, the Directors 
took account of:
• the Group’s current financial performance 
including EBITDA, operating profit and 
adjusted profit after tax;
• its strong financial position and cash flows 
including net debt and available cash; 
• the availability of its banking facilities and 
complying with the agreed covenants;
• its business model and strategy in 
particular new site acquisitions and 
inward capex; and
• risks and uncertainties.
These were extended as part of the 
Group’s three-year plan forecasts and 
appropriate stress-testing was undertaken 
to consider the potential impact of a 
combination of principal risks and 
uncertainties materialising together 
such as declines in year-on-year sales,
inflationary increases across all variable 
cost lines as well as above expected 
increases in fixed costs such as property 
rents. This was then looked at in isolation 
as well as in combination with certain 
strategies not being implemented around 
sales growth initiatives and site acquisitions 
in the pipeline not being made. Based on 
this assessment, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
will continue in operation and meet all 
its liabilities as they fall due during the 
three-year period up to 28 December 2020.
Going concern
On 12 April 2017, the Group’s shares 
were admitted to trading on the Main 
Market of the London Stock Exchange 
and it entered into a new £15m, three-year 
revolving credit facility (see note 3 to the 
financial statements for details of the Group 
reorganisation). There were no primary 
funds raised for the Group at the IPO 
and all proceeds were distributed to 
existing shareholders.
The Directors believe that the IPO has 
benefitted the Group by providing:
• a stronger capital structure, enabling 
it to continue its acquisition growth 
strategy while making it more attractive 
as a tenant to landlords;
• access to a wider range of capital raising 
options beyond the banking facilities 
already in place, which could be used 
for acquisition opportunities;
•   removal of the private equity PIK loan 
notes, which reduced overall earnings 
as they attracted higher rates of interest 
than normal bank facilities; and
• repayment of prior bank facilities and 
renegotiation of new banking facilities 
with a lower rate of interest, which 
reduces interest payments, increases 
earnings and allows further investment 
of cash. 
The Group is in a strong financial 
position to continue its operations for 
the next 12 months. For these reasons, 
the Directors have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The Directors have made this 
assessment after consideration of budgeted 
cash flows and related assumptions and 
in accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting.

the Board and signed on its behalf by:

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc The Group’s corporate 
social responsibility policy 
covers four main areas: 
Charity and work within 
the community
The sites each have their own nominated 
charity and give charitably in the form 
of events and fundraising. The Group also 
has a nominated charity, which as at the 
date of these financial statements is 
Rays of Sunshine. The Group encourages 
employees to give back to the community 
by allowing employees to be able to 
work fully paid for one day a year for 
a charitable organisation.
This encouragement has also led 
to “VIP days” for terminally ill children 
and participation in national fundraising 
campaigns such as Children in Need 
and Macmillan events.
Social
Bowling is a fun, family-oriented activity 
that encourages people to be active and 
promotes enjoyable social time together. 
Our sites provide drink and food as part of 
the experience and we understand the focus 
on diet and wellbeing. We are passionate 
about our food and strive to always provide 
the best quality food to our customers 
and we are focused on making progressive 
changes going forward to meet changing 
customer expectations. We have introduced 
a low fat, low salt burger as well as a new 
cooking oil which has reduced oil usage 
by 25% annually.
We continue to work with our suppliers to 
reduce the amount of sugar and salt in the 
products we use and ensure all our products 
are from sustainable sources and that we 
have a range of healthier options available.
We communicate regularly with regulatory 
bodies, local councils and our suppliers to 
ensure that we have an appropriate mix of 
gaming machines in terms of content and 
quality and age appropriateness.
Environmental
The Group is committed to operating its 
business in such a way as to minimise the 
impact on the environment as a result of 
its activities and will always aim to meet and, 
where practicable, improve upon relevant 
environmental legislative requirements and 
codes of practice. In addition, the Group 
continues to demonstrate environmental 
care in which it operates by carrying out 
professional surveys in order to identify 
where reasonable steps can be taken to 
reduce energy usage, promoting the 
purchase and use of materials within the 
business in a manner that minimises 
potential adverse environmental effects and

Employee engagement 
and wellbeing
The Group has policies in place which 
demonstrate its commitment to a high 
level of integrity and standards and the 
welfare of its employees. This includes 
a “Health and Wellbeing Strategy” for 
the Group’s employees and providing 
a comprehensive but flexible benefits 
and reward scheme for all employees.
Achievements for 2017 include:
• a celebration of success with our 
colleagues through the “Winning Way” 
lunches, a Tenpin five-a-side football 
tournament, a company awards event 
and Christmas parties; 
• the Group’s focus on our people 
was recognised by the “Great Place to 
Work” awards as a top 35 best workplace; 
• implementation of a new development 
programme for both site apprenticeships 
and management teams;
• retention of Gold Investors in People 
standard, and runners up at Investors 
in People awards;
• launch of “The Voice”, an 
employee forum for feedback 
on all areas of the business;
• launch of “Learning Lanes” to 
complement our training and 
development strategy; and
• launch of additional products 
to complement our reward 
and recognition strategy.
The Group strives to provide a happy 
and safe environment for colleagues 
and is always seeking to understand what 
improvements can be made in colleagues’ 
experiences at work. The People team 
helps the Group keep focused on work-life 
balance initiatives and provides opportunities 
for colleagues to connect and network with 
each other. All colleagues are provided 
with an excellent benefits package which 
includes access to the Group’s reward 
scheme “Tenpin Treats”, the use of which 
is continuing to increase as employees 
understand the benefits of the scheme. 
The Group runs a regular engagement 
survey with colleagues to measure team 
member satisfaction and to give colleagues 
an opportunity to feed back what works 
well and what can be improved upon. 
Results of the survey are encouraging, with 
completion levels at 92% on the last survey 
conducted in September 2017 and 90% of 
respondents saying they would recommend 
Tenpin as a great place to work.
The Group’s policy on diversity is that no 
individual should be discriminated against 
on the grounds of race, colour, ethnicity, 
religious belief, political affiliation, gender, 
age or disability, and this extends to Board 
appointments. The Board recognises the 
benefits of diversity, including gender 
diversity, on the Board, although it believes 
that all appointments should be made 
on merit, whilst ensuring that there is an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience 
within the Board. The Board currently 
consists of 12.5% (one) female and 87.5% 
(seven) male Board members while the total 
Group headcount consists of 622 female 
and 512 male employees. The Group is 
passionate about fairness, equality and 
inclusion and is committed to reducing 
the gender pay gap.
The Modern Slavery Act, which came into 
force in October 2015, requires the Group 
to publish an annual slavery and human 
trafficking statement. The latest statement 
can be found on the Ten Entertainment 
Group plc website. Neither the Group nor 
any of its subsidiaries permit, condone 
or otherwise accept any form of human 
trafficking or slavery in its business and the 
Group is committed to doing what it can 
to combat these practices.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Governance supports success 
of Company strategy
Dear Shareholders 
I am pleased to introduce our first 
Corporate Governance report on behalf 
of the Board. The Board is committed to 
ensuring that the Group operates with high 
standards of corporate governance and 
intends to comply with the requirements 
of the Code as it applies to smaller 
companies (i.e. those below the FTSE 350). 
We believe that it is important that the 
governance structure supports the success 
of the Company’s strategy after listing in 
April 2017 and ensures the creation and 
preservation of shareholder value, as well 
as benefiting other stakeholders.
As part of the IPO, our key focus was to 
ensure that the Board had constituted 
appropriate Committees and adopted 
relevant terms of reference, policies and 
procedures to support the development 
of a robust governance structure. After the 
IPO we have continued to work on ensuring 
compliance with the Code and other 
obligations of a company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange’s Main Market. 
As you will see from our Corporate 
Governance report, due to the fact that 
the Company only listed in April 2017 it has 
not been practicable to fully comply with 
all provisions and our report highlights these 
areas and how we expect to address these 
in the coming year.
The Board plays a vital role in developing 
and maintaining the Group’s culture and 
values by setting the “tone from the top” 
and determining the behaviours expected 
by the Board and ensuring that ethical 
standards are maintained. In so doing, 
the Board aims to strike the right balance 
between entrepreneurial leadership and 
the prudent and effective management 
of risk, both of which are essential to 
maintaining a sustainable business and 
creating value for shareholders.
We have appointed high-calibre  
Non-Executive Directors who all bring 
experience relevant to our sector, 
first-class backgrounds and the right 
skills to support our status as a listed 
company. David Wild, Julie Sneddon 
and Rob McWilliam all joined the Board 
in the lead up to the IPO and have already 
started to make significant contributions 
to the Board and its various Committees. 
Our corporate governance framework 
continues to evolve and improve and the 
following report sets out how the Board 
has complied with the principles of good 
governance during the year.

UK Corporate Governance 
Code – compliance
The Company adopted the Code 
on 12 April 2017 on Admission of 
its shares to the UKLA’s Official List 
and listing on the Main Market of the 
London Stock Exchange. Prior to 
that date it was not a premium listed 
company and was therefore not 
required to comply with the 
principles and provisions of the Code. 
Since 12 April 2017, and including 
the period between Admission 
and the end of the financial year, 
Nick Basing
Chairman
the Company has applied all 
of the main principles of the Code 
as they apply to it as a “smaller 
company” (defined in the Code 
as being a company below the 
FTSE 350) and has complied with 
all relevant provisions of the Code 
except as indicated below:
Provision explanation
A.3.1 – The Chairman was not 
independent on appointment; 
however, he provides a wealth 
of experience in the industry to the 
Group and, following on from the 
IPO, he provides strong continuity 
to the transition from a private 
company to a listed company. 
The Board also includes three 
independent Directors to provide 
balance to the governance of 
the Group.
B.6.1 – The Board has not carried 
out a performance evaluation as this 
is the first year of incorporation but 
one will be carried out in FY18.
A.4.2 and B.6.3 – The Non-Executive 
Directors have not formally evaluated 
the Chairman’s performance as this 
is the first year of incorporation but 
an evaluation will be carried out 
in FY18.
C.3.1 and D.2.1 – The Audit and 
Remuneration Committees were 
not comprised only of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The 
Company Chairman is a member 
of both the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees but is not an independent 
Non-Executive Director. This is 
currently expected to continue 
indefinitely, but will form part of the 
Board effectiveness evaluation in 
FY18. All three of the independent 
Directors are members of each 
Committee and the Committees are 
chaired by an independent Director.

is designed such that the Board focuses 
on providing experienced leadership to the

The Board operates in accordance with 
the Company’s Articles of Association

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Board governance Board membership
The Board currently comprises the 
Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Commercial 
Officer, a Senior Independent Director and 
three Non-Executive Directors. The names 
and biographical details of the serving 
Directors and the offices held by them 
can be found on pages 36 to 37. We believe 
that the Board is of sufficient size that the 
requirements of the business and good 
governance can be met and normal 
succession challenges managed, but is 
not so large as to be unwieldy.
Chairman
The role of the Chairman is:
• providing leadership to and ensuring 
the effectiveness of the Board; 
• ensuring that agendas emphasise strategic, 
rather than routine, issues and that the 
Directors receive accurate and clear 
information well ahead of the time 
when a decision is required; 
• promoting a culture of openness 
and constructive debate, and facilitating 
an effective contribution by the  
Non-Executive Directors; 
• arranging informal meetings of the 
Directors, including meetings of the 
Non-Executive Directors;
• ensuring effective communication 
by the Group with its shareholders; 
• arranging for the Chairs of the 
Committees to be available to answer 
questions at the AGM and for all 
Directors to attend; and 
• taking the lead in providing a properly 
constructed, full, formal and tailored 
induction programme and ongoing 
development for new Directors.
Chief Executive Officer
The role of the Chief Executive Officer is:
• leading the development of the Group’s 
strategic direction and objectives; 
• identifying and executing acquisitions 
and disposals and leading geographic 
diversification initiatives; 
• reviewing the Group’s organisational 
structure and recommending changes 
as appropriate; 
• identifying and executing new 
business opportunities; 
• overseeing risk management 
and internal control; 
• managing the Group’s risk profile, 
including the health and safety 
performance of the Group; 
• implementing the decisions of the Board 
and its Committees; 
• building and maintaining an effective 
Group leadership team; and 
• ensuring the Chairman and the Board 
are alerted to forthcoming complex, 
contentious or sensitive issues affecting 
the Group.
Senior Independent Director (“SID”)
The role of the SID is: 
• meeting regularly with the independent 
Non-Executive Directors; 
• providing a sounding board for the 
Chairman and acting as an intermediary 
for other Directors; 
• being available to shareholders if they 
have concerns which contact through 
the normal channels of Chairman or 
Chief Executive Officer has failed to 
address or would be inappropriate; and 
• holding annual meetings with  
Non-Executive Directors without 
the Chairman present.
Non-Executive Directors
The role of a Non-Executive Director is:
• providing creative contribution to the 
Board by way of constructive criticism; 
• bringing independence, impartiality, 
experience, specialist knowledge and 
a different perspective to the Board; 
• providing guidance on matters 
of concern and strategy;
• overseeing risk management 
and internal control; 
• protecting shareholder 
and stakeholder interests; 
• constructively challenging the 
Executive Directors and monitoring 
Executive performance; 
• supporting the Executive team in 
shaping and delivering the strategic 
goals of the business; 
• optimising shareholder return and 
protection of shareholder assets; and
• ensuring the Board is able to work 
together effectively and make maximum 
use of its time.
Board independence
The Board has considered the independence 
of the current Directors as below:
Non-independent
Nick Basing (Chairman) 
Alan Hand (Chief Executive Officer) 
Mark Willis (Chief Financial Officer) 
Graham Blackwell (Chief Commercial Officer) 
Christopher Mills
Independent
David Wild (SID)  
Julie Sneddon 
Rob McWilliam
The Company complies with provision 
B.1.2 of the Code as it applies to smaller 
companies as it has two independent  
Non-Executive Directors on the Board.
The Board reviews the independence 
of its Non-Executive Directors annually. 
In assessing the independence of each 
Director, the Board considers whether 
each is independent in character and 
judgement and whether there are 
relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to affect, or could appear to affect, 
the Director’s judgement.
40 | Corporate governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Board governance and key Board roles The Company does not comply with 
provision A.3.1 of the Code which requires 
that the Chairman should, on appointment, 
meet the independence criteria set out in 
provision B.1.1 of the Code. This is because 
the Chairman holds shares in the Company. 
Nevertheless, the Board considers that the 
fact of the Chairman’s shareholding in the 
Company (including its relative size) does 
not influence his independence of character 
and judgement within the meaning of Code 
provision B.1.1 and it does not influence 
him or the Board in the proper discharge 
of their duties and the operation of the 
business of the Group.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee assists the Board 
in discharging its responsibilities for the 
integrity of the financial statements, 
reviewing the internal control environment 
and risk management systems, managing 
the relationship with the external auditors 
and monitoring the effectiveness and 
objectivity of the external and internal 
auditors. Rob McWilliam is the Chair of this 
Committee which also includes David Wild, 
Nick Basing, Christopher Mills and Julie 
Sneddon. The Audit Committee will normally 
meet not fewer than three times a year at 
the appropriate reporting and audit cycle.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee oversees 
the recruitment of the Directors and senior 
management and advises on matters 
relating to the Board’s membership and 
Committee appointments, including 
reviewing succession plans. The Nomination 
Committee also regularly reviews and 
monitors the overall skills and experience 
of the Board. Julie Sneddon is the Chair 
of this Committee which also includes 
David Wild, Nick Basing, Christopher Mills 
and Rob McWilliam. The Nomination 
Committee will meet at least twice annually.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee determines 
the terms and conditions of employment, 
remuneration and rewards of the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and the leadership 
teams. The Remuneration Committee aims 
to offer an appropriate balance of fixed and 
performance-related, immediate and deferred 
remuneration, but without overpaying 
or creating the risk of rewards for failure. 
David Wild is the Chair of this Committee 
which also includes Rob McWilliam, 
Julie Sneddon, Nick Basing and 
Christopher Mills. The Remuneration 
Committee will meet at least twice annually.
Board meetings and process 
Since Admission, the Board met on five 
occasions between April and the financial 
year-end in December 2017, with key 
matters discussed including reviewing 
and approving new acquisitions, reviewing 
and approving lease decisions, considering 
and approving significant capital projects, 
the Group’s strategic plan, the Group’s 
annual budget, the Group’s interim results, 
the Group risk register, the functioning of the 
internal control environment and reviewing 
the terms of reference of its Committees. 
Where Board members were unable to 
attend meetings, they were provided 
with the Board documents, and members 
provided their input, in advance of the 
meeting. Following the meetings, they 
were updated on decisions taken.
The Board has met on a further two 
occasions to date in FY18, with key matters 
discussed including the approval of the 
2017 Annual Report and financial statements. 
All Directors were present at both meetings.

The Board intends to meet formally at 
least six times a year, with ad hoc meetings 
called as and when circumstances require 
it to meet at short notice. The Board has 
approved an annual calendar of agenda 
items, with relevant matters scheduled for 
consideration at the appropriate point in the 
regulatory and financial cycle. In addition, 
the Board will meet at least once a year to 
discuss strategy, including a full strategic 
review of the business operations and the 
development of the Group’s strategic plan. 
All Directors are expected to attend all 
meetings of the Board and any Committees 
of which they are members, and to 
devote sufficient time to fulfil their 
duties as Directors. 
Each Non-Executive Director has 
committed to the Company that they 
are able to allocate sufficient time to the 
Company to discharge their responsibilities 
effectively. Any additional appointments they 
are contemplating taking on are discussed 
with the Chairman in advance, including 
the likely time commitment and whether 
these could in any way constitute a conflict 
of interest. These matters are formally 
reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.
As stated in the Articles of Association, 
at every AGM of the Company one-third 
of the Directors or, if their number is not 
three or a multiple of three, the number 
nearest to one-third, shall retire from office. 
As the 2018 AGM will be the Company’s 
first AGM since the IPO, all of the Directors 
retire and offer themselves for re-election.
Corporate governance | 41
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc The Directors received an induction 
briefing from the Company’s legal adviser, 
Bircham Dyson Bell LLP, on their duties 
and responsibilities as Directors of a 
publicly quoted company as part of the 
listing process. The Chairman, with the 
support of the Company Secretary, will 
ensure that a full, formal and tailored 
induction programme will be developed 
for any new Directors joining the Board 
and that the development and ongoing 
training needs of individual Directors and 
the Board as a whole are reviewed and 
agreed at least annually. The Company 
Secretary will ensure that the Board is 
briefed on forthcoming legal and 
regulatory developments, as well as 
developments in corporate governance

areas to ensure its effectiveness:
• Recruitment: A formal, rigorous 
and transparent procedure for the 
appointment of new Directors to the 
Board, overseen by the Nomination 
Committee. For each appointment, the 
Board will develop an objective brief 
summarising the role and the skills 
and experience required and use an 
appropriate executive search firm with 
proven expertise in the relevant field. 
Before confirming an appointment, the 
Board will check whether the preferred 
individual can commit to the time 
expected by the appointment.
• Tools and training: All Directors will have 
a tailored, formal induction process on 
joining the Board, including the opportunity 
to meet major shareholders. The aim is 
to ensure that they understand the 
Company and its business model, strategy, 
the drivers of value in the business and 
the key risks, and that they understand 
the legal and regulatory environment 
in which the Company operates.
  Directors are expected to update and 
refresh their skills and knowledge on an 
ongoing basis, and to continue to build 
their familiarity with the Company and its 
business throughout their tenure.
  The Company will provide the 
necessary resources for developing 
and updating its Directors’ knowledge 
and capabilities. All Directors have 
access to the services of the Company 
Secretary, and the opportunity to seek 
independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense where they judge 
it necessary to discharge their 
responsibilities as Directors or as 
members of Board Committees. 
  If Directors have concerns which 
cannot be resolved about the running 
of the Company or a proposed action, 
they can require that their concerns are 
recorded in the Board minutes, or provide 
a written statement to the Chairman, 
for circulation to the Board. The Board 
is supplied with information in a form 
and of a quality appropriate to enable 
it to discharge its duties effectively. 
This is provided in good time ahead 
of all meetings and decisions, and 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged 
to seek clarification from management 
whenever they feel appropriate.
• Conflicts of interest: Directors have a 
statutory duty to avoid actual or potential 
conflicts of interest. Any Director who 
becomes aware that he or she is in a 
situation which does or could create a 
conflict of interest, or has an interest in 
an existing or proposed transaction in 
which the Company also has an interest, 
is required to notify the Board in writing 
as soon as possible. The interests of 
new Directors are reviewed during the 
recruitment process and authorised 
(if appropriate) by the Board at the time
  of their appointment. No Director had 
a material interest in any contract of 
significance in relation to the Company’s 
business at any time during the year or 
to the date of this report.
Relationship with shareholders
We maintain a dialogue with shareholders 
throughout the year as part of an ongoing 
investor relations programme. The Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief 
Financial Officer all variously and routinely 
engage with analysts, institutional and 
retail shareholders and potential investors. 
Our aim is to ensure that there are strong 
relationships, through which we can 
understand those parties’ views on material 
issues. Feedback is provided to the Board, 
particularly where there are issues or 
concerns, and the Company’s brokers also 
provide independent feedback from investors. 
All brokers’ notes are circulated to the entire 
Board in order that the Board maintains an 
understanding of market perceptions of the 
Company. The Non-Executive Directors 
are available to discuss any matter 
shareholders might wish to raise.
The AGM is treated as an opportunity 
to communicate with all shareholders. 
The Chairs of all Board Committees 
attend the AGM and are available to 
answer questions. An explanatory circular 
containing the notice of meeting is sent 
to shareholders at least 20 working days 
beforehand, with separate votes being 
offered on each substantive issue. To 
encourage shareholders to participate in 
the AGM process, the Company will offer 
electronic proxy voting through both our 
registrar’s website and, for CREST members, 
the CREST service. Voting will be conducted 
by way of a poll and the results will be 
announced through the Regulatory News 
Service and made available on the 
Company’s website.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Board effectiveness Annual statement by the 
Nomination Committee Chair
As Chair of the Nomination Committee, 
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Board covering the policy and practice 
for the Company for the first time as a 
listed entity. 
The Nomination Committee will 
be responsible for assisting the Board 
in the formal selection and appointment of 
Directors. It will consider potential candidates 
and will recommend appointments of new 
Directors to the Board and will also be 
responsible for periodically reviewing the 
Board’s structure and identifying potential 
candidates to be appointed as Directors or 
Committee members as the need may arise.
The appointments will be based on merit 
and against objective criteria, including 
the time available to, and the commitment 
which will be required of, the potential 
Director. It will also be responsible for 
carrying out an annual performance 
evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors.
The Nomination Committee is 
responsible for evaluating the balance 
of skills, knowledge and experience 
and the size, structure and composition 
of the Board and Committees of the 
Board, retirements and appointments 
of additional and replacement Directors 
and Committee members, and will make 
appropriate recommendations to the 
Board with regard to any changes 
necessary on such matters.
In addition, the Nomination Committee 
will make recommendations to the Board 
as regards succession planning for both 
Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors. The Nomination Committee 
will take into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Group and what 
skills and expertise will therefore be 
needed on the Board in the future.
Meetings
It is intended that the Nomination 
Committee will meet at least twice per 
year and as otherwise required to meet is 
duties. The composition of the Board was 
assessed and the terms of reference were 
established as part of the IPO process. 
The Committee did not meet in the period 
between the IPO and 31 December 2017.
The Committee will meet in 2018 and 
will focus on succession planning, a review 
of the Committee’s terms of reference and 
the Group’s Diversity Policy. We will also 
review the composition of the Board and 
its Committees to satisfy that we have a 
good balance of skills and experience on 
the Board to support the Company’s 
future development.

Performance evaluation
As the Nomination Committee has 
only been established for a short time, 
a formal performance evaluation has 
not been conducted. It is intended that a 
performance evaluation will be conducted 
in 2018 and reported on in the Company’s 
2018 Annual Report.
Diversity
The Company’s policy on diversity is 
that no individual should be discriminated 
against on the grounds of race, colour, 
ethnicity, religious belief, political affiliation, 
gender, age or disability, and this extends to 
Board appointments. The Board recognises 
the benefits of diversity, including gender 
diversity, on the Board and across the 
Company, although it believes that all 
appointments should be made on merit, 
whilst ensuring that there is an appropriate 
balance of skills and experience within 
the Board. The Board currently consists 
of 12.5% (one) female and 87.5% (seven) 
male Board members.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Nomination Committee report Annual statement by the 
Audit Committee Chair
I am pleased to present this report covering 
the role of the Audit Committee and the 
issues reviewed by the Company since 
becoming a listed entity. The Committee’s 
primary purpose is to assist the Board with 
the discharge of its responsibilities in 
relation to internal and external audits and 
controls, including reviewing the Group’s 
annual financial statements, considering 
the scope of the annual audit and the extent 
of the non-audit work undertaken by external 
auditors, advising on the appointment 
of external auditors and reviewing the 
effectiveness of the internal control 
systems in place within the Group.
The Committee has met twice between the 
IPO in April and the end of the 2017 financial 
year. In this, the first year as a listed company, 
the primary focus of the Committee was 
on establishing the Committee’s terms 
of reference, reviewing the Company’s 
whistleblowing policy, reviewing the risk 
management process, reviewing the 
incident management process, reviewing the 
Company’s first set of financial statements 
at its interim results in September, 
establishing a process for internal audit and 
considering the potential impact of future 
changes in accounting standards. The below 
is a summary of the key issues reviewed by 
the Committee during the period:
Significant accounting issues 
The Audit Committee’s review of the 
half-year financial statements focused 
on the following areas of significance: 
• reviewing the appropriate use of 
alternative performance measures, 
including adjusted financial results 
to exclude one-off IPO expenses, 
to communicate the Company’s 
performance to its shareholders. 
An explanation of the alternative 
performance measures employed 
can be found in note 2;
• the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements as a continuation of 
the existing Indoor Bowling Equity Limited 
business and to account for its acquisition 
by insertion of the holding company 
(Ten Entertainment Group plc) using the 
principles of predecessor accounting 
along with the accounting treatment 
and disclosure of the transaction costs 
incurred as part of the IPO process; and
• reviewing the impairment assessments 
of the values of property, plant and 
equipment and goodwill for the Group 
at the end of the period and the factors 
considered in determining the cash flows 
and the rate used to discount those cash 
flows. Further detail of the impairment 
assessments can be found in notes 11 
and 13.
The Audit Committee, following 
confirmations from management and the 
external auditors, satisfied itself as to the 
reasonableness and consistency of these 
assumptions when compared to prior years.
New accounting standards
The new accounting standard for 
leasing (IFRS 16), which will be effective 
for the year ending in December 2019, 
will have no net cash flow impact but 
could significantly change the composition 
of the consolidated balance sheet and 
phasing of the charges in the income 
statement. In view of the nature of the 
majority of the Group’s leases being 
long-term leases with landlords, the Audit 
Committee is advised that the impact is 
anticipated to be material. The Company 
has yet to determine whether to adopt the 
new standard on a full retrospective or 
modified retrospective basis and the Audit 
Committee will report next year on the 
expected method of adoption together 
with the anticipated impact of the standard 
on the financial statements.
The new accounting standard for statutory 
revenue recognition (IFRS 15), effective 
1 January 2018, is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s revenues. 
The majority of the Group’s statutory 
revenues are derived from sales to customers 
and the new standard is not expected to 
impact the recording of these.
The new financial instruments 
standard (IFRS 9) will be applicable from 
1 January 2018. An assessment of the 
impact of this standard is in progress but 
initial estimates are that the overall impact 
is not expected to be material.
Risk management 
and internal control
The Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control were 
reviewed extensively as part of the pre-IPO 
process and again as a part of the annual 
risk review process, and it was concluded 
that the systems currently in place 
are satisfactory and work effectively.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Audit Committee report As a newly listed company, we recognise 
the importance of ensuring these systems 
are robust and effective and we expect 
to work with the finance and IT teams to 
ensure they are kept under review and 
developed where necessary during the 
coming financial year.
The Board has overall responsibility 
for setting the Group’s risk appetite 
and ensuring that there is an effective 
risk management framework to maintain 
appropriate levels of risk. The Board has, 
however, delegated responsibility for review 
of the risk management methodology 
and effectiveness of internal control 
to the Audit Committee.
The Group’s system of internal control 
comprises entity-wide, high-level controls, 
controls over business processes and 
centre-level controls. Policies and 
procedures, including clearly defined 
levels of delegated authority, have been 
communicated across the Group. Internal 
controls have been implemented in respect 
of the key operational and financial 
processes which exist within the business.
These policies are designed to ensure the 
accuracy and reliability of financial reporting 
and govern the preparation of the financial 
statements. The Board is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal controls and risk management 
and discharges its duties in this area by: 
• holding regular Board meetings 
to consider the matters reserved 
for its consideration; 
• receiving regular management 
reports which provide an assessment 
of key risks and controls; 
• scheduling annual Board reviews 
of strategy;
• ensuring there is a clear organisational 
structure with defined responsibilities 
and levels of authority; 
• ensuring there are documented policies 
and procedures in place; and 
• reviewing regular reports containing 
detailed information regarding financial 
performance, rolling forecasts, actual 
and forecast covenant compliance 
and financial and non-financial KPIs.
The process by which the Audit 
Committee has monitored and reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management during the 
year has included: 
• reviews of the Group’s risk register;
• reviewing the system of financial and 
accounting controls, and considering 
the view of the external auditors in relation 
to the effectiveness of such controls; and
• reporting to the Board on the risk 
and control culture within the Group.
The Audit Committee has not 
identified, nor been made aware of, 
any significant failings or weaknesses 
in the risk management and internal 
control systems and is satisfied that the 
systems are effective. The Committee 
will continue to challenge management 
to further improve risk identification, 
evaluation and management processes 
across the Group.
Going concern 
and viability statement 
On behalf of the Board, the Audit 
Committee reviewed the Group’s 
projected cash flows, facilities and 
covenants as well as reviewing the 
assumptions underlying the viability 
statement and concluded that it could 
recommend to the Board that it should 
be able to make the relevant statements.
Incident management 
The Company operates an incident 
management policy at site level, recording 
incidents relating to health and safety, 
accidents, criminal activity, food standards, 
pest control and others. The Chief 
Financial Officer reviews these incidents 
and escalates any significant incidents to 
the Audit Committee as necessary. 
Whistleblowing
The Company has established procedures 
for employees to raise concerns, in 
confidence, relating to matters of financial 
reporting, financial control or other matters. 
The whistleblowing policy is applicable 
for all employees who are made aware 
of the policy on joining the Company, 
and are reminded of its availability through 
online portals and posters. A whistleblowing 
hotline is operated by an independent 
outsourced specialist, who provides direct 
escalation of incidents through the HR 
department and up to the Chair of the 
Audit Committee. No incidents were 
reported during FY17.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Internal auditors
The Group expects to use BDO UK LLP 
(“BDO”) to perform at least two internal 
audit reviews per year. The audit results are 
discussed with the Chief Financial Officer 
and presented to the Audit Committee, 
who will annually review the effectiveness 
of the internal audit function. BDO were 
appointed to this role during FY17 and 
commenced work on their first audit 
during the financial year. In addition, the 
Group supports the internal audit reviews 
with a loss prevention and process audit 
role, with each site visited to perform 
process audits at least once per annum.
External auditors
The Audit Committee has reviewed 
the independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), 
and considers that PwC continue to 
possess the skills and experience required 
to fulfil their duties effectively and 
efficiently. As this is the first year after 
the IPO no audit tender was carried 
out and the Committee will assess the 
performance of the auditors each year 
in considering whether it is appropriate 
to carry out a tender, before a compulsory 
tender is required. The Audit Committee’s 
review of the effectiveness of PwC as the 
external auditors is based on discussions 
with the senior finance team, the robustness 
of the audit, the quality of reporting to the 
Audit Committee and reports published 
by the FRC.
PwC have confirmed that in their 
professional judgement they are 
independent within the meaning of 
regulatory and professional requirements 
and the objectivity of the audit engagement 
partner and audit staff is not impaired.
The Audit Committee has held meetings 
with the external auditors without 
management and there is regular 
dialogue with the audit partner.
PwC provided certain non-audit services 
in respect of the IPO, including providing 
an opinion on the Company’s historical 
financial information. PwC were engaged 
due to their knowledge and understanding 
of the business prior to the IPO. In order 
to maintain their independence and 
objectivity, PwC undertook their standard 
independence procedures in relation to 
each of these assignments and staff not 
engaged on the audit were used for the 
provision of the non-audit services. As a 
result, given the work on the IPO, the fees 
paid to PwC in respect of non-audit 
services during the year totalled £260,187, 
which was in excess of the audit fee. 
Fair, balanced, understandable 
and comprehensive reporting 
The Audit Committee has provided advice 
to the Board on whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each Director was also asked to provide 
this confirmation. When doing so, both the 
Committee and the individual Directors 
were provided with a set of questions 
designed to test the quality of reporting 
and asked to satisfy themselves that the 
levels of disclosure were appropriate.
Annual evaluation
We have made good progress since the 
IPO in strengthening our governance and 
control infrastructure and will continue to 
work with the management team and the 
Board to ensure our processes operate 
effectively to support the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy. The Committee as a 
whole has competence that is relevant 
to the sector in which the Group operates 
and the Chair of the Committee has the 
relevant financial experience to run 
the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee report continued Annual statement by the 
Remuneration Committee Chair
As Chair of the Remuneration Committee, 
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Board covering the policy and practice for the 
Company for the first time as a listed entity. 
This report has been prepared in accordance 
with the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2013, the UKLA 
Listing Rules and the Code. In this report 
we explain the pay which has resulted for 
Executive Directors, the fees paid to the 
Non-Executive Directors and we set out 
our approach for remuneration for FY18. 
This report is split into three parts:
• the annual statement by the Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee;
• a summary of the Directors’ 
remuneration policy as introduced 
upon Admission; and
• the annual report on remuneration 
which sets out payments made to the 
Directors and details the link between 
Company performance and remuneration 
for 2017.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy was prepared 
at the time of the IPO and appropriate 
arrangements were set up to support 
the Company as a publicly listed entity. 
The following were considered in 
determining the new policy:
• transitioning from a private equity 
backed business to a listed company;
• linking the remuneration policy 
of Executive Directors to the performance 
of the Company to encourage a 
high-performance culture, including 
an annual bonus measure based upon 
the Group’s financial performance over 
the year and specific objective measures 
for each Director; and
• the launch of the new Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) with the first grants 
made during May 2017. Awards will vest 
at the end of three years subject to 
satisfaction of performance conditions 
measuring EPS and TSR in the final 
year of the performance period in 
equal measure.
The Remuneration Committee is 
focused on ensuring that its policy aligns 
stakeholders and the business strategy, 
enables the Company both to retain and 
attract executives in a competitive market 
and set challenging targets that are fair to 
all concerned. The Committee’s key activities 
during FY17 since the IPO have been 
focused on:
• the formulation of the Company 
remuneration policy as a listed company;
• the agreement of the Remuneration 
Committee’s terms of reference;
• the agreement of the Chairman’s fee 
and the Non-Executive Director fees; 
• formulation of the Company’s 
new LTIP; and
• introduction of a bonus plan in respect 
of this financial year.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Directors’ remuneration report FY17 remuneration performance
The annual bonus plan for Executive Directors 
was based on target performance of Group 
adjusted EBITDA, which the Committee 
considers to be an important measure of 
business performance and consistent with 
how the Board measures performance. 
Bonus targets for Group adjusted EBITDA 
were not achieved based on the performance 
conditions set for FY17. Despite a successful 
year both operationally and financially, 
stretching targets were set for the first year 
of transition from a private to public 
company, recognising the level of equity 
that was awarded to the Executive 
Directors on completion of the IPO.
As the earliest vesting date for awards 
made under the LTIP is FY19, no LTIP 
awards vested during the year.
The Committee is satisfied that 
the remuneration outcomes for the 
Executive Directors for FY17 are fully 
justified, considering both the business 
and individual performance during the 
year, and are in the best interests of both 
the Company and its shareholders.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank shareholders for their support for the 
Company and I look forward to meeting 
you at the Annual General Meeting on 
9 May 2018. In the meantime, I am always 
happy to hear from shareholders, and I can 
be contacted via the Company Secretary 
should you have any questions on either 
this report, or more generally in relation 
to our remuneration policy.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Directors’ remuneration report continued Directors’ 
remuneration policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy will be 
put to a shareholder vote on 9 May 2018 
and will apply for a period of three years 
from the date of approval.
Policy summary
The Remuneration Committee determines 
the policy for the Executive Directors and 
the Chairman for the current and future 
years. The Committee considers that a 
successful policy needs to be sufficiently 
flexible to take account of changes in both 
the business environment and remuneration 
best practice. The policy is designed to 
provide remuneration packages that will:
• align the interests of the Executive 
Directors and senior management 
with those of shareholders; 
• provide competitive remuneration 
that will both motivate and retain the 
Group’s current key employees and attract 
high-quality individuals to join the Group;
• encourage and support  
a high-performance culture;
• reward delivery of the Group’s business 
plan and key strategic goals; and
• set appropriate performance 
conditions in line with the agreed 
risk profile of the business.
Whilst the Committee does not 
consult directly with employees 
on Executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee does receive updates 
regarding remuneration for employees 
across the Group. This is considered 
when determining the remuneration 
for the Directors.
Consistent with the remuneration 
strategy, the Remuneration Committee 
agreed a post-Admission remuneration 
policy for the Executive Directors and 
senior managers whereby:
• salaries will be set at competitive, 
but not excessive, levels compared 
to peers and other companies of an 
equivalent size and complexity and 
are commensurate to the individual’s 
performance and responsibility;
• performance-related pay, based on 
stretching targets, forms a significant 
part of remuneration packages and 
offers the potential for competitive levels 
of total pay if targets are delivered; and
• there is an appropriate balance between 
short and longer-term performance 
targets linked to delivery of the Group’s 
strategic plan.
The Remuneration Committee will 
oversee the implementation of this policy 
and will seek to ensure that the Executive 
Directors are fairly rewarded for the Group’s 
performance over both the short and long 
term. The Remuneration Committee is very 
aware that the policy must be capable of 
being operated to take account of the 
Group’s evolution following Admission and 
to reflect the fact that its pay arrangements 
need to transition over time from ones that 
are reflective of a non-listed private equity 
backed entity in which senior executives 
have material stakes to a more standard 
listed public limited company structure.
The remuneration framework intended 
to deliver this policy post-Admission for 
Executive Directors and senior managers 
is a combination of base salary, benefits 
and an annual incentive award as 
described below. 
Base salary 
Base salaries will be reviewed as 
appropriate following Admission, but not 
typically more frequently than annually. 
In reviewing base salaries (and overall 
levels of remuneration more generally), 
the Remuneration Committee will consider 
the performance of the Group and the 
individual, the individual Executive Director’s 
experience and changes in responsibilities 
or scope of the role, as well as pay practices 
in relevant comparator companies of a 
broadly similar size and complexity (with 
due account taken of both market 
capitalisation and turnover). Base salaries 
for the Executive Directors from Admission 
were £275,000 for Alan Hand, £175,000 
for Mark Willis and £160,000 for 
Graham Blackwell.
Benefits
The Executive Directors are entitled to 
receive benefits which include, but are 
not limited to, family private health cover, 
death in service life assurance and travel 
expenses for any business-related travel.
Pension
The Executive Directors receive pension 
contributions of 5% of salary per annum.
Bonus plan
The Executive Directors are able to 
participate in the Company’s discretionary 
Executive and Management Bonus Scheme 
for FY17. Targets under the bonus scheme 
are based on the achievement of EBITDA 
in excess of target expectation for the 
financial year with a sliding scale for 
the increasing levels of performance. 
The maximum percentage of annual salary 
that Executive Directors can receive is 
100% for achieving the highest targets 
under the bonus scheme. From FY18 the 
bonus scheme will also include an element

Bonus plan continued
of performance measurement in relation 
to each Executive Director’s personal 
performance. 70% of the maximum bonus 
will remain based on EBITDA in excess 
of target expectation, with the remaining 
30% dependent on achieving personal 
objectives as agreed with the Committee. 
The personal performance element only 
becomes attainable on achieving the 
minimum EBITDA target.
Long-term incentive plans
The Board approved and adopted 
performance share plans on 12 April 2017, 
conditional upon Admission. Executive 
Directors and selected employees of the 
Group may be invited to participate in 
the share plans at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee. The LTIP is 
designed to incentivise the Executive 
Directors to maximise returns to shareholders 
through a combination of EPS growth and 
TSR performance conditions. Awards are 
granted annually in the form of nil-cost 
options, vesting at the end of a three-year 
performance period, subject to: the 
Executive Director’s continued employment 
at the date of vesting; and the satisfaction 
of the performance conditions. The 
maximum award is 200% of base salary 
for the award granted in the first year 
post-Admission, reducing to 150% of salary 
in subsequent years.
Service agreements
Each of the Executive Directors has 
entered into a service agreement with the 
Company which is effective upon Admission. 
The policy is that each Executive Director’s 
service agreement should be of indefinite 
duration, subject to termination by the 
Company or the individual on six months’ 
notice. The service agreements of all 
Executive Directors comply with that policy.
The contracts contain a payment in lieu 
of notice clause which is limited to base 
salary only and there is no loss of office 
payment due.
Recruitment remuneration policy
New Executive Director and senior manager 
hires (including those promoted internally) 
will be offered remuneration packages in 
line with the Group’s remuneration policy 
in force at the time. In addition to the above 
elements of remuneration, the Remuneration 
Committee may, in exceptional 
circumstances, consider it appropriate to 
grant an award under a different structure 
in order to facilitate the buyout of 
outstanding awards held by an individual 
on recruitment. Any buyout award would 
be limited to what the Remuneration 
Committee considers to be a fair estimate 
of the value of awards foregone when 
leaving the former employer and will be 
structured, to the extent possible, to take 
into account other key terms (such as a 
scheduled vesting and performance targets) 
of the awards which are being replaced. 
For external and internal appointments, 
the Remuneration Committee may agree 
that the Group will meet certain relocation 
expenses as it considers appropriate.
Chairman and Non-Executive 
Director letters of appointment
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive 
Directors’ fees have been set at a level 
to reflect the amount of time and level 
of involvement required in order to carry 
out their duties as members of the Board 
and its Committees, and to attract and 
retain Non-Executive Directors of the 
highest calibre with relevant commercial 
and other experience. Fee levels are set by 
reference to non-executive Director fees 
at companies of similar size and complexity.
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined 
by the Remuneration Committee, while 
the fees for other Non-Executive Directors 
are determined by the Board as a whole. 
The Chairman, from Admission, receives 
an annual fee of £135,000; David Wild, 
Rob McWilliam, Christopher Mills and 
Julie Sneddon all receive an annual fee 
of £50,000. The Chairman and the other 
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in any of the Group’s incentive 
arrangements following Admission and do 
not receive pension contributions.

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The 2017 Annual General Meeting will be the first occasion on which the Company will seek the support of shareholders for matters 
relating to the remuneration of Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee will ensure that it considers all of the feedback which 
it receives from shareholders during this process. 
Single total figure of remuneration
The table below sets out the single total figure of remuneration and breakdown for each Director in respect of FY17. Nick Basing is the 
only Director of the Company who received remuneration and who was a Director of Indoor Bowling Equity Limited prior to its acquisition 
and as such his remuneration is not prorated from the date of the IPO, being 12 April 2017. The other Directors’ remuneration is prorated 
from the date of the IPO but their full annual remuneration has been reflected separately.

The above charts provide an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the remuneration policy 
and the value of each component. The assumptions noted for target performance and maximum in the graphs above are provided for 
illustration purposes only. Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director: 
Threshold performance – consists of fixed remuneration, no annual bonus and no vesting of LTIP awards. 
On-target - Fixed remuneration, 50 per cent annual bonus payout (50% of salary) and no vesting of LTIP awards.
Maximum – Fixed remuneration, 100 per cent annual bonus payout (100% of salary) and no vesting of LTIP awards.
The fixed remuneration element is based on base salary effective for the year ended 30 December 2018, as set out on page 54 plus the 
pension and benefits paid in the year ended 31 December 2017, as set out in the table of Directors’ remuneration on page 51.
52 | Corporate governance
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Directors’ remuneration report continued Annual Bonus Plan
The incentive for FY17 was in the form of a bonus based on performance against a target to increase the Group’s adjusted EBITDA. 
The Executive Directors had a bonus opportunity of up to 100% of salary in respect of FY17. Actual Group adjusted EBITDA of £19.0m 
did not result in a bonus payment for the Executive Directors. Mark Willis was granted a one-off, discretionary bonus of £15,000 upon 
joining the Company, payable after six months’ employment.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
In accordance with the PSP announced on 22 May 2017, the vesting of awards is conditional upon the achievement of two performance 
conditions which will be measured following the announcement of results for the year to 31 December 2019 (“FY19”). The first performance 
condition applying to the awards will be based on earnings per share of the Company (“EPS”) and will apply to 50% of the total number 
of share awards granted. The second performance condition will be based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) of the Company over the 
period from the date of grant to the announcement of results for FY19 relative to a comparator group of companies and will apply to 
the remaining 50%. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, the value of the awards is measured at fair value at the date of the 
grant. The fair value is written off on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on management’s estimate of the number 
of shares that will eventually vest.
LTIP awards granted in 2017
The following awards were granted to the Executive Directors on 22 May 2017. The share price at grant date was £1.68 and at the 
minimum performance level 12.5% of the scheme’s interest would be receivable.

Comparison of overall performance
It should be noted that the Company listed on 12 April 2017 and, therefore, has limited listed share price history until the financial year 
ended 31 December 2017. The below graph reflects the performance of an investment of £100 in the Group against the same investment in

The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Chief Executive Officer over the last two years, valued using the 
methodology applied to the single total figure of remuneration. The Remuneration Committee does not believe that the remuneration 
payable in its earlier years as a private company bears any comparative value to that paid in its later years and, therefore, the Remuneration 
Committee has chosen to disclose remuneration only for the two most recent financial years:

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Directors’ report The Directors are all covered by a Directors’ 
and Officers’ liability insurance policy 
maintained by the Company with a qualifying 
third-party insurance company which was 
maintained throughout the financial period 
and is still in place as at the date of the 
approval of these financial statements. 
Results and dividend 
The results for the year are set out in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income on page 69. The Directors 
recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of 7p per share on 5 July 2018 subject to 
approval at the AGM on 9 May 2018, with 
a record date of 25 May 2018.
As at 31 December 2017, the Company’s 
authorised share capital was £650,000 
divided into a single class of 65,000,000 
ordinary shares of 1p each. Details of the 
Company’s share capital, including 
changes during the year, are set out in 
note 17 to the financial statements. 
All issued ordinary shares are fully paid 
up. The ordinary shares are listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and can be held 
in certificated or uncertificated form. 
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled 
to attend and speak at general meetings 
of the Company, to appoint one or more 
proxies and, if they are corporations, 
corporate representatives who are entitled 
to attend general meetings and to exercise 
voting rights. On a show of hands at a 
general meeting of the Company every 
holder of ordinary shares present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have 
one vote, unless the proxy is appointed by 
more than one shareholder and has been 
instructed by one or more shareholders to 
vote for the resolution and by one or more 
shareholders to vote against the resolution, 
in which case the proxy has one vote for 
and one vote against. This reflects the 
position in the Shareholders’ Rights 
Regulations 2009 which amended the 
Companies Act 2006. On a poll, every 
member present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote shall have one vote 
for every ordinary share held. None of the 
ordinary shares carry any special voting rights 
with regard to control of the Company. 
The Articles specify deadlines for 
exercising voting rights and appointing 
a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to 
resolutions to be passed at the AGM. The 
relevant proxy votes are counted and the 
number for, against or withheld in relation 
to each resolution are announced at the 
AGM and published on the Company’s 
website after the meeting. 
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares in the Company other 
than certain restrictions that may be 
imposed from time to time by the Articles, 
law or regulation and pursuant to the 
Listing Rules whereby certain Directors, 
officers and employees require approval 
to deal in ordinary shares of the Company. 
As part of the IPO the following restrictions 
were also put in place:
• restrictions on Harwood Capital 
Nominees Limited, Oryx International 
Growth Fund Limited and North Atlantic 
Smaller Companies Investment Trust plc 
(the “Principal Selling Shareholders”) as a 
result of the Principal Selling Shareholders 
entering into a lock-in deed with the 
Company and its sponsor (Numis) 
restricting the transfer of ordinary shares 
held by the Principal Selling Shareholder 
immediately after Admission for a period 
of 12 months. For the 180-day period 
thereafter, they have agreed not to 
directly or indirectly transfer any of the 
shares other than through Numis; and 
• restrictions on certain Directors 
of the Company (the “Management 
Selling Shareholders”) as a result of 
the Management Selling Shareholders 
entering into a lock-in deed with the 
Company and its sponsor (Numis) 
restricting the transfer of the legal and/or 
beneficial interest in ordinary shares held 
by the Management Selling Shareholders 
immediately after Admission for a period 
of 12 months. For the 180-day period 
thereafter, they have agreed not to 
directly or indirectly transfer any of the 
shares other than through Numis.
The Group is not aware of any other 
agreements between holders of securities 
that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of ordinary shares.
Authority for the Company 
to purchase its own shares 
Subject to authorisation by shareholder 
resolution, the Company may purchase 
its own shares in accordance with the Act. 
Any shares which have been bought 
back may be held as treasury shares 
or cancelled immediately upon completion 
of the purchase.
Immediately prior to, but conditional 
upon Admission, the Company was 
generally and unconditionally authorised 
to make market purchases (within the 
meaning of Section 693(4) of the Companies 
Act) of its shares provided that in doing so 
it could not purchase more than 6,500,000 
shares in aggregate, pays not less than 1p 
(excluding expenses) per share and pays a 
price per share that is not more (excluding 
expenses) per share than the higher of:
• 105% of the average of the middle 
market quotations for a share as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily 
Official List for the five business days 
immediately before the day on which 
it purchases that share; and 
• the amount equal to the higher of the 
price of the last independent trade of an 
ordinary share and the highest current 
independent bid for an ordinary share 
as derived from the London Stock 
Exchange trading service SETS.
This authority shall expire at the conclusion 
of the next AGM of the Company or within 
15 months from the date of passing of the 
resolution (whichever is the earlier), but the 
Company may, if it agrees to purchase shares 
under this authority before it expires, 
complete the purchase wholly or partly 
after this authority expires. The Company

Employment policies 
The Group is committed to the principle 
of equal opportunity in employment. The

qualifications and suitability for the position, 
whilst bearing in mind equality and diversity. 
It is the Group’s policy to recruit the most 
capable person available for each position.

employees honestly and fairly. The Group 
is committed to ensuring that its employees 
feel respected and valued and are able to 
fulfil their potential and recognises that the 
success of the business relies on their skill

Applications for employment by disabled 
persons are always fully considered bearing 
in mind the aptitudes of the applicant 
concerned. In the event of members of 
staff becoming disabled, efforts are made 
to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged. It is the policy of the 
Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should 
as far as possible be identical with that of 
other employees.
The Group attaches importance to 
good communications and relations with 
employees. Information that is or may be 
relevant to employees in the performance 
of their duties is circulated to them on a 
regular basis, or immediately if it requires 
their immediate attention. There is regular 
consultation with employees through 
meetings or other lines of communication, 
so that their views are known and can be 
taken into account in making decisions 
on matters that will or may affect them.
Employee participation in their bowling 
venue’s performance is encouraged through 
various bonus and incentive schemes and 
there is regular communication with all 
employees on the performance of their 
bowling venue or central function and on 
the financial and economic factors affecting 
the overall performance of the Group.

Directors’ statement 
of disclosure of information 
to auditors 
Having made the requisite enquiries, the 
Directors in office at the date of this Annual 
Report and Accounts have each confirmed 
that, so far as they are aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the 
Group’s auditors are unaware and each 
Director has taken all the steps he/she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself/ 
herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
Going concern
The financial statements are prepared on 
a going concern basis, which the Directors 
believe to be appropriate based on: 
• the ongoing review of current trading 
performance and results and the impact 
on cash flows and the financial position 
of the Group;
• the review of the Group’s operational 
cash requirements, investment and 
maintenance capital needs, financing 
cash requirements in the servicing and 
repaying of debt and how the current and 
forecast cash position covers these areas;
• the preparation of annual budgets which 
analyse the future trading performance, 
the conversion to cash and the movement 
in the Group’s financial position;
• the review of current compliance with 
banking covenants and the analysis of 
forecast results and how they impact 
on compliance. This includes reviewing 
sensitised cases for potential risks 
impacting on forecast performance 
and what levels of headroom the Group 
can sustain to remain compliant;
• the ongoing review of material risks 
and uncertainties to the business and 
the maintenance or implementation of 
controls and procedures to ensure these 
are monitored and managed. These risks 
are reviewed under the Strategic report 
on pages 23 to 25; and
• the ongoing review of the business 
model and implementation of new 
technology and ideas as well as entering 
into new contracts and business 
partnerships to improve the business 
performance and ensure its going 
concern for at least the following year 
as per current forecasts.
Cautionary statement 
This Annual Report and Accounts 
contains forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements are 
not guarantees of future performance; 
rather, they are based on current views 
and assumptions as at the date of this 
Annual Report and Accounts and are made 
by the Directors in good faith based on the 
information available to them at the time 
of their approval of this report. These 
statements should be treated with caution 
due to the inherent risks and uncertainties 
underlying any such forward-looking 
information. The Group undertakes 
no obligation to update these  
forward-looking statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulation.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare financial statements for each 
financial 52-week period. Under that law 
the Directors have prepared the Group 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union 
and Company financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Group 
and Company for that period. 
In preparing the financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union have 
been followed for the Group financial 
statements and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed for 
the Company financial statements, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Group 
and Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and Company 
and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ 
remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Directors are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors consider that the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group and 
Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names 
and functions are listed in the Corporate 
Governance report confirm that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the Company financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and loss of 
the Company;
• the Group financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit 
of the Group; and
• the strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Group and Company, together with a 
description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face. 
In the case of each Director in office at the 
date the Directors’ report is approved:
• so far as the Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which 
the Group and Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they 
ought to have taken as a Director in 
order to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Group and Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information.
We consider the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.

Ten Entertainment Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Opinion
In our opinion, Ten Entertainment Group plc’s group 
financial statements and company financial statements 
(the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the 
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s 
profit and the group’s and the company’s cash flows for the 
52-week period then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company’s 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the 
Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated and Company 
statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated 
and Company statements of cash flows, and the Consolidated 
and Company statements of changes in equity for the 52-week 
period then ended; the accounting policies; and the notes to the 
financial statements.
Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities 
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the 
ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as 
applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit 
services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided 
to the group or the company.
Other than those disclosed in the Directors’ Report, we have 
provided no non-audit services to the group or the company 
in the period from 2 January 2017 to 31 December 2017.
Our audit approach
Context
Ten Entertainment Group plc is a tenpin bowling operator 
and operations are wholly UK-based. As described in note 3 to 
the financial statements, the Group listed on the London Stock 
Exchange on 19 April 2017. A group reorganisation took place as 
part of the IPO in which Ten Entertainment Group plc became the 
new parent company of the existing group. The group has applied 
the principles of predecessor accounting and as such the 
comparatives are presented as if the group has always existed 
in its current form.
Overview
Materiality • Overall group materiality: £559,000 
(2016: £420,000), based on 5% 
of adjusted profit before tax.
• Overall company materiality: £409,000 
(2016: £430,000), based on 1% of 
total assets.
Audit scope • The Ten Entertainment Group plc 
group operates with one significant 
component, being Tenpin Limited, 
which is a UK subsidiary. There are 
7 other UK based subsidiaries.
• We performed a full scope audit over 
Tenpin Limited, whilst performing 
specific procedures over transactions 
and balances within the other statutory 
entities based on their contribution to 
the group’s financial statement line items.
• Our audit scoping gave us coverage 
of 97% of revenue and 89% of profit 
before tax.
Key audit matters • Goodwill and site asset impairment.

Independent auditors’ report
To the members of Ten Entertainment Group plc The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality 
and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made 
subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and 
considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
framework applicable to the group and the industry in which 
it operates, and considered the risk of acts by the group which 
were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. 
We designed audit procedures at group and significant component 
level to respond to the risk, recognising that the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the 
risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional 
misrepresentations, or through collusion. We focused on laws 
and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in 
the group and company financial statements, including, but not 
limited to, the Companies Act 2006, the Listing Rules and UK tax 
legislation. Our tests included, but were not limited to, review 
of the financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting 
documentation, review of correspondence with legal advisors 
and enquiries of management. There are inherent limitations in
the audit procedures described above and the further removed 
non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events 
and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less 
likely we would become aware of it.
We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, 
including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk 
of management override of internal controls, including testing 
journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ 
professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period and include the 
most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether 
or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the 
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list 
of all risks identified by our audit.
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and site asset impairment assessment
Refer to pages 44-46 (Audit Committee Report), pages 76-77 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and pages 86 to 89 (notes).
The group has property, plant and equipment of £34.9 million. The group 
operates in the leisure market and is therefore exposed to fluctuations in 
consumer discretionary spending and the wider economy.
Management considers each site to be a cash-generating unit (CGU) and has 
performed an impairment assessment using discounted cash flows to ensure that 
the carrying value of each site’s assets is supported by expected future cash flows.
We focused on this area as the determination of whether an impairment charge 
was necessary involved significant estimates about the future results of each site.
The group also has goodwill and intangible assets of £26.7 million which have 
arisen through a number of acquisitions. Goodwill is not allocated to individual 
CGUs as management considers that the synergies arising from each acquisition 
benefit the group as a whole rather than individual sites and management 
monitors goodwill in aggregate for internal purposes. Therefore, for goodwill 
impairment testing, the CGUs are aggregated into a single group.
We considered the carrying value of the group’s assets compared to 
its market capitalisation which gives an indication of the overall value 
of the group. The market capitalisation was significantly in excess 
of the carrying value of assets.
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s future cash 
flow forecasts and tested the underlying value in use calculations. 
We agreed management’s forecast to the latest Board approved 
strategic plan. We also compared historic actual results to those 
budgeted to assess the quality of management’s forecasting. Based 
on this evaluation, we considered management’s ability to forecast 
was appropriate to support the basis upon which the future cash 
flows have been prepared.
The key assumptions in the calculations were growth in revenue 
and EBITDA. In assessing these assumptions we considered external 
leisure market growth forecasts from a variety of sources, as these were 
good indicators of expected growth in tenpin bowling operator sales. 
Where management’s growth assumptions were in excess of these 
forecasts, we evaluated the rationale, being the benefit of refurbishments 
and other management actions to drive growth. We considered the 
forecasts had been prepared on a supportable basis.

Independent auditors’ report 
continued
To the members of Ten Entertainment Group plc Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Goodwill and site asset impairment assessment continued
Management’s assessment of the site portfolio as detailed above is used to form 
the basis of the goodwill impairment review and is therefore subject to the same 
assumptions as the site impairment review above.
We also tested:
•  management’s assumption in respect of the long term growth rates 
in the forecasts by comparing them to long term average growth 
rates of the UK economy; and
•  the discount rate, by assessing the cost of capital for the company 
and comparable organisations.
We were satisfied these assumptions were appropriate.
We also performed sensitivity analysis in respect of key assumptions 
to determine at what level changes in these would eliminate headroom 
in the impairment test. There were no changes in key assumptions that 
were considered reasonably possible which would eliminate headroom.
We evaluated the appropriateness of allocating goodwill to a single 
group of CGUs. We considered the rationale for the acquisitions, level 
of integration with the rest of the group, and the nature of synergies 
derived. We also confirmed this is the way in which management 
monitors goodwill by reviewing management’s internal reporting. 
We were satisfied that synergies benefited the group as a whole 
and therefore the allocation of goodwill to a single group of CGUs 
was appropriate.
We determined that there were no key audit matters applicable to the company to communicate in our report.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which they operate.
The Ten Entertainment Group plc group operates with one significant component, being Tenpin Limited, which is based the UK. There are 
7 other UK subsidiaries. 
We performed a full scope audit over Tenpin Limited, whilst performing specific procedures over transactions and balances within the 
other statutory entities based on their contribution to the group’s financial statement line items.
Our audit scoping gave us coverage of 97% of revenue and 89% of profit before tax. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in 
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. 
Key audit matters continued
Financial statements | 65 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Materiality continued
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality £559,000 (2016: £420,000). £409,000 (2016: £430,000).
How we determined it 5% of adjusted profit before tax. 1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
Adjusted profit before tax is a primary measure used 
by management and shareholders in assessing the 
performance of the group and is disclosed as a key 
performance indicator in the annual report. This measure 
provides us with a consistent year-on-year basis for 
determining materiality based on trading performance 
and eliminates the impact of non-recurring items. 
Adjusted profit before tax excludes exceptional items, 
shareholder loan note interest, amortisation of acquired 
intangibles, and loss on disposal of assets.
Total assets is deemed an appropriate 
benchmark as this is a non-trading entity 
which predominantly holds investments 
in subsidiaries.
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range 
of materiality allocated across components was between £409,000 and £500,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory 
audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £28,000 (Group 
audit) (2016: £21,000) and £20,450 (Company audit) (2016: £21,500) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
In accordance with ISAs (UK) we report as follows:
Reporting obligation Outcome
We are required to report if we have anything material to add 
or draw attention to in respect of the directors’ statement in the 
financial statements about whether the directors considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements and the directors’ identification 
of any material uncertainties to the group’s and the company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s 
and company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
We are required to report if the directors’ statement relating 
to Going Concern in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We have nothing to report.
Reporting on other information 
The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
any form of assurance thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform 
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other 
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

Independent auditors’ report 
continued
To the members of Ten Entertainment Group plc Reporting on other information continued
With respect to the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies 
Act 2006 have been included. 
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006, (CA06), ISAs 
(UK) and the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described 
below (required by ISAs (UK) unless otherwise stated).
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors’ 
Report for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in 
accordance with applicable legal requirements (CA06).
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report (CA06).
The directors’ assessment of the prospects of the group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the group
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to regarding:
• The directors’ confirmation on page 24 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.
• The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.
• The directors’ explanation on page 32 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period 
they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, 
including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors’ statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group and statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the group. Our review was substantially less in scope 
than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors’ process supporting their statements; checking that 
the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”); and considering whether 
the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit (Listing Rules).
Other Code Provisions
We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when: 
• The statement given by the directors, on page 61, that they consider the Annual Report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group’s and company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the group and company obtained 
in the course of performing our audit.
• The section of the Annual Report on page 44 describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
• The directors’ statement relating to the company’s compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the Code specified, under the Listing Rules, for review by the auditors.
Directors’ Remuneration
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (CA06).

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the annual report set out on page 61, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible 
for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless 
the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company 
or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms 
part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Consolidated and Company 
statements of changes in equity
for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 General information
T en Entertainment Group plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company, limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom 
and registered in England and Wales. The address of the registered office is Aragon House, University Way, Cranfield Technology Park, 
Cranfield, Bedford MK43 0EQ. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) that were acquired by the Company on 12 April 2017 
before the Company was admitted to the London Stock Exchange on 19 April 2017. The principal activity of the Group comprises the 
operation of tenpin bowling centres.
Basis of preparation
The Company was incorporated on 15 March 2017 and acquired the businesses of the Indoor Bowling Equity Limited Group on 12 April 2017 
as detailed in note 3. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 have been 
prepared as a continuation of the existing Indoor Bowling Equity Limited business and to account for its acquisition by insertion of the 
holding company (Ten Entertainment Group plc) using the principles of predecessor accounting. In doing so, the comparatives for the 
53-week period to 1 January 2017 have been presented as if the Group had always existed in its current form. Refer to note 3 for a 
detailed explanation of the Group reorganisation.
The Group and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as they apply to the financial statements of the Group and the Company for 
the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2017 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The accounting policies which follow 
set out those policies which apply in preparing the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2017 and have been applied 
consistently. The Group and the Company financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
pounds (£000) except when otherwise indicated. The financial statements are prepared using the historical cost basis. On publishing the 
company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption 
in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that 
form a part of these approved financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures 
During the year, a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact 
on the Group’s net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share. At the date of authorisation of the 
consolidated financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published but 
are not yet effective. The Group has not adopted early any of these pronouncements. The new standards, amendments and interpretations 
that are expected to be relevant to the Group’s financial statements in the future are as follows: 
IFRS 2 Share Based Payment has been amended to clarify the classification and measurements of share based payment transactions 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The clarifications and amendments are for the accounting for cash-settled 
share based payment transactions that include a performance condition; the classification of share based payment transactions with net 
settlement features; and the accounting for modifications of share based payment transactions from cash-settled to equity-settled. The 
Directors do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (2009) and amendment IFRS 9 Financial Instruments are effective for periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2018. IFRS 9 is a replacement for IAS 39 Financial Instruments and covers three distinct areas. Phase 1 contains new requirements 
for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. Phase 2 relates to the impairment of financial assets and requires 
the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis. Phase 3 relates to less stringent 
requirements for general hedge accounting. The Directors do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on 
the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
Financial statements | 73 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Statement of accounting policies Changes in accounting policy and disclosures continued
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces 
IAS 18 Revenue and introduces a five-step approach to revenue 
recognition based on performance obligations in customer 
contracts. The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) 
has proposed to issue some clarifications and to defer the standard’s 
effective date of 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2018. The Directors 
have carried out an initial assessment of the impact and based on 
the assessment completed to date do not expect the adoption 
of this standard to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements in future periods.
IFRS 16 Leases sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties 
to a contract, i.e. the customer (lessee) and the supplier (lessor). 
IFRS 16 completes the IASB’s project to improve the financial 
reporting of leases and replaces the previous leases standard, IAS 17 
Leases, and related interpretations. The effective date for the 
Group is 1 January 2019. The standard will affect primarily the 
accounting for the Group’s operating leases and will result in a 
material decrease in operating lease rental costs; material increases 
in depreciation and finance costs; a decrease in profit before and 
after tax; a decrease in net assets and recognition of lease assets 
and liabilities. As at the reporting date, the Group has non-cancellable 
operating lease commitments of £142.7m (see note 25). The Directors 
are in the process of evaluating the impact of IFRS 16 on the Group.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over 
which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. All intercompany 
balances and transactions and any unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the identifiable acquired assets 
(including intangible assets), liabilities and contingent liabilities are 
recorded at their fair values, reflecting their condition on the date 
control passes. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed. The excess of the cost of the acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. All accounting policies 
are applied consistently throughout the Group companies. 
Going concern
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
with the assistance of its bank facilities. The Group’s forecasts 
and projections take account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance and show that the Group should be able to 
operate within the level of its current facilities, meet future debt 
repayments and continue to comply with its banking covenants 
for at least the next 12 months.
At 31 December 2017, the Group had cash balances of £5.6m 
and undrawn committed financing facilities of £9.0m with a 
further £5.0m of uncommitted financing. In their consideration 
of going concern, the Directors have reviewed the Group’s future 
cash forecasts and profit projections, which are based on past 
experience and the projected opening programme of an average 
of two new centres per annum. Taking the above into consideration 
and also the principal risks, the Directors consider it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
Financial Statements. The Directors have made this assessment 
after consideration of the annual budgeted cash flows and related 
assumptions, and in accordance with the FRC’s Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting.
Statement of compliance
Both the company financial statements and the Group 
financial statements have been prepared and approved by the 
Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (“Adopted IFRSs”), 
IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under Adopted IFRS. Adopted 
IFRSs are subject to an ongoing process of review and endorsement 
by the European Commission and amendment and interpretation 
by the IASB.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements requires the use 
of accounting estimates, and requires management to exercise 
judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
Accounting estimates are based on historical experience and various 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form 
the basis of making the judgements about the carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. 
74 | Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Statement of accounting policies 
continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Actual results may differ from these estimates and the estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in 
which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision 
affects both the current and future periods.
Intangible assets and tangible property, plant and equipment 
These assets are affected by impairment assessments and estimates 
of value in use and residual value. The calculation of value in use 
is based on pre-tax cash flow projections from the financial budgets 
approved by the Board covering a one-year period and extrapolated 
by management using an estimated medium-term growth rate for 
a further two years. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are 
extrapolated over the life of the lease relating to that site at the 
estimated long-term growth rate, extended by 15 years for short 
leasehold premises in England and Wales where the provisions 
of the Landlord and Tenants Act apply and the Company has the 
right and expects to extend the lease on expiry, or over 50 years 
for a long leasehold or freehold site. The pre-tax discount rate 
applied to the cash flow projections approximates the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital, adjusted only to reflect the way 
in which the market would assess the specific risks associated with 
the estimated cash flows of the bowling businesses and to exclude 
any risks that are not relevant to estimated cash flows of the 
bowling businesses, or for which they have already been adjusted.
The effect of varying the key assumptions in the goodwill and 
tangible property, plant and equipment impairment calculations 
is presented in note 13.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 requires assets and liabilities acquired to be recorded 
at fair value and to separately identify intangible assets from 
goodwill. There is judgement involved in estimating fair value, 
which requires the Directors to estimate the useful economic life 
of each asset and the future cash flows expected to arise from 
each asset and to apply a suitable discount rate. 
Onerous lease provisions
Onerous lease provisions are made where the future minimum 
contractual payments exceed the future cash flows expected to 
be generated by the relevant site. The assessment of expected 
further cash flows and the discount rate used requires estimation.
The cash flow projections are calculated on the same basis as 
those for the assessment of impairment of intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment as outlined above. 
Deferred tax
Estimation is required of temporary differences between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences but, where deductible temporary differences exist, 
management’s judgement is required as to whether a deferred 
tax asset should be recognised based on the availability of future 
taxable profits. The deferred tax assets actually recoverable may 
differ from the amounts recognised if actual taxable profits differ 
from management’s estimates.
Share based payments
The estimation requires the selection of an appropriate valuation 
model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation 
model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that 
will ultimately vest, inputs for which arise from judgements relating 
to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of the Executive Directors, as 
detailed in note 27.
Non-GAAP performance measures
The Group has identified certain measures that it believes will 
assist in the understanding of the performance of the business. 
The measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be 
directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. 
The non-IFRS measures are not intended to be a substitute for an 
IFRS performance measure but the business has included them as 
it considers them to be important comparables and key measures 
used within the business for assessing performance. These financial 
statements make reference to the following non-IFRS measures:
Group adjusted EBITDA – This consists of earnings before 
interest, taxation, depreciation amortisation costs, exceptional 
items, profit or loss on disposal of assets, adjustments to onerous 
lease and impairment provisions and derecognition of finance leases. 
The reconciliation to operating profit is included on note 2.
Adjusted underlying profit after tax – This consists of the profit 
after tax adjusted for exceptional items, profit or loss on disposal 
of assets, amortisation of acquisition intangibles, shareholder loan 
note interest, adjustments to onerous lease and impairment provisions 
and derecognition of finance leases. The reconciliation of this number 
to profit after tax is included under note 2.
Financial statements | 75 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Non-GAAP performance measures continued
Exceptional costs – Exceptional items are those significant items 
which management considers to be one-off and non-recurring. 
The separate reporting of these per note 6 helps to provide a 
better indication of underlying performance.
Like-for-like sales – These are a measure of growth of sales adjusted 
for new or divested sites over a comparable trading period.
Revenue
Revenue represents the total amounts earned from customers 
from bowling, food, beverage, machines and amusements, together 
with any other goods and services delivered in the normal course 
of business, net of VAT. The Group recognises revenue when the 
amount of revenue can be reliably measured, when it is probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and in the 
case of bowling, when the game has been played. All deposits 
paid in advance for a game of bowling that has yet to be played 
are accounted for as deferred revenue under current liabilities 
until the game is played, upon which it is recognised as revenue. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately 
disclosed by virtue of their size or nature to enable full understanding 
of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may 
give rise to exceptional items include, but are not limited to, gains 
or losses on disposal of assets, legal and professional fees from 
corporate transactions and costs associated with subsidiary and 
new site acquisitions such as professional and legal fees, taxes 
and redundancy costs. Professional fees, taxes and other costs 
arising on re-gears are treated as exceptional as they are believed to 
be one-off in nature and arising as the property market adjusts to 
the performances of companies in the wider entertainment industry.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition of a 
subsidiary or business combination over the fair value of the Group’s 
share of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is carried at 
cost less impairment, and is tested annually for impairment, or earlier if 
circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Excess of 
acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of acquiree’s identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost arising on acquisition 
is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill is not allocated to individual cash-generating units 
(“CGUs”) as the Group considers that the synergies arising 
from each acquisition benefit the Group as a whole rather than 
individual sites and monitors goodwill in aggregate for internal 
purposes. Therefore, for goodwill impairment testing, the CGUs 
are aggregated into a single group.
Software
Software costs are capitalised and amortised over their estimated 
useful lives of up to three years. All software has been purchased 
and generated externally.
Customer lists
Customer lists are recognised at fair value on acquisition 
of subsidiaries and are amortised over the years from which 
their expected benefits are determined to be recognised in the 
income statement to nil over a five-year period with the rate 
of amortisation decreasing. 
Favourable leases
Favourable leases are recognised at fair value on acquisition 
of subsidiaries and are amortised over the period of the lease. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment in value with property, plant and 
equipment acquired in a business combination recognised at their 
fair value. Cost of assets includes acquisition costs net of VAT, as 
well as other directly attributable costs in bringing the asset into a 
working condition. Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the 
cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line 
basis over its expected useful economic life. The principal useful 
lives used for this purpose are as follows:
Long leasehold premises The shorter of 50 years or their  
 estimated useful lives
Short leasehold premises Their estimated useful lives
Fixtures, fittings and equipment Between three and 40 years
Amusement machines Four years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until 
they are brought into use. As required by IAS 16, property, plant 
and equipment’s expected useful life and residual values are 
reviewed annually. Residual value is calculated based upon 
prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Statement of accounting policies 
continued Impairment of assets
At each reporting date, all assets are considered for evidence 
of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment, the 
Group carries out an impairment test by measuring the asset’s 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less 
costs to sell and the value in use. If this recoverable amount is 
below the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income and the asset is written 
down to the recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows arising from the use of the asset 
are discounted to their present value using a discount rate which 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment of the Group’s 
property plant and equipment is assessed at the cash-generating 
unit (“CGU”) level being a bowling site, with goodwill allocated at 
company level and impairment tested for goodwill at company 
level. Impairment losses are charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the period in which they are identified 
and are allocated first to goodwill then to carrying amounts 
of other assets at the CGU level.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect 
of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an 
indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there 
has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the 
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, 
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Property disposals
Disposals of properties and any resultant gain or loss on disposal 
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income once 
all conditions of the sale contract become unconditional.
Business combinations
The purchase of a company or bowling site being a group of inputs 
and processes capable of generating profits is accounted for as a 
business combination. Business combinations are accounted for 
using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration 
for a business combination is measured at fair value on the date 
of acquisition with the assets acquired and liabilities incurred measured 
at fair value on exchange. Goodwill is recognised as the surplus 
of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
and is accounted for as per the accounting policy on goodwill.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with 
business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Management judgements are made in the measurement of fair 
values to the net assets acquired in a business combination in 
particular the customer lists, inventories and property, plant 
and equipment acquired. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is calculated as cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis 
based on normal levels of activity. Net realisable value is based on 
estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred 
to completion and disposal which is the same method used to fair 
value the inventory on a business combination. Provision is made 
for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value 
and then subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial assets
The Group classifies its financial assets as either at fair value 
through profit and loss (all of which were designated as such 
upon recognition) or as loans and receivables. There are no 
financial assets held as available for sale. Loans and receivables 
including non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments are classified as “trade and other receivables” in the 
balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call 
deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form 
an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as 
a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the 
statement of cash flows while being included in financial liabilities 
for the balance sheet.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value 
with attributable debt issue costs capitalised. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised 
cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Financial statements | 77 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc Debt issue costs
Issue costs of debt such as bank arrangement fees and legal fees 
incurred in arranging debt are capitalised under non-current 
other receivables and are amortised in the statement of 
comprehensive income on an effective interest rate method.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value 
and subsequently held at amortised cost.
Shareholder loan notes
Shareholder loan notes were £1 principal amount, unsecured, 
10% interest-bearing notes which were listed on the Channel Island 
Securities Exchange (“CISE”). Interest is capitalised on 31 December 
each year with an equivalent in loan notes being issued, listed 
and bearing interest. These were redeemed for shares as detailed 
in note 20. 
Leases
Costs incurred in respect of operating leases are charged to 
the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as 
an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of the Group’s 
short-term property leases are treated as operating leases.
Finance lease arrangements, which transfer substantially all 
of the benefits and risks of ownership of the related property 
and machines to the Group, are treated as if the property and 
machines had been acquired. The properties and machines are 
included in property, plant and equipment, classified as long 
leasehold premises for the properties and amusement machines 
for the machines. The capital element of the leasing commitment 
is shown as a finance lease obligation in liabilities. Lease rentals 
are separated into capital and interest elements, with the capital 
element applied to reduce the finance lease obligation and the 
interest element charged to finance costs in the statement 
of comprehensive income, so as to give a constant periodic rate 
of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation outstanding 
at each accounting period end. The properties and amusement 
machines are depreciated in accordance with the accounting 
policy for property, plant and equipment.
Lease incentives
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental 
expense over the term of the lease. These are amortised 
on a straight-line basis.
Onerous lease commitments
Provisions are recognised for the present value of onerous leases 
and vacant properties, calculated as the expected net cash out 
flows over the remaining life of the lease, discounted at a pre-tax 
rate which reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the liability. Notional interest is 
charged in respect of the unwinding of the discount.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension plan. 
The Group pays contributions to privately administered pension 
insurance plans on a mandatory basis. The Company has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been 
paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit 
expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as the result of a past event 
and it is both probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation 
can be reliably estimated. Where the Group expects to be reimbursed 
for an outflow of resources associated with a provision, for example 
under an insurance contract, the expected reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement 
is virtually certain. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are calculated by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, 
the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the unwinding of the discount 
over time is charged to finance costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Tax
The tax charge comprises current tax payable and deferred tax. 
The current tax charge represents an estimate of the tax payable 
in respect of the Group’s taxable profits and is based on an 
interpretation of existing tax laws.
As required by IAS 12 (revised), the Group provides deferred income 
tax using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary 
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying values at the balance sheet date. Deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities so recognised are determined using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date and are based on the expected manner of realisation 
or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities.
78 | Financial statements
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc
Statement of accounting policies 
continued Tax continued
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax 
is not recognised in respect of the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability acquired in a transaction which is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction does not affect 
accounting or taxable profits.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation 
authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities 
where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Segment reporting
The Group’s segments (distinguishable components of the Group 
that are engaged either in providing products or services) are its 
tenpin bowling operations and its central management. The Group 
wholly operates within the UK. The Group has identified the Board 
of Directors as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”).
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Share premium arises on 
the excess between the fair value of the shares issued and the par 
value of the shares issued and the existing shares issued have 
none. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
against share premium.
Share based payments
Performance Share Plans (“PSPs”) for its Executive Directors are 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. 
The value of the awards is measured at fair value at the date of the 
grant and recognised as an expense. The total amount expensed 
is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted 
including any market performance conditions. The cost of the 
transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase 
in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are 
fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant Directors 
become fully entitled to the award.

Notes to the financial statements
for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 2 Alternative performance measures – non-GAAP measures
The Group has identified certain measures that it believes will assist 
in the understanding of the performance of the business. The 
measures are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly 
comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. The non-IFRS 
measures are not intended to be a substitute for an IFRS performance 
measure but the business has included them as it considers them 
to be important comparables and key measures used within the 
business for assessing performance. These financial statements 
make reference to the following non-IFRS measures:
Group adjusted EBITDA – This consists of earnings before interest, 
taxation, depreciation and amortisation costs, exceptional items, 
profit or loss on disposal of assets, adjustment to onerous lease 
and impairment provisions and derecognition of finance leases.

Adjusted underlying profit after tax – This consists of the profit 
after tax adjusted for exceptional items, profit or loss on disposal 
of assets, amortisation of acquisitions intangibles, shareholder loan 
note interest, adjustments to onerous lease and impairment provisions 
and derecognition of finance leases. The reconciliation of this 
number to profit after tax is included under note 9.
Exceptional costs – Exceptional items are those significant items 
which management considers to be one-off and non-recurring. 
The separate reporting of these per note 6 helps to provide a 
better indication of underlying performance.
Proforma sales – This consists of the sales for the 52-week 
period to 1 January 2017 representing weeks 2 to 53 of FY16. 
This number will exclude the sales for week 1 which is the week 
ending 3 January 2016 which is the most comparable to the 53rd 
week included in the FY16 results. This has been done to provide 
a more useful comparative to understand the underlying trading 
performance for the 52 weeks to 31 December 2017.
Like-for-like sales – These are a measure of growth of sales 
adjusted for new or divested sites over a comparable trading period.
3 Group reorganisation
On 12 April 2017 as part of the Offer and Admission of the ordinary 
share capital of the Company to the premium segment of the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, a Group reorganisation 
was carried out resulting in the Company becoming the ultimate 
holding company of the Group. The steps carried out on 12 April 2017 
and their impact on the financial statements are as follows:
Capitalisation of shareholder loan notes
Indoor Bowling Equity Limited shareholders converted their 
holding of £43,586,573 shareholder loan notes for 824,253 shares 
at a nominal value of £1 increasing the number of issued shares 
to 2,028,175. A share premium reserve of £42,762,320 was 
recognised for the difference in the value of the issued shares 
swapped for the shareholder loan notes.
Share for share exchange – acquisition of TEG Holdings Limited 
by Ten Entertainment Group plc
The Company acquired the entire share capital of TEG Holdings 
Limited with the consideration being the issue and allotment of 
shares in the Company. The Company issued 64,901,400 shares at 
£0.01 each as consideration for the entire holding in TEG Holdings 
Limited. The investment in TEG Holdings Limited was £38,914,665 
with the excess over the value of the issued shares being 
£38,265,649 and accounted for in the merger reserve account. 
The Company allotted a further 98,400 shares to bring the share 
capital to 65,000,000 shares immediately prior to the issue of the 
prospectus on 12 April 2017. 
Admission 
On 12 April 2017 the Company announced its Initial Public Offering 
(“IPO”) of 65,000,000 shares, including 16,250,000 shares in the 
capital of the Company (offered at a price of 165p per share by certain 
discretionary investment management and/or advisory clients 
of Harwood Capital LLP, the Executive Directors and Nick Basing) 
representing 25% of the Company’s issued ordinary shares on 
Admission. The Company was admitted to the premium segment 
of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 19 April 2017.
Financial statements | 81 
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc 3 Group reorganisation continued
Capital reduction
Subsequent to the IPO, on 7 June 2017 shareholders of the 
Company approved a special resolution for the reduction of its 
share capital, which involved the capitalisation of £38,265,649.03 
of the merger reserve into new B ordinary shares and the reduction 
in full of these B ordinary shares to distributable reserves. As the 
Company is a publicly listed entity, this process required approval 
by a court order. On 28 June 2017 the High Court of England and 
Wales confirmed the reduction of 38,265,649 B ordinary shares which 
was registered at Companies House on 28 June 2017. The effect 
of the reduction and cancellation is to create distributable reserves 
to support the Board’s future dividend policy.

(1)  Professional fees and other one-off costs have been on corporate-related transactions undertaken by the Group and redundancy costs.
(2)  Loss on disposals includes £282k of bowling equipment disposed of at the sites where Pins & Strings have been implemented and thus have replaced the bowling 
machinery which is now redundant. The Group anticipates that it will continue to roll out Pins & Strings across the entire estate over a period of a further three years; 
this will result in around a further £1.4m write-off of bowling equipment.
(3)  Professional fees, taxes and other costs arising on lease re-gears are treated as exceptional as they are believed to be one-off in nature at a site level. These costs 
are currently arising as the Group looks to take advantage of changes in the property market which have made Tenpin an attractive tenant for landlords. It is anticipated 
that the Group will continue to look to continue to take advantage of the changes in market conditions and could incur further re-gear costs through its exceptional 
items over the next two to three-year period.

The Finance Bill 2015 included legislation to reduce the main

1 April 2017, 1 April 2018 and 1 April 2019, and to 17% for the 
financial year beginning 1 April 2020. These changes had been 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently 
are included in these financial statements by using a blend rate 
of 19% which has been used to determine the overall net deferred 
tax liability, as the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
at the various rates over those periods.
9 Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share for each period is calculated by dividing 
the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. 
Earnings per share is based on the capital structure of the Company 
and includes the weighted average of the 65,000,000 ordinary 
shares issued upon the Admission of the Company on 19 April 2017. 
The total shares in issue at the end of the 52-week period were 
65,000,000. The weighted average number of shares for the 
preceding periods has been stated as if the Group share for share 
exchange had occurred at 27 December 2015.
The Company has 79,153 potentially issuable shares (2016: nil), 
all of which relate to share options issued to Directors of the 
Company. Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated 
by dividing profit for the year and total comprehensive income 
attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year 
together with the dilutive number of ordinary shares. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share has been calculated in 
order to compare earnings per share year on year and to aid 
future comparisons. Earnings has been adjusted to exclude IPO 
expenses, share based payments and other one-off costs (and any 
associated impact on the taxation charge). Adjusted diluted earnings 
per share is calculated by applying the same adjustments to earnings 
as described in relation to adjusted earnings per share divided by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during 
the year adjusted by the effect of the outstanding share options.

10 Business combinations
As part of the Group’s strategy to grow and expand, the following 
sites were acquired as part of a business combination.
Business combination – Eastbourne
On 21 February 2017, the Group acquired the assets and trade 
of the Eastbourne bowling site known as The Lanes, part of the 
David Lloyd Leisure Centre. The Group entered into a Business 
Purchase Agreement with David Lloyd Leisure Limited and 
acquired the assets for £1.5m.
The table below summarises the consideration paid for the 
acquisition, the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed on the date of acquisition:
Consideration as at 21 February 2017 £000
Cash consideration paid 1,538
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
Inventory 21
Property, plant and equipment 467
Cash and cash equivalents 6
Deferred tax liabilities (67)
Other assets and liabilities, net 23
Total identifiable net assets 450
Goodwill 1,088
Total 1,538
Acquisition-related costs of £0.1m have been charged to 
administrative expenses. Food and bar stocks were initially 
recognised with a step up in value from their historical cost 
of £0.02m which was expensed when the inventories were sold. 
Property, plant and equipment fair values were determined 
internally looking at the market prices for the acquired assets 
and for similarly aged assets elsewhere in the Company’s business 
which resulted in a step up from the assets book values of £0.4m 
which will be depreciated over five years. Deferred tax liabilities 
were recognised on the fair values of assets acquired and their 
tax bases which will be released as the related fair value measurement 
differences are recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income. Since the date of the business combination the site 
generated £1.1m of sales and made EBITDA of £0.3m which has 
been included in the statement of comprehensive income. As part 
of the due diligence, the sales and profit numbers prior to acquisition 
from the seller’s management accounts were reviewed including 
the period from 2 January 2017 to the date of acquisition. As they 
had not been audited they are not reflected here to provide a guide 
to potential full-year performance. The goodwill is made up of the 
expected benefits to arise from Tenpinisation of the site’s operations 
and processes under the management of the Tenpin brand. None of 
the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Business combination – Rochdale
On 26 June 2017, the Group acquired the assets and trade of the 
Rochdale bowling site known as Sandbrooke Leisure. The Group 
entered into a Business Transfer Agreement with Sandbrooke 
Leisure Limited and acquired the assets for £1.0m.
The table below summarises the consideration paid for the 
acquisition, the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed on the date of acquisition:
Consideration as at 26 June 2017 £000
Cash consideration paid 1,056
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
Inventory 16
Property, plant and equipment 543

over five years. Deferred tax liabilities were recognised on the fair values of assets acquired and their tax bases which will be released as 
the related fair value measurement differences are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Since the date of the business 
combination the site generated £0.6m of sales and made EBITDA of £0.1m which has been included in the statement of comprehensive 
income. As part of the due diligence, the sales and profit numbers prior to acquisition from the seller’s management accounts were 
reviewed including the period from 2 January 2017 to the date of acquisition. Due to not having access to the information they are not 
reflected here to provide a guide to potential full-year performance. The goodwill is made up of the expected benefits to arise from 
Tenpinisation of the site’s operations and processes under the management of the Tenpin brand. None of the goodwill is expected to 
be deductible for tax purposes.
The acquisition of the site in Blackburn was not deemed to be a business combination per IFRS 3 but the acquisition of assets as per IAS 16 
Property, Plant and Equipment.

for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 11 Goodwill and intangible assets continued
Goodwill is tested for impairment at each financial year end based on the recoverable amount of each CGU. The overall process for testing 
impairment follows the same methodology as detailed in note 12 for property, plant and equipment. Due to the strong performance 
of the Group, there is significant headroom before any goodwill would become impaired. As part of the business combination accounting 
for the acquisition of Essenden Limited in 2015, the fair value of customer lists, rebate contracts and the Tenpin Limited website were 
recognised and will be amortised over the period for which the benefits are expected to be recognised. The goodwill acquired during 
the period arose on the business combination of the site in Eastbourne on 21 February 2017 and Rochdale on 26 June 2017 as detailed 
in note 10. The amortisation charged on the above intangible assets is included in other administrative expenses in the statement 
of comprehensive income.

Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. The recoverable amount of each CGU (each of the 
40 (2016: 38) sites open as at the period end has been treated as a CGU) has been calculated as the higher of its value in use and its fair 
value less cost to sell. The calculation of value in use is based on pre-tax cash flow projections from the financial budgets approved 
by the Board covering a one-year period and extrapolated by management using an estimated medium-term growth rate for a further 
two years. Cash flows beyond this three-year period are extrapolated over the life of the lease relating to that site, extended by 15 years 
(for non-onerous sites) for short leasehold premises in England and Wales where the provisions of the Landlord and Tenants Act apply 
and the Company has the right and expects to extend the lease on expiry, or over 50 years for a long leasehold or freehold site. 
The key assumptions of the value in use calculation are:
31 December
2017
1 January
2017
Period on which management approved forecasts are based 3 years 3 years
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 2% 2%
Pre-tax discount rate 12.6% 12.9%
The budgets which underlie the calculations are compiled on a site by site basis, with gross margin, staff cost, property cost and other 
operating profit assumptions being based on past performance and known factors specific to that site which are expected by management 
to affect future performance, to reflect the operating circumstances and risks relevant to each part of the business. They also include 
an allocation of central overheads which are allocated across the sites based on turnover. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash 
flow projections approximates the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted only to reflect the way in which the market would 
assess the specific risks associated with the estimated cash flows of the bowling businesses and to exclude any risks that are not relevant 
to estimated cash flows of the bowling businesses, or for which they have already been adjusted. This pre-tax discount rate has been 
benchmarked against the discount rates applied by other companies in the leisure sector.

for the 52-week period ended 31 December 2017 13 Property, plant and equipment continued
The key assumptions to which the calculation is sensitive remain the future trading performance and the growth rate that is expected 
of each site, which have a similar effect on the quantum of the onerous lease provision as the discount rate assumed. If the sales in the 
budgets which underlie the calculations were reduced by 5%, reducing the cash flows of the bowls by 4%, the onerous lease charge would 
increase by £0.0m (2016: £0.2m). If the pre-tax discount rate applied in the calculations is increased by 1%, the impairment charge increases 
by £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). For the calculation of fair value less cost to sell, management has assumed that each Tenpin Limited business 
could be sold for a multiple of 5x EBITDA (2016: 5x EBITDA).
The depreciation and impairment charges are recognised in administrative expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Bank borrowings are secured on property, plant and equipment for the value of £20.0m (2016: £20.0m). Properties held under finance 
leases had a net book value of £0.2m (2016: £0.2m) and the finance lease depreciation charged in the period was £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). 
Amusement machines held under finance leases had a net book value of £3.9m (2016: £4.0m) and the finance lease depreciation 
charged in the period was £1.9m (2016: £1.7m).

The share capital of the Group is represented by the share capital of the company, Ten Entertainment Group plc, which was 
incorporated on 15 March 2017. Prior to this the share capital of the Group was represented by the share capital of the previous 
parent, Indoor Bowling Equity Limited.
However, as stated in the statement of accounting policies on page 73, the principles of predecessor accounting have been applied with 
these financial statements and, therefore, the comparative share capital of the Group has been adjusted as if the Group had always existed. 
The basis of preparation included in the statement of accounting policies includes a reconciliation of the prior years shares and reserves 
to the opening shares and reserves included in the statement of changes in equity.
The shares confer on each holder the right to attend, speak and vote at all the meetings of the Company with one vote per ordinary 
share on a poll or written resolution.

Notional interest on unwinding of discount 42
At 31 December 2017 – current 70
At 31 December 2017 – non-current 361
The provision for onerous leases comprises provision for the onerous element of the property leases on certain trading units, covering 
the expected period of the onerous commitment. As the provision is based on the future budgeted trading performance of the bowling 
centres subject to the onerous leases the amount and timing of the related cash outflows is sensitive to future variances in EBITDA from 
those budgets. If the pre-tax discount rate of 12.6% (2016: 12.9%) applied in the calculations is increased or decreased by 1%, the onerous 
lease provision will increase or decrease by £0.0m (2016: £0.1m). In calculating the future budgeted trading performance, central 
overheads are allocated to the CGUs based on turnover. 
The provision is expected to unwind as follows:

can be utilised. No deferred tax asset has been provided for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2017 on the losses other 
than that for the rollover relief. A 1% change in the corporation tax rate would cause a £0.1m (2016: £0.1m) change in the value of the 
deferred tax liability.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Ten Entertainment Group plc 23 Deferred tax continued
The Group has carry-forward tax losses of an estimated £27.3m 
(2016: £21.7m). Of these, £nil (2016: £nil) are held by Tenpin Limited, 
£12.6m (2016: £12.2m) held by Essenden Limited, £8.7m (2016: £8.7m) 
held by Georgica Limited, £0.8m (2016: £0.3m) held by Indoor 
Bowling Equity Limited, £2.1m (2016: £0.5m) held by Indoor Bowling 
Acquisitions Limited, £nil (2016: £nil) held by Georgica Holdings 
Limited, £0.3m (2016: £nil) held by TEG Holdings Limited and 
£2.8m (2016: £nil) held by Ten Entertainment Group plc. All of the 
Tenpin Limited losses have been utilised. The losses in Essenden 
Limited, Georgica Limited, Indoor Bowling Equity Limited, 
Indoor Bowling Acquisitions Limited, Georgica Holdings Limited, 
TEG Holdings Limited and Ten Entertainment Group plc have not 
been recognised as these companies are not currently generating 
profits for which these losses can be utilised. The potential deferred 
tax asset of £5.2m (2016: £4.1m) on these losses is the only 
unprovided deferred tax. A deferred tax asset has been recognised 
on the £0.8m (2016: £0.8m) in capital allowances in Georgica Limited 
which can be group relieved across to Tenpin Limited. This asset 
is netted off against the deferred tax liability recognised on the 
difference between the tax and accounting base of the capital 
allowances in Tenpin Limited of £9.5m (2016: £9.2m). The £3.7m 
(2016: £3.7m) of capital losses from disposals of the CVA sites has 
generated a deferred tax asset equivalent to the rollover relief 
liability carried under Tenpin Limited as these two tax balances 
have right of set off.
24 Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, 
cash and short-term deposits and are held in Sterling. The purpose 
of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such 
as trade receivables, trade payables and finance leases that arise 
directly from its operations. All the Group’s financial instruments 
are denominated in Pound Sterling. The carrying value of all the 
Group’s financial instruments approximates fair value and they 
are classified as loans and receivables with the financial liabilities 
measured at amortised cost.

Financial risk management
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such 
as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, 
will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings 
of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management 
is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group borrows in Sterling at floating rates of interest. 
The interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities 
gross of debt issue costs was as follows:
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities

2017

Floating rate financial liabilities 6,000 12,906
Finance leases 4,245 5,149
Payment in kind notes — 42,435
Financial liabilities on which 
no interest is paid 430 1,870
10,675 62,360
Cash flow interest rate risk derives from the Group’s floating rate 
financial liabilities, being its bank debt and overdraft facility, which 
are linked to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.75%. The Group has no fair 
value interest rate risk. The average period to the expected maturity 
date of the interest-free financial liabilities, being the onerous lease 
provisions, is 12 years. In managing interest rate risk the Group aims 
to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s 
earnings. Over the longer term, however, sustained changes in 
interest rates would have an impact on the Group’s earnings. A 1% 
increase in the current interest rate charged on the bank loans 
would decrease earnings by £0.1m (2016: £0.1m). The bulk of the 
finance lease liability is for amusement machines and there is no 
actual interest charge on the arrangement with the supplier.

Credit risk
As almost all of the Group’s sales are for cash, the Group is exposed 
to minimal credit risk. The receivables mainly relate to rebate income 
or vouchers sold and are from companies with strong credit histories 
and good credit ratings and thus none are classified as past due 
or impaired.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s cash position and cash flow forecasts are reviewed 
by management on a daily basis. The current bank facilities consist 
of a £15m RCF and a £5m uncommitted Accordion facility.

Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objectives are to ensure the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide an 
adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services 
commensurate with the level of risk. The Group has declared a 
final dividend of 7p having paid an interim dividend of 3p resulting 
in a dividend of 10p per share amounting to £6.5m as a return 
to shareholders in the Group’s first year as a public company. 
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount 
of equity less cash and cash equivalents as presented on the 
face of the consolidated balance sheet.

Tenpin Limited had 40 (2016: 38) bowling venues open as at the 
year end with one under finance lease and 39 held on operating 
leases, all with less than 25 years to run. The majority of the leases 
are in England and Wales (two in Scotland), and the provision of 
the Landlord and Tenants Act giving the tenant the right to extend 
the lease by 15 years on expiry applies in most cases.

27 Performance Share Plan 
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) for 
its Executive Directors. In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based 
Payments, the value of the awards is measured at fair value at the 
date of the grant. The fair value is written off on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, based on management’s estimate of the 
number of shares that will eventually vest. In accordance with the 
PSP scheme announced on 22 May 2017, the vesting of these awards 
is conditional upon the achievement of two performance conditions 
which will be measured following the announcement of results 
for the year to 31 December 2019 (“FY19”). 
The first performance condition applying to the awards will be 
based on earnings per share of the Company (“EPS”) and will apply 
to 50% of the total number of share awards granted.
The second performance condition will be based on T otal Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) of the Company over the period from the date of grant 
to the announcement of results for FY19 relative to a comparator 
group of companies and will apply to the remaining 50% of share 
awards granted.
The assumptions used in the calculation of share based payments 
are as follows:
• an expected term for awards granted under the PSP as being 
three years from the date of grant on the basis that these are 
nil-cost awards and therefore we assume that participants will 
exercise their options as soon as possible to benefit from full 
shareholder rights (e.g. voting and sale rights);
• the risk-free rate has been based on the implied yield  
of zero-coupon UK Government bonds (UK Strips) with 
a remaining term equal to the expected term;
• expected dividend yield is 6.33%; and
• the expected volatility is based on historical daily data over 
a term commensurate with the expected life of the awards.
The models and model inputs are as follows:

Risk-free rate n/a 0.10%

Expected volatility n/a 27.03%
Fair value of one share (£) 1.39 0.81
During the period ended 31 December 2017, 739,393 share awards 
were granted under the PSP . For this grant, the Company recognised 
a charge of £87,069. These are equity-settled share based payments 
and the remaining contractual life of the share options at the period 
end is two years and six months.
