Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 01 About Energean
Leading E&P player in the  
Eastern Mediterranean
Energean’s operations began when the Group acquired the Prinos 
licences, offshore North East Greece, in 2007. At the time, 
these licences contained 2 mmboe of audited 2P reserves.  
Ten years later, the Group has built up a balanced portfolio 
of producing and development assets, containing a total of 
51 MMbbls of oil 2P reserves in Greece; 1.2 Tcf of natural gas 
2C resources in Israel; and 39.4 MMbbls of oil 2C resources in 
both countries. Energean is committed to realising the significant 
growth potential of its development and exploration projects, 
such as the Karish and Tanin fields, offshore Israel, and other 
licence blocks in Greece and Montenegro.

02 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 03 Chairman’s statement
Embarking on an exciting  
chapter in our history
Dear Shareholder,
I was delighted to join the Board of Energean as Chairman in 
July 2017. Since then, I have been impressed by how much the 
Company has achieved in a few months in running the day-to-day 
business, making significant progress on both the Karish and 
Tanin project and the Prinos Basin expansion, and, most recently, 
becoming a Premium Listed Company on the London Stock 
Exchange (‘LSE’) in March 2018, the first significant European oil 
and gas E&P listing since 2014 and the largest ever primary raise 
for a Premium-Listed E&P company on the LSE. 
These achievements are driven by a strong corporate culture 
and an equally strong health, safety and environmental (‘HSE’) 
focus, backed by a professional management team. The staff 
of Energean are determined to make the Company the leading 
independent operator in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Our Board and Management are focused on this goal and are 
committed to achieving it while delivering value for shareholders 
and stakeholders.
OurBoardandgovernance
Our Board was chosen to ensure that, as a fast-growing public 
Company, Energean demonstrates best practice governance 
standards and provides sound stewardship. 
We are fortunate to have deep sector, financial, HSE and 
capital markets expertise on the Board to guide the Company 
going forward.
As a Premium Listed Company, the Board will comply with 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have appointed audit, 
risk, governance and remuneration committees to safeguard 
shareholders’ interests and provide a strong governance 
framework. 
Our people
The depth and breadth of skills across our technical, engineering, 
geological and financial teams and wider workforce, enables 
us to be agile in our decision making and to deliver our growth 
projects while remaining open to future opportunities. 
Energean’s management team has over 200 years’ combined 
experience in the oil and gas industry encompassing a broad 
range of projects, asset types (including offshore, shallow and 
deepwater), and exploration and production technology. Our 
senior management team are also significant shareholders in 
the business and are therefore fully aligned with the interests  
of other shareholders. 
All the Company’s staff have worked with dedication and 
commitment over the last few months to deliver the IPO and  
our new projects. I am very grateful to them all for everything  
they have done.
Dividendpolicy
We are in a growth phase and our investors have bought into 
an ambitious, fast-moving Company in an exciting region. We 
therefore do not anticipate that the Company will pay a dividend 
until the Karish and Tanin development is completed. Until then, 
any earnings will be reinvested in developing the businesses 
of the Group. The Board will review how it provides returns to 
shareholders regularly and will take a prudent approach that has 
regard to the level of profit generated by the Group’s operations 
and the funding requirements for our operations and exploration 
and development programmes.
Thefuture
We have a clear and substantially de-risked pathway to 
production growth ahead of us with the Karish and Tanin, 
Prinos Basin and Katakolo development programmes. 
Our portfolio offers both near-term value delivery, significant 
mid-term value and longer-term potential upside from which 
we are well-positioned to benefit. I look forward to reporting 
on further progress over the coming year. 
SimonHeale

A sustainable growth story
Mathios Rigas
ChiefExecutiveOfficer
A new era...
When Energean was established in 2007, it was with a clear 
vision to build the leading independent E&P company in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. We saw a region which had been 
overlooked and under-exploited by the international oil and gas 
majors, and one that would inevitably need more gas 
development to cater for growing demand for cleaner energy 
in the surrounding states.
The past decade has been one of considerable growth, learning, 
investment and achievement for Energean.
We are embarking on a new era for the Company and for the 
emerging oil and gas industry in the Eastern Mediterranean – 
a region which could soon become a globally significant gas hub.
Since 2008, we have steadily expanded our operating footprint 
from one country to four; from two licences in Greece to 
13 licences in the Eastern Mediterranean; and from 2 mmboe (2P) 
reserves in our Prinos licence to 51 mmboe (2P) reserves and 
339 mmboe (2C) resources across our portfolio. In a very short 
period, we have taken the prospective Karish and Tanin gas fields, 
offshore Israel, from acquisition in December 2016, through 
a Field Development Plan (FDP) and financing, to a Final 
Investment Decision (FID). This is a remarkable achievement, 
of which we are very proud.
Advancingourflagshipproject: 
Karish and Tanin
Having signed 12 Long Term Gas Sales & Purchase Agreements 
with the leading Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and 
industrial companies in Israel, we have secured substantial 
revenues underpinning Energean’s performance over the next 
two decades and will meet the Israeli Government’s objectives  
of encouraging competition in the domestic Gas market and 
improving supply security from 2021, when we plan to produce 
first gas from Karish.
Delivering the project on time and on budget has been affirmed 
through an Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Installation 
& Commissioning (EPCIC) turnkey contract, signed with 
TechnipFMC, protecting our shareholders against risks of delays 
and cost overruns.
We have attained the necessary financing to complete our major 
development projects in Israel and Greece, which allowed us to 
take FIDs on both the Karish and Tanin project in Israel and our 
Epsilon development project in Greece.
We are embarking on a 
new era for the Company  
and for the emerging oil  
and gas industry in the 
Eastern Mediterranean.

Successful IPO and project financing
Energean’s Premium Listing on the London Stock Exchange 
in March 2018, raising US$460 million, was a landmark 
accomplishment for the Company. It has effectively reopened 
the upstream IPO market after four years of relative stagnation 
and is a strong indicator that positive sentiment is returning 
to the London oil and gas sector. 
Signing the US$1.275 billion Facility Agreement in the same 
month was a key milestone in financing the development of 
the Karish and Tanin project and testament to the confidence 
placed in us by leading international banks.
Our investment proposition to the London market attracted 
substantial institutional interest, despite challenging market 
conditions. This proposition is characterised by the quality 
of our asset portfolio, our strategic position in the Eastern 
Mediterranean, our offshore experience and our management’s 
track record of value creation.
Our priority now is to deliver significant growth in our first year 
as a listed business.
Our strategy
Our aim is to maximise production, reserves and cash flow from 
our existing low-cost production base, while pursuing sustainable 
growth and returns through active development and exploration 
programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean. We will achieve 
this while maintaining a disciplined financial framework and 
a conservative balance sheet. This strategy is underpinned 
by our key competitive strengths:
 X We are an experienced offshore operator, operating 
the majority of assets in our portfolio
 X We are well-positioned as an independent, Eastern 
Mediterranean E&P to move quickly in an increasingly 
active region
 X We have a track record of value creation through timely 
acquisitions and efficient development
 X We have the depth and diversity across a series of assets at 
various stages of development to position us as a full-cycle, 
sustainable business
 X We have an experienced management team, with an 
international oil industry track record, who are significantly 
invested in Energean
 X We have a strong health and safety track record
 X We have world class industry partners such as TechnipFMC, 
BP and Repsol and strong financial capacity 
1
Maximising output and cash  
flow from our producing assets
The Prinos and Prinos North oil fields, offshore North Eastern 
Greece, are low-cost producing assets that have already delivered 
115 million barrels of oil to date. The Prinos Basin licence was 
acquired in 2007 for US$1.5 million (plus acquired indebtedness). 
Since then, we have secured a 25-year licence extension and  
have increased reserves through the technical reappraisal of the 
reservoir, with a new 3D campaign undertaken in 2015 as well as 
further drilling activity enabling us to implement our fully-funded 
development plan to significantly increase production over the 
next three years. 
Energean’s long track record in the Prinos basin, operatorship 
of the majority of our assets, and low operating costs per barrel, 
underpins our ability to maximise cash flow from our reserves 
and resources. 
Prinosdevelopmentprogramme
In the Prinos Basin, we are delivering an investment plan of 
approximately US$350 million through 2021, which we expect to 
significantly increase production over the next few years, tapping 
the 39.5 MMbbls of discovered 2P oil reserves and 6 Bcf of 2P 
gas in the Prinos, Prinos North and Epsilon oil fields. 
This development plan includes drilling 24 new wells (with eight 
wells already drilled since December 2015); the construction of an 
unmanned platform to exploit the Epsilon field adjacent to Prinos; 
and infill drilling in the existing producing fields.
We regard Prinos as a low-risk development, due to our extensive 
knowledge and experience of the Basin and its geology, the 
secured offtake agreement with BP that will fully cover the 
expected increase in production, and the control we enjoy as 
operator over the related infrastructure.
2
Developing Karish  
and Tanin
Amaterialde-riskedopportunity
Our most significant undeveloped assets are the Karish and Tanin 
gas fields located offshore Israel, which we acquired in December 
2016 for US$148.5 million and which are set to transform our 
business over the next few years. The fields have an estimated 
2.4 Tcf of natural gas and 32.8 MMbbls of condensate and light 
oil (contingent 2C resources) .
At the time of acquisition, Karish and Tanin were stranded 
assets with no gas contracts in place. Along with receiving 
approval of our FDP from the Israeli government in August, 
last year we aimed to secure gas sale and purchase agreements 
with leading industrial companies and power producers in Israel. 
By December 2017, the Company had secured contracts with 12 
leading domestic industrial and independent power producers in 
Israel for the sale of 61 BCM of gas (up to 74 BCM including the OR 
gas supply agreement) over a period of 16 years on a weighted 
average basis. The annual production rate is estimated at 
approximately 4.2 BCM per year on an ACQ basis (up to 5.1 BCM 
per year including the OR gas supply agreement). This was 1.2 
BCM above the amount required to proceed with FID for Karish 
and Tanin and reflects the increasing energy demand in Israel.
Currently discovered 2C discounted cash flows from Karish 
and Tanin equate to an estimated NPV of US$830 million  
net to Energean (70% working interest (WI)) according to the 
NSAI CPR. This uplift in value has been realised in the space  
of 15 months, due to Energean’s ability to execute key project 
milestones quickly and effectively. 
The development of the Karish field, which is fully-funded to 
first gas in 2021, will materially increase the scale of the Group’s 
operations and support Energean’s strategy to become a major 
player in the Eastern Mediterranean gas market. Production from 
Karish will be solely used to supply Israel. Therefore, these assets 
are highly strategic for the development of the Israeli energy 
market and can help to meet increasing Israeli demand, increase 
market competition and improve security of supply. 
We have de-risked the project through a scalable development 
plan. Our new-build FPSO will allow Energean to develop its 
assets in the region and will be available to be used as a tie back 
option for future third party discoveries. The FPSO is currently 
the only such vessel earmarked for operation in the region, 
presenting us with an advantage to quickly capitalise on suitable 
adjacent discoveries.
3
Capitalising on growth opportunities  
in the Eastern Mediterranean
Katakolo
In addition to the Prinos Basin, we are also advancing the 
development of Katakolo in Western Greece in 2018, which 
we received government approval to develop in 2017 and which 
holds 10.5 MMbbls of 2P oil reserves and 6.2 Bcf of 2C gas 
resources. On approval of an Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessment, we expect to take our FID on the project in the 
second half of 2018, and drill the first pilot well in the second 
half of 2019. First oil is expected in 2020.
Exploration prospects
Energean has a focused exploration strategy with several 
exploration prospects in Greece, Montenegro and Israel. Our 
strategy revolves around identifying and exploring undeveloped 
areas where we have technical experience of similar geologies 
to minimise exploration risk. Our exploration portfolio has best 
estimate unrisked prospective resources of 3.1 Tcf of natural 
gas and 375.3 MMbbls of liquids. 
We deploy a controlled approach to managing exploration risk. 
This is evidenced in our two onshore Greek exploration assets, 
Aitoloakarnania and Ioannina, which we recently farmed out 
to Repsol as operator (60% WI), and who will carry 90% of the 
exploration costs. 
In March 2017, Energean signed a concession contract to explore 
blocks 26 and 30 offshore Montenegro, which hold best estimate 
unrisked prospective resources of 1.8 Tcf of natural gas and 
143.9 MMbbls of liquids. While the Eastern Adriatic remains 
substantially underexplored, Western offshore Adriatic has 
been a prolific hydrocarbon producing province for over 50 years  
for both oil and gas. We believe Montenegro has significant 
exploration potential for future oil and gas discoveries and the entry 
of ENI into the four blocks neighbouring those held by Energean, 
with significant exploration commitments, is an indication of the 
area’s potential. We plan to begin the 3D seismic acquisition at 
the end of this year, to be completed in the first half of 2019.
In November 2017, Energean Israel participated in Israel’s First 
Offshore Bid Round, and in December was awarded five licences 
for blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31. The award of these exploration 
licences, adjacent to our Karish and Tanin project, further bolsters 
our exploration portfolio and long-term value potential in the 
region. Block 12 is on trend with the Karish and Tanin discoveries, 
presenting an opportunity for low-risk exploration, which could 
be developed via a tie back to the FPSO. 
4
Maintaining a disciplined  
financial framework
We have successfully maintained a conservative balance 
sheet throughout the commodity down-cycle, through careful 
management of working capital and low levels of bank debt. 
We aim to preserve our balance sheet flexibility, alongside 
disciplined capital deployment, backed by strong cash flow 
from our producing assets.
As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses 
ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value-
accretive opportunities. We have strict investment criteria  
for new projects, typically targeting an unlevered internal  
rate of return of more than 15%. This approach, alongside  
the Group’s production, development and exploration  
prospects, will underpin Energean’s sustainable  
growth in the future.

Outlook
Energean is currently the only upstream Company on the  
LSE with considerable exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean, 
an area which is attracting increasing interest from global oil 
and gas majors. As a fast-moving independent, our aim is to 
take advantage of this trend and be part of the substantial 
infrastructure developments that will connect the region 
to local and wider markets.
As we progress through 2018, we are confident that our ability 
to acquire, de-risk and develop projects of significant scale can 
deliver a flow of new opportunities in the region.
We are well placed to capitalise on our growth plans and have the 
infrastructure, local relationships and track record to move swiftly 
on future value-accretive opportunities for all our stakeholders.

Health,safetyandtheenvironment
We see our health, safety and environmental (HSE)  
performance as a key aspect of the overall success of our 
business. We are committed to the highest standards of HSE 
regarding our employees, contractors, partners, the general 
public and the mitigation of our environmental impact.
Our experience of operating in environmentally sensitive areas 
without compromising them is something we are incredibly  
proud of. Energean’s HSE record has been an important factor  
in our successful bids for licences, including Karish and Tanin.
Energean is the only oil and gas producer in Greece and, together 
with its predecessor business, has a 37-year track record of 
operating offshore and onshore assets in environmentally 
sensitive areas. Energean’s experience and conscientious 
approach towards the management of its assets is a key 
differentiator in the sector. 
As we continue to scale up operations, we will remain focused 
on our key HSE performance indicators and the safety of our 
employees. These are key aspects of how we operate as a 
business and are integral to our culture and engagement with 
our stakeholders.

Low-cost producer with  
stable cash flow
Historically, we have been able to respond to oil price volatility 
by reducing our cost of production per barrel (excluding 
depreciation) at Prinos, largely through increased production. 
This approach led to our cost of oil production per barrel falling 
from US$63/bbl in 2014 to US$25/bbl in 2017.
Our aim is to maximise production, reserves and cash flow from 
our existing low-cost production base, while pursuing sustainable 
growth and returns through active development and exploration 
programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Experienced and proven  
offshore operator
Energean is the operator of the majority of its assets, including 
Prinos, Prinos North, South Kavala, Epsilon and Katakolo in 
Greece; Karish, Tanin and Blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31 in Israel; 
and blocks 26 and 30 in Montenegro.
Our operational and technical knowledge is core to our business, 
including our dedicated teams of geologists, geophysicists and 
production and reservoir engineers, which will help us to rapidly 
develop projects. This extensive knowledge has been built up 
across the business during more than 36 years of offshore 
operating experience in the Prinos Basin.
This experience and in-house capability have supported the 
Group in maintaining stable and risk-controlled production from 
Prinos and provided a platform to acquire attractive assets and 
de-risk key development projects.
The Directors believe that operatorship affords us the flexibility 
to progress projects at the most advantageous rates.
We intend to maintain a flexible and prudent approach to retaining 
or farming out operatorship, depending on the nature of each 
asset and its financing structure.
Strategically positioned in 
an increasingly active region
Our operations are focused on the Eastern Mediterranean,  
with the most significant assets located in Israel and Greece, which 
are both OECD countries and strategically attractive for investment. 
By maintaining a focused approach to this region, we believe the 
Group has developed strong relationships with all key stakeholders.
The Eastern Mediterranean has become an increasingly active 
area for E&P. Recent discoveries of material gas fields in Egypt 
and Israel (the Zohr and Leviathan fields, respectively) have drawn 
attention and investment to the region. In Greece, Exxon Mobil, 
Total, Edison and Repsol have been attracted to the hydrocarbon 
sector and have acquired, or expressed an interest in acquiring, 
Greek exploration blocks.
As an independent, locally-based E&P company, Energean  
is well positioned to move swiftly on opportunities in the Eastern 
Mediterranean.
Track record of value creation
Energean has a strong track record of value creation through 
timely acquisitions and efficient development.
The Prinos Basin licence was acquired in 2007, at what the 
Directors believe was a relatively advantageous valuation level. 
We have since been able to secure a licence extension and have 
increased reserves through technical reappraisal of the reservoir 
and drilling activity, enabling the implementation of a low-cost 
development plan. 
The most recent Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. Competent 
Person’s Report (‘NSAI CPR’) for Prinos estimates that Prinos 
Basin 2P assets will have a cumulative net cash flow (discounted 
at 10%) of approximately US$0.7 billion through 2035.
The value of Prinos to the Group is further enhanced by a 
four-year extension of Energean’s long-term offtake agreement 
with BP, from 2021 to 2025, for 100% of Prinos production. BP 
has been the Group’s offtaker in the Prinos Basin since 2013.
The Karish and Tanin leases were acquired in 2016 for 
US$148.5 million. The assets were sold due to a regulatory 
requirement relating to the seller.
The acquisition of Karish and Tanin was completed at a lower 
US$/boe value than other discoveries in the region, at a US$/boe 
value of 0.4 (excluding royalties), while Zohr (Egypt) and Aphrodite 
(Cyprus) have US$/boe values of 1.4 and 0.8, respectively  
(source: IHS Energy database – Herold).
At the time Energean acquired them, Karish and Tanin were 
stranded assets with no gas contracts in place. Since the 
acquisition of these leases, the Group has achieved a number 
of key milestones, including the approval of the Karish and  
Tanin Field Development Plan (‘FDP’) in August 2017. We have 
also signed 12 Gas Supply Agreements, totalling an estimated  
4.2 BCM per annum on an annual contract quantity (‘ACQ’) basis,  
or 3.1 BCM per annum on a take or pay basis.
Currently discovered 2C from Karish and Tanin equate to an 
estimated NPV of US$830 million net to Energean (70% (‘WI’)). 
This uplift in value has been realised in the space of 15 months, 
due to Energean’s ability to execute key project milestones 
quickly and effectively.
In addition, Energean has secured a number of attractive 
exploration licences in Israel, Western Greece and Montenegro, 
where we believe we can add value.
As our track record demonstrates, Energean continually assesses 
ways to create further sustainable value and act upon value-
accretive opportunities.
Experienced management with 
international industry track record
Energean’s management team and staff are drawn from 
international and national oil companies, major and smaller 
independents and engineering contractors.
Management’s experience encompasses a broad range of 
projects, asset types – including offshore (shallow and deep 
water) assets – and E&P technology, with over 200 years’ 
combined experience in the oil and gas industry.
We have offices in the UK, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt  
and Montenegro and our technical team has recently been 
expanded to support the move into deep water operations 
at Karish and Tanin.
World-class partners and 
strong financial backing
The growth and success of our business has been supported by 
our strong partnerships with industry-leading technical experts 
and the financial backing of major banks and specialist investors. 
These world-class partners, in addition to our strong customer 
relationships, have enabled us to realise our potential and will  
be integral to our future as we transform Energean into a leading 
international oil and gas business.
Strong health & safety record
Energean’s exemplary HSE performance is a key aspect of our 
overall success. We have operated in the Kavala and Thassos 
Island areas in Greece, both of which are environmentally 
sensitive locations with high tourist activity, for over 37 years.
Energean Gas benefitted from this experience and we believe 
that the Gulf of Kavala’s continued biodiversity and popularity 
with tourists are testament to our ability to conduct our 
operations in an environmentally sound and responsible manner.
Our HSE record has been an important factor in our success in 
bidding for licences and we are committed to maintaining the 
health and safety of all our employees and other stakeholders.
Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 15 14 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Greece
Energean is currently the only company in Greece operating 
producing oil and gas assets.
Interest in the country from international oil and gas companies 
is growing. A consortium of Exxon Mobil, Total and Hellenic 
Petroleum has bid for two licences offshore Crete, and Repsol 
and Hellenic have jointly bid for a block in the Ionian Sea.
Energean also operates four development stage fields at Prinos 
and Prinos North in Kavala, Epsilon in Northern Greece and 
Katakolo in Western Greece.
Montenegro
The Eastern Adriatic remains underexplored, despite having 
what appear to be all the necessary hydrocarbon-generating 
components. Large prospects have been identified offshore 
Montenegro. These are on a par with recent oil discoveries in 
northern Albania, such as the onshore Shpirag-2 discovery. 
To date, over 5 billion barrels of oil in place have been discovered 
within this prolific carbonate play.
In March 2017, Energean signed a concession agreement with 
Montenegro for offshore Blocks 30 and 26. The NSAI Ioannina 
and Montenegro CPR indicates that the two blocks hold best 
estimate unrisked prospective resources of 1.8 Tcf of natural 
gas and 143.9 MMbbls of liquids.
Market overview
Maximising opportunities  
in a highly prospective region
The Eastern Mediterranean 
The Eastern Mediterranean is an increasingly active E&P region. 
Recent discoveries in Egypt and Israel (the Zohr and Leviathan 
gas fields, respectively), as well as the Aphrodite and Calypso 
fields in Cyprus, have drawn investment from global oil and  
gas majors.
The region represents a large captive market in which 
governments are seeking to transition to cleaner sources of 
energy and are keen to expand sovereign resources. Growing 
demand from Western Europe for alternative sources of gas has 
raised the prospect of strategic pipelines being put in place that 
will considerably increase the economic importance of Eastern 
Mediterranean assets.
Our opportunity
Energean is well positioned to target and compete for 
opportunities in this region. In addition to our strong track  
record of value creation from assets in the Prinos Basin, we have 
secured world class industry partners (such as BP, Repsol and 
Prime Marine) and strong financial backing from the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Kerogen 
Capital and Third Point.
Our expanding presence in the Eastern Mediterranean will 
strengthen our ability to create new opportunities.
Game-changing gas discoveries
The Eastern Mediterranean has seen a number of major gas 
discoveries in the last decade. These include the Tamar gas field, 
currently estimated to contain 11.2 Tcf of gas reserves, in 2009 
and the Leviathan gas field, estimated to contain 21.4 Tcf of gas, 
in 2010, both off the coast of Israel. 
Cyprus’ oil and gas sector has experienced significant expansion 
following the discovery of the Aphrodite gas field, with an estimated 
4 Tcf of natural gas, in January 2012. ENI, Total, Exxon Mobil and 
Qatar Petroleum are currently operating in the country.
In February 2018, ENI announced the Calypso 1 gas discovery, 
offshore Cyprus, which it described as “a promising gas discovery 
that could contain more than 230 BCM of gas”.
Increasing M&A activity
The Eastern Mediterranean has recently received investment 
from world class companies.
Landmark deals in the region include Tamar Petroleum’s 
purchase of a 7.5% stake in the Tamar natural gas reserve  
in January 2018, for US$560 million and 38.5 million shares.  
Two Zohr field deals were concluded in Q4 2016, with Rosneft 
acquiring a 30% share in the field for US$1.125 billion and BP 
securing a 10% interest in the Shorouk concession, offshore 
Egypt, which contains the Zohr gas field, for US$375 million.  
In March this year, UAE’s Mubadala Petroleum acquired a 10% 
stake in Shorouk for US$934 million. In February 2018, two Israeli 
firms signed a US$15 billion agreement to export gas to Egypt 
from Leviathan and Tamar. The deal will see 64 BCM of gas 
supplied over 10 years with an implied price of c.US$6.6/mmbtu.
East Med Pipeline and export  
routes to Europe
A 1,700km pipeline connecting the Eastern Mediterranean’s 
Levantine Basin (Israel) with the European gas network, via 
Greece and Italy, is due for completion in 2025. 
Known as the East Med Pipeline, this development has been 
classified as a European Project of Common Interest. A MoU has 
already been signed between Israel, Greece, Italy and Cyprus to 
support the expected US$6–7 billion pipeline construction.
Regional market overview
Israel
Over the last decade, Israeli natural gas demand has been  
among the fastest growing globally. Future demand is forecast  
to increase substantially, primarily driven by the electricity sector 
to serve population growth, rising living standards, increased 
water desalination, electrification of the railway system, and the 
adoption of electric vehicles and compressed natural gas (‘CNG’) 
for transportation. Israel consumed 10.4 BCM of gas in 2017.  
The Israeli Ministry of Energy anticipates that demand will 
increase to 12.5 BCM in 2020 and to 18 BCM by 2030, of which 
85% will be for electricity generation and industrial use.

Future pipeline developments
There are currently three major pipeline projects which could 
traverse Greece. The Trans-Anatolian pipeline is planned to run 
from the Turkish border with Georgia, to the Greek border at 
Edirne. Here, the pipeline will connect to the Trans-Adriatic 
pipeline, which is planned to run across Greece to Albania in the 
west. The East Med pipeline is planned to run from the Levantine 
basin (Israel) to Cyprus then to Crete, the Peloponnese and finally 
connect with the Poseidon pipeline to Italy. 
A floating gas storage and regasification unit offshore 
Alexandroupolis is expected to begin operations in 2020,  
creating a fourth import route to Greece. 
Oil price outlook
Oil prices began to recover in 2017 following the oil price  
crash in mid-2014. However, prices remained volatile,  
ranging from US$44.82/bbl (21 June 2017) to US$67 .02/bbl  
(26 December 2017).
Energean’s conservative financial management and its focus  
on operating costs give the Group confidence that it can prosper 
under a range of oil prices.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 17 16 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Our strategy in action
Energean is focused on a clear strategy of producing, 
developing and exploring existing and new assets in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. By maximising the potential of our 
assets and building momentum in this increasingly active 
region, we aim to deliver real value in this new era of our 
growth story.
Maximising  
output and cash  
flow from our  
producing assets
Maximising our low-cost 
production base
A key strategic priority is to increase Prinos Basin production 
and cash flow. Our existing development plan targets the 
monetisation of 2P reserves of 39.5 MMbbls of oil and 6.0 
Bcf of gas, as well as 2C resources of 22.9 MMbbls of oil and 
5.3 Bcf of gas, as of 31 October 2017, according to the NSAI 
Prinos CPR. Our long-term development plan from 2018–
2021 includes: drilling 24 new wells; constructing an 
unmanned platform to exploit the Epsilon Field, adjacent to 
Prinos; and infill drilling in the existing producing fields. We 
estimate average 2P production rates to increase to 
4,000–4,500 bopd in 2018 as new infill wells are brought on 
stream in the Prinos complex.
Our focus for the next  
12 months
 X Complete Prinos Alpha in-fill programme  
(PA-32 drill, PA41 w/o, PA-33 maint)

The development of the Karish and T anin 2.4 T cf gas 
project, offshore Israel, will ultimately transform the 
Group’s business and position us as a significant  
player within the Eastern Mediterranean.
Developing  
Karish and T anin
A transformational project in Israel 
Delivering commercial production from Karish and Tanin will

of natural gas and 32.8 MMbbls of liquids (2C resources) and 
2.4 Tcf of natural gas and 70.9 MMbbls of liquids (prospective 
resources), these assets are highly strategic for the development 
of the Israeli energy market and can help to meet increasing 
Israeli demand, increase market competition and improve 
security of supply. 
The Karish and Tanin development will position Energean  
as a significant player within the region. The FDP for Phase 1  
of the project was approved by the Israeli government on  
27 August 2017, with the final investment decision taken  
in the first quarter of 2018 and first gas expected in the  
first half of 2021.

Upside potential
Energean has a number of development and exploration 
opportunities within our current portfolio, including, but not 
limited to further Prinos Basin development and exploration 
potential; development and exploration blocks in Western 
Greece, Katakolo, Aitoloakarnania and Ioannina; blocks 26 and 
30 offshore Montenegro; and various inorganic growth 
opportunities aligned with our strategy. These include five 
blocks for which Energean Israel was awarded licences 
in Israel’s First Offshore Bid Round, which concluded on 
15 November 2017.
One example of the inorganic growth opportunities available to 
the Group is the oil and gas industry in Cyprus, which 
has experienced significant growth following the discovery of 
the Aphrodite gas field, with an estimated 4 Tcf of natural gas, 
in January 2012. ENI, Total, Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum 
are currently operating in the country, with Total and ENI 
having commenced drilling in Cyprus in July 2017. In February 
2018, ENI announced the Calypso 1 gas discovery, offshore 
Cyprus. Accordingly, Cyprus represents a further opportunity 
to expand our operations within the Eastern Mediterranean.

Prinos operations
The first half of the year was operationally challenging for our 
producing Prinos Basin assets. Problems related to asphalt 
precipitation prevented us from maintaining the production 
growth we achieved in 2016. 
As a consequence of these measures, average yearly  
production fell to 2,803 bopd in 2017, from 3,490 bopd in  
2016. This contributed to an increase in our cost of production  
to US$24.7/boe from US$19.1/boe year on year. Following 
modifications to the well completion design and refinement  
of certain operational practices, these issues were largely 
eradicated and production growth restarted. We finished  
2017 with production in Q4 averaging 3,405 bopd.
Production, maintenance and marine operations at Prinos 
were executed successfully during 2017. No significant incidents 
occurred. A bi-annual shutdown campaign was completed 
with the main underwater pipelines successfully pigged.
To prevent future asphaltene issues, single string completion 
designs have been adjusted to allow deeper injection of inhibitor, 
improved asphalt prediction curves have been developed based 
on samples from the new wells and drawdown rates are being 
better managed to maintain bottom hole pressure above asphalt 
onset point.
We expect to achieve average production rate of between 
4,000–4,500 bopd from Prinos for 2018, an increase of 40–60% 
compared to 2017. During 2018, a further five development infill 
wells are planned to be drilled.
All of the Group’s production from the Prinos Basin assets in 
2017 was sold through a long-term offtake agreement with BP, 
under which BP typically collects on a quarterly basis. Energean’s 
average realised sales price for 2017 was US$46.73/bbl. This 
offtake agreement was recently extended to November 2025, 
eliminating our offtake risk for the foreseeable future as we scale  
up production in the Basin.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 29 28 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Following the successful appraisal well drilled into the Kazaviti 
structure in 2016 (deepening of development well PA-36) 
contingent resources were recognised and a development 
well is being planned for inclusion in the ongoing Prinos infill 
drilling campaign.
Work on the Katakolo project in the Greek Peloponnese focused 
on execution of the necessary environmental studies required  
to obtain approval for the construction of the initial two wells and 
associated pilot production facilities. Further sub-surface studies 
were completed, allowing 10 MMbbls of contingent resources 
to be recognised.
Resources were also recognised on the 1990s Delta discovery 
that sits below the partly developed Prinos North satellite. 
A proposal for an extended reach well from the Prinos platform 
has been prepared.
In Western Greece, Energean successfully farmed out  
60% of our interest and operatorship for our Ioannina and 
Aitoloakarnania Blocks, onshore Western Greece, to Repsol  
in September 2017, who will carry 90% of the gross exploration 
costs, up to US$49.9 million.
Montenegro
In March 2017, Energean signed a concession contract to explore 
blocks 26 and 30, offshore Montenegro, which hold best estimate 
unrisked resources of 1.8 Tcf natural gas and 143.9 MMbbls 
of liquids.
1
We established an office in Montenegro and commenced 
work to allow a 3D seismic survey to be performed in 2018. 
Environmental baseline studies have been completed and 
an Environmental Impact Assessment is in preparation.
Egypt
In 2017, the Group drilled just one exploration well – in the West 
Kom Ombo licence in Egypt. This proved to be a dry hole and the 
licence was subsequently relinquished. 
1 Based on NSAI Ionnina and Montenegro CPR, October 2017
Review of operations continued
Karish and Tanin
In Israel, we made major steps forward in the development of the 
Karish and Tanin gas fields, acquired from Delek Energy in 2016. 
Engineering work commenced in January 2017 and ran through 
the entire year. Feasibility work completed during 2016 
demonstrated the attractiveness of developing the project 
through an FPSO located at the Karish field. This approach 
removes the need to land hydrocarbon liquids in Israel, 
minimising environmental impacts, and will establish a 
hub through which other discoveries could be developed.
To fast-track the development of Karish to produce first gas 
in 2021, Energean contracted TechnipFMC to design, procure, 
construct, install and commission all facilities from the wellhead 
to the entry point of the Israeli gas grid. This approach minimises 
interfaces and hence execution risk for the Group.
An FDP for Karish and Tanin was submitted in June 2017 and 
approved by the Israeli authorities in August. FEED work was 
undertaken between June and December.
In parallel with preparing the FDP, we secured gas supply 
contracts for around 4.2 BCM per year for 16 years to Israeli 
gas buyers. Options for a further 12 BCM were also agreed.
Detailed design work for the Karish and Tanin development 
commenced towards the end of 2017 and will continue 
throughout 2018, with first steel cuts on the hull and topsides 
expected towards the end of this year. 
In January 2018, Energean announced it had selected Stena 
Drilling as its preferred drilling contractor, following a competitive 
tendering process. Three development wells will be drilled at 
Karish in 2019. Drilling services will be provided by Halliburton 
and well engineering by Lloyds Register.
A contract to cover all operations readiness and assurance 
work was tendered and awarded to Wood Group in March 2017. 
In addition, we have been gradually extending our team in Israel 
and recruiting local staff to deliver the in-country scope and 
to manage all local interfaces and stakeholders.
Exploration, appraisal and  
development activities
Exploration represents an important element in the Company’s 
growth portfolio. The main focus in 2017 was on extending 
and upgrading our exploration portfolio in Israel and Greece, 
in preparation for further drilling when cash flow from increased 
Greek production will be available. 
Israel
The Israeli government announced and executed the country’s 
First Israeli Offshore Bid Round in 2017. Energean decided to bid 
only on blocks within a 40km radius of the Karish field, namely 
Blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 31. Following the conclusion of the Bid 
Round in November, Energean was awarded licences for all five 
blocks in December. No firm well commitments were required.
In parallel with winning these new blocks, work also continued 
on maturing the significant exploration prospects mapped in the 
Karish lease. Well proposals for Karish North and Karish East 
were prepared and options secured in the drilling contract with 
Stena to allow them to be added onto the Karish Main 
Development drilling sequence.
Greece
In Greece, work continued throughout the year on the infill 
development campaign of our main producing field: Prinos. 
Three new wells were completed – PA-33, PA-37 and PA-38 
– and wells PA-40 and PA-19 were worked over. Well PN-H4 – 
the first extended reach well to be drilled by our own rig – was 
drilled towards the end of 2017. Development drilling activities 
were generally successful, with unswept oil being found 
as targeted. Reserves developed per well were in line 
with expectations.
Meanwhile, work continued on the development of the  
Epsilon satellite. This requires the installation of a new drilling 
platform plus three 3.5km long pipelines connecting it to Prinos. 
The design was adjusted to allow the contractor, GSP, to build 
the jacket, topsides and pipelines, while also drilling three  
early appraisal/development wells. Finance for this work  
was secured with the Black Sea Development Bank and  
Romanian Export Import Bank. Costs were in line with the  
earlier development concept.
Work addressing the potential installation of a new platform at 
the Prinos complex was also progressed. Options to extend the 
existing B platform were generated and will be compared with  
a new bridge-linked jacket. This new facility will be required after 
the drilling of Epsilon development wells is completed.

Building the financial  
framework for growth
Furthermore, the Group progressed with the Epsilon development 
plan delivering the following: 
 X Signing of a US$88.3 million turnkey EPCIC contract with GSP 
Offshore S.R.L. which includes the drilling of the first three 
development wells, the construction and installation of an 
unmanned satellite platform to the main Prinos complex and 
procurement and installation of the pipelines and umbilical to 
connect the new Lamda platform to the Prinos Delta platform 
 X Agreeing terms for the upsizing of the Reserve Based Lending 
facility with the EBRD from US$75million to US$180 million with 
the participation of other lenders including the Black Sea Trade 
and Development Bank, Banca Comerciala Intesa Sanpaolo 
Romania S.A. and the Export-Import Bank of Romania 
Eximbank SA. The tenor of the loan was extended to 2024  
with first repayment in Q2 2020. 
The Group continued its prudent and cautious exploration 
expenditure and commitment strategy, underpinned by  
key commercial agreements and strategic decisions:
 X Farm-out of a 60% interest in the Ioannina and Aitolokarnania 
licences to Repsol for a consideration of US$1.0 million in cash 
and a carry of 90% of the first exploration phase costs, up to a 
pre-agreed maximum of US$49.9 million.
 X Signed an exploration and production concession contract 
with the State of Montenegro covering offshore blocks 4219-
26 and 4218-30 for work commitment amount €3.0 million
 X Awarded five exploration licences for blocks 12, 21, 22, 23 and 
31 offshore Israel, near to the existing Karish and Tanin fields 
 X Received approval for the Field Development Plan of the 
Katakolo field in Western Greece from Hellenic Hydrocarbons 
Resources Management
 X Relinquishment of West Kom Ombo licence in Egypt and 
recognition of impairment of US$9.3 million.
Energean funded its operations and activities in 2017 by 
a combination of:
 X Operating Cash Flow of US$29.1 million generated from the 
Prinos and Prinos North fields
 X Kerogen Capital committed funds of US$20 million for the 
Karish Tanin pre-FID work
 X Available funds of US$33 million from the EBRD committed 
facilities to fund our operations in Greece. 
2017 found Energean with a major task of converting its newly 
acquired Karish & Tanin gas discoveries, offshore Israel, into  
a commercial project. In order to achieve Final Investment 
Decision Energean met the following key milestones:
 X finalisation of Field Development Plan that was submitted  
to and approved by the Israeli authorities 
 X execution of 12 long term gas sales agreements totalling an 
estimated 61 BCM on an ACQ basis (up to 74 BCM including 
OR gas supply agreement) with reputable and credible 
counterparties 
 X agreement of financing terms for a US$1.275m Project 
Finance with major international banks. 
In Greece, oil production from the Prinos licence was materially 
impacted by the scheduled turnaround of the Prinos facilities in 
September 2017, with production being shut for 18 days, and the 
well performance issues experienced in the first half of the year 
which resulted in an unplanned recompletion programme of a 
number of producers and the delay of the infill drilling schedule. 
Post September both the production from existing wells and the 
drilling operations resumed with PA 37 and PNH4 wells coming 
on-stream in December 2017 and March 2018 respectively. 
In spite of the Group’s expansion and growth during the year, we remained focused on capital discipline, cost control  
and efficiency by:
 X Total third party Net Debt of US$75.6 million (2016: US$48.5 million) resulting in a very low Gearing ratio of 26.17% (2016: 24.39%). 
The increase in Net Debt is driven by the drawdown of available funds under the RBL Facility, but the Gearing ratio has remained well 
below 30%
 X Production cost of US$25.3 million (2016: US$24.3 million). and production cost per barrel for the year of US$24.7 (2016: US$19.1). 
The production cost in 2017 when adjusted for the $0.8m scheduled shutdown has remained steady. The production cost per barrel 
has been affected by the lower production delivered through the year but is still at very competitive levels
 X Total Group G&A of US$6.0 million (2016: US$4.1 million), The G&A increase, reflects the additional staffing and administrative 
costs caused by the rapid growth of the Group’s portfolio with the acquisition of Karish and Tanin and the efforts to bring the asset 
to Final Investment Decision in early 2018.
The above, coupled with the improved oil price environment during 2017 with a realised sales price of $46.7/barrel (2016: US$34.3) 
resulted in significantly improved financial performance as reflected below:

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 33 32 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Taxation
Taxation expense was US$14.1 million in the year (2016: income of US$11.5 million). The higher taxation expense is mainly due 
to higher deferred tax credits in unrealised foreign exchange differences in the Greek entities and due to recognition of income tax 
liabilities in relation to the Kavala Oil tax appeal. 
Income after tax from continuing activities and profit per share
Income for the year from continuing activities amounted to US$9,943 million (2016: loss of US$38.6 million). Profit per share  
was 14 cents (2016: loss of 0.54 cents).
Cash from operating activities 
Net cash flows from operating activities increased to US$29.1 million for the reporting period (2016: US$15.2 million) and was primarily 
attributable to an increase in the realised oil price and decrease in inventory balance. This cash flow together with increased debt 
facilities funded the Group’s US$54 million capital expenditure on exploration and development. 
Capital expenditures 
2017 capital expenditures amounted to US$67.6 million (2016: US$104.8 million) with US$64.4 million invested in development 
activities and US$3.2 million in exploration and appraisal activities. More than 90% of the total capital expenditure was invested in 
Greece, with three new wells completed – PA-33, PA-37 and PA-38 – and wells PA-40 and PA-19 were worked over. Well PN-H4 –  
the first extended reach well to be drilled by our own rig – was being drilled at year end. 
Liquidity risk management and going concern
The Group closely monitors and manages its liquidity risk. Cash forecasts are regularly produced and sensitivities run for different 
scenarios including, but not limited to, changes in commodity prices and different production rates from the Group’s producing assets. 
The Directors have assessed the current financial position and the profitability of the Group as well their expectations in relation to 
future business prospects, and future profitability and cash flows of the Group. 
The Group’s forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within its current debt facilities and have sufficient financial 
headroom for the following 12 months. Another important factor for determining that the going concern basis remains appropriate is 
the ability of raising necessary funding as and when needed. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group having successfully 
completed an IPO on the London Stock Exchange raised $460 million gross proceed. Furthermore the Group’s liquidity position has 
been significantly improved by the amendment of the Group’s existing EBRD Senior Facility agreement signed on 30 January 2018, 
increasing the facility size to US$180 million from US$75 million and the addition of a US$1.275 billion Senior Credit Facility agreement, 
which will be used to fund the Karish and Tanin development costs. 
Non-IFRS measures
The Group uses certain measures of performance that are not specifically defined under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting 
principles. These non-IFRS measures include adjusted EBITDAX, cost of oil production capital expenditure, cash capex, net debt and 
gearing ratio are explained overleaf.
Revenue
The Group’s revenue increased by 45.4% to US$57.8 million for the reporting period (2016: US$39.7 million). This is mainly explained  
by the increase in the average realised crude oil price from US$34.25/bbl during 2016 to US$46.73/bbl during the reporting period. 
Cost of oil production, depreciation and impairments 
Cost of oil production amounted to US$25.3 million; US$24.7/boe (2016: U$24.3 million; US$19.1/boe). Cost of production in 2017 
includes an amount of US$0.8 million for turnaround expenditures. 
Depreciation charges in cost of oil production decreased by 16.9% primarily as a result of an increase in 2P reserves. 
During 2017, the Group relinquished West Kom Ombo licence in Egypt and wrote off US$8.0 million in relation to exploration 
expenditure and US$1.3 million for the licence’s letter of guarantee.

Gain on derivative
The gain on derivative of US$25.8 million is a result of the valuation of a derivative financial instrument, measured at fair value at the 
end of each reporting date, which related to the Energean Israel Limited Class B Shares the Group had a contingent commitment to 
acquire. Pursuant to the Reorganisation Agreement, the Group had committed to acquire in an exit event 50% of the Energean Israel 
Limited Class B Shares of Energean Israel Limited held by the Founders. The valuation technique used to value this asset multiplies 
the estimated likelihood of an exit (being an IPO or a sale) by the estimated difference between the consideration payable under the 
commitment and the estimated value of the B shares to be acquired under the commitment. Pursuant to the Reorganisation 
Agreement, the Group acquired the Founders’ 50% economic interest in Energean Israel on 16 March 2018 in exchange for 
US$10 million, leaving the Group with a 50% economic interest and 50.0001% voting rights in Energean Israel. Pursuant to Second 
Subscription Agreement with Kerogen and after taking a final investment decision in respect of the Karish and Tanin assets the 
Group’s interest in Energean Israel was further increased to 70% on 29 March 2018.
Financing costs
Financing costs for the year were US$22.9 million (2016: US$ 29.3). The decrease in financing costs is associated with shareholders 
loan conversion to preference shares at the end of H1 2017.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 35 34 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Net debt and gearing ratio
Net debt is defined as the Group’s total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) less shareholders’ subordinated 
debt, cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits. Management believes that net debt is a useful indicator of the Group’s 
indebtedness, financial flexibility and capital structure because it indicates the level of borrowings after taking account of cash and 
cash equivalents within the Group’s business that could be utilised to pay down the outstanding borrowings. The Group defines capital 
as the Group’s total equity plus shareholders’ subordinated debt. The Group calculates the gearing ratio (net debt to capital) as net debt 
divided by capital.

Capital expenditures 
Capital expenditure is a useful indicator of the Group’s organic expenditure on oil and gas assets and exploration and appraisal assets 
incurred during a period. Capital expenditure is defined as additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets excluding decommissioning asset additions, disposal and capitalised depreciation, less capitalised borrowing cost.

Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX is calculated by the Group as profit or loss for the period adjusted for profit or (loss) for the period from 
discontinued operations, taxation (expense) / income, total depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets, other income, other 
expenses, finance income, finance costs, gain on derivative, net foreign exchange gain / (loss) and exploration and evaluation 
expenses. The Group presents adjusted EBITDAX as it is used in assessing the Group’s growth and operational efficiencies as it 
illustrates the underlying performance of the Group’s business by excluding items considered by management not to be reflective of 
the underlying operations of the Group.

Cost of oil production
Cost of oil production is defined as cost of oil sales, less cost of services, depreciation and change in inventory (defined as the 
difference between opening inventory and closing inventory). Cost of oil production per boe represents cost of oil production divided by 
total production for the respective period.
Cost of oil production is a useful indicator of the Group’s underlying cash costs incurred to produce oil and gas. Cost of oil production 
eliminates certain non-cash accounting adjustments to the Group’s cost of sales to produce oil and gas. The Group uses these 
measurements to compare the performance of the Group’s operations period-to-period, to monitor costs and to evaluate operating 
efficiency.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 37 36 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Corporate social responsibility – Our approach
Being a responsible business 
and building trust
Asaninternationaloilandgascompany,
we recognisethatweneedtoearn
our social and legallicencetooperate
througha consistenttrackrecord
of responsible,safe and effective
performance.
Corporate social responsibility (CSR) lies at the heart of our 
business. We are here for the long-term and we understand  
that sustained commercial success and disciplined CSR go 
hand-in-hand.
Operating in the oil and gas sector demands that we adhere to  
the highest international standards to ensure we manage the 
impact of our business and its contribution to society. It is not  
just about acting in an ethical way, it is about understanding  
that CSR makes sound business sense and builds reputation. 
Itisalsointegralinhelpingusto:
 X Build strong and productive relationships with our customers, 
partners and suppliers by understanding their needs
 X Manage risk more effectively by strengthening our procedures 
and processes
 X Engage our employees through a culture of collaboration, 
trust and safety
 X Improve our performance by maintaining the integrity of 
our assets, our environment and our communities wherever 
we operate
 X Earn trust to sustain our reputation long term.
Operating in a responsible and sustainable manner is essential 
to Energean Oil & Gas.
In addition to the expectations of stakeholders, CSR is a 
fundamental guiding principle of how we run our business.  
We believe that striving for the best possible CSR helps us to 
manage risks and fully capitalise on the opportunities presented 
to us in a changing world.
Our objective is to generate sustainable prosperity through  
our business operations.
We are therefore committed to conducting our operations 
responsibly, which means supporting local communities and 
caring for the environment, as well as looking after the health 
and safety of our employees.
CSR policy
Our CSR policy is rooted in our company values, guided by 
international standards and best practice, and driven by 
our aspiration for excellence in every area of our business.
Our Chief Executive is ultimately accountable for CSR, supported 
by our CSR Team. The Board has ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the CSR strategy and for monitoring  
our progress in achieving sustainability objectives through  
regular performance reviews and reporting.
All our business units are accountable for developing and 
implementing the CSR strategy and, where appropriate,  
our progress against our targets is independently assured.

We have established a comprehensive and integrated  
Health and Safety Management System (H&S MS) aligned  
with the requirements of international standards and European  
safety directives.
We are committed to the implementation, maintenance  
and continual improvement of our H&S MS and aim to  
achieve accreditation for international safety standards  
and best practices.
Our H&S MS is based on tried and tested, internationally 
recognised best practices in managing H&S risks  
in the E&P industry, structured around a classic  
‘Plan-Do-Assess-Adjust’ cycle.

CorporateMajorAccidentPreventionPolicy
The Board has approved a Corporate Major Accident Prevention 
Policy (CMAPP), recognising:
 X Its responsibility to comply with the Offshore Safety Directive 
and with the Seveso Directive; 
 X That the nature of Energean’s offshore oil and gas operations 
may give rise to major accidents;
 X Its responsibility to control the risks of major accidents 
and to continuously improve these controls in line with 
advancements in technology and good oilfield practices;
 X Its commitment — as laid out in the Code of Conduct — to 
achieve high standards of HSE performance and to make 
available all necessary resources to achieve these goals.
Energean controls risks of major accidents arising from  
its onshore and offshore oil and gas operations so far as  
is reasonably practicable, ensuring that such risks are within  
the ‘acceptable’ or ‘tolerable’ ALARP region (As Low As 
Reasonably Practicable).
‘Stopwork’policy
Any person employed and/or contracted by Energean may invoke 
the ‘stop work’ policy if they feel that any employee, a company 
asset or the local environment is at risk. There shall be no  
fault put on any employee calling for a ‘stop work’ order in good 
faith even if, upon investigation, the stop order proves to be 
unnecessary.
Leadershipandcommitment
HSE leadership and accountability for H&S starts with the CEO 
who takes all necessary steps to ensure that the highest possible 
level of H&S performance is achieved within the Company. We 
regard Health and Safety as a line responsibility and an integral 
part of the duties of all personnel. 
Legalcompliance
Compliance with all applicable H&S legislation and regulations 
is a fundamental requirement of the Energean H&S MS. All work 
carried out at our company offices and premises, and all work 
activities undertaken at project locations and operational sites, 
is carried out in accordance with applicable local laws and 
European regulations. 
Competencemanagementandtraining
Energean and its contractors implement an ongoing competence 
and assurance management scheme, and provide appropriate 
HSE training to all employees. Formal H&S training is provided to 
all employees and contractors either annually, or every 2–3 years, 
depending on the specific training required. 
Operationalframeworkandcontrol
We develop, implement, monitor and review procedures and 
instructions for safe operation, enabling our adaptation to changes 
in operations, regulations, industry standards and advances in 
technology. The main components of this framework are:
 X  Pre-shift briefings and shift handovers
 X  Toolbox talks
 X  Site HSE inspections & audits
 X  Incident reporting & investigation
 X  Task risk assessments
 X  HSE meetings
 X  Permit to Work system
 X  Emergency response
 X  Safety inductions
Occupational health
We take all necessary steps to ensure the health of our 
employees and contractors. An annual health programme is 
implemented for all employees, which includes biochemical 
analysis, physical examinations, and heart and lung screenings. 
All employees and contractors hold medical certificates relevant 
to the requirements of their position. Private health insurance is 
provided to all employees, except in Israel where public health 
services are of a high standard.

Corporate social responsibility – Environment
Protecting our environment
Energeanrecognisestheimportanceof
understandingtheimpactofitsactivities
ontheenvironmentandwearetherefore
workingtocontinuallyimproveour
EnvironmentalManagementSystem.
Ouraimistoachieveaccreditationfor
internationalenvironmentalstandards 
andbestpractices.
Our environmental responsibilities are addressed throughout  
the value chain and we are constantly investing in ways to reduce 
our carbon footprint and waste, as well as enhance our energy 
and water efficiency.
Environmental protection is a top priority and we are 
committed to ensuring that all necessary measures are being 
taken to minimise the possibilities of any environmental impact. 
Additionally, management and staff are committed to vigorous 
supervision and the implementation of applicable Greek and 
European legislation.
Marine Antipollution Response Drill, Prinos — Air quality monitoring
Airquality
To ensure we meet all our environmental objectives we are 
continuously monitoring air quality. In the wider area of Thassos 
and Kavala, 12 stations monitor the total sulphation of the 
atmosphere on a monthly basis, and a central environmental 
station monitors H2S, SO2 and HC levels and meteorological 
parameters (wind speed and direction, ambient temperature, 
and relative humidity).
Marineenvironment
We have an excellent track record of environmental 
risk management. In 38 years of operation, in the sensitive 
environment of the Gulf of Kavala, no environmental damage  
has been recorded.
Our environmental policy and management are in line with  
all applicable national laws and European directives.
Our onshore and offshore water discharges are continuously 
monitored to meet the requirements of the Water Framework 
Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Barcelona 
Convention and the International Convention for the Prevention 
of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).
Biodiversityprotection
We aim to conserve the biological diversity of terrestrial, marine 
and avian migratory species throughout their range. We manage 
our operations by taking into account the fundamental ecological 
functions of wetlands and their economic, cultural, scientific and 
recreational value. 
Marine contingency plan
We have developed and tested emergency response procedures 
for handling specific incidents such as oil spills. Our well-structured 
management plan, which includes regular, comprehensive 
training for staff and the necessary oil spill fighting equipment, 
ensures we have the confidence that we can manage any 
potential oil spill. The effectiveness of these emergency 
management procedures is demonstrated by the fact that  
we have never had to put them into practice.
Oil,tourismandtheenvironmentcanco-exist
Since 2009, we have invested more than US$300 million in  
the Prinos oil field in the Gulf of Kavala. Our track record of  
zero environmental incidents during our operations in the Gulf 
demonstrates that heavy industry can be compatible with both 
the natural environment and the activities of local communities. 
Our ability to operate in environmentally sensitive areas is also 
reflected by the award of more than 10 blue flags by the Hellenic 
Society for the Protection of Nature (representing Greece in the 
International Foundation for Environmental Education) every year 
since 2008 to beaches and marinas in the areas surrounding the 
Prinos basin.
The Bonn Convention, the Ramsar Convention, the Convention 
on Biological Diversity, and the Birds and Habitats Directives are 
considered throughout the execution of environmental impact 
assessments and environmental monitoring plans.
An independent offshore specific study showed that benthic 
communities have not been affected by Energean’s offshore 
operations in the Gulf of Kavala.

Risk management framework
The Board has approved a Group Risk Register identifying 
significant risks of the following kinds:
 X Strategic risk
 X Health, safety and environmental risk 
 X Human resource risk
 X Technology risk
 X Regulation & compliance risk 
 X Operational and execution risk 
 X Financial and reporting risk.
The Board has put in place a monitoring system to ensure  
that risk management and all aspects of internal control are 
considered on a regular basis, and fully reviewed at least annually. 
The monitoring system assists in determining the nature and 
extent of the significant risks the Board is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives. 
Risk management processes
The Board and the senior management team use a combination 
of different and complementary skills to assess the risks facing 
the business. In determining its risk appetite, the Board considers 
a variety of information when reviewing the Group’s operations 
and in approving key matters reserved for its decision. This 
information includes:
 X Updates provided by senior management on key strategic  
and operational matters
 X Discussion and approval by the Board of the Group budget 
(including its working capital)
 X Information provided for the purposes of deciding whether  
to approve those significant matters which have been reserved 
for the Board; 
 X Group risk assessments facilitated by the Group’s 
management and monitored by the Internal Audit function 
 X The reports of the external auditors.

Overview
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives, and for ensuring that risks are managed 
effectively. A key aspect of this is designing and monitoring  
an internal control system in order to manage these risks. 
In preparation for Admission, the Board established a risk 
management framework for the Group in order to identify,  
assess, control and monitor the risks to the business and allow  
it to achieve its strategic objectives. 
The risk management framework sets out the inputs into the 
internal controls and risk management process and includes 
detail around the following matters:
 X Risk reporting structure
 X Identification
 X Methodology and classification
 X Risk appetite
 X Group Risk Register
 X Reporting and monitoring framework.

Reserve 
replacement
The Group’s  
long term future 
success depends 
on its ability to find, 
develop and 
acquire additional 
oil and gas 
reserves that are 
economically 
recoverable.
Link to strategy:  
1
Generally, while the Group’s current reserves are 
being depleted by production, unsuccessful 
exploration activities, such as dry wells, would 
mean that the Group would not be able to replace 
such reserves and the Group’s revenue would 
decline. The Group may not be able to find or 
acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
which could have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s business, results of operations, financial 
condition and/or prospects.
The Group’s current reserves are being depleted at a 
low rate. Once production from Karish and Epsilon 
commences, depletion is expected to be significantly 
increased and hence the Group may have to increase 
the number of exploration wells drilled or discovered 
reserves acquired through M&A activity to maintain 
the same reserves position.
 X Drilling of low risk, material exploration prospects in the Group’s 
portfolio.
 X Seeking new venture opportunities and other projects, including 
additions to the Group’s exploration portfolio and the acquisition 
of additional stranded oil/gas Resources and conversion to 
Reserves via maturation of development projects.
 X Continuing to manage exploration at an acceptable cost level.
 X De-risking of the Group’s existing exploration portfolio by 
acquisition of additional seismic data.
 X Continuing to maintain a strong technical and commercial team 
with successful track record in exploration and marginal field 
development.
Geopolitical
The geopolitical 
situation in Israel 
may adversely 
affect the Group’s 
business.
Link to strategy:  
2
As the Group has assets located in and offshore 
Israel, political, economic and military conditions 
in Israel may directly affect the Group’s business. 
The Group’s development and/or future production 
operations with respect to the Karish-T anin 
Development, although subject to security 
measures required by law and under the Lease 
requirements, could be specifically targeted. 
 X Active monitoring of the political, economic and social situation 
in Israel.
 X Ensuring that the offshore facilities are appropriately equipped  
and protected.
 X Monitoring and adhering to local laws and regulations.
Health, Safety and Environmental Risks
Health,  
Safety and the 
Environment
The Group is 
obliged to comply 
with health and 
safety and 
environmental 
regulations and 
cannot guarantee 
that it will be able to 
comply with these 
regulations.
Link to strategy:  
1
 
2
The Group operates in an industry that is 
inherently hazardous and consequently subject 
to comprehensive regulation. Although the 
Group considers that it has adequate 
procedures in place to mitigate operational risks 
and keeps these under review, there can be no 
assurances that these will be adequate and 
failure to adequately mitigate risks may result in 
loss of life, injury, or adverse impacts on the 
health of employees, contractors or third parties

Strategy:
Principal risks and uncertainties
This section describes the material existing and emerging risks 
which the Board believes could significantly impact the ability of 
the Group to meet its strategic objectives.
The Directors of the Company confirm that they have carried out 
a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, 
including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.
Risk reporting
The Board has delegated to the Audit and Risk Committee the 
responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s 
systems of internal control and risk management methodology.
As part of this review, the Audit and Risk Committee considers 
the principal risks facing the Group and the nature and extent of 
these risks, based on assessments by management and the 
Group’s Internal Auditors. The Group outsources its Internal Audit 
function, which also provides independent assurance over the 
effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal 
control. The detailed assessments are then consolidated to 
provide input into the overall Group risk assessment.

Project Execution & Production Operations Risks
Project Execution
The Group’s 
success will be 
partly dependent 
upon completing 
the Karish-Tanin 
Development on 
budget and on 
schedule.
Link to strategy: 
1
 
2
The Karish-Tanin Development is in its early 
stages. Whilst the design and execution strategy 
have been developed so as to mitigate risk, in 
particular in a country with a strong 
environmental lobby, by carrying out processing 
offshore, there remain risks in ensuring that 
project delivery is on budget and on schedule. 
Any delay in project delivery could have an 
impact under the Group’s Gas Sales and 
Purchase Contracts.
 X Strong compliance with local law requirements, regular interface 
meetings with the authorities and pro-active engagement with 
local stakeholders, to ensure environmental approvals are 
obtained in a timely manner.
 X Disciplined lump sum, turnkey engineering, procurement, 
construction, installation and commissioning ‘EPCIC’ Contract 
with TechnipFMC for the construction of the FPSO and subsurface 
facilities (which Contract includes liquidated damages, including 
for the event of delay).
 X Monthly reporting on the status, risks, opportunities and budget  
of the Karish-Tanin development.
 X Effective contract management, with a focus on minimising variations 
and close management of contingencies and variable items.
 X Focus on the critical path and regular progress meetings.
Production
The Group’s 
success will  
be partly 
dependent 
upon continuing 
production 
from Prinos.
Link to strategy: 
1
The Group’s current oil and gas production and 
related revenue are obtained entirely from the 
Prinos basin, located offshore in northeast 
Greece.
The Group is therefore exposed to the effect of 
disruption, delays or interruptions of production 
from wells in this area.
 X Continuous focus on and investment in HSE.
 X Committed in house reservoir engineers and production 
technologists working on Prinos reservoir management, 
supplemented with outsourced consultants/experts.
 X Continuous review of well design and performance, in 
particular with a view to minimise unexpected or additional well 
maintenance.
 X Monthly reporting on the status, risks, opportunities and budget  
of the Prinos development.
 X Management and maintenance of facilities, with a focus on 
ensuring that unplanned work-overs, shutdowns and expenditure 
are minimised.
 X Compliance with asset licence and applicable laws and 
regulations.
 X Continuous and rigorous focus on cost control.
Major cyber or 
information 
security incident
Link to strategy:

A cyber-attack could compromise the Group’s 
network and have a disruptive or destructive 
impact resulting in stopped production, 
explosion or loss of life. 
Any loss or theft of confidential information 
could lead to loss of competitive advantage and 
intellectual property and reputational damage.
 X Continuous implementation and monitoring of the Company’s  
IT Security Policy, which includes measures to protect against  
cyber-attacks.
 X Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing.
 X Employee awareness of confidentiality through internal policies 
(including the Group’s Corporate Culture and Business Ethics 
policy) and awareness training. 
 X Control of disclosures and protection of any disclosed confidential 
information in third party contracts.

Principal Risk Potential Impact Mitigation
Financial Risks
Compliance with 
Financial 
Covenants
The Group has 
secured loan 
agreements and is 
subject to restrictive 
debt covenants and 
security 
arrangements that 
may limit its ability 
to finance its future 
operations and 
capital needs and 
to pursue business 
opportunities and 
activities. Breach of 
financial covenants 
may lead to default 
and/or liquidity risk.
Link to strategy:  
4
Under the terms of the Reserve Based Lending 
(‘RBL’) Senior Facility Agreement and the 
Subordinated Facility Agreement and the 
Karish-Tanin Project Financing, the Group 
must comply with a number of covenants 
including financial maintenance covenants 
and restrictions on, among other matters, 
dividends and other distributions, cash 
movements, capital expenditure, additional 
future borrowings and indebtedness, and 
disposals and acquisitions. The breach of any 
of these covenants could result in part of the 
loan amounts becoming unavailable or to an 
event of default, in which case all amounts 
owed to the lenders would be due and payable 
immediately.
 X All loans are project based, not corporate loans, that have been 
sized and structured on conservative price, cost and production 
assumptions.
 X Regular monitoring of financial covenants on an actual and 
forecast basis as part of the monthly reporting to management 
and the Board. 
 X Adhering to the Facility Compliance Calendar, which outlines 
covenant requirements, due dates and the frequency of reporting. 
Treasury and 
trading
The Group is 
exposed to 
treasury and 
trading risks, 
including foreign 
exchange and 
commodity  
price risk.
Link to strategy: 
4
The Group is exposed to changes in 
currency values as a result of its international 
operations in various foreign currencies. The 
key sources of the risk include loan agreements 
denominated in the U.S. dollar, sales of crude 
oil remunerated in U.S. dollar, ongoing 
operating costs and capital expenditures 
incurred in EUR, USD and to a lesser extent 
GBP and NOK.
The Group is exposed to commodity prices in 
relation to its sales and revenues under the 
crude and gas sales, which are subject to 
variable market factors. A decrease in these 
commodity prices could significantly impact 
the Group’s cash flows and results.
The Group has a centralised Treasury function which manages 
currency exchange, interest rate and commodity risks, with 
mitigations including:
 X Currency risk
–  Regular updates and revisions of short and long term 
expenditure budgets and cash flow projections, applying 15% 
sensitivity on EUR:USD movements
–  Short term EUR:USD hedging for fixed inelastic EUR 
denominated expenditures.
–  Negotiation of large capital expenditure, commitments and 
contractual obligations in USD denominations. The Group 
plans to exercise the option under the Technip EPCIC contract 
and fix the non USD component of the payment plan in USD.
–  All Group loans are USD denominated.
 X Commodity price risk
–  The Group has hedged 450 thousand bbls of production 
for 2018 at a price of approximately USD69.4/bbl.
–  The Group actively monitors oil price movements and will 
proceed in hedging part of its proved and producing barrel 
sales profile for a tenor of no more than 12 months.
–  All Karish-Tanin gas contracts are based on pricing formulas 
which include floor prices; that ensures a minimum price for 
gas sales whatever the market conditions or pricing formulas 
outcome. 
–  Group’s debt facilities have been sized and structured on 
conservative oil and gas price assumptions versus the 
prevailing market prices.

Liquidity risk and 
restricted funding
The Group not 
having adequate 
liquidity and/or 
access to the 
necessary funding 
sources in order to 
meet its minimum 
opex, capex and 
financing 
commitments as 
well as its growth 
and expansion 
plans.
Link to strategy:

Lack of necessary liquidity and access to 
funding may materially impact the Group’s plans 
to develop its existing assets, meet production 
targets and execute its strategic growth plan.
 X At least monthly monitoring of 6-18 month cash flow projections 
under a number of reasonable worst case assumptions, which 
include downside sensitivities on oil price, cost and production 
levels.
 X Optimisation of debt capital structure. 
 X Strong long term relationship with major international and local 
financial institutions. 
 X The Karish-Tanin development has secured funding to First Gas by 
a combination of committed equity funding and the Karish-Tanin 
project finance.
 X Epsilon development has secured funding to First Oil by a 
combination of ongoing operating cash flow from Prinos field and 
the RBL Facility.
 X Major turnkey EPCIC contracts for both Karish-Tanin and Epsilon 
development to minimise the risk of cost overruns and ensure 
adequate liquidated damages are payable in case of project 
execution delays. 
Counterparty Risk
The Group being 
exposed to delayed 
payment, 
counterparty 
default or 
suspension or 
termination of 
sales. 
Link to strategy: 
4
All of the Group’s production of crude oil from 
the Prinos basin is currently sold to a single 
Buyer, BP, under a long-term offtake agreement. 
The Group is consequently reliant on BP for 
substantially all of its revenue. 
If the offtake agreement with BP was 
terminated, the Group would need to negotiate 
and enter into a new offtake contract. During any 
such negotiations, the Group may not be able to 
sell any of its oil from the Prinos basin, which 
would have an adverse effect on the Group’s 
business, results of operations, financial 
condition and/or prospects.
 X In Q1 2018, the offtake agreement was extended to 2025  
on same terms.
 X The Group has built a strong relationship with BP and the 
contractual terms have been applied since 2013 without disputes 
and/or payment defaults and/or lifting delays.
 X Focus on maintaining delivery of production.
 X BP is an investment grade A- credit rated company with minimal 
risk of being unable to meet its lifting and payment obligations 
under the Prinos offtake agreement.
Governance and Compliance Risks
Fraud, bribery and 
corruption
The Group has an 
obligation to 
comply with fraud, 
anti-bribery, 
anti-corruption and 
anti-money 
laundering laws 
and violations of 
these laws expose 
the Group and / or 
its employees to 
criminal 
ramifications.  
Link to strategy

The Group is exposed to bribery and corruption 
risk through its business operations. 
Any instances of non-compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations, including those 
laws around fraud, anti-bribery, anti-corruption 
and anti-money laundering, could damage the 
reputation of the Group. In addition, these could 
result in litigation, regulatory action and fines 
which may have a material adverse impact on 
our cash flows and the financial condition of the 
Group.
 X Strong oversight and leadership from the Executive Management 
and the Board.
 X Robust framework of controls to monitor all payment approvals.
 X Compliance with governance policies, including the Group’s 
Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, which sets out the Group’s 
responsibilities, as well as those of its employees, in observing 
and upholding its position on bribery. The policy also provides 
information and guidance to those working for the Group on how  
to recognise and deal with bribery and corruption issues.
 X Anti-Bribery training of Group personnel.
 X Compliance with the Group’s Corporate Culture and Business 
Ethics Policy which includes the Group’s policy of conducting all its 
business in an honest and ethical manner and in compliance with 
all applicable laws, including but not limited to all applicable local 
laws where the Group operates and the Bribery Act 2010.

basisofpreparation,theunderlying
assumptions,thecomputationof

the periodandsensitivityanalysis.
The Directors have determined that the three-year period to 
December 2020 is an appropriate period to underpin their Viability 
Statement. In the first quarter of 2021 the Group’s Karish asset is 
expected to be on-stream delivering a long-term source of funds.
For the purpose of our viability assessment a three-year financial 
model was used as a base-case scenario. Considering the 
shorter assessment period as compared to the impairment 
testing model, we assessed that the base-case scenario is most 
sensitive to the following assumptions: 
 X Implementation of the drilling programme in Prinos, which 
is based on the most recent NSAI reserve report. The drilling 
programme is based on the required programme to produce 
all 2P reserves and does not cover any of the contingent 
resource base; 
 X No commercial gas is assumed to be produced; and
 X Having signed the US$1.275bn Facility Agreement and raised 
the equity required to develop Karish through a premium 
listing on the London Stock Exchange, the Group has limited 
its balance sheet and capital expenditure exposure to the 
project over the period to first quarter of 2021 when the asset 
will be ready to come on-stream.
For the purpose of sensitivity testing, several principal risks and 
uncertainties were selected (from those described on pages 
49–52), which were deemed to have the highest potential 
financial impact on the Group’s future performance and liquidity, 
taking into account prior period assessments.
The effect of those principal risks and uncertainties or their 
combination on the base-case scenario were analysed within 
following scenarios: 
 X Deterioration in the business and market environment: taking 
into account that the oil price assumptions applied in the base 
case scenario were based on conservative projections by 
institutional analysts, this scenario was aimed at analysing the 
sensitivity to a further 15% reduction in the oil prices over the 
period of assessment; 
 X a 20% decrease in development of proved and probable 
reserves (2P): and analysing the sensitivity to a further 
15% reduction in the production volumes over the period 
of assessment; 
 X a Reasonable Worst Case (RWC) scenario: a combination 
of 15% reduction in the base case price, 20% decrease in 
production volumes together with impact of a 2 month delay 
in production from new wells to come on stream during the 
forecast period; 
The scenarios took into account the availability and likely 
effectiveness of any mitigating actions that are in place or could 
be implemented such as hedging, additional funding options and 
further rationalisation of our cost base including cuts to 
discretionary capital expenditure.
Based on the results of the analysis the Board of Directors has a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of its assessment.

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to welcome you to our first Corporate Governance 
report on behalf of the Board. In this, we provide a description  
of our governance arrangements and explain how we will apply 
the main principles of the provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Governance Code’) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC). We believe it is important that the 
governance structure supports the success of the Company’s 
strategy and ensures the creation and preservation of 
shareholder value, as well as benefiting other stakeholders.
I look forward to working with the Board, management and  
all of our stakeholders as we become a leading independent  
oil and gas exploration and production company in the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 
The Board and governance
Our Board was formed in 2017, following incorporation of the 
Company and prior to the IPO in March 2018. In preparation  
for listing, the Board reviewed and expanded its policies,  
where necessary, with the aim of strengthening the Group’s 
governance framework.
The Board plays a vital role in developing and maintaining the 
Group’s culture and values by setting the ‘tone from the top’, 
determining the behaviours expected by the Board and ensuring 
that ethical standards are maintained. In doing so, the Board aims 
to strike the right balance between entrepreneurial leadership and 
the prudent and effective management of risk, both of which are 
essential to maintaining a sustainable business and creating 
value for shareholders.
Corporate governance
Chairman’s letter
Diversity
The Board understands the benefits of diversity in maintaining 
and improving the quality of performance and all Board 
appointments are made against objective criteria and with  
due regard to the benefits of diversity, in all senses.
The Board will be establishing a Board diversity policy in 2018 and 
we look forward to presenting the key principles of the new policy 
and how it has been implemented in the 2018 Annual Report. 
Board evaluation 
As the IPO took place in March 2018, the Board did not undertake 
an evaluation during 2017. However, the Board has discussed the 
benefits of undertaking a review and an internal review of Board 
effectiveness will be undertaken in 2018. The internal review will 
focus on the governance policies and procedures which we have 
introduced and will play a key role in identifying any areas for 
further improvement in our corporate governance framework.
Engagement with shareholders 
We place emphasis on active engagement with our shareholders 
and aim to maintain open and transparent communication.  
We laid the foundations for this ongoing shareholder dialogue  
as we progressed through the listing process, and look to 
continue this through 2018 and beyond. 
Looking ahead, I expect 2018 to be an important year for 
Energean as the Group continues to grow and focus on the 
development of Karish and Tanin. In this context, developing and 
maintaining the high standards of governance established to date 
will be of critical importance. 
I look forward to engaging with many shareholders throughout 
the year and welcoming all shareholders to our first Annual 
General Meeting on 28 June 2018.

Corporate governance report
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate 
and the responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer are independently defined. It is the Chairman’s 
responsibility to provide leadership of the Board and set the board 
agenda as well as to ensure that the Board is provided with 
accurate, timely and clear information in relation to the Group and 
its business. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting 
the overall objectives and strategic direction of the Group as well 
as having day-to-day executive responsibility for the running of 
the Company’s businesses. The Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer will share responsibility for the representation of the 
Company to third parties.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have a broad range of business 
and commercial experience. They provide independent and 
constructive challenge to the Group and monitor the performance 
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer 
against the Group’s strategy and key objectives.
Each appointment is for an unlimited term, subject to being 
re-elected as a director at each annual general meeting. A 
Non-Executive Director or the Company may terminate the 
appointment at any time upon three months’ written notice. 
These appointments are subject to the provisions of the Articles, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and 
related legislation.
The role of the Senior Independent Director, Andrew Bartlett, 
is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to serve 
as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. 
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if 
they have concerns which contact through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer 
has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate.
Independence of Directors 
The Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, who was 
independent on appointment, two Executive Directors and 
six Non-Executive Directors. The Company considers all of the 
Non-Executive Directors to be independent within the meaning  
of ‘independent’ as defined in the Code, other than David 
Bonanno and Efstathios Topouzoglou.
While each of Mr Bonanno and Mr Topouzoglou are considered to 
be independent in character and judgement, David Bonanno is 
not deemed to be independent by reference to the criteria set out 
in the Code as a result of representing Third Point Hellenic 
Recovery (Lux) S.Á. R.L., which holds approximately 26.7% of the 
shares of the Company, while Efstathiou Topouzoglou is not 
deemed to be independent by reference to the criteria set out in 
the Code as a result of owning in aggregate (as an individual and 
by his indirect holdings in both Oilco Investments Limited and HIL 
Hydrocarbon Investments Limited) approximately 11.7% of the 
shares of the Company.
Statement of compliance
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Since Admission on 21 March 2018, the Board 
has and will continue to comply with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). In this report, we 
describe our corporate governance arrangements and explain 
how the Group applies the principles of the Code. The Code 
is available from www.frc.org.uk.
Directors
New Directors were appointed to the Board in 2017 in anticipation 
of the admission of the Company’s ordinary shares to the 
premium listing segment of the FCA and to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange’s main market of listed securities. Following the 
appointment of the Independent Non-Executive Directors in 2017, 
the Board believes it has an appropriate balance of skills and 
experience and meets Code provision B.1.2 for at least half the 
board, excluding the Chairman, to comprise Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board
The Board plans to meet on at least five occasions 
during the course of 2018 to review trading performance 
and budgets, funding, to set and monitor strategy, 
examine acquisition opportunities and report to 
shareholders. The Board may also meet at other times 
at the request of one or more of the Directors. The Board 
has a formal schedule of matters that can only be 
decided by the Board, and this schedule is reviewed by 
the Board each year. The key matters reserved are the 
consideration and approval of:
 X Business plan and 
budgets 
 X Group strategy 
 X Performance review
 X Operation as a listed 
company
 X Financial reporting and 
controls
 X Distributions and 
dividends
 X Changes in capital 
structure
 X Capital expenditure
 X Board membership
 X Acquisitions and 
disposals
 X Material contracts
 X Material tenders
 X The appointment and 
removal of internal and 
external auditors
 X Material litigation
 X Compliance with 
statutory and 
regulatory obligations
 X Approval of press 
releases
 X Internal controls and 
risk management
 X Significant transactions
 X Executive remuneration
 X Delegations of authority
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination and Governance Committee reviews the 
structure, size and composition of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board about any changes required. 
The Executive Directors, Mathios Rigas and Panos Benos, 
were appointed as directors on incorporation of the Company. 
Board committees
The Board has established four committees made up principally 
of Independent Non-Executive Directors and all appointments 
to these committees shall be for an initial period of up to three 
years and may be extended by no more than two additional 
three year periods. These committees are:
 X Audit and risk committee (pages 62–63)
 X Nomination and governance committee (page 64) 
 X Health, safety and environment committee (page 65) 
 X Remuneration committee (pages 66–67)
The page numbers above denote the location of each committee 
report which describes the composition and focus for each of 
the committees. The terms of reference of the committees have 
been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Code. 
A copy of each committee’s terms of reference is available from 
the Company Secretary and can be found at www.energean.com.
Board effectiveness 
Evaluations 
The Board is committed to undertaking regular reviews of its 
effectiveness and believes such a process can add value to 
the way the Board, committees and individual directors operate. 
The Board plans for a formal, internal evaluation of its own 
performance, that of its committees and the individual directors  
to take place for the year 2018. More generally, it will also review  
the Group’s overall corporate governance arrangements, and the 
Group will report on these matters in the 2018 Annual Report.
Training and development 
Board members are provided with ongoing training and 
development opportunities. 
Development needs are discussed during annual performance 
reviews with the Chairman. In 2017, Board members were 
provided with training on a number of topics including their 
obligations under the Listing Rules, Prospectus Rules, The 
Disclosure Guidance & Transparency Rules and the Market  
Abuse Regulation. 
Induction 
On joining the Board all new Directors will receive an induction 
programme that is tailored to their individual requirements. The 
induction schedule is facilitated by the Company Secretary in 
consultation with the Chairman and the new Director.
The objective of each induction programme is to provide an 
overview of the business, strategy, finances, the Group’s history 
and culture and values and to ensure that the new Director gains 
sufficient knowledge of the business to allow them to carry out 
their role effectively.
Relationship with shareholders 
Engagement with shareholders 
We are committed to regular dialogue with our shareholders 
and the wider investment community and this process 
commenced with the IPO preparations. Ongoing communications 
will be through regulatory announcements, regular meetings, 
presentations, investor conferences and ad hoc events.
Shareholders can access details of the Group’s results and 
other new releases through the London Stock Exchange’s 
Regulatory News Service, and all news releases are published 
on the Investors and Media sections of the Group’s website:  
www.energean.com.
Annual General Meeting 
The 2018 AGM will be held on 28 June 2018 and shareholders 
will receive presentations setting out the key developments in 
the Group and have an opportunity to ask questions of the Board.
A poll will be used to for all resolutions and the final results will 
be announced via the London Stock Exchange Regulatory News 
Service and on the Group’s website.

Audit and risk  
committee report
The Audit and Risk Committee shall additionally review the 
Group’s capability to identify and manage new types of risk, and 
keep under review the Group’s overall risk assessment processes 
that inform the Board’s decision making. 
The Audit and Risk Committee will consider annually how the 
Group’s internal audit requirements shall be satisfied and make 
recommendations to the Board accordingly as well as on any 
area it deems needs improvement or action.
Meetings 
The Audit and Risk Committee became effective upon 
Admission in March 2018, therefore no meetings were held 
in 2017. The committee plans to meet three times in 2018. 
Any member of the committee, the Company’s external  
auditors or its internal auditors may however request a  
meeting if he/she considers that one is necessary or expedient.
Key matters considered in relation to 
the consolidated financial statements 
The Audit and Risk Committee focused on a number of key 
judgements and reporting issues in the preparation of the full 
year results and the annual report. In particular, the committee 
considered, discussed and where appropriate challenged: 
 X As at 31 December 2017, the Group held a commitment to 
acquire 70% of preference shares in Energean Israel Limited 
from the Founders
1
 (50%) and Kerogen Investments No. 38 
Limited (20%). A derivative asset of USD 93.4 million  
was recognised in the accounts, using an estimate as  
at 31 December 2017 of the likelihood of the IPO being 
successful and the exercise price. The committee challenged 
and supported this valuation. The IPO and consequently  
this transaction were successfully executed after the end  
of the accounting period. 
 X The viability statement in the 2017 annual report and the  
going concern basis of accounting including consideration  
of evidence of the Group’s capital, liquidity and funding position. 
The committee considered the assessment of principal risks, 
assessed the Group’s prospects in light of its current position 
and reviewed the disclosures on behalf of the Board.  
The committee supported the viability statement and  
the Directors’ going concern conclusion. 
Assessment of annual report 
A requirement of the Code is that the annual report is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy. This is 
the Group’s first annual report and, in order to support the 
assessment, the Committee reviewed the principal risks, 
business model, financial review and KPIs to ensure these 
were representative of the business and consistent throughout 
the report and that areas requiring significant judgement and 
explanation have due prominence.
Membership of the committee 
The other members of the Audit and Risk Committee are  
Ohad Marani and Robert Peck. 
The committee’s members are all Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, and therefore the composition of the committee 
complies with the Code. Members’ skills and experience are 
documented on pages 56–59. The Board is satisfied that the 
committee meets the requirement to have recent and relevant 
financial experience and that as a whole we have sufficient 
experience of the oil and gas sector.
Role of the committee 
The Audit and Risk Committee’s role is to assist the Board with 
discharging its responsibilities in relation to financial reporting, 
including monitoring the integrity of the Group’s annual and 
half year financial statements, reviewing the Group’s accounting 
policies, reviewing the Group’s internal financial controls, 
reviewing and monitoring the scope of the annual audit and 
the extent of the non-audit work undertaken by external auditors, 
advising on the appointment of external auditors and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the internal audit, whistleblowing and fraud 
systems in place within the Group. 
I am pleased to present this Audit and Risk 
Committee Report for the year ended 31 
December 2017, which sets out the role 
of the committee and key areas of focus 
for 2018 since the committee recently 
became effective in March 2018. 
The Committee believes that the disclosures set out in the  
annual report provide the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s position, performance, business model  
and strategic outlook.
Internal controls and risk management 
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight 
of the Group’s system of internal controls, including the risk 
management framework and the work of the internal audit 
function. Details of the risk management framework are discussed 
within the risk management section on pages 47–48. The Group’s 
principal risks and uncertainties, which provide a framework for the 
committee’s focus, are discussed on pages 49–52. Management 
has identified the key operational and financial processes which 
exist within the business and has developed an internal control 
framework. This is structured around a number of Group policies 
and procedures and includes a delegated authority framework.
Internal auditors 
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for the review 
and approval of the role and mandate of Internal Audit, including 
the approval of the annual internal audit plan and monitoring 
the effectiveness of Internal Audit. 
PwC LLP was appointed in January 2018 for a term of three years 
as the Group’s outsourced internal audit function (‘Internal Audit’) 
following a tender process. Its key objectives are to provide 
independent and objective assurance on risks and controls, 
to the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee and senior 
management, and to assist the Board in meeting its corporate 
governance responsibilities. The long term Internal Audit plan 
for 2018, 2019 and 2020 was approved by the Audit and Risk 
Committee in April 2018, as well as a short term Internal Audit 
plan for 2018. Going forward, the plans will be reviewed annually. 
The committee’s chair has established a positive and effective 
working relationship with Internal Audit.
In its annual assessment of the effectiveness of Internal Audit, 
the Audit and Risk Committee will:
 X Meet with Internal Audit without the presence of 
management to discuss the effectiveness of the function 
 X Review and re-assess the internal audit work plan; and 
 X Monitor and assess the role and effectiveness of Internal Audit 
in the overall context of the Group’s risk management. 
External auditors 
Ernst and Young LLP (‘EY’ and the ‘External Auditor’) were 
appointed as auditors in 2018 and undertook their first audit 
for the year ended 31 December 2017. Energean Oil and Gas plc 
became a Public Interest Entity in 2018 on admission to trading 
on the London Stock Exchange. The Company has to comply 
with the EU Audit Directive (2014/56/EU) and Audit Regulation 
(537/2014) and will be required to put the external audit 
contract out to tender by 2028. The current lead audit partner 
is Andrew Smyth. 
The External Auditor will attend each meeting of the Audit 
and Risk Committee and will report on their audit work and 
conclusions including the appropriateness of the judgements 
made by management and their compliance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards.
The Audit and Risk Committee has responsibility for the 
oversight of the external audit plan. This includes monitoring 
the independence and objectivity of EY, the quality of the audit 
services and their effectiveness, the level of fees paid, approval 
of non-audit services provided by EY and re-appointment. 
The committee concluded that EY are objective, and operate 
at a high standard and will be recommending to the Board that 
the External Auditor be re-appointed at this year’s AGM for the 
financial year ending 31 December 2018.
Non-audit services
In order to safeguard the auditor’s independence and objectivity, 
the Group has in place a policy setting out the circumstances 
in which the auditor may be engaged to provide services other 
than those covered by the Group audit. The policy complies 
with the FRC’s Ethical Standard for Auditors, published in 
September 2015, which implemented the EU’s revised 
Statutory Audit Directive.
The Policy sets out those types of services that are strictly 
prohibited and those that are allowable in principle (permissible 
services). Any service types that do not fall within either list are 
considered by the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman on a 
case by case basis, supported by a risk assessment prepared 
by management.
No fees were paid during 2017 to EY, for audit or non-audit services.
Whistleblowing policy
The Group has a Whistleblowing policy in place and the 
committee is responsible for overseeing the arrangements and 
the effectiveness of the processes. The policy exists to enable 
employees to raise concerns in confidence about wrongdoing 
or impropriety within the Group.
Performance of the committee 
The performance of the Audit and Risk Committee will be 
assessed by way of an internal process in 2018.
Our priorities for 2018
Looking forward to 2018, the committee will focus on monitoring 
the implementation of the short term Internal Audit plan for 2018 
and it will review this towards the end of 2018.

committee report
Meetings
The Nomination and Governance Committee became effective 
upon Admission in March 2018, therefore no meetings were held 
in 2017. The committee plans to meet once in 2018. Any member 
of the committee may however request a meeting if he/she 
considers that one is necessary or expedient.
Diversity 
The committee’s key area of responsibility is to ensure the 
composition of the Board is appropriate for oversight of the 
strategic direction of the Group and this includes reviewing  
the balance of skills and knowledge. The Nomination and 
Governance Committee is aware of the benefits of diversity  
in the boardroom and believes that a wide range of experience, 
backgrounds, perspectives and skills generates effective 
decision-making.
The Board will be establishing a board diversity policy in 2018 and 
we look forward to presenting the key principles of the new policy 
and how it has been implemented in the 2018 Annual Report.
Board effectiveness 
As reported earlier on page 55, an evaluation of Board effectiveness 
will take place during 2018. The Company Secretary will facilitate an 
internal self-assessment of the Board and committees. 
Performance of the committee 
The performance of the Nomination and Governance Committee 
will be assessed by way of an internal process in 2018.
Our priorities for 2018
In 2018, the Nomination and Governance Committee will focus 
on succession planning to ensure the Group retains senior 
executives with the necessary skills and knowledge to remain 
effective and the committee will work alongside the Board to 
prepare and implement the board diversity policy.
Simon Heale 
Nomination and Governance Committee Chairman 
30 April 2018
It is my pleasure to introduce the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
Report for 2017, which sets out the 
composition and role of the committee 
and the areas of focus for 2018. 
Membership 
The other members of the Nomination and Governance 
Committee are Andrew Bartlett and Efstathios Topouzoglou. 
The Code recommends that a majority of the members of  
the Nomination and Governance Committee be Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and that the Chairman (other than where 
the committee is dealing with the appointment of a successor  
to the chairmanship) or an Independent Non-Executive Director 
should chair the committee. As I was considered to be 
independent upon appointment as Chairman and Andrew Bartlett 
is considered to be an Independent Non-Executive, we believe 
that the Company complies with the requirements of the Code  
in this respect.
Role of the committee 
The Nomination and Governance Committee assists the Board  
in reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board, 
including providing advice to the Board on the retirement and 
appointment of additional and/or replacement Directors. It is  
also responsible for reviewing succession plans for the Directors, 
including the Chairman and Chief Executive and other senior 
executives.

considers that one is necessary or expedient. .
Performance of the committee 
The performance of the Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee will be assessed by way of an internal process in 2018.
Our priorities for 2018
In 2018, the Health, Safety and Environment Committee will focus 
on reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s policies and 
systems for identifying the risk of major accidents and conduct 
assurance of the key health, safety and environmental controls

expects to review the Group’s plans for an enhanced Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy.
Robert Peck

Remuneration report
Remuneration strategy
The Company’s remuneration strategy is to provide pay  
packages that will:
 X motivate and retain industry leading employees;
 X attract high quality individuals to join the Company;
 X encourage and support a high performance culture;
 X reward delivery of the Company’s business plan and  
key strategic goals; and
 X align employees with the interests of shareholders  
and other external stakeholders.
Executive Directors’ remuneration
Consistent with the remuneration strategy, the Remuneration 
Committee has agreed a remuneration policy for the Executive 
Directors, whereby:
 X salaries are set at competitive, but not excessive, levels 
compared to peers and other companies of an equivalent  
size and complexity;
 X performance-related pay, based on stretching targets,  
forms a significant part of remuneration packages; and
 X there is an appropriate balance between rewards for delivery 
of short-term and longer-term performance targets.
The remuneration framework intended to deliver this policy  
for the Executive Directors will be a combination of base salary, 
benefits, annual and deferred bonuses and awards under the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Due to the provisions of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers 
as regards shareholders who may act in concert with each other, 
it is currently intended that the Executive Directors’ deferred 
bonus and LTIP awards will be granted as phantom share awards 
to be settled in cash. As and when those provisions are no longer 
applicable, a more standard equity settlement approach will  
be adopted.
Executive Directors’ remuneration will usually be reviewed 
annually and assessed taking into account the scope and 
requirements of the role, experience of the individual and the  
total remuneration package. Account will also be taken of 
remuneration arrangements in peer companies and the wider 
employee group. 
Remuneration arrangements for 2018 are summarised below.
2018 
base salary
Mathios Rigas (Chief Executive Officer) £675,000
Panos Benos (Chief Financial Officer) £450,000
The Company was only recently admitted to the main market  
of the London Stock Exchange, on 21 March 2018. Consequently,  
as the Company was not listed during 2017, the Companies Act 
does not require the production of a Remuneration Report in 
respect of 2017. However, in the interests of transparency, the 
Board has decided that it would be appropriate to include a form 
of Remuneration Report in this Annual Report in order to outline  
the remuneration structure for 2018.
Membership of the Remuneration Committee
The other members of the Remuneration Committee are  
Andrew Bartlett, David Bonanno and Robert Peck.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee’s primary role is to determine  
and agree with the Board the executive remuneration policy and 
approve individual remuneration arrangements for the Chairman 
and Executive Directors with the objective of ensuring that the 
levels of remuneration are sufficient to promote the long-term 
success of the Company.
Benefits
Mathios Rigas receives a benefits package worth £75,000 per 
annum and Panos Benos receives a benefits package worth 
£50,000 per annum.
Annual bonus
Consistent with best practice for UK listed companies, a cap  
has been introduced on the maximum annual bonus opportunity. 
In 2018 the Executive Directors will be able to earn a bonus up  
to a maximum of 150% of base salary. At least one-third of any 
bonus earned by the Executive Directors in 2018 will be deferred 
for two years.
Bonuses in 2018 will be determined by a combination of financial, 
strategic and operational Company measures and performance 
measures appropriate to the individual Executive Director’s role. 
These measures are currently commercially sensitive. However, 
retrospective disclosure will be provided in the next Remuneration 
Report to the extent that they do not remain commercially 
sensitive at that time. 
Malus and clawback provisions may be applied to a bonus up to 
three years from the determination of the bonus.
LTIP
An LTIP award will be granted to the Executive Directors during 
2018 worth (at grant) 200% of salary. Performance conditions for 
this award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee at 
the time of grant and will be disclosed in the next Remuneration 
Report. At least 50% of this award will be based on relative Total 
Shareholder Return. 
The LTIP award granted to the Executive Directors in 2018 will  
be subject to a three year performance period and two year 
holding period. 
Malus and clawback provisions may be applied to LTIP awards  
up to the fifth anniversary of grant.
Shareholding guideline
Executive Directors are subject to share ownership guidelines that 
require them to build up and retain a shareholding worth 200% of 
their base salary. Until an Executive Director has satisfied their 
guideline, they are required to retain at least 50% of vested share 
awards (after selling sufficient shares to satisfy any tax liabilities 
upon vesting).
Notice period
The Company, or the relevant Executive Director, may terminate 
the appointment of that Executive Director at any time upon six 
months’ written notice.
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee plus supplementary 
fees for roles with additional time commitment. The fee structure 
that has applied since Admission is summarised below.
Annual fee
Company Chairman £150,000
Basic Non-Executive Director fee £50,000
Supplementary fees
 X Audit Committee Chairman £5,000
 X Remuneration Committee Chairman £5,000
 X Health, Safety and Environment Committee 
Chairman
£5,000
 X Senior Independent Director £7,500
Fees may be paid in cash and / or shares. In addition, the 
Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for expenses that

Directors’ report
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors,  
the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act and related 
legislation. The Articles themselves may be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders. The powers of directors are

on request, and the Corporate Governance Statement on page 60.
The authority to issue shares in the Company may only be 
granted by the Company’s shareholders and once granted such 
authority shall be exercised by the Directors.
There are a number of agreements entered into by members of 
the Group that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of 
control of the Company, such as commercial contracts and bank 
loan agreements. None of these are considered to be significant 
in terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group  
as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of  
any agreements between the Company and its Directors  
or employees that provide for compensation for loss of office  
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
for the Group financial statements
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets  
of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for  
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 X the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole;
 X the strategic report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 X the annual report and financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s position and performance, business model  
and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the board  
of directors on 30 April 2018 and is signed on its behalf.
By order of the Board
Mathios Rigas Panos Benos
Chief ExecutiveOfficer  Chief Financial Officer
30 April 2018  30 April 2018
The Directors of the Company are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors 
are required to prepare Group financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company 
law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements,  
the Directors are required to:
 X select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently;
 X make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 X state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework has been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 X prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the parent company 
will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that the Directors:
 X properly select and apply accounting policies;
 X present information, including accounting policies,  
in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable  
and understandable information; 
 X provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable  
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and
 X make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.

Independent auditor’s report  
to the members of Energean Oil & Gas Plc
We are independent of the group and parent company in 
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s 
Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and  
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going 
concern and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following information 
in the annual report, in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us 
to report to you whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to:
 X the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 49–52 
that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 X the directors’ confirmation set out on page 49 in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the entity, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
 X the directors’ statement set out on page 35 in the Financial 
Review section about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve 
months from the date of approval of the financial statements;
 X whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained 
in the audit; or 
 X the directors’ explanation set out on page 53 in the annual report 
as to how they have assessed the prospects of the entity, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period 
to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a 
reasonable expectation that the entity will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period 
of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Risk Our response to the risk
 Key observations communicated  
to the Audit and Risk Committee
Recoverability of oil and gas assets, including 
estimation of oil and gas reserve volumes 
Tangible oil and gas properties: $248.9 million (2016: 
$179.4 million) 
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report (pages 
62–63); Accounting policies; and Notes 3.5, 3.7, 4.2, 6 and 
22 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 
90–126)
This refers to the risk that capitalised costs associated to 
tangible oil and gas assets may be recorded at a level 
that exceeds future recoverable value. In the Energean 
group, we consider this risk to exist predominantly for the 
established assets in Greece.
Accounting standards require management to assess at 
each reporting date whether indicators of asset 
impairment exist. Where indicators of impairment (or 
reversal) exist, management must carry out an 
impairment test.
Management prepare their tangible asset impairment 
tests under the value-in-use methodology. The models 
include a number of accounting estimates and 
judgements performed by management including: 
reserve and resources volume estimates, future oil and 
gas prices, discount rates, production forecasts and 
operating and capital expenditures for each cash 
generating unit (CGU). Changes to one or more of these 
key inputs could lead to a potential impairment or a 
reversal of impairment. 
Procedures to evaluate management’s assessment of 
impairment indicators, in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 36, for the tangible oil and gas assets 
in Greece, included:
 X Assessing the completeness of management’s third 
party reserves and resources report, as well as the 
objectivity and competency of the report authors, and 
verifying input data used within the report;
 X Inspecting management’s reconciliation of the third 
party reserves and resources report with Energean’s 
valuation model to assess economic cut off;
 X The use of EY valuation specialists to assist the audit 
team in assessing the reasonableness of other key 
accounting estimates and judgements prepared by 
management, as well as the valuation methodology 
used by Energean management in the valuation model;
 X Reperforming calculations in management’s valuation 
model to ensure there is a sufficient headroom over 
the carrying value of the oil and gas assets; and
 X Challenging the reasonableness of future production 
assumptions used in management’s valuation model.
We reported to the Audit and Risk 
Committee in the April 2018 meeting that:
 X With respect to the developed 
producing and the undeveloped 
tangible assets, we did not identify 
any further impairment indicators that 
gave rise to issues with recoverable 
value; and
 X Management’s estimates of reserves 
and resources, as well as key 
assumptions used in the valuation 
model, were found to be reasonable.
Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which  
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the  
allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team. We communicated key audit matters  
and our planned response to each risk to the Audit and Risk 
Committee in our March audit planning report. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we  
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk Our response to the risk
 Key observations communicated  
to the Audit and Risk Committee
Assessment of impairment indicators for 
exploration and evaluation intangible assets 
Impairment charge: $6.7 million (2016: $0.0 million)
Intangible exploration and evaluation (‘E&E’) assets: 
$3.4 million (2016: $7.7 million)
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report (pages 
62–63); Accounting policies; and Notes 3.7, 7 and 22 of  
the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 90–126)
The Group’s E&E assets need to be considered for 
impairment in each reporting period in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation  
of Mineral Resources (‘IFRS 6’). The recoverability of 
capitalised costs will depend upon internal and external 
factors, including the terms of the exploration rights and 
allocation of future capital by management, as well as 
technical and economic prospects which could pose a 
risk to the ability to progress intangible assets to the 
development stage.
A lack of consideration of the above factors could lead  
to inappropriate valuation of the assets in the financial 
statements.
Our response was led by the Group audit team, with 
significant input from our two component audit teams 
responsible for two full scope components.
For exploration costs held as intangible assets relating to 
future oil and gas prospects, our procedures included: 
 X Verifying remaining exploration periods, rights 
and associated costs capitalised under licence 
agreements; and
 X Evaluating management’s identification and 
assessment of future development potential and 
whether the impairment recognised is appropriate and 
in line with IFRS 6.
We reported to the Audit and Risk 
Committee in the April 2018 meeting that:
 X With respect to capitalised exploration 
costs held at the balance sheet 
date, we did not identify any further 
indicators of impairment in the 
remaining intangible assets; and
 X The calculated impairment charge 
of $1.2 million was considered to be 
appropriate.
Impact of the Energean Israel reorganisation
Derivative asset: $93.3 million.
Investment in Joint Ventures: $0.0 million (2016:  
$0.0 million).
Refer to the Audit and Risk Committee Report (page 
62–63); Accounting policies; and Notes 4.2, 9, 31.4, 34.2 
and 38 of the Consolidated Financial Statements  
(pages 103–140); and Note 4 of the Company financial 
statements (page 147). 
During 2017 and in the post balance sheet period, 
Energean’s interests in Energean Israel Limited have 
been subject to several structural changes.
At 31 December 2017, the Energean group held certain 
voting rights over Energean Israel Limited but held no 
rights to the economic interests.
During 2017, the Group entered into several contractual 
agreements concerning the ownership of Energean 
Israel Limited. At 31 December 2017, the Energean group 
held a commitment to acquire 70% of preference shares 
in Energean Israel Limited from the Energean founders 
(50%) and from Kerogen Investments No.38 Limited 
(20%), This commitment related to the post balance 
sheet period and would crystallise upon a successful 
Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) or in the event of a sale 
transaction.
Management has recognised a derivative financial 
instrument in the 2017 financial statements ($93.3m 
derivative asset), using an estimate as at 31 December 
2017 of the likelihood of the IPO process being 
successful and the exercise price related to the 
commitment. 
There exists a risk that this arrangement, or the Group’s 
financial interests in Energean Israel Limited, are 
inappropriately accounted for and/or materially 
misstated within the financial statements, due to the 
complexity of the reorganisation agreements and their 
significance to the Group.
The accounting for the commitment to purchase 70%  
of share capital in Energean Israel Limited (which 
management identified as a derivative asset at  
31 December 2017) and the related valuation judgements 
were considered within our audit approach. 
Our procedures focused on understanding the terms of 
the restructuring agreements entered into during 2017 
and the contractual commitments that the Energean 
Group was bound by as a result of such agreements, 
together with the related accounting implications.
We inspected management’s approach to value the 
derivative financial asset, which is based on the estimated 
difference between the consideration payable under the 
relevant agreement and the estimated value of the  
B shares in Energean Israel Limited that were to be 
acquired, and independently performed recalculations 
based on management’s model.
The transaction prices within management’s valuation 
model were agreed to the contractual agreements entered 
into by Energean.
We focused on the key assumptions used by 
management to determine the fair value of the derivative 
financial asset, including the probability of the IPO being 
successful as at 31 December 2017 (50%).
We performed subsequent events procedures in relation 
to the acquisition of the 50% of the preference shares in 
Energean Israel from the Energean founding shareholders 
and an additional 20% of Energean Israel shares from 
Kerogen Investments No.38 Limited, which completed 
prior to the approval of the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts. We considered the adequacy of the disclosures 
regarding this reorganisation in the financial statements 
of the Energean group.
We reported to the Audit and Risk 
Committee in the April 2018 meeting that:
 X We concluded that it is appropriate to 
recognise a derivative financial asset 
in respect of the Energean  
Israel Reorganisation;
 X Management’s estimation of the 
derivative financial asset valuation and 
corresponding profit recognised within 
the year was materially reasonable; 
and
 X Disclosure of the Energean Israel 
Reorganisation and the impact of the 
post balance sheet event relating to 
the Energean Israel reorganisation 
within the financial statements was 
considered appropriate.

Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at 
each of the components by us, as the group audit engagement 
team, or by component auditors from other EY global network 
firms operating under our instruction. For two full scope 
components where the work was performed by two EY 
component teams (Athens and Thessaloniki), we determined the 
appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the group as a whole.
The group audit team interacted regularly with the EY component 
teams during each stage of the audit, were responsible for the 
scope and direction of the audit process and reviewed key 
working papers. The group audit team followed a programme of 
planned visits that was designed to ensure that the group audit 
team members visited the full scope component teams during 
the current year’s audit cycle. These visits involved discussing the 
audit approach with the component team and any issues arising 
from their work, meeting with local management, and reviewing 
key audit working papers on risk areas. The group team 
interacted regularly with the component teams during various 
stages of the audit, reviewed key working papers and were 
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process.  
This, together with the additional procedures performed at  
group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. We maintained continuous 
and open dialogue with our EY component teams in addition to 
holding formal meetings to ensure that we were fully aware of 
their progress and results of their procedures.
Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on 
the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent 
of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be $1.9 million, which 
is 0.5% of total assets as at 31 December 2017, adjusted to 
remove the derivative financial asset connected with the 
Energean Israel Reorganisation ($93.3m) as this was not 
considered part of the underlying business at the year end.  
We believe that adjusted total assets provides us with a suitable 
basis for setting materiality for immature emerging oil and gas 
exploration and production companies, providing a reliable 
measure to assess the size of the group’s operations.
Revenue recognition is a significant risk presumed by ISAs (UK). 
It is not included above, as Energean’s revenue streams are 
largely routine in nature and do not involve significant judgement 
or use of significant estimates. Consequently, the auditing of 
revenue recognition did not have the greatest effect on our  
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit  
or in directing the efforts of the engagement team.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope  
for each entity within the group. Taken together, this enables us to 
form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and 
effectiveness of group-wide controls, and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at 
each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group 
financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 
ten reporting components of the group, we selected all ten 
components covering entities within Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, 
Montenegro, Israel and the United Kingdom, which represent the 
principal business units within the group.
Of the ten components selected, we performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of three components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk 
characteristics. For the remaining seven components, we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within four components 
(“specific scope components”) that we considered had the potential 
for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial 
statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk 
profile. The audit scope of these components may not have included 
testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of the group tested.
The reporting components where we performed full scope and 
specific scope audit procedures accounted for 99% of the group’s 
profit before tax, 99% of revenue and 99% of total assets. 
For the remaining 3 components, we performed other procedures 
including the following to respond to any potential risks of 
material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements:
 X Inspected key documentation surrounding the post 
balance sheet events connected with the Energean Israel 
Reorganisation;
 X Analytical review procedures on a legal entity basis;
 X Tested consolidation journals, intercompany eliminations  
and foreign currency translation recalculations;
 X Made inquiries of management about unusual transactions  
in these components; and
 X Reviewed minutes of Board meetings held throughout the period.
We determined materiality for the parent company to be $4,000, 
which is 1% of net assets.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality 
and no changes were made.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality was 50% of our 
planning materiality, namely $950,000. We have set performance 
materiality at this percentage based on our assessment of 
likelihood of misstatements based on our understanding of the 
group as part of our planning procedures.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining 
audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance 
materiality. The performance materiality set for each component 
is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the 
group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. In the current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to components was $200,000 to $800,000.
We determined performance materiality for the parent company 
to be $2,000, based on the same judgement made for the Group.
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered 
as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would 
report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of 
$95,000, which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
For the parent company, we agreed with the Audit & Risk 
Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected 
differences in excess of $200, based on the same judgement 
made for the Group.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report set out on pages 01 to 71 and 149 – 156, other than 
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The 
directors are responsible for the other information. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated  
in this report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we 
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work  
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of the other information, we are required to  
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our 
responsibility to specifically address the following items in  
the other information and to report as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information where we conclude  
that those items meet the following conditions:
 X Fair, balanced and understandable, set out on page 71 
– the statement given by the directors that they consider the 
annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, 
business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
 X Audit and Risk Committee reporting, set out on pages 
62–63 – the section describing the work of the Audit and 
Risk Committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit and Risk Committee; or
 X Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, set out on page 60 – the 
parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing 
Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for 
review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) 
do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course  
of the audit:
 X the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 X the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the 
Strategic Report or the Directors’ Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 X adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 X the parent company financial statements to be audited are not 
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
 X certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 X we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
 
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement 
set out on page 71, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as 
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the 
group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have  
no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the  
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to identify and 
assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement 
due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate 
responses; and to respond appropriately to fraud or suspected 
fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary 
responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests  
with both those charged with governance of the entity and 
management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
 X We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to Energean and determined 
that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting 
framework (IFRSs, Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) 
and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions 
in which the group operates. In addition, we concluded that 
there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have 
an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements and laws and regulations relating to 
health and safety, employee matters, environmental and bribery 
and corruption practices.
 X We understood how the group is complying with those 
frameworks by making enquiries of management and with 
those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We 
designed audit procedures to identify non-compliance with 
such laws and regulations identified in the paragraph above, 
including corroborating our enquiries through our review 
of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and correspondence received from regulatory 
bodies, and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.
 X We assessed the susceptibility of Energean’s consolidated 
financial statements to material misstatement, including how 
fraud might occur, focussing on opportunities for management 
to reflect bias in key accounting estimates. We have reported 
our findings in our key audit matters section of our report. 
We also incorporated data analytics and manual journal entry 
testing into our audit approach. 
 X Other procedures performed to address the risk of 
management override included evaluating the business 
rationale for significant unusual and one-off transactions, 
reviewing the minutes of the Board of Directors and Audit and 
Risk Committee, and including a level of unpredictability in  
our testing. 
A further description of our responsibilities for  
the audit of the financial statements is located on  
the Financial Reporting Council’s website at  
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.  
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
 X We were appointed by the company on 21 February 2018 to 
audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 
2017 and subsequent financial periods. 
 X The period of total uninterrupted engagement including 
previous renewals and reappointments is one year, covering the 
year ending 31 December 2017.
 X The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard 
were not provided to the group or the parent company and we 
remain independent of the group and the parent company in 
conducting the audit. 
 X The audit opinion is consistent with the report of the Audit and 
Risk Committee.

unless otherwise stated)
1. Incorporation and principal activities 
1.1 Incorporation 
Energean Oil & Gas plc (the ‘Company’) was incorporated in England & Wales on 8 May 2017 as a public company with limited liability, 
under the Companies Act 2006. On incorporation, the Company issued 50,000 ordinary shares of a nominal value of £1.00 per share. 
Its registered office is at 21 Gloucester Place, London W1U 8HR, United Kingdom. The Company and all subsidiaries controlled by the 
Company, are together referred to as �the Group’.
On 30 June 2017, the Company reorganised the business and became the parent company of the Group through the acquisition of  
the full share capital of Energean E&P Holdings Limited in exchange for 65,643,120 £0.01 shares in the Company (the �transaction’). 
This transaction, which resulted in Energean E&P Holdings Limited becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the 
Company becoming the new immediate holding company of Energean E&P Holdings Limited, constitutes a group reconstruction  
and a transaction between entities under common control. This transaction falls outside the scope of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’.
There is no other authoritative guidance for such situations under IFRS. In the absence of such authoritative guidance under IFRS,  
the transaction has been accounted for in these consolidated financial statements using the principles of merger accounting under 
Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, which results in 
the net assets of Energean E&P Holdings Limited being recorded at carrying value and presented as if the Company and Energean E&P 
Holdings Limited had always been part of the same consolidated group. This policy, which does not conflict with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS), reflects the economic substance of the transaction. The effect of this transaction is reflected in the share 
capital of the Group on the date it became effective. 
1.2 Principal activities 
The Group has been established with the objective of exploration, production and commercialisation of crude oil and natural gas in 
Greece, Israel, North Africa and the wider Eastern Mediterranean. The Group’s core assets as of 31 December 2017 comprise:

associate in which the Group has 0% economic interest. 
2 In March 2017 the Group agreed to farm out a 60% working interest to Repsol (operator) in Ioannina block. 
3 Subject to ratification of lease agreement by Greek Parliament. 
The principal operations of the Group are in Greece, Egypt and Israel. 
2. Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial 
instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting 
policies below.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union (EU).
The consolidated financial information is presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars except 
where otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The Directors have exercised significant judgement in assessing that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements on a 
going concern basis is appropriate. In making this assessment, the important factors considered, among others, include the current 
financial position and the profitability of the Group as well their expectations in relation to future business prospects, and future 
profitability and cash flows of the Group. Another important factor for determining that the going concern basis remains appropriate is 
the ability of raising necessary funding as and when needed. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group successfully completed 
an IPO on the London Stock Exchange and raised $460 million in gross proceeds. Furthermore the Group’s liquidity position has been 
significantly improved by the amendment of the Group’s existing EBRD Senior Facility agreement signed on 30 January 2018, 
increasing available funds to US$180 million and the addition of a US$1.275 billion Senior Credit Facility agreement, which will be used 
to fund Karish and Tanin development costs. Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
3. Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies and measurement bases used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements unless  
otherwise stated.
3.1 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries) as detailed in Note 8. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the  
Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
 X Power over the investee
 X Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
 X The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and 
circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
 X The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
 X Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
 X The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the 
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 87 86 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements continued
Accounting policies 
continued
3.1 Basis of consolidation continued
Profit or loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) are attributed to owners of the Group and to the non-
controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Where necessary, adjustments  
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members  
of the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.  
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the  
non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. 
Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control of a subsidiary are accounted for as transactions  
with the owners (i.e. as equity transactions). The difference between the fair value of any consideration and the resulting change  
in the non-controlling interests’ share of the net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
3.2 Functional and presentation currency and foreign currency translation 
 X Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are measured using the  
currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (’the functional currency’).
The functional currency of the Company is US dollars (’US$’). The US dollar is the currency that mainly influences sales prices and 
revenue estimates, and also highly affects its operations. The functional currencies of the Group’s main subsidiaries are as follows:  
for Energean E&P Holdings Ltd, Energean Oil & Gas S.A., Kavala Oil SA and Energean Montenegro is Euro, for Energean International 
Limited and Energean Israel Limited is US$. 
 X Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in profit or loss. Such monetary assets and liabilities are translated at year end foreign exchange rates. Non-monetary 
items denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction and are not 
subsequently remeasured. 
 X Translation to presentation currency 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements information, the assets and liabilities of the Group are expressed  
in US$. The Company and its subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date. 
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly 
during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising are 
recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
3.3 Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in  
a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets 
transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by  
the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For each business combination the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest  
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs  
are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred. 
Where appropriate, the cost of acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, 
measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where 
they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified 
are accounted for in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations (revised 2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
 X deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee benefit arrangements, are recognised and measured  
in accordance with IAS 12, ‘Income Taxes’ and IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’ respectively;
 X liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements 
of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 
Share-Based Payment at the acquisition date; and 
 X non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations’, are measured at fair value less costs to sell.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting year in which the combination occurs,  
the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted 
during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained  
about facts and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised  
as at that date.
The measurement period is the year from the date of acquisition to the date the Group receives complete information about facts  
and circumstances that existed as at the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the 
acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date 
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess  
is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
3.4 Investments in joint ventures 
A joint arrangement is one in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control  
of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties  
sharing control. 
Joint operations
A joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have the right to the 
assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. In relation to its interests in joint operations, the Group recognises 
its share of: 
 X Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly
 X Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly
 X Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation
 X Share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation
 X Expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly

3.4 Investments in joint ventures continued
Joint venture 
A joint venture is an arrangement (which usually involves the establishment of a separate entity) that the Group controls jointly with  
one or more other investors, and over which the Group has rights to a share of the net assets rather than direct rights to underlying 
assets and obligations for underlying liabilities.
The investments in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.  
Under the equity method, the investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost.  
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of a joint venture  
since the acquisition date less any impairment in the value of individual investments. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or 
losses of a joint venture is recognised in profit or loss. The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of the joint venture is shown 
on the face of the consolidated statement of profit and loss and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interest in the 
subsidiaries of the joint venture. Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and a joint venture are eliminated  
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a joint venture at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount  
of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value  
of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless the Group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.
At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired.  
If there is such evidence, the Group determines the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. 
The accounting policies of a joint venture are aligned with those adopted by the Group where necessary, to ensure consistency.
3.5 Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment comprises oil and gas properties, machinery, furniture and fixtures and vessel costs. 
Initial recognition
Oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. 
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset  
into operation, the initial estimate of the decommissioning obligation, and borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction  
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment related to hydrocarbon production activities are generally depreciated on a unit of production basis over 
the proved and probable developed and undeveloped commercial reserves of the field concerned, except in the case of assets whose 
useful life is shorter than the lifetime of the field, in which case the straight-line method is applied. For the purposes of calculating 
depreciation, the value of oil and gas properties includes both historical capital expenditure and estimated future capital expenditure 
related to the development of undeveloped 2P reserves. Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on the 
straight-line method so as to write off the cost amount of each asset to its residual value, over its estimated useful life. The useful life 
of each class is estimated as follows:
Years
Buildings 12
Vessel cost 5–14
Plant and machinery 7–30
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7
3.5 Property, plant and equipment continued
Depreciation of the assets in the course of construction commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, on the same 
basis as other assets of the same class. 
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the statement of profit or loss when 
the asset is derecognised. 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. 
Development costs
Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling  
of development wells is capitalised within oil and gas properties in property, plant, and equipment on the consolidated statement  
of financial position.
Repairs, maintenance, and renovations
Expenditure for routine repairs and maintenance of property, plant and equipment is charged to the profit or loss in the year in which  
it is incurred. The cost of major improvements and renovations and other subsequent expenditure are included in the carrying amount 
of the asset when the recognition criteria of IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ are met. Major improvements and renovations 
capitalised are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. 
3.6 Intangible assets 
Computer software 
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique computer software products controlled by the Group and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. Subsequently computer 
software is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Costs associated with maintenance of computer software programs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Computer software costs are amortised using the straight-line method over their useful lives, which commence when the computer 
software is available for use. Their amortisation expense is included in administration expenses.
Exploration and evaluation costs 
Exploration and evaluation activity involves the search for hydrocarbon resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the 
assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation assets are accounted for using the successful 
efforts method of accounting.
Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, costs directly associated with exploration and evaluation are capitalised as 
exploration and evaluation assets until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include 
licence acquisition costs, directly attributable employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to 
contractors and suppliers. 
If no potentially commercial reserves are found, the exploration asset is tested for impairment. If potentially extractable hydrocarbons 
are found and, subject to further appraisal activity (e.g. by drilling further wells), have the potential to be developed commercially,  
the costs continue to be carried as exploration and evaluation cost while sufficient and continued progress is made in assessing the 
commerciality of the hydrocarbons. All such capitalised costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review as well  
as review for indicators of impairment at least once a year, to confirm the continued intention to develop or otherwise extract value 
from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off to profit or loss. 
When proved reserves of oil are identified and development is sanctioned by management, the relevant expenditure is assessed for 
impairment and any resulting impairment loss is recognised before reclassifying the balance to oil and gas properties within property, 
plant and equipment.

3.7 Impairment of non-financial assets 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its depreciable property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Impairment is assessed at the level  
of cash-generating units (CGUs) which, in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, are identified as the smallest identifiable 
group of assets that generates cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. This is usually  
at the individual royalty, stream, oil and gas or working interest level for each property from which cash inflows are generated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value-in-use (VIU). The future cash flow expected is derived using estimates  
of proven and probable reserves, a portion of resources that is expected to be converted into reserves and information regarding  
the mineral, stream and oil & gas properties, respectively, that could affect the future recoverability of the Company’s interests. 
Discount factors are determined individually for each asset and reflect their respective risk profiles. 
Assets are subsequently reassessed for indications that an impairment loss previously recognised may no longer exist. An impairment 
charge is reversed if the conditions that gave rise to the recognition of an impairment loss are subsequently reversed and the asset’s 
recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. Impairment losses can be reversed only to the extent that the recoverable amount 
does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised previously.
Exploration and evaluation assets are tested for impairment when there is an indication that a particular exploration and evaluation 
project may be impaired. Examples of indicators of impairment include a significant price decline over an extended period, the decision 
to delay or no longer pursue the exploration and evaluation project, or an expiration of rights to explore an area. In addition, exploration 
and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment upon their reclassification to producing assets (oil and gas interest in property, 
plant and equipment). In assessing the impairment of exploration and evaluation assets, the carrying value of the asset would be 
compared to the estimated recoverable amount and any impairment loss recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
3.8 Leasing 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  
to the lessee. Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases.
Operating leases 
The Group as lessee:
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease as well as prepayments and any other premiums  
paid are spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
3.9 Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument. 
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition  
of financial assets or the issuance of financial liabilities that are recorded at other than fair value through profit and loss. 
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial instruments �at fair value through profit and loss” 
(FVTPL); �held to maturity investments’; �available for sale (AFS) financial assets’ and �loans and receivables’. Financial liabilities are 
classified as FVTPL and other liabilities. The classification of financial instruments depends on the nature and purpose of the financial 
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. For the periods presented the Group’s financial assets consist of �loans and 
receivables’ and FVTPL, and financial liabilities consist of FVTPL and other liabilities. 
Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss
FVTPL includes financial instruments held for trading (HFT) and financial instruments designated upon initial recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial instruments are classified as HFT if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in  
the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as HFT. The Group has not designated any 
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the 
consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as a gain or loss in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss. The Group’s financial instruments that have been classified as HFT are derivative instruments. 
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not HFT or designated  
at fair value though profit or loss.
Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and 
receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs, and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised 
by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Group’s loans and receivables consist of other non-current assets, cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other receivables. 
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets  
is impaired. An impairment exists if one or more events that has occurred since the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss 
event’), has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably 
estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial 
difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganisation, and observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as  
changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether impairment exists individually for financial assets  
that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no 
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset  
in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are 
individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective 
assessment of impairment.
The amount of any impairment loss identified is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present 
value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The present value  
of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

3.9 Financial instruments continued
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the loss is recognised in the statement of  
profit or loss. Interest income (recorded as finance income in the statement of profit or loss) continues to be accrued on the reduced 
carrying amount and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the 
impairment loss. Loans, together with the associated allowance, are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery 
and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the Group. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated 
impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously 
recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the allowance account. If a write-off is later recovered, the recovery  
is credited consistent with where the impairment was recorded in the statement of profit or loss.
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and other financial 
liabilities, which include borrowings and trade and other payables. The Group does not have any financial liabilities classified as fair 
value through profit or loss except derivative instruments. 
Other liabilities 
Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected cash flows over the estimated life of the 
instrument to its net carrying amount. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss. 
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled, or it expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and 
the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and measured at their nominal value. Any premiums received on issue of share capital above 
its nominal value are recognised as share premium within equity. Associated issue costs are deducted from share premium.
3.9 Financial instruments continued
Compound instruments 
The component parts of compound instruments (convertible notes) issued by the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities 
and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity 
instrument. A conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed 
number of the Group’s own equity instruments is an equity instrument.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-
convertible instruments. This amount is recorded as a liability at fair value and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date.
The conversion option classified as equity is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of  
the compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently 
remeasured. In addition, the conversion option classified as equity will remain in equity until the conversion option is exercised,  
in which case, the balance recognised in equity will be transferred to share premium. When the conversion option remains unexercised 
at the maturity date of the convertible note, the balance recognised in equity will be transferred to other equity reserves. No gain or  
loss is recognised in profit or loss upon conversion or expiration of the conversion option.
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the convertible notes are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to 
the allocation of the gross proceeds. Transaction costs relating to the equity component are recognised directly in equity. Transaction 
costs relating to the liability component are included in the carrying amount of the liability component and are amortised over the lives 
of the convertible notes using the effective interest method.
If a conversion option does not meet the definition of an equity instrument, it is classified as a derivative. The conversion option is 
initially recorded at fair value. The derivative is initially recorded at fair value with the difference between the fair value and the proceeds 
of issuance recorded as a liability. The derivative is subsequently remeasured with changes to fair value recorded in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss.
3.10 Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset  
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, are categorised  
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement  
as a whole:
 X Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 X Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly 
observable
 X Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest-level input that  
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

3.11 Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and also cash reserves retained as a bank security pledge  
in respect of bank guarantees (Note 13.2), with a maturity of three months or less that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  
in their fair value.
The cash reserves retained as a bank security pledge in respect of bank guarantees are defined as restricted cash and held in 
designated bank deposits accounts to be used only for the purposes of the capital commitments. Release of cash from the accounts 
can only be made with the approval of the lender when specified expenditure milestones are met. The current and non-current 
classification of the bank security pledges is determined by the forecast expenditure of the capital commitments.
3.12 Inventories 
Inventories comprise crude oil and by-product (sulphur), consumables and other spare parts. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the monthly weighted average cost method. The cost of finished goods and work  
in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads. It does not include borrowing 
costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Spare parts consumed within a year are carried as inventory and recognised in profit  
or loss when consumed.
The Group assesses the net realisable value of the inventories at the end of each year and recognises in the consolidated statement  
of profit or loss the appropriate valuation adjustment if the inventories are overstated. When the circumstances that previously caused 
impairment no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in the inventories’ net realisable value due to a change in the 
economic circumstances, the amount thereof is reversed.
3.13 Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where the Group 
expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration 
required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risk and uncertainties surrounding 
the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is  
 the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of money is material). 
Decommissioning provision 
The Group recognises a provision for decommissioning cost and, more specifically, a provision for future restoration of environment 
disturbed, as of the reporting date, as a result of past drilling activity and in line with prevailing environmental legislation or binding 
practices. According to the Prinos concession agreement ratified by Greek law, the Group is obliged to plug only the wells opened 
resulting from own drilling activities. The amount recognised is the estimated cost of restoration, discounted to its present value. A 
corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil & gas property. The provision 
is measured at each reporting date and is appropriately adjusted to reflect the present value of the expenses required to fulfil the 
obligation. Changes in the estimated timing of restoration or restoration cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an 
adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning provision is recognised in profit or loss within finance costs. 
3.14 Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and revenue indirect taxes.
Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated 
with the transaction will flow to the Group, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and the recognition criteria 
for each of the Group’s different activities have been met. These activity-specific recognition criteria are described below.
Sale of crude oil and by-products 
Revenue from sale of crude oil and by-products is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred, which is when title passes to the customer. This generally occurs when product is physically transferred into a vessel,  
pipe or other delivery mechanism.
Rendering of services 
Revenue from technical advisory services is recognised in the period in which the services are rendered by reference to the stage  
of completion of the specific service transaction, assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total 
services to be provided.
Finance income 
Finance income is accrued by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
3.15 Retirement benefit costs 
State-managed retirement benefit scheme
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes (e.g. Government Social Insurance Fund) are dealt with as payments to 
defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution plan. 
The Group’s contributions are expensed as incurred and are included in staff costs. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations 
to pay further contributions if the government scheme does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees' benefits relating to 
employee service in the current and prior periods.
Defined benefit plan
The Group operates an unfunded defined benefit plan in which a lump sum amount is specified and is payable at the termination  
of employees’ service based on such factors as the length of the employees’ service and their salary. The liability recognised for  
the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each 
reporting date. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are developed by management with the assistance of independent 
actuaries.
Service costs on the defined benefit plan are included in staff costs. Interest expense on the defined benefit liability is included in 
finance costs. Gains and losses resulting from other remeasurements of the defined benefit liability are included in other 
comprehensive income.
3.16 Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such 
time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of 
specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Excluded from the above capitalisation policy are any qualifying assets that are inventories that are produced in large quantities  
on a repetitive basis. 
Borrowing costs include interest expense on loans, and bank overdrafts on an effective rate basis, and other bank charges, and are 
included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

3.17 Tax 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated 
financial statements because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further 
excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, based on tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or 
from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
taxable profit nor the accounting profit. 
Current and deferred tax assets and corresponding liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Significant estimates are made in determining the tax liability for income taxes. The tax treatment of some transactions and 
calculations is uncertain and is yet to be agreed with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. The Group recognises tax 
provision liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on whether it is probable – defined as more likely than not – that additional taxes 
will be due. This assessment is based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Where the final 
tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax 
liability in the period in which such determination is made. 
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of losses and other temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be future taxable profits against which the losses and other temporary differences can be utilised. The Group has considered 
their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will  
be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. These estimates are based on forecast performance  
and, where tax losses are subject to expiration, the estimates take into account the expected reversal patterns of taxable temporary 
differences compared to the future reversal of deductible temporary differences.
3.18 Non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less 
costs of disposal. Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable 
and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, 
which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification. 
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary 
are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling 
interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. 
When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving disposal of an investment in an associate, or a portion of an investment in  
an associate, the investment or the portion of the investment in the associate that will be disposed of is classified as held for sale when 
the criteria described above are met, and the Group discontinues the use of the equity method in relation to the portion that is 
classified as held for sale. Any retained portion of an investment in an associate that has not been classified as held for sale continues 
to be accounted for using the equity method. The Group discontinues the use of the equity method at the time of disposal when the 
disposal results in the Group losing significant influence over the associate. After the disposal takes place, the Group accounts for  
any retained interest in the associate in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ unless the 
retained interest continues to be an associate, in which case the Group uses the equity method (see the accounting policy regarding 
investments in associates above) (please refer also to Note 9).
3.19 Equity, reserves and dividend payments
Share capital represents the nominal (par) value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premiums received  
on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium, net of any 
related income tax benefits.
Other components of equity include the following:
 X remeasurement of net defined benefit liability – comprises the actuarial losses from changes in demographic and financial 
assumptions and the return on plan assets (see Note 3.15)
 X translation reserve – comprises foreign currency translation differences arising from the translation of financial statements 
of the Group’s foreign entities into euros and translation reserves from the translation to the Group’s presentation currency US$  
(see Note 3.2).
Retained earnings includes all current and prior period retained profits. 
All transactions with owners of the parent are recorded separately within equity.
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in other liabilities when the dividends have been approved in  
a general meeting prior to the reporting date.
3.20 New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following amended IFRSs  
which have been adopted by the Group and Company as of 1 January 2017:
The below amendments did not have a significant impact on the Company and consolidated financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2017.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the significant accounting policies and measurement bases 
summarised below.
 X IAS 12: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses (Amendments)
The objective of the amendments is to clarify the requirements of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses, in order to address 
diversity in practice in the application of IAS 12 Income Taxes. The specific issues where diversity in practice existed relate to: the 
existence of a deductible temporary difference upon a decrease in fair value, recovering an asset for more than its carrying amount, 
probable future taxable profit and combined versus separate assessment.
 X IAS 7: Disclosure Initiative (Amendments)
The objective of the amendments is to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities 
arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes. The amendments specify that 
one way to fulfil the disclosure requirement is by providing a tabular reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the 
statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities, including changes from financing cash flows, changes 
arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes  
in fair values and other changes. 
 X The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014 – 2016 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs.  
The following annual improvement has not yet been endorsed by the EU. This improvement did not have an effect on the  
Group financial statements:
 –  IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities: The amendments clarify that the disclosure requirements in IFRS 12, other  
than those of summarised financial information for subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, apply to an entity’s interest in a 
subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate that is classified as held for sale, held for distribution, or as discontinued operations in 
accordance with IFRS 5.

3.21 Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted
 X IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 
  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early application permitted. The final version 
of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements for classification  
and measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting. 
  The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date and will not restate comparative information. During 2017, 
an impact assessment of IFRS 9 was performed. 
   Based on the above assessment the following impact from the adoption of the new standard is expected: 
 –  There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities, as the new requirements only affect the accounting  
for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss and the Group does not have any such liabilities.
 –  Financial assets currently held will continue to be measured on the same basis under IFRS 9, and accordingly, the Group  
does not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on the classification and measurement of its financial assets.
 –  The new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (ECL) rather than 
only incurred credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. The Group will apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected 
losses on all trade receivables. Based upon an assessment carried out, the Group has determined that, upon adoption, the loss 
allowance will not increase.
 –  The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk 
management practices. It appears that the Group’s current hedge relationships would qualify as continuing hedges upon the 
adoption of IFRS 9. Accordingly, the Group does not expect a significant impact on the accounting for its hedging relationships.
 –  The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change 
the nature and extent of the Group’s disclosures about its financial instruments, particularly in the year of the adoption of the  
new standard.
 X IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that will 
apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction  
or the industry. The standard’s requirements will also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale  
of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g. sales of property, plant and equipment  
or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including: disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance 
obligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods, and key judgements and estimates. 
  The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date using the modified retrospective method. Based on the 
Group’s assessment of IFRS 15 completed in 2017, no material differences from the current accounting policies were identified. 
Therefore, the new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements  
upon adoption.
 X IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (clarifications)
  The clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The objective  
of the clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the �separately identifiable’ 
principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well  
as applications of control principle and of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and 
royalties. The clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively  
or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. Management has assessed that the amendments do not affect the 
consolidated financial statements.
 X IFRS 16: Leases
  The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer (‘lessee’) and the supplier 
(‘lessor’). The new standard requires lessees to recognise most leases on their financial statements. Lessees will have a single 
accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. 
3.21 Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted continued
  The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases. However, the Group has assessed that the 
amendments will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. This is due to the fact that some of the 
commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value leases and some commitments may relate to 
arrangements that will not qualify as leases under IFRS 16.
 X Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards
  The IASB issued the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting on 29 March 2018. The Conceptual Framework sets 
out a comprehensive set of concepts for financial reporting, standard setting, guidance for preparers in developing consistent 
accounting policies and assistance to others in their efforts to understand and interpret the standards. IASB also issued a separate 
accompanying document, Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards, which sets out the 
amendments to affected standards in order to update references to the revised Conceptual Framework. It’s objective is to support 
transition to the revised Conceptual Framework for companies that develop accounting policies using the Conceptual Framework 
when no IFRS Standard applies to a particular transaction. For preparers who develop accounting policies based on the Conceptual 
Framework, it is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020.
 X IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (amendments)
  The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted.  
The amendments require entities to use updated actuarial assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for  
the remainder of the annual reporting period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement has occurred. The amendments 
also clarify how the accounting for a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affects applying the asset ceiling requirements. 
These amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group will examine the impact of the above on its consolidated 
financial statements.
 X IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (amendments)
  The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The 
Amendments provide requirements on the accounting for the effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement  
of cash-settled share-based payments, for share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax 
obligations and for modifications to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the 
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled. 
 X IAS 40: Transfers to Investment Property (amendments)
  The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted.  
The amendments clarify when an entity should transfer property, including property under construction or development, into  
or out of investment property. The amendments state that a change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet,  
the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use. A mere change in management’s intentions for  
the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use.
 X IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (amendment)
  The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. 
The amendment allows financial assets with prepayment features that permit or require a party to a contract either to pay or receive 
reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract (so that, from the perspective of the holder of the asset there 
may be ‘negative compensation’), to be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The 
Group will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements, though it is not expected to have any. 
 X IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (amendments)
  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. 
The amendments relate to whether the measurement, in particular impairment requirements, of long-term interests in associates 
and joint ventures that, in substance, form part of the ‘net investment’ in the associate or joint venture should be governed by IFRS 9, 
IAS 28 or a combination of both. The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, before it applies IAS 
28, to such long-term interests for which the equity method is not applied. In applying IFRS 9, the entity does not take account of 
any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interests that arise from applying IAS 28. These amendments have not yet 
been endorsed by the EU. The Group will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements, though it is not expected  
to have any.

 X IFRIC INTERPRETATION 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
  The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The 
interpretation clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign 
currency. The interpretation covers foreign currency transactions when an entity recognises a non-monetary asset or a non-
monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recognises the related asset, 
expense or income. The interpretation states that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate,  
is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred income liability. If there are multiple payments  
or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date for the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance 
consideration. The Group will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements.
 X The IASB has issued its Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2014–2016 cycle), which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 for IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards and for IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Earlier application is permitted for IAS 
28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. These annual improvements have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group  
will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements, though it is not expected to have any. 
 –  IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: The amendments clarify that the election to measure at fair value 
through profit or loss an investment in an associate or a joint venture that is held by an entity that is a venture capital organisation, 
or other qualifying entity, is available for each investment in an associate or joint venture on an investment-by-investment basis, 
upon initial recognition.
 X IFRIC INTERPRETATION 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 
  The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The 
interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application  
of IAS 12. The interpretation provides guidance on: considering uncertain tax treatments separately or together, examination  
by tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect uncertainty, and accounting for changes in facts and circumstances. This 
Interpretation has not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group will examine the impact of the above on its financial statements.
  The IASB has issued its Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2015–2017 cycle), which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The 
amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. These annual 
improvements have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The Group will examine the impact of the elements below on its financial 
statements:
 –  IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains 
control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 
11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not remeasure previously 
held interests in that business.
 –  IAS 12 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify that the income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments 
classified as equity should be recognised according to where the past transactions or events that generated distributable profits 
has been recognised.
 –  IAS 23 Borrowing Costs: The amendments clarify paragraph 14 of the standard that, when a qualifying asset is ready for  
its intended use or sale, and some of the specific borrowing related to that qualifying asset remains outstanding at that point,  
that borrowing is to be included in the funds that an entity borrows generally. 
 
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and 
assumptions, and also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies.
Estimates, assumptions and judgement applied are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Although these estimates, 
assumptions and judgement are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may  
ultimately differ.
4.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
The following are significant management judgements in applying the accounting policies of the Group that have the most  
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements:
Determination of a business
Determination of whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business may require the Group to make certain 
judgements. A business is a group of assets that includes inputs, outputs and processes that are capable of being managed together 
to provide a return to the Group and its shareholders. Classification of an acquisition as a business combination or an asset acquisition 
depends on whether the assets acquired constitute a business. Whether an acquisition is classified as a business combination or 
asset acquisition can have a significant impact on the entries made on or after acquisition. 
In 2016, the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the equity in Energean Israel Limited. The Group concluded that the acquisition did 
not meet the definition of a business since in acquisition the fair value of the gross assets acquired was not concentrated in a single 
identifiable asset, and accordingly, the acquisition was accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The accounting and further detail 
on the judgement made is set out in Note 9. 
Functional currency
The functional currency for the Company and each of its subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates. Note 3.2 describes the functional currency of each of the entities within the Group. The determination of the 
functional currency of Energean Oil and Gas S.A. involves certain judgements to determine the primary economic environment. As 
Energean Oil and Gas S.A.’s capital expenditure, payroll cost, energy costs and exploration and evaluation costs are all predominantly 
denominated in euro, the Group has determined that the functional currency of the company is the euro. The Group reconsiders the 
functional currency of its entities if there is a change in events and conditions which determined the primary economic environment.
4.2 Estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities are discussed below:
Fair value measurements and valuation processes
Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of  
an asset or a liability the Group uses market-observable data to the extent that it is possible. Where Level 1 inputs are not available,  
as is the case for estimating a fair value for the convertible loan notes (see Note 9) and the option to purchase Energean Israel Class B 
shares (see Note 31.4) the Group has used a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 inputs to estimate the fair value.
The Chief Financial Officer reports the valuations to the Board of Directors of the Group every six months to explain the cause of 
fluctuations in the fair value of the assets and liabilities. 
Information about the valuation technique and inputs used in determining the fair value of the convertible loan notes and the option  
to purchase Energean Israel Class B shares is disclosed in Note 34.2.

4.2 Estimation uncertainty continued
Impairment of non-financial assets
 X Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment
The Group assesses impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may lead to impairment  
of assets. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the recoverable amount (which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value 
in use) of the cash-generating unit to which the assets belong is then estimated based on the present value of future discounted cash 
flows. For oil and gas assets, the expected future cash flow estimation is based on a number of factors, variables and assumptions, 
the most important of which are estimates of reserves, future production profiles, oil prices and costs. In most cases, the present  
value of future cash flows is most sensitive to estimates of future oil price, estimates of reserves, estimates of development costs and 
discount rates. A change in the assumptions could materially change the recoverable amount. In the event that future circumstances 
vary from these assumptions, the recoverable amount of the Group’s development and production assets could change materially  
and result in impairment losses or the reversal of previous impairment losses.
The fields of Prinos, Prinos North and Epsilon are grouped together in one cash-generating unit (CGU) and reviewed annually for 
impairment. The carrying value of Prinos CGU as of 31 December was US$303.9 million. The recoverable amount of the Prinos CGU  
as of 31 December was estimated above its carrying value therefore no impairment losses were recorded in the Group's profit or loss. 
Further details of the Group’s economic environment are provided in Note 33. Based on the evaluation performed, No reasonably 
possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the unit’s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. Further 
details about the carrying value of property, plant and equipment are shown in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.
 X Impairment assessment of exploration and evaluation costs
The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining  
whether future economic benefits are likely from either future exploitation or sale, or whether activities have not reached a stage  
which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves, or whether an economically viable extraction operation can  
be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is 
capitalised, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount 
is written off in profit or loss in the period when this new information becomes available. Further details about the carrying value  
of exploration and evaluation costs are shown in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
Hydrocarbon reserve and resource estimates 
The Group’s oil and gas development and production properties are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated  
by reference to developed and undeveloped proved and probable commercial reserves (2P developed and undeveloped) which  
are estimated to be recoverable with existing and future developed facilities using current operating methods, as determined in 
accordance with Petroleum Resources Management System published by Society of Petroleum Engineers, the World Petroleum 
Congress and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.
Commercial reserves are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery factors and future oil prices. The level of estimated 
commercial reserves is also a key factor in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Group’s oil and gas properties  
has been impaired.
As the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geological information is produced during the operation of a  
field, estimates of recoverable reserves may change. Such changes may impact the Group’s reported financial position and results  
which include:
 X Depreciation and amortisation charges in profit or loss may change, where such charges are determined using the unit of production 
method, or where the useful life of the related assets changes
 X Impairment charges in profit or loss
 X Provisions for decommissioning may change where changes to the reserve estimates affect expectations about when such activities 
will occur and the associated cost of these activities
 X The recognition and carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change due to changes in the judgements regarding the 
existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.
4.2 Estimation uncertainty continued
The impact upon commercial reserves and the aggregate depletion charge for the year of a +/– 10% fluctuation in the forward Brent  
oil price assumption as well as a +/- 10% fluctuation in the forward foreign exchange rate (euro to USD) are presented in the table

The application of the Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgement in determining whether 
future economic benefits are likely from either future exploitation or sale, or where activities have not reached a stage which permits a 
reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves. The determination of reserves and resources is itself an estimation process that 
requires varying degrees of uncertainty depending on sub-classification, and these estimates directly impact the point of deferral of 
exploration and evaluation expenditure. The deferral policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to 
future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any such 
estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, information 
becomes available suggesting that the recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount is written off in profit 
or loss in the period when the new information becomes available.
Retirement benefit obligation 
The cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making 
assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases where necessary. The Group 
sets these assumptions with the assistance of independent professional actuaries. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such 
estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The assumptions used may vary from year to year which would affect future net 
income and net assets. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect future net income and net 
assets. Further details are shown in Note 18 to the consolidated financial information.

4.2 Estimation uncertainty continued
Income taxes 
Significant estimates are made in determining the tax liability for income taxes. The tax treatment of some transactions and 
calculations is uncertain and has yet to be agreed with the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. The Group recognises tax 
provision liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on whether it is probable, defined as more likely than not, that additional taxes will 
be due. This assessment is based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Where the final tax 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax 
liability in the period in which such determination is made. 
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of losses and other temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be future taxable profits against which the losses and other temporary differences can be utilised. The Group has considered 
their carrying value at each balance sheet date and concluded that, based on management’s estimates, sufficient taxable profits will  
be generated in future years to recover such recognised deferred tax assets. These estimates are based on forecast performance  
and where tax losses are subject to expiration, the estimates take into account the expected reversal patterns of taxable temporary 
differences compared to the future reversal of deductible temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets recognised from carried forward unused tax losses for the Group amounted to US$80,571 for the year ended 
31 December 2017 (year ended 31 December 2016: US$56,296).
The Directors regard the deferred tax asset in relation to tax losses and other temporary differences as recoverable, despite the 
loss-making situation that currently exists, based on their best estimate of future sources of taxable income for the Group.
Recoverability of Kavala subsidies receivable 
In December 2015, Kavala Oil SA filed a petition against OAED, the public body for employment and social inclusion in Greece, and the 
Greek state itself, seeking the payment of €2.5 million (plus interest). This claim is based on the provisions of Art. 21 of the Law Act No 
1767/1988 and the Ministerial Decree No 31370/1988, by which Kavala Oil SA believes it was entitled to receive the abovementioned 
sum as financial support under the action plan (co-funding by national and EU instruments) for promoting sustainable employment  
in underdeveloped or deprived districts of Greece, such as the area of Kavala.
Following several postponements of the hearing initiated by the Greek state, the hearing took place on 14 June 2017. The Group is 
of the view, based on legal advice, this petition will prevail and has therefore included a balance within trade and other receivables 
(Note 12).
5. Segmental reporting
The information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (Chief Operating Decision Makers) for the 
purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on five operating segments: Greece (including 
the production asset of Prinos and the non-producing exploration assets of Ioannina and Katakolo), Israel (including 50% of the  
Karish and Tanin assets), Egypt (including the non-producing exploration asset of West Kom Ombo), Montenegro (including two 
non-producing exploration assets) and new ventures. Factors considered to identify the operating segments of the Group are 
geographical and stage of development.
The operating results of each operating segment are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers in order to 
make decisions about the allocation of resources and to assess their performance. The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Makers 
evaluate segmental performance on the basis of adjusted EBITDAX, which is defined as profit/(loss) from continuing operations before 
tax less depreciation and amortisation, exploration and evaluation expenses, other income, other expenses, finance costs, finance 
income, gain/(loss) on derivative instruments and net foreign exchange gain/(loss). Adjusted EBITDAX is used by the Chief Operating 
Decision Makers as the profit measure for the review of the segment operations. The Greece segment comprises the production  
asset of the Prinos area (including Prinos, Prinos North, South Kavala and Epsilon fields) and north-east Greece (exploration assets of 
Ioannina and Katakolo). The Group’s reportable segment under IFRS 8 Operating Segments is Greece. Segments that do not exceed 
the quantitative thresholds for reporting information about operating segments have been included in Other.
The following tables present revenue and certain asset information regarding the Group’s reportable segments for the years ended 
31 December 2017 and 2016.

The oil and gas properties opposite related to the Greek segment (the fields of Prinos, Prinos North and Epsilon) are depreciated at  
the same rate (see Note 3.5). 
Borrowing costs capitalised for qualifying assets, included in �Additions’ of oil & gas properties and property under construction for 
the year ended 31 December 2017, amounted to US$1,258 (year ended 31 December 2016: US$3,992). The interest rates used were:
 X 7.03% (for the year ended 31 December 2017)
 X 15.66% (for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 May 2016) and 6.97% (for the period 1 June 2016 to 31 December 2016).
During the year ended 31 December 2014 and in view of its future drilling campaigns, the Group acquired and initiated the upgrade 
work of a drilling rig (Energean Force). The Group has issued a first preferred mortgage on the aforementioned Energean Force,  
in favour of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (see Note 15). The depreciation charge of the Energean 
Force has been capitalised in the oil and gas properties.
The Group recorded impairment and write-off charges on PP&E of US$1,344 for the year ended 31 December 2017 (year ended 
31 December 2016: US$1,947). The impairment charges in 2017 relates to impairment of drilling materials in West Kom Ombo license 
and are recorded under �exploration and evaluation expenses’ in the profit or loss. The impairment charges in 2016 relate to machinery 
and other equipment used in operations.

Disposal of exploration and evaluation cost
In March 2017, the Group agreed to farm out a 60% working interest and operatorship of the Ioannina licence to Repsol.  
The Group retains a 40% working interest as of 31 December 2017 (Note 1.2). According to the farm-out agreement:
 X On the completion date Repsol paid to the Group the consideration of US$1 million for all past costs regarding the licence.
 X Repsol will conduct the exploration of the Ioannina block, providing 90% of the committed investment up to US$25 million  
and 60% thereafter, in exchange for a 60% interest.
The disposal of exploration and evaluation cost included in the period ended 31 December 2017 relates to 60% of past expenditure 
in the Ioannina lease area. The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. It also does not recognise 
any gain or loss on its exploration and evaluation farm-out arrangements, but re-designates any costs previously capitalised in relation 
to the whole interest as relating to the partial interest retained. Any cash consideration received directly from the farmee is credited 
against costs previously capitalised in relation to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmor as a gain on disposal.
Write-off and impairments
The Group recognised US$6,663 million in exploration and evaluation expenses in the period ended 31 December 2017, relating to 
exploration expenditure for West Kom Ombo in Egypt. West Kom Ombo is an exploration block in Upper Egypt, the licence for which 
expired on 2 October 2017. There are no recoverable costs associated with West Kom Ombo and the asset has been fully written off 
in 2017.
Amortisation and impairment expenses and write-offs for the period have been recognised in profit or loss as follows:

Energean Oil & Gas S.A.
Energean Oil & Gas S.A. is engaged in the exploration, extraction and trading of oil and gas. Energean Oil & Gas S.A. was established  
in 2007 in Greece. 
In December 2007, Energean Oil & Gas S.A. acquired Kavala Oil S.A. (�Kavala Oil’), the sole oil and gas production company in Greece, 
under a licence granted by the Greek State under Law 2779/1999 (�the Licence’) for the exploration and production of the crude oil and 
gas reserves of Prinos and the South Kavala field (�the exploitation areas’).
In June 2009, the exploitation areas were assigned by Kavala Oil to Energean Oil & Gas S.A, under an assignment agreement entered

Please refer to Note 9 below.
9. Investments in Energean Israel
9.1 Details of the joint venture
Energean Israel Limited (formerly Ocean Energean Oil and Gas Limited) was incorporated in Cyprus on 22 July 2014 as a private 
company with limited liability under the Companies Law, Cap. 113. Its registered office is at Vyronos 36, Nicosia Tower Center,  
8th floor, 1096, Nicosia, Cyprus. 
The principal activity of Energean Israel Limited is to act, work and operate as an international offshore drilling contractor and/or  
oil operator, providing oilfield services for offshore oil and gas mining, exploration and production.
As of 31 December 2015 and 2014, Energean Israel Limited was a 50% investment in a joint venture. On 16 August 2016, the Group 
acquired the remaining 50% of the share capital of Energean Israel Limited for the purpose of investing in the Karish and Tanin 
licences. The acquisition of the additional 50% did not, however, meet the definition of a business combination as Energean Israel 
Limited had 0 employees, did not own the Karish and Tanin licences, and the development plan for the offshore fields had not 
commenced.
Below represents the consideration transferred to acquire the remaining share capital of Energean Israel Limited on 16 August 2016:

Acquisition of leasehold rights 
On 16 August 2016, Energean Israel Limited entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire interests in each of the Tanin  
and Karish offshore Israel leases issued by the Israel Petroleum Commissioner on 24 December 2015.
Following approval from the Israel Petroleum Commissioner obtained in December 2016, Energean Israel Limited has paid an initial 
and closing payment of forty million dollars (US$40,000) and has assumed the obligation to pay the remainder of the consideration 
being a total additional amount of one hundred and eight million and five hundred thousand dollars (US$108,500) in ten equal annual 
payments and ongoing royalties to the sellers. The additional consideration is due on the earlier of the date on which a final investment 
decision of Energean Israel Limited has been made or the date on which aggregate expenditures in connection with the leases exceed 
one hundred and fifty million dollars (US$150,000). The US$108,500 remaining consideration is not recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements and does not form part of the consideration.
9.1 Details of the joint venture continued
In August 2016, Energean E&P Holdings Limited entered into loan agreements with its founding shareholders Oilco Investments, 
Growthy Holdings and Adobelero Holdings for loans of US$4,750, US$4,750 and US$500 respectively to fund the US$10,000 initial 
payment pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement for the acquisition of the Karish and Tanin rights. Each of the loans bears 
interest at 2.0% and had an initial term of 90 days. On 21 December 2016, the Group entered into a subscription agreement with 
Kerogen Capital Limited (�Kerogen’), a private equity fund manager focused on oil and gas, for the investment of US$50 million to 
Energean Israel Limited. The initial capital was funded by a US$35 million convertible loan in December 2016 and a further 
US$5 million loan in the first quarter of 2017, to be converted to equity, together with a further equity investment by Kerogen of 
US$10 million subject to (i) approval from the Petroleum Commissioner and (ii) the closing of the sale and purchase of the subject 
interest in accordance with the provisions of the Delek sale and purchase agreement. The loan bears no interest and was repayable by  
19 June 2017 in the case that no conversion occurred. The net proceeds received from the issue of the Kerogen convertible loan have 
been allocated between the financial liability component ($34,167 as of 31 December 2016) and an equity component ($737k as of  
31 December 2016). The conversion reserve represents the difference between the fair value of the discounted cash outflows to repay  
the loan from Kerogen, discounted using the market interest rate, and the total proceeds from the convertible loans of US$40 million. 
On 13 June 2017 the Kerogen convertible loan interim facility and founding shareholders' loans were discharged in consideration for 
the issue of shares in Energean Israel Limited, whereby Kerogen acquired a 50% equity voting interest and a 50% economic interest 
and the founding shareholders acquired a 50% economic interest in Energean Israel Limited. Energean E&P Holdings Limited retained 
the remaining 50% of the voting rights of Energean Israel. The shareholders’ agreement governing the control and management of 
Energean Israel Limited specifies that the Group’s strategy for the development and operation of the Karish and Tanin fields and the 
implementation of such strategy are subject to consulting with and obtaining the consent of Kerogen. Accordingly, Energean Israel 
Limited was classified as a discontinued operation and assets and liabilities held for sale as of 31 December 2016 and ceased to be  
a subsidiary of the Group on 13 June 2017. Energean Israel Limited was deconsolidated at 13 June 2017.
9.2 Discontinued operations
At 31 December 2016, Energean Israel Limited was presented as a wholly owned subsidiary of Energean E&P Holdings Limited. Based 
on the Kerogen convertible loan and founding shareholder loans as described above, the Group lost control of Energean Israel Limited 
on 13 June 2017 and was therefore presented as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale 
and Discontinued Operations.
The results of the discontinued operations, which have been included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, were as follows:
 For the year ended  
 31 December

A US$1.5 million gain on disposal of the subsidiary was recognised in other income in profit or loss, based on the difference between 
the consideration received (nil) and the net liability position of Energean Israel Limited as of 13 June 2017 of US$1.5 million.

Government subsidies mainly relate to grants from the Greek Public Body for Employment and Social Inclusion (�OAED’) to financially 
support the Kavala Oil S.A. labour cost from manufacturing under the action plan for promoting sustainable employment in 
underdeveloped or deprived districts of Greece, such as the area of Kavala. 
Kavala Oil S.A. participated in this scheme from July 2010 until subsidies ceased to be in force in January 2016.  
The subsidy balance still outstanding at 31 December 2017 is for the period commencing 1 July 2010 until 31 December 2015. 
In December 2015, the Group filed a petition against OAED, and the Greek state itself, seeking the payment of US$2,998 (€2,500). 
Following several postponements of the hearing initiated by the Greek state, the hearing took place on 14 June 2017 and the  
final decision is expected to be announced within the year 2018. 
The Group is of the view, based on legal advice, that its petition will prevail.

Emission Allowances credits (hereby referred to as �EUAs’) during previous years, was sold to Piraeus Bank. Since then and as of

At 31 December 2017 the Group has unused tax losses of US$322,063 (as of 31 December 2016: US$225,184) available to offset 
against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been recognised as of 31 December 2017 in respect of US$80,571 (as of 31 December 
2016: US$56,296) of such tax losses.
Tax losses can be utilised to offset taxable profits for a period of time that is dictated by the tax legislation of each country.  
The above carried forward unused tax losses arise almost exclusively from the Prinos area. Tax losses incurred under the  
Prinos licence (Law 2779/1999) can be utilised to offset taxable profits up to the termination of Prinos exploitation area.
According to the Ioannina and Katakolo lease agreements the losses incurred in respect of a particular exploitation area prior  
to the commencement of any exploitable production shall be carried forward without any restrictions for such period. From the 
commencement of any exploitable production and thereafter, the general income tax provisions shall apply in relation to the carrying 
forward of losses (currently five years).
The Group expects that there will be sufficient taxable profit in the following years and that deferred tax assets, recognised in the 
consolidated financial statements of the Group, will be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,  
and interest in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable  
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group has no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for 
taxable temporary differences arising on its investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interest in joint ventures.

17 .1 Provision for decommissioning 
According to Article 27 of Greece's Law 2779/1999, the Group is obliged to plug only wells drilled pursuant to its own drilling activities. 
For this purpose, a committee was formed comprised of representatives of the three parties involved in the above law: one appointed 
by the Greek state, one representing the contractor and a third member jointly chosen by the Greek state and the contractor. The 
committee assigns and adjust the amount of environment rehabilitation expenditure, which should be kept in restricted accounts,  
for the fulfilment of the contractor’s obligations. 
The last meeting of the committee in 2004 defined the amount of obligation as US$310 (€235)' which has been adjusted to US$  
at each balance sheet date (as of 31 December 2017: US$281, as of 31 December 2016: US$247). This amount was included in the 
cost of wells, and an equivalent provision for environmental rehabilitation was established. 
In excess of this obligation, the Group recognises an estimated restoration amount for each well drilled in accordance with IAS 37 
‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. The amount recognised as a provision is the present value of the expenditure 
estimate required to settle the obligation at each balance sheet date, discounted at 6.18% until 2032. The provision is reviewed and 
adjusted at each balance sheet date as necessary.

17 .2 Legal claims
Tax
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the statutory tax audit of Kavala Oil S.A. for the years 2006–2011 was finalised and the 
official Tax Report was issued by the Greek tax authorities for tax and transfer pricing penalties amounting to US$6,673 (€5,564).  
On 22 April 2015, Kavala Oil S.A. has proceeded in executing its Mandatory Administrative Appeal before the Dispute Resolution 
Directorate of the Greek Ministry of Finance against certain tax assessment notices. 
The Group was required to make a prepayment of 50% of the value of the total exposure, thus a total amount of US$3,238 (€2,782) 
was paid by Kavala Oil S.A. during 2015. In the year ended 31 December 2016 this amount was presented in trade and other 
receivables (see Note 12) as an advance payment to Greek tax authorities. In 2017, the amount was no longer recorded as an advance 
payment due to a provision being recognised in full for the tax and transfer pricing penalties, as fully explained later in this note. In the 
year ended 31 December 2016 the Group had not recorded a provision for the initial tax and transfer pricing penalty.
The appeals were rejected implicitly by the Dispute Resolution Directorate of the Greek Ministry of Finance. Against the decisions  
of the Dispute Resolution Directorate, Kavala Oil S.A. filed on 8 October 2015 equal number of appeals before the Athens Administrative 
Court of Appeal. The discussion of these actions took place in February 2017 and the final decision is expected in 2018.
Developments in the tax audit framework in Greece, and specifically the repeal of the 18-month period under which an unqualified  
tax certificate issued by the statutory auditors to audited companies was considered to be final and the respective tax year to be 
considered as �finalised’, resulted in a change in attitude of many taxpayers during the period ended 31 December 2017, in respect  
of the approach followed with unaudited tax years. 
In addition, the five-year statute of limitation for the unaudited year of 2012 ends by the end of 2018. As of 31 December 2017, the 
Company has not received a tax audit request for the most recent non-prescribed unaudited year, which in the case of Kavala Oil S.A.  
is 2012. 
Kavala Oil S.A.’s court appeal against the transfer pricing penalties as well as the adjustment of the tax losses of the company is still 
pending and if a tax audit request is submitted to the company before the issuance of the court decision, it is likely that the tax auditors 
will follow the same approach as their predecessors and adjust the tax losses of the company accordingly.
Following the developments that took place in this period, the Company recognised a provision for its unaudited tax years 2012–2016 
of US$4,155. This takes into consideration the outcome of the tax audit of the Company’s transfer pricing policies finalised for fiscal 
year 2011. This amount corresponds to a corporate income tax amount of US$2,303 (Note 29) plus penalties and interest of US$1,851 
(Note 29).
The Company has also recorded a provision of US$6,935 for the fiscal years 2006–2011 which it is currently appealing. The amount 
differs from the initial assessment in the Tax Report due to additional interest and penalties accruing during the appeals process. The 
decision of the court is expected to be issued no sooner than the first half of 2018, if the decision is not in favour of the Company, this 
amount is payable in two equal monthly instalments. In such case, the Group’s intention is to submit an appeal at the higher level court  
(Council of State). An amount of US$3,839 of the US$6,935 has been already paid as prepayment in order to enable the Company to 
submit an administrative appeal. The total provision amounts for transfer pricing penalties of US$6,935 are included in other expenses 
(Note 25) and provision amounts for taxation expenses and income tax penalties of US$4,155 in taxation (expense)/income (Note 29). 
The total payable amount under the above provision, out of already paid amount of US$3,839, is included in current liabilities under 
�Provisions for liabilities’ in the consolidated statement of financial position, since the Company estimates the final decision will not be 
announced until 30 June 2018. 
Other
The Plaintiff, a State Company entrusted with the Operation of the Electricity Transmission System in Greece (�ADMIE’), commenced 
a claim against Kavala Oil S.A. in November 2014 seeking payments of €376 as utilities charges for the time period 2009–2011.  
ADMIE alleges that Kavala Oil, as owner of a power plant within the onshore facilities in Kavala and as the operator of this power  
plant exclusively for industrial own use, is subject to these charges – as any ordinary energy consumer would be under Greek law  
(Greek Energy Acts Nos. 2773/1999, 4067/2012 & 4001/2011) and the regulation of electricity distribution and transmission charges, 
approved by the Greek Energy Regulatory Commission (�RAE’) in 2008 and 2009 (�Charge Regulation 2008’, �Charge Regulation 2009’, 
�CHR 2008 & 2009’). 
17 .2 Legal claims continued
It must be noted that RAES ’ CHR 2008 & 2009 have been contested (by social organisations and other entities of consumers) before 
the Greek Supreme Administrative Court (Council of State) and due to constitutional illegality annulled. Thus, the abovementioned  
Act No. 4001/2011 reintroduced provisions similar to those of RAE’s CHR 2008 & 2009. 
By the decision of the Court of Appeal No. 91/2017 the Group is ordered to pay €376 (plus interest from the claim filing date, 
30 December 2014). Thus the Group proceed with a provision amount US$405 which is included in �Other expenses’. Effective 
December 2017, the Group started the repayment of the awarded amount in ten equal instalments of €49.7 each, bearing no interest,  
of which the first was paid in November 2017 and the tenth and last on shall be paid in August 2018. The Group reserves all rights 
against ADMIE based on the outcome of the case brought before the Supreme Court.

18. Retirement benefits obligation 
The Group provides retirement benefits in the form of lump sum amounts based on an unfunded fixed benefit retirement plan to its 
employees. The Group’s policy is to carry out an independent actuarial valuation every three years of the liabilities with regard to the 
retirement benefit plan.
According to the plan, a certain percentage of the current salary is converted into a pension component each year until retirement. 
Pensions under this scheme are paid out when a beneficiary has reached the age of 65. Eligible employees are required to contribute 
2% of their pensionable salary. The pension payments are also linked to the Greek consumer price index (CPI) in euros. 
In accordance with the provisions of Greek labour law, employees are entitled to compensation in case of dismissal or retirement.  
The amount of compensation varies depending on salary, years of service and the manner of termination (dismissal or retirement). 
Employees who resign are not entitled to compensation. The compensation payable in case of retirement is equal to 40% of the 
compensation which would be payable in case of unjustified dismissal. These plans are not funded and are defined benefit plans  
in accordance with IAS 19. The Greek subsidiaries charge the accrued benefits in each period with a corresponding increase  
in the relative actuarial liability. The payments made to retirees in every period are charged against this liability. The liabilities of  
the Group arising from the obligation to pay termination indemnities are determined through actuarial studies, conducted by 
independent actuaries.

18.4 Actuarial assumptions and risks

 As at 31 December 
2017 2016
Discount rate 1.50% 1.50%
Expected rate of salary increases 3.59% 3.59%
Average life expectancy 24.57 years 24.57 years
Inflation rate 1.75% 1.75%
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation of changing each assumption while not changing all 
other assumptions. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that 
the change in the assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
 As at 31 December
2017
(US$ 000)
2016
(US$ 000)
Effect of + 0.5% change in defined benefit obligation 
Discount rate + 9.0% + 9.0%
Expected rate of salary increases + 14.0% + 14.0%
Effect of – 0.5% change in defined benefit obligation
Discount rate -9.0% -9.0%
Expected rate of salary increases -14.0% -14.0%
18.4 Actuarial assumptions and risks continued
The amounts presented reflect the percentage increase/(decrease) in the given assumption that is required to impact the defined 
benefit obligation by +/- 0.5%, while holding all other assumptions constant.
The plan exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as interest rate risk, longevity changes and inflation risk.
Interest rate risk 
The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to market yields of high- 
quality corporate bonds. The estimated term of the bonds is consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligation and it 
is denominated in euros. A decrease in market yield on high-quality corporate bonds will increase the Group’s defined benefit liability.
Longevity of members 
The Group is required to provide benefits for life for the members of the plan. Any increase in the life expectancy of the members  
will increase the defined benefit liability.
Inflation risk 
A significant proportion of the defined benefit liability is linked to inflation. An increase in the inflation rate will increase the Group’s 
defined benefit liability.

Taxation Cyprus 
The Group is subject to corporation tax on its taxable profits at the rate of 12.5%. Any capital gains are taxed at the rate of 20%. 
Under certain conditions interest is subject either to corporation tax or to defence contribution. The relevant corporation tax rate  
for the year is 12.5% and the defence contribution rate is 30%. 
Companies in Cyprus which do not distribute 70% of their profits after tax, as defined by the relevant tax law, within two years after the 
end of the relevant tax year, will be deemed to have distributed as dividends 70% of these profits. Special contribution for defence at 
17% will be payable on such deemed dividends to the extent that the shareholders (companies and individuals) are both tax resident 
and also domiciled in Cyprus. The amount of deemed distribution is reduced by any actual dividends paid out of the profits of the 
relevant year at any time. This special contribution for defence is payable for the account of the shareholders. Given the current tax 
position of the Group’s companies in Cyprus, these deemed distribution rules are not applicable. 
Taxation Greece
The nominal tax rates applicable to Energean are exclusively governed per each contract area by the provisions of the lease 
agreements ratified by Laws 2779/1999 (Prinos), 4298/2014 (Katakolo) and 4300/2014 (Ioannina). The applicable tax rate according  
to the aforementioned agreements for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 is 25%.
On 12 July 2017 a tax audit order was issued by the Greek tax authorities in respect of FY12 for Energean Oil & Gas S.A. and the 
request for information commenced on 15 January 2018. For FY12, Energean Oil & Gas S.A, was audited by Grant Thornton, in 
accordance with Article 82 of Greece's Law 2238/1994 and received an unqualified tax certificate. On this basis should any tax 
liabilities arise from the audit, they are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 
The nominal tax rate of Kavala Oil S.A. for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016 is 29%.

30. Earnings per share
The earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2017 and 2016. There were no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during any 
period, therefore the basic and diluted earnings per common share were equal.
In accordance with IAS 33 ‘Earnings Per Share’, the comparative weighted average number of shares was restated to apply the number 
of shares which arose from the Group restructuring described in Note 14.
From continuing and discontinued operations

31.4 Reorganisation
On 30 June 2017 the Group entered into a Reorganisation Agreement which was subsequently amended by the �Supplementary 
Agreement’ dated 31 October 2017. The Reorganisation Agreement is between the Company and the existing shareholders of 
Energean E&P Holdings (�the Existing Shareholders’), Energean E&P Holdings, Energean Israel and Energean International. Under the 
Reorganisation Agreement, the Company became the holding company of the Group (see Note 1.1) and the senior secured loan from 
Third Point and certain other parties was discharged in exchange for US$224 million preference shares in Energean International Limited.
The preference shares in Energean International Limited have no voting rights. Rights to future capital and distributions comprise the 
right to a return of capital of $224 million upon winding up of Energean Israel Limited and, as clarified in the Supplementary Agreement 
dated 31 October, priority over distributions to the Company’s ordinary shareholders up to an amount of $224 million. 
Under the Reorganisation Agreement dated 30 June 2017 and the subsequent Supplementary Agreement dated 31 October 2017,  
the Group also made the following commitments:
 X Under the Reorganisation Agreement dated 30 June 2017, in the event of an Exit transaction as defined in the Reorganisation 
Agreement, the Group committed to acquire the preference shares in Energean Israel Limited. Consideration would be in the form  
of ordinary shares of the Company to the value of $224 million in the event of a Sale transaction or $240 million in the case of an IPO. 
Under the Reorganisation Agreement, each of Third Point and the Founders may at any time propose an Exit Event at which time 
each of the other parties to this Agreement shall: (i) give such co-operation and assistance as such Parties may reasonably request; 
and (ii) use all reasonable endeavours to procure that such Exit Event is achieved in accordance with such proposal, and therefore 
the contingent settlement provision of the preference shares represented a financial liability at 30 June 2017, initially recognised at 
its fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost (see Note 34.2 for the impact on the consolidated financial statements). 
Under the Supplementary Agreement dated 31 October 2017, the process for implementation of an Exit Event (whether by reference 
to an IPO or Sale) requires the consent of each of Third Point, the Founders and the Company; therefore the liability recognised was 
extinguished on 31 October 2017 with no impact on profit or loss. 
 X Under the Reorganisation Agreement dated 30 June 2017, in the event of an Exit transaction as defined in the Reorganisation 
Agreement, the Group committed to acquire the Founders’ 50% interests in the B shares of Energean Israel Limited which represent 
50% of the beneficial ownership of Energean Israel. Taken together with the Group’s A shares of Energean Israel Limited (see Note 
9), this would result in Energean Israel becoming a 50% joint venture investee of the Group. Consideration would be in the form of 
ordinary shares of the Company to the value of $50 million in the event of a Sale transaction or $150 million in the case of an IPO.

31.4 Reorganisation continued
 X Under the Reorganisation Agreement, the Group was contractually obliged to pursue an Exit transaction, and therefore the contingent 
share purchase represented a derivative financial instrument at 30 June 2017, carried at fair value through profit and loss (see Note 
34.2). Pursuant to the terms of the Supplementary Agreement the Company agreed to acquire the Energean Israel Limited Class B 
Shares from its founder shareholders upon the occurrence of:
 (i) a Sale for US$10 million in cash (rather than for the issue of New Shares as contemplated by the Reorganisation Agreement); or
 (ii) an IPO for US$10 million in cash (rather than for the issue of New Shares as contemplated by the Reorganisation Agreement).
The impact of the Supplementary Agreement on the derivative financial instrument was recognised as a credit to equity. In March 2018 
the Company completed the admission of its shares to the Premium Segment of the London Stock Exchange.
32. Legal cases and other contingent liabilities 
32.1 Other contingent liabilities
The Group had no material contingent liabilities as of 31 December 2017 and 2016.
33. Commitments and contingencies
33.1 Operating lease commitments 
The non-cancellable operating lease agreements entered by the Group relate mainly to:
 X Lease of supply vessel Valiant Energy;
 X Lease of supply vessel Energean Wave;
 X Office rentals; and
 X Vehicle leases.
The total operating lease expenses for the year ended 31 December 2017 amounted to US$395 (year ended 31 December 2016: US$251).
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:

33.2 Performance guarantees 
Energean Israel Limited, on 25 December 2016, submitted to the Petroleum Commissioner two irrevocable bank guarantees issued  
by HSBC of US$10 million each, for each of the Karish and Tanin leases, to secure compliance with the leases and related liabilities. 
The guarantees replace the respective guarantees in the amount of US$7.5 million each given by the previous leaseholders Noble, 
Delek, and Avner.
The Group has issued a Letter of Guarantee of US$6,000 to beneficiary Ganoub El Wadi Holding Petroleum (�GANOPE’), which is the 
Egyptian Oil Commissioning Authority, in respect of the capital and financial commitments of its related entity, Energean International 
Limited, in the area of West Kom Ombo. As of 31 December 2017, the US$6,000 guarantee has been reduced to US$2,225 and is now 
due to expire on 2 May 2018. The Group relinquished the area in October 2017 and the respective bank guarantee was further reduced 
in April 2018 to the amount of US$1,285. The Group in the year ended 31 December 2017, recognised a provision of US$1,285 for the 
remaining amount of the financial commitment (note 22).
The Group provided a performance guarantee for the amount of US$704 (€587) issued to the Greek Ministry of Environment, Energy 
and Climate Change in respect of the contract with the Greek State for exploitation in the Prinos area. See Note 13.2. 
33.2 Performance guarantees continued
In relation to the investment in the areas of Ioannina and Katakolo, Energean Oil & Gas S.A. and its partners proceeded to provide bank 
guarantees in favour of the Greek Ministry of Environment & Energy for total amounts of US$8,600 (€7,900), and US$751 (€690), for 
each area respectively. The purpose of these guarantees is the security of the minimum expenditure obligation per area, by Energean 
Oil & Gas S.A. and its partners, as this derives from the provisions of the respective lease agreements. 
As of 31 December 2016, the US$8,600 (€7,900) performance bank guarantee related to Ioannina block was reduced to US$6,507 
(€6,173) while as of 31 December 2017 it has been further reduced to US$6,666 (€5,558), and will be further reduced from time to time  
to represent the remaining minimum expenditure obligations. For the security of any bank claim on the aforementioned guarantees, 
Energean Oil & Gas S.A. proceeded to restricting an amount of US$2,680 (€2,235), which corresponds to its 40% participating interest 
as described in Note 13.2.
The performance bank guarantee of US$379 (€360) related to Katakolo block has already expired, since Energean Oil & Gas S.A.  
has executed the committed minimum expenditure.
A €3.0 million guarantee from Energean Montenegro Limited in favour of the state of Montenegro, due to expire on 14 October 2020, 
relates to the Group’s concession and mandatory work programme in Montenegro. The guarantee is secured by a €3.0 million cash 
deposit (see Note 13.2).
33.3 Contingent consideration
Energean Israel Limited has an obligation to pay a total additional amount of one hundred and eight million and five hundred thousand 
dollars (US$108,500) in ten equal annual payments for the acquisition of the Tanin and Karish offshore Israel leases as described  
in Note 9.1. This additional payment represents contingent consideration that is not recognised within the consolidated financial 
statements. The contingent consideration is due on the earlier of the date on which a final investment decision of Energean Israel 
Limited has been made or the date on which the aggregate expenditures in connection with the Israeli leases exceed US$150,000. 
34. Financial assets and liabilities 
34.1. Carrying amount

34.2. Fair value measurements
The information set out below provides information about how the Group determines fair values of various financial assets and 
liabilities.
The fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost approximate to their carrying amounts at the 
reporting date. The carrying value less any estimated credit adjustments for financial assets and financial liabilities with a maturity of 
less than one year are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term-nature.
Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 135 134 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements continued
34.2. Fair value measurements continued
The Group has only one material financial asset measured at fair value at 31 December 2017 which relates to the Energean Israel B 
shares. As part of the reorganisation, the Group on 30 June 2017 committed to acquire the 50% of the class B shares of Energean 
Israel Limited in an Exit Event (See Note 31.4).
The valuation technique used multiplies the estimated likelihood of an Exit (being an IPO or a Sale) by the estimated difference 
between the consideration payable under the commitment and the estimated value of the B shares to be acquired under the 
commitment. The key input assumptions used in the fair value measurement calculation are the estimated likelihood of an IPO event 
and value of the B shares. An Exit in the form of a Sale is considered to be of negligible likelihood. The other significant inputs are the 
transaction prices applicable in an Exit Event, which are contractually agreed amounts, and the discount rate assumption used in the 
calculation which was 11.5%. The fair value of the derivative asset is a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value measurement 
hierarchy, because the valuation relies significantly on input assumptions that are unobservable.
On remeasurement on 31 December 2017, the value of the B shares was estimated based on the price negotiated at a similar time  
with a third party for another tranche of the B shares in a separate transaction. The likelihood of a future IPO occurring was estimated 
as of 31 December 2017 to be 50%, having regard to the considerable progress made to prepare for an IPO as of that date, but also to 
the fact that there were a number of significant steps not wholly under the control of the Group that remained to be achieved, and the 
inherent uncertainty in achieving any IPO due to capital market conditions.
The change in fair value of US$25,786 between 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2017 is included in �Gain on derivative’ in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss as it is due to changes in measurement assumptions.
Also on 31 October 2017, under the Supplementary Agreement (see Note 31.4) the consideration payable to acquire the B shares in 
the event of an IPO was reduced from US$150 million to US$10 million. The resulting increase in the value of the derivative asset of 
US$67,506 (after applying the 50% IPO likelihood assumption and other discounting effects) is recorded in the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity as the Supplementary Agreement is a transaction with owners, giving the derivative asset a closing value as of 
31 October 2017 of US$91,615. As of 31 December 2017 the derivative asset was further increased to US$93,292 due to unwinding 
of the discount applied at the recognition, resulted in additional gain of US$1,677 recorded in profit or loss.
If the probability of an IPO increased to 100%, whilst the probability of a sale was 0% and the discount rate was held constant, the 
fair value of the derivative asset to purchase Energean Israel Class B shares at 31 December 2017 would increase by US$93,292.
If the discount rate increased from 11.5% to 20%, whilst the probability of an IPO and probability of a sale were held constant, the 
fair value of the derivative asset to purchase Energean Israel Class B Shares at 31 December 2017 would decrease by US$1,135. 
Upon recognition, the derivative was the only instrument in the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers  
in or out of this category in the period, and the only movement in the category relates to the increase in fair value of the derivative.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value (but fair value disclosure is 
required) is as follows:

Total – 336,962 – 336,962
     
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements during the year. 
35. Financial risk management 
The Group’s Treasury function provides services to the business and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the 
operations of the Group, through internal reporting which analyses exposures by degree and magnitude of risk. These risks include 
market risk (interest rate risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk).
The Treasury function reports monthly to the Board of Directors to monitor risks and policies implemented to manage risk exposures.
35.1 Interest rate risk 
The Group’s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on long-term financing. Longer-term borrowings are therefore 
usually at fixed rates. At 31 December 2017, the Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates through bank borrowings at 
variable interest rates. Other borrowings are at fixed interest rates. The exposure to interest rates for the Group’s money market funds 
is considered immaterial.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit to a reasonably possible change in interest rates of +/- 1%. These changes are 
considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in 
the average market interest rate for each period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes 
in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

35.2 Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of a failure by counterparties to discharge their obligations, which could reduce the amount of future cash inflows 
from financial assets on hand at the reporting date. The Group has policies in place to ensure that all of its transactions giving rise to 
credit risk are made with parties having an appropriate credit history, and monitors on a continuous basis the ageing profile of its 
receivables.

35.2 Credit risk continued
Also, the Group has policies to limit the amount of credit exposure to any banking institution, considering among other factors the 
credit ratings of the banks with which deposits are held. Credit quality information in relation to those banks is provided below.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date, without taking account of any collateral obtained, was:

Credit quality of non-impaired bank deposits 
The credit quality of the banks in which the Group keeps its non-impaired deposits is assessed by reference to the credit rating  
of these banks. The credit ratings of the corresponding banks in which of the Group keeps its deposits as follows:
AA/Aa2
AA/Aa3
Lower than B-/B3
The Company has assessed the recoverability of all cash balances and believe they are presented at fair value within the consolidated 
Statement of financial position.
35.3 Foreign exchange risk 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk as it undertakes operations in various foreign currencies. The key sources of the risk  
are attributed to the fact that the Group has certain subsidiaries with euro functional currencies in which a number of loan agreements 
denominated in US$ and sales of crude oil are additionally denominated in US$.
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at each reporting date is shown in the table below. The amounts shown are the US$ 
equivalent of the foreign currency amounts.

The above calculations assume that interest rates remain the same as at the reporting date. 
35.4 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An unmatched position potentially can 
increase the risk of losses. The Group has procedures with the object of minimising such losses such as maintaining sufficient cash 
and other highly liquid current assets and by having available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based 
on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table 
includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by ongoing monitoring of its cash flows. Management budgets and follows up its cash flows and 
appropriately acts for available cash deposits and credit lines with the banks. 
As part of the derivative asset recognition under the Reorganisation and Supplementary Agreement (Note 31.4), there is a contractual 
cash flow of US$10 million to be paid on either a Sale transaction or an IPO. The carrying value of the derivative asset as of 31 
December 2017 is US$93,292.

36. Other risk management 
36.1 Inventory market price risk 
External market conditions can impact our financial performance. Supply, demand and the prices achieved for our products can  
be affected by a wide range of factors including political developments, technological change, global economic conditions and the 
influence of OPEC.
Hedging activity
The Group does not have a formal hedging policy with regard to the oil price and is limited in the scope of its hedging activities under 
the terms of its facility agreements with the EBRD. Historically, hedging has been undertaken via zero-cost collars for general downside 
risk and fixed price contracts to set a fixed price for a set number of barrels for a known future BP lifting to protect against either  
(i) a fall in the oil price and/or (ii) the pricing optionality afforded to BP under the BP Offtake Agreement.
36.2 Customer concentration risk 
The Group’s revenue is derived from a single major customer. The loss of this customer would adversely affect the Group’s financial 
position and operating results. The Group takes all reasonable steps to maintain a good relationship with that customer.

37 . Capital management 
The Group for management purposes determines as capital, defined as total equity, including all reserves, plus its shareholders, 
subordinated debt.
Shareholders' subordinated debt represents loans from the shareholders of the Group. The Group defines net debt as the Group’s total 
borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) less cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group manages its capital and net debt to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return  
to shareholders through the optimisation of the balance between its net debt and capital. 
The Group manages its capital structure and takes reasonable steps in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk 
characteristics of its underlying business and assets. In order to maintain or improve its capital structure the Group may issue new 
shares, sell assets to reduce debt, refinance existing borrowings, and/or adjust the amount of any distribution of dividends.
The net debt at the end of the period is calculated using the following amounts, as shown in the consolidated statement of  
financial position:
 As at 31 December
2017
(US$ 000)
2016

38. Subsequent events 
On 21 March 2018 the Company completed the admission of its shares to the Premium Segment of the London Stock Exchange and 
raised gross proceeds of US$460 million.
On 16 March the Company acquired 50% of the preference shares of Energean Israel from its founder shareholders after paying the 
total consideration of US$10 million (please refer to Note 31.4).
In March 2018, further to a subscription agreement pursuant to which the Group agreed to subscribe for additional shares in  
Energean Israel Limited for an aggregate consideration of US$266.7 million, the Group acquired an additional 20% of Energean Israel 
shares, with Kerogen holding the remaining 30%.
In March 2018 the Group proceeded with a Final Investment Decision (FID) on the Karish and Tanin offshore Israel leases. In 
consequence the Group proceeded with the recognition of a liability in respect of the deferred consideration for the acquisition  
of the Tanin and Karish leases of US$108.5 million due in ten equal annual payments. 
On 30 January 2018, the Group’s existing EBRD Senior Facility Agreement was amended and restated pursuant to the RBL Senior 
Facility Agreement. The RBL Senior Facility Agreement comprises two facilities — a facility of up to US$105 million with EBRD and  
the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) as lenders (the �IFI Facility’) and a US$75 million facility pursuant to which  
the Export-Import Bank of Romania Eximbank SA (�Romanian ECA’) and Banca Comerciala Intesa Sanpaolo Romania S.A. (with 95% 
insurance cover from the Romanian ECA) as lenders (the �Romanian Club Facility’). Proceeds from the Romanian Club Facility will 
finance exclusively 85% of the value attributable to goods and services under the GSP Engineering, Procurement, Construction and 
Installation Contract (EPCIC). 
On 12 February 2018, the Group signed an amendment to the BP Offtake Agreement to extend the contract to supply the produced 
Prinos crude oil to BP Oil International until the later of a) the expiry of the agreement on 1 November 2025 or b) the delivery of 
twenty-five million barrels. As of 31 December 2017 the Group has delivered 3,974,667 barrels under the BP Offtake Agreement.

As at 31 December 2017
(a) General information 
Energean Oil & Gas plc (‘the Company') was incorporated in the England & Wales on 8 May 2017 as a public company with limited 
liability, under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered number is 10758801 and its registered office is at 21 Gloucester Place, London 
W1U 8HR, United Kingdom. The financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest US$ 
thousand (‘000), except where otherwise stated. Energean Oil & Gas plc is the ultimate parent of the Energean Oil & Gas Group. 
(b) Basis of preparation
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (�FRS 100’) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. The financial statements have therefore been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101  
(�FRS 101’) ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ as issued by the Financial Reporting Council. As permitted by FRS 101, the Company  
has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
a) the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures;
b) the requirements of paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement;
c)  the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ to present comparative information  
in respect of: (i) paragraph 79(a) (iv) of IAS 1 and (ii) paragraph 73(e) of IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment;
d)  the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 16, 38A to 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C and 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 Presentation  
of Financial Statements; 
g) the requirements of IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows; 
i) the requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures; 
j)  the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member; 
Where relevant, equivalent disclosures have been given in the Group accounts.
During the year the Company made a profit of US$25.0 million.
(c) Going concern
The Directors have exercised significant judgement in assessing that the preparation of the financial statements on a going concern 
basis is appropriate. In making this assessment, the factors considered, among others, include the current financial position and the 
profitability of the Company as well their expectations in relation to future business prospects, and future profitability and cash flows  
of the Company. Another important factor for determining that the going concern basis remains appropriate is the ability to raise 
funding as and when needed. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company successfully completed an IPO on the London 
Stock Exchange and raised $460 million gross proceeds. Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
(d) Foreign currencies
The US dollar is the reporting currency of the Company. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange 
ruling at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at the 
rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the income statement.
(e) Investments
Fixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Strategic report Other information Financial statements Corporate governance
Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 143 142 Energean Oil & Gas plc Annual Report 2017 Financial statements continued
(f) Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
FVTPL includes financial instruments held for trading (HFT) and financial instruments designated upon initial recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial instruments are classified as HFT if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the 
near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives, are also classified as HFT. Financial instruments at fair value 
through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented as a gain or 
loss in the statement of profit or loss. The Company’s financial instruments that have been classified as HFT are derivative 
instruments. 
(g) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and 
recoverable amount. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost. Allowance is made when 
there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to recover balances in full. Evidence on non-recoverability may include 
indications that the debtor or group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter 
bankruptcy or default or delinquency in repayments. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being 
remote. The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
(h) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior 
to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Company becomes obligated to make future payments in respect of 
the purchase of those goods and services. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
(i) Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset 
or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset  
or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by 
selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available  
to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements, are categorised within the fair value 
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
 X Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
 X Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly  
or indirectly observable
 X Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether 
transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest-level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Company accounting policies
continued
(j) Share issue expenses
Costs of share issues are written off against the premium arising on the issues of share capital.
(k) Capital management
The Company defines capital as the total equity of the Company. Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders  
and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is not subject  
to any externally imposed capital requirements. To maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend 
payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, and/or put in place new debt facilities.
(l) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities are discussed below:
Fair value measurements and valuation processes
Some of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of 
an asset or a liability the Company uses market-observable data to the extent that it is possible. Where level 1 inputs are not available, 
as is the case for the option to purchase Energean Israel Class B shares the Company has used a combination of level 2 and level 3 
inputs to estimate the fair value.
The Chief Financial Officer reports the valuations to the Board of Directors of the Company every six months to explain the cause of 
fluctuations in the fair value of the assets and liabilities. 
Information about the valuation technique and inputs used in determining the fair value of the option to purchase Energean Israel Class 
B shares is disclosed in Note 4.

Company. At incorporation, the affiliate company Energean E&P Holdings provided a letter according to which the amount of ₤50,000  
is held available in its bank accounts on behalf of the Company until its shareholders are able to pay the amount. At reporting date,  
the amount was still outstanding. 
The amount included under deposits and prepayments account consists of the costs accrued in 2017 related to the Initial Public 
Offering (IPO) of the Company, which at reporting date was still in progress. All such costs will be reported in the year the IPO is 
successfully completed and will be debited against the share capital raised. Such IPO costs are related to the services provided to the 
Company by the reporting accountants, lawyers and other professionals. 
Note 4. Financial instruments 
Disclosure exemptions adopted
Where equivalent disclosures for the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements 
have been included in the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts of Energean Oil & Gas plc, the Company has adopted the disclosure 
exemptions available to the Company’s accounts.
Financial risk management objectives
The Company follows the Group’s policies for managing all its financial risks.
Fair values of derivative instruments
The Company has one material financial asset measured at fair value at 31 December 2017 which relates to the Energean Israel B 
shares. As part of the reorganisation the Company committed on 30 June 2017 to acquire the 50% of the class B shares of Energean 
Israel Limited in an Exit Event.
The valuation technique used multiplies the estimated likelihood of an Exit (being an IPO or a Sale) by the estimated difference 
between the consideration payable under the commitment and the estimated value of the B shares to be acquired under the 
commitment. The key input assumptions used in the fair value measurement calculation are the estimated likelihood of an IPO event 
and the value of the B shares. An Exit in the form of a Sale is considered to be of negligible likelihood. The other significant inputs are 
the transaction prices applicable in an Exit Event, which are contractually agreed amounts, and the discount rate assumption used in 
the calculation, which was 11.5%. The fair value of the derivative asset is a Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value 
measurement hierarchy, because the valuation relies significantly on input assumptions that are unobservable.
On remeasurement on 31 December 2017, the value of the B shares was estimated based on the price negotiated at a similar time  
with a third party for another tranche of the B shares in a separate transaction. The likelihood of a future IPO occurring was estimated 
as of 31 December 2017 to be 50%, having regard to the considerable progress made to prepare for an IPO as of that date, but also  
to the fact that there were a number of significant steps not wholly under the control of the Company that remained to be achieved,  
and the inherent uncertainty in achieving any IPO due to capital market conditions.
The change in fair value of US$25,786 between 30 June 2017 and 31 December 2017 is included in �Gain on derivative’ in the 
statement of profit or loss as it is due to changes in measurement assumptions.
Also on 31 October 2017, under the Supplementary Agreement the consideration payable to acquire the B shares in the event of an  
IPO was reduced from $150 million to $10 million. The resulting increase in the value of the derivative asset of US$67,506 (after 
applying the 50% IPO likelihood assumption and other discounting effects) is recorded in the statement of changes in equity, as the 
Supplementary Agreement is a transaction with owners, giving the derivative asset a closing value as of 31 October 2017 of $91,615. 
As of 31 December 2017 the derivative asset was further increased to US$93,292 due to unwinding of the discount applied at the 
recognition, resulted in additional gain of US$1,677 recorded in profit or loss.
If the probability of an IPO increased to 100%, whilst the probability of a sale was 0% and the discount rate was held constant, the fair 
value of the derivative asset to purchase Energean Israel Class B shares at 31 December 2017 would increase by US$93,292.
If the discount rate increased from 11.5% to 20%, whilst the probability of an IPO and probability of a sale were held constant, the fair 
value of the derivative asset to purchase Energean Israel Class B shares at 31 December 2017 would decrease by US$1,135.
Upon recognition, the derivative was the only instrument in the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers  
in or out of this category in the period, and the only movement in the category relates to the increase in fair value of the derivative.

on 1 December 2014 and require UK companies in the extractive sector to publicly disclose 
payments made to governments in the countries where they undertake extractive 
operations. The regulations implement Chapter 10 of EU Accounting Directive (2013/34/ 
EU). The UK Regulations came into effect on 1 January 2015. The 2016  
disclosure remains in line with the EU Directive and UK Regulations and we have provided 
additional voluntary disclosure on withholding taxes, PAYE and other taxes.
The payments disclosed are based on where the obligation for the payment arose: payments raised at a project level have been 
disclosed at project level and payments raised at a corporate level have been disclosed on that basis. However, where a payment or  
a series of related payments do not exceed £86,000, they are disclosed at a corporate level, in accordance with the UK Regulations. 
The voluntary disclosure has been prepared on a corporate level. All of the payments disclosed in accordance with the Directive  
have been made to National Governments, either directly or through a Ministry or Department of the National Government,  
with the exception of Greek payments in respect of production royalties and licence fees, which are paid to the Hellenic Hydrocarbon 
Resources Management SA. 
Royalties – represent cash royalties paid to the Greek Government during the year for the extraction of oil. The terms of the royalty  
paid described within our Lease Agreement for Prinos area. The cash payment of royalties occurs within a three months’ period  
from the end of the year in which the royalty payment obligation has arisen.
Licence fees – represent licence fees, rental fees, entry fees and other consideration for licences and/or concessions paid for  
access to an area during the year (with the exception of signature bonuses which are captured within bonus payments).
Withholding tax (WHT) – represent tax charged mainly on services and royalties. The amount disclosed is equal to the WHT  
return submitted by Energean to governments with the cash payment made in the year the charge is borne. 
PAYE and national insurance – represent payroll and employer taxes paid (such as PAYE and national insurance) by Energean  
as a direct employer. The amount disclosed is equal to the return submitted by Energean to governments with the cash payment  
made in the year the charge is borne.
Training allowances – comprise payments made in respect of training government or national oil company staff. This can be  
in the form of mandatory contractual requirements or discretionary training provided by a company.
VAT – Represents net cash VAT received from/paid to governments during the year. The amount disclosed is equal to the VAT  
refunds/payments made by Energean to governments on a cash basis.
Other taxes – comprise payments made in respect taxes other than the above including annual levies, stamp duties etc. 
The main economic value to 
host governments is from payroll 
and other withholding taxes on 
Energean’s activities.
