“ We have had a successful year through a combination of organic and 
acquisitive growth combined with a strong operational performance. 
Over the last 18 months our market-leading positions in the UK and Paris 
have been consolidated, supported by the acquisitions of Space Maker 
and Alligator Self Storage, which added 24 stores to the UK portfolio and 
boosted earnings from the outset. Organically we have developed and 
opened six new stores in the UK and Paris, with a pipeline of a further 
four new stores opening in London, Birmingham and Paris.”
Frederic Vecchioli, Safestore’s Chief Executive Officer

Notes
1  Cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment 
properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the 
Safestore Employee Benefit Trust).
2  CER is constant exchange rates (Euro-denominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the 
reported results on a more comparable basis).
3  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and 
Emerainville, as well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has 
been adjusted.
4  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent 
and depreciation. Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to 
bank loans and cash.
5   Profit before tax decreased by £16.0 million to £78.9 million (FY2016: £94.9 million) principally as a result of exceptional costs totalling £17.7 million (FY2016: exceptional income of 
£4.3 million), which includes exceptional refinancing costs of £16.3 million, and a reduction in the gain on investment properties by £2.5 million to £39.2 million (FY2016: £41.7 million), 
offset by an improvement in underlying EBITDA of £8.7 million.
6 The consideration paid for Alligator on 1 November 2017 was £56.0 million, and is subject to customary working capital adjustment.
7  LTV ratio is loan-to-value ratio, which is defined as gross debt (excluding finance leases, but adjusted for the fair value of the US Dollar cross currency swap) as a proportion of the valuation 
of investment properties and investment properties under construction (excluding finance leases).
8  ICR is interest cover ratio, and is calculated as the ratio of underlying EBITDA after leasehold rent to underlying finance charges.
9  Occupancy excludes offices but includes bulk tenancy. As at 31 October 2017, closing occupancy includes 27,000 sq ft of bulk tenancy (31 October 2016: 37,000 sq ft).
10  MLA is maximum lettable area. At 31 October 2017, Group MLA was 5.71m sq ft (FY2016: 5.59m sq ft).
11  Average storage rate is calculated as the revenue generated from self-storage revenues divided by the average square footage occupied during the period in question.
12  Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the period after tax but excluding corporate 
transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of 
exceptional items, IFRS 2 share-based payment charges, exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost 
is excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). Therefore, neither the Company’s ability to 
distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). The financial statements will disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and 
Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full reconciliation of the differences in the financial year in which any LTIP awards may vest.
13  Free cash flow is defined as cash flow before investing and financing activities but after leasehold rent payments. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Chairman’s statement
The Board remains confident in the prospects for the Group
Strong strategic 
progress over the year
I am pleased to announce, on behalf of the Board of Safestore, another 
strong set of results for the year ended 31 October 2017. 
There has been strong strategic progress over the year. Space Maker, 
acquired in July 2016, is fully integrated into the Group and the six 
new stores opened over the last sixteen months are all performing 
at least in line with their business plans. The acquisition of Alligator, 
completed on 1 November 2017, will be integrated during the first half 
of the current financial year and we have a pipeline of four new sites, 
adding 226,000 sq ft of capacity, opening over the next 18 months. 
Management’s focus remains on the existing store portfolio and filling 
the 1.7m sq ft of available capacity (including Alligator), building on 
the operational improvements made over the previous four years. 
The refinancing of our bank debt and US private placement notes in 
May 2017 has improved further the balance sheet flexibility and capacity 
to continue to take advantage of carefully selected development and 
acquisition opportunities. I remain confident that the business is well 
positioned for growth and to deliver additional value for shareholders.
During the year, our Remuneration Committee has spent a significant 
amount of time engaging with our shareholders around our new 
remuneration policy. Like the Remuneration Committee, I strongly 
believe that the new remuneration structure, which is designed 
to break away from the conventional model and drive exceptional 
corporate performance from our talented management team over 
the next five years, is in the best interests of all stakeholders. I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank all the shareholders who have 
supported our proposals, as well as all of those who have engaged 
with us and put considerable time and effort into analysing and 
providing feedback on our proposals.
Financial results
Revenue for the year was £129.9 million, 12.6% ahead of last year 
(FY2016: £115.4 million) and was up 10.0% on a constant currency 
basis. Like-for-like revenue was up 3.3% in constant currency. 
This result was driven by a solid performance in the UK, which 
grew like-for-like revenue by 3.1%, combined with another strong 
performance by Une Pièce en Plus, our Parisian business, which 
grew like-for-like revenue by 4.0%. In addition, the July 2016 acquisition 
of Space Maker contributed to the revenue growth.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 13.6% to £72.9 million (FY2016: 
£64.2 million) and 10.7% on a constant currency basis. Underlying EBITDA 
after rental costs increased by 13.0% to £62.6 million (FY2016: £55.4 million).
The refinancing of our bank debt and US private placement notes 
in May 2017 was the principal driver of a reduction in the year in 
the underlying finance charge of £0.7 million or 6.9% to £9.4 million 
(FY2016: £10.1 million). Over the last four years we have reduced 
our finance charges by 49% or £9.0 million.
As a result of the above factors, cash tax adjusted earnings per share 
grew by 17.7% to 23.3 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence). Cash tax adjusted 
EPS has grown by 12.2 pence or 110% over the last four years.
Statutory basic earnings per share decreased to 37.4 pence 
(FY2016: 42.0 pence), the increase in cash tax adjusted earnings per 
share being offset by a reduction in the gain on investment properties 
and an increase in exceptional costs and exceptional finance charges.
Capital structure
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust with a Group LTV
7
 ratio 
of 36% and an interest cover ratio of 6.7x. This represents a level 
of gearing we consider appropriate for the business to enable the 
Group to increase returns on equity, maintain financial flexibility 
and to achieve our medium term strategic objectives.
Dividend
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board 
is pleased to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend to 
9.8 pence per share (FY2016: 8.05 pence per share), resulting in an 
increase of 20.2% in the total dividend to 14.0 pence per share for 
the year (FY2016: 11.65 pence per share). The total dividend for the 
year is covered 1.66 times by cash tax earnings (1.70 times in 2016). 
The Group’s dividend has increased by 143% in the last four years. 
Shareholders will be asked to approve the dividend at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2018 and, if approved, the final 
dividend will be payable on 6 April 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at close of business on 9 March 2018.
The Board remains confident in the prospects for the Group and 
will continue its progressive dividend policy in 2018 and beyond. 
In the medium term it is anticipated that the Group’s dividend will 
grow at least in line with Adjusted Diluted EPRA Earnings per Share
12
. 
People
In another year of progress, our people continue to be the key to the 
success of the business. I would like to take this opportunity to thank 
all my colleagues throughout the business for their hard work and 
dedication this year.

Chief Executive’s statement
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend
We have strengthened 
our market-leading portfolio
Summary 
Building on the performance of 2016, Safestore has delivered another strong 
financial result through a combination of organic and acquisitive growth and 
the debt refinancing in May 2017 . Total Group revenue increased by 12.6% 
(10.0% at CER
1
) with a strong performance across the UK (+11.6%) and 
continued strength in Paris (+5.1%). On a like-for-like basis
2
 in CER, Group 
revenue increased by 3.3% with the UK up 3.1% and Paris up 4.0%. 
The Group’s like-for-like closing occupancy increased by 1.3 percentage 
points (“ppts”) to 75.0% with the average storage rate up 1.3% at CER. 
Our operational performance across the UK has been robust this year. 
Our updated consumer website, combined with our digital marketing 
expertise, delivered good enquiry growth, which has resulted in like-for-like 
closing occupancy in the UK growing by 0.6ppts to 72.5%. Growth 
in occupancy in the UK regions outside London and the South East 
performed particularly well. 
ln the UK, we successfully integrated the Space Maker portfolio during the 
year and completed the acquisition of the twelve-store Alligator Self Storage 
portfolio on 1 November 2017 for £56 million
3
. In addition, the four new 
stores opened in London – Chiswick, London – Wandsworth, Birmingham 
and Altrincham, on time and on budget, between August and November 
2016 are all performing in line with or ahead of their business plans. 
In Paris, our performance has been robust with like-for-like revenue growing 
by 4.0%. Our balanced approach to revenue management resulted in 
like-for-like rate growth of 2.3% and average occupancy growth of 1.2%. 
Like-for -like closing occupancy ended the year at 84.7% (FY2016: 80.7%). 
This is the nineteenth consecutive year of revenue growth in Paris with 
average growth over the last five years of circa 5%. We opened a new 
store in Emerainville in September 2016 and our most recent new store 
at Combs-la-Ville opened in June 2017. Both are trading in line with 
their business plans. 
Group underlying EBITDA of £72.9 million increased by 10.7% at CER 
on the prior year and by 13.6% on a reported basis reflecting the impact 
of the strengthening Euro on the profit earned on our Paris business. The 
Group’s strong EBITDA performance, combined with reduced finance costs 
arising from the refinancing of the Group’s USPP notes and amendment 
and extension of the bank facilities completed in May 2017, resulted in 
a 17.7% increase in cash tax adjusted EPS
4
 in the period to 23.3 pence 
(FY2016: 19.8 pence). Going forward, the business will be focusing on 
the Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS
5
 measure, which is consistent with how 
the underlying performance of the business is measured and with how 
management is incentivised for the long term. Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS 
for FY2017 was 23.2 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence). 
Our property portfolio valuation, including investment properties under 
construction, increased in the year by 6.2% on a constant currency basis. 
After exchange rate movements the portfolio valuation increased by 5.5% 
to £1,007.0 million with the UK portfolio up £33.8 million to a total UK 
value of £744.4 million and the French portfolio increased €27.7 million 
to €298.6 million. 
Reflecting the Group’s strong trading performance, the Board is pleased 
to recommend a 21.7% increase in the final dividend to 9.8 pence per 
share (FY2016: 8.05 pence) resulting in a full year dividend up 20.2% 
to 14.0 pence per share (FY2016: 11.65 pence).

05 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Outlook 
In the last 18 months Safestore has further strengthened its market positions 
in both the UK and Paris with the acquisitions of Space Maker and Alligator, 
the opening of six new stores and the establishment of a pipeline of a further 
four new stores. Including Alligator, the Group has 1.7m sq ft of fully 
invested unlet space available, offering significant operational upside in the 
existing portfolio. We remain focused on further optimising the Group’s 
operational performance whilst our balance sheet strength and flexibility 
provide us with the opportunity to actively consider further selective 
development and acquisition opportunities in our key markets. 
We believe Safestore is well placed to withstand the uncertain 
macro-economic backdrop in the UK and have seen encouraging 
like-for-like revenue trends in both the UK and Paris in the first 
two months of the current financial year. Our recently acquired businesses 
and newly opened stores are trading at least in line with their business 
plans and we look forward with confidence to the 2017/18 financial year.
Our strategy
The Group’s proven strategy remains unchanged and as stated in our 
last Annual Report. We believe that the Group has a well located asset 
base, management expertise, infrastructure, scale and balance sheet 
strength to exploit the current healthy industry dynamics. As we look 
forward, we consider that the Group has the potential to significantly 
further increase its earnings per share by:
 — optimising the trading performance of the existing portfolio;
 — maintaining a strong and flexible capital structure; and
 — taking advantage of selective portfolio management and expansion 
opportunities.
Key performance indicators 
The key performance indicators (“KPls”) of our business are occupancy 
and average rental rate, which drive the revenue of our business. These 
KPls, along with underlying EBITDA, are reported in the financial highlights 
section on page 2 and within the trading performance section of the 
strategic report on page 12.
Optimisation of existing portfolio
With the opening of six new stores in the last 16 months, and the 
acquisitions of Space Maker in July 2016 and Alligator in November 2017 , 
we have strengthened our market-leading portfolio. We have a high quality, 
fully invested estate in both the UK and Paris. Of our 146 stores (including 
Alligator), 93 are in London and the South East of England or in Paris, with 
53 in the other major UK cities. We now operate 44 stores within the M25, 
which represents a higher number of stores than any other competitor. 
With the aforementioned new store openings, our MLA has increased to 
5.71m sq ft at 31 October 2017. At the current occupancy level of 72.6% 
we have 1.6m sq ft of unoccupied space (excluding Alligator), of which 
1.3m sq ft is in our UK stores and 0.3m sq ft in Paris. With the addition 
of the Alligator portfolio from 1 November 2017, a further 0.57m sq ft of 
MLA is added, of which 0.40m sq ft was occupied at 31 October 2017 
resulting in a total MLA of 6.28m sq ft with an occupancy of 72.3%. In 
total this unlet space is the equivalent of circa 40 empty stores located 
across the estate. This available space is fully invested and the related 
operating costs are essentially fixed and already included in the Group 
cost base. Our continued focus will be on ensuring that we drive 
occupancy to utilise this capacity at carefully managed rates.
There are three elements that are critical to the optimisation of our 
existing portfolio.
 — enquiry generation through an effective and efficient 
marketing operation;
 — strong conversion of enquiries into new lets; and
 — disciplined central revenue management and cost control.
In-house digital marketing expertise
Awareness of self-storage is increasing each year but remains relatively 
low with 58% of the UK population either knowing very little or nothing 
about self-storage (source: 2017 SSA Annual Report). In the UK around 
75% of our new customers are using self-storage for the first time. It is 
largely a brand-blind purchase with only 12% of respondents in the 
2017 Self Storage Association Annual Survey stating that a brand would 
influence their purchase decision. Typically customers requiring storage 
start their journey by conducting online research using generic keywords 
in their locality (e.g. “storage in Borehamwood”, “self-storage near me”).
We believe there is a clear benefit of scale in the generation of customer 
enquiries. The Group has continued to invest in its consumer website 
as well as in-house expertise which has resulted in the development 
of a leading digital marketing platform that has generated over 40% 
enquiry growth over the last four years. 
In December 2016, the Group launched a new trading website for the 
Paris business, building on the success of the new UK site, which is 
performing well.
Online enquiries now represent over 82% of our enquiries in the UK 
(FY2016: 81%) and 72% in France (FY2016: 63%). 57% of our online 
enquiries in the UK originate from mobile devices, compared to 54% 
last year, highlighting the need for continual investment in our 
responsive web platform.
Our in-house expertise and skills and significant annual budget enable 
us to achieve the above results. We will continue to invest in activities 
that promote a strong search engine presence to grow enquiry volume 
whilst managing efficiency in terms of the overall cost per enquiry.
Feefo, the independent review system, which allows our customers to 
leave their feedback on the quality of our customer service, has been 
integrated into our website since 2013. Over this period, our customer 
satisfaction score has averaged above 96% and we have achieved a 
Feefo Gold Service Merchant rating every year since its introduction.

Motivated and effective store teams benefiting from improved 
training and coaching 
Having an enthusiastic, well trained and customer-centric sales team 
remains a key differentiator and a strength of our business. Understanding 
the needs of our customer and using this knowledge to develop in-store 
trusted advisers is a fundamental part of driving revenue growth and 
market share.
The experience gained from the integration of the Space Maker 
brand, as well as enhancements to our regional leadership structure, 
supported the recent acquisition of Alligator Self Storage, allowing us 
to quickly integrate the stores into our geographical regional structure. 
Our dedicated online learning platform allows our new colleagues to 
take part in our industry-leading training and development programmes.
November 2016 saw the launch of our internal Store Manager Development 
Programme, designed to provide the business with its future store managers. 
The first group of trainees graduated in November 2017 and the second 
intake of sales consultants have now commenced the 2018 programme.
As with our new Alligator colleagues, new recruits to the business 
benefit from enhanced induction and training tools which have been 
developed in house and enable us to quickly identify high potential 
individuals. Our Store Manager Development Programme demonstrates 
the effectiveness of our learning tools. In a spirit of constant improvement 
our content and delivery process is dynamically enhanced through our 
360-degree feedback process utilising the learnings from not only the 
candidates, but also our training store managers. This allows our 
people to be trained with the knowledge and skills to sell effectively 
in today’s market place. 
All new recruits receive individual performance targets within four weeks 
of joining the business and are placed on the “pay-for-skills” programme, 
which allows accelerated basic pay increases dependent on success in 
demonstrating specific and defined skills. The key target of our programme, 
to ensure that close to 100% of our store managers are promoted 
internally, still remains and we are pleased with our progress to date.
The training and development of our store and customer-facing colleagues 
is an essential part of our daily routines. In 2017 we delivered a further 
22,500 hours of training through face-to-face sessions and via our 
internally developed online learning tool. This Learning Management 
System also provides the opportunity for team members to receive 
rigorously enforced health and safety, fire and compliance training, 
ensuring that our staff are up to date in relation to their technical 
knowledge and continue to operate a safe environment for both our 
colleagues and customers. These modules are continually updated to 
target the areas of most opportunity and maintain colleague engagement.
To further support our cyber-security efforts we have introduced further 
enhanced online training modules. All colleagues are required to 
complete this training.
Our performance dashboard allows our store and field teams to focus on 
the key operating metrics of the business, providing an appropriate level 
of management information to enable swift decision making. Reporting 
performance down to individual level enhances our competitive approach 
to team and individual performance. We continue to reward our people 
for their performances with bonuses of up to 50% of basic salary based 
on their achievements against individual new lets, occupancy, ancillary 
sales and pricing targets. In addition, a Values and Behaviours framework 
is overlaid on individuals’ financial performance in order to assess team 
members’ performance and development needs on a quarterly basis.
Customers continue to be at the heart of everything we do, whether it 
be in store, online or in their communities. Our Feefo customer service 
score of 96% reflects our ongoing commitment to their satisfaction.
Central revenue management and cost control
We continue to pursue a balanced approach to revenue management. 
We aim to optimise revenue by improving the utilisation of the available 
space in our portfolio at carefully managed rates. Our central pricing 
team is responsible for the management of our dynamic pricing policy, 
the implementation of promotional offers and the identification of additional 
ancillary revenue opportunities. Whilst price lists are managed centrally 
and are adjusted on a real-time basis when needed, the store sales 
teams have the ability to offer a Lowest Price Guarantee in the event 
that a local competitor is offering a lower price. 
During the last year, we have continued to enhance our business 
intelligence software, which we first implemented in 2015. This has 
improved the team’s ability to identify pricing opportunities, monitor 
competitive pricing in local markets and to establish optimal unit mix 
in individual stores. 
Our strategy to optimise revenue is implemented by continually 
reviewing the appropriate mix of occupancy and rate growth targets, 
store by store.
Rate growth is predominantly influenced by:
 — the store location and catchment area;
 — the volume of enquiries generated online;
 — the store team skills at converting these enquiries into new lets at the 
expected price; and
 — the pricing policy and the confidence provided by analytical 
capabilities that smaller players may lack.
We believe that Safestore has a very strong proposition in each 
of these areas.
Costs are managed centrally with a lean structure maintained at the 
Head Office. 
We are continually challenging our cost base and in 2017 we completed 
a full retendering process of maintenance suppliers to further improve 
the efficiency, quality and cost of both our planned and reactive 
maintenance. Our rollout of LED lighting has moved at pace in 2017 
and we plan to complete the entire estate by March 2018, reducing 
our CO
2
 emissions by the equivalent of removing 800 cars from the 
road per annum.
Strong and flexible capital structure
Since 2014 we have refinanced the business on three occasions 
and believe we now have a capital structure that is appropriate for our 
business and which provides us with the flexibility to take advantage 
of carefully evaluated development and acquisition opportunities. 
On 31 May 2017 we completed the refinancing of the Group’s US 
private placement notes (“USPP”) and an amendment and extension 
of its existing bank facilities to extend the average maturity and lower 
the cost of the Group’s debt financing.

The key terms of the new and amended arrangements are as follows:

 2019 USPP and $47.3 million 
6.74%

 2024 USPP were repaid in full;
 — New Euro and Sterling-denominated USPP notes were issued with 
the following tenor and fixed coupons:
 — €50.9 million 7 year notes at a coupon of 1.59%;
 — €74.1 million 10 year notes at a coupon of 2.00%; and
 — £50.5 million 12 year notes at a coupon of 2.92%.
Amendment and extension of bank facilities
 — The previous UK and Euro revolving credit facilities were extended 
by two years from June 2020 to June 2022, with an option (on an 
uncommitted basis) to extend for a further year; the previous 
£126 million term loan was cancelled.
 — As at 31 May 2017, the amended facilities comprised:
 — a £190 million revolving credit facility; and
 — a €70 million revolving facility.
 — The margin on the amended facilities was reduced by 25bps from 
150bps to 125bps.
 — Similarly, the non-utilisation fee on the undrawn facilities reduced 
from 0.6% to 0.5%.
 — The Group also had the option (on an uncommitted basis) to 
increase the quantum of the Sterling revolving credit facility by 
£60 million. This option was exercised in October 2017 to increase 
the UK revolving facility to £250 million, in anticipation of the acquisition 
of the Alligator business, which completed following the year end 
on 1 November 2017.
As part of the refinancing, the Group made a “make-whole” payment to 
existing USPP noteholders of £12.4 million and broke the Sterling/Dollar 
cross currency swap relating to the existing USPP notes, leading to the 
Group receiving £13.9 million, being the mark-to-market value of the 
swap which was in the Group’s favour and which was carried at that 
value at the date of breakage. Exceptional finance charges reported 
by the Group in respect of the refinancing for the year are £16.3 million, 
comprising the £12.4 million “make-whole” payment, with the balance 
relating to fees and the write off of previous unamortised issue costs. 
The refinancing was broadly cash flow neutral.
The USPP was issued to insurance company affiliates of AIG, Inc. 
and the bank facilities are provided by a syndicate of RBS, HSBC, 
Lloyds, Santander and BRED. 
Subsequent to amendment and extension of the bank facilities, the Group 
also restructured its interest rate hedge arrangements. Existing swaps, 
which mirrored the previous term of the bank facilities to June 2020, 
at weighted average fixed rates of 1.34% (over £100 million) and 0.309% 
(over €30 million), were broken, resulting in a cash outflow of £2.6 million. 
New interest rate hedge agreements were put in place to June 2022, 
swapping LIBOR on £100 million at an effective rate of 0.8145% and 
EURIBOR on €30 million at an effective rate of 0.1635%.
At 31 October 2017, based on the current level of borrowings and interest 
swap rates, the Group’s weighted average cost of debt is 2. 14%, a reduction 
of 144bps since the prior year end (FY2016: 3.58%). The weighted average 
maturity of the Group’s debt has increased from 3.9 years at 31 October 2016 
to 6.7 years at the current year end. The Group’s LTV ratio under the new 
financing arrangements was 36% as at 31 October 2017; however, this 
has been distorted due to the drawdown of £56 million of loans just prior 
to the year end in anticipation of the Alligator acquisition, which completed 
immediately after the year end on 1 November 2017 . On a pro forma basis, 
excluding this £56 million drawdown, LTV at 31 October 2017 would 
have been 31%, or by including the value of the Alligator stores at 
31 October 2017, LTV would have been 34%.
This LTV and interest cover ratio of 6.7x for the year ended 31 October 2017 
provide us with significant headroom compared to our banking covenants. 
We have £108 million of available bank facilities at 31 October 2017 .
Taking into account the improvements we have made in the performance of 
the business and the reduction in underlying finance charges of £9.0 million 
per annum over the last four years, the Group is now capable of generating 
free cash after dividends sufficient to fund the building of 2–3 new stores 
per annum depending on location and availability of land.
The Group evaluates development and acquisition opportunities in 
a careful and disciplined manner against rigorous investment criteria. 
Our investment policy requires certain Board-approved hurdle rates to 
be considered achievable prior to progressing an investment opportunity. 
In addition, the Group aims to maintain LTV of between 30% and 40% 
for the foreseeable future.
Portfolio management
As ever, our approach to store development and acquisition in the 
UK and Paris will continue to be pragmatic, flexible and focused 
on the return on capital.
Our property teams in both the UK and Paris are continually seeking 
investment opportunities in new sites to add to the store pipeline. 
However, investments will only be made if they comply with our 
disciplined and strict investment criteria.
In the last 16 months, the Group opened six new stores in Chiswick 
and Wandsworth in London, Birmingham, Altrincham, and Emerainville 
and Combs-la-Ville in Paris as well as completing the extension and 
refurbishment of our Acton and Longpont (Paris) stores. All of these 
stores are performing in line with or ahead of their business plans.
In December 2016, we acquired the freehold of a site in Mitcham, 
in South West London. We now have planning permission and have 
started construction on a new circa 54,000 sq ft store on this site. 
The store is scheduled to open in the first half of the current 
financial year.

Chief Executive’s statement continued
Portfolio management continued
In July 2017, we obtained planning permission and exchanged contracts 
for a new 37,000 sq ft leasehold store located between Paddington and 
Marble Arch in central London. The lease will be for a period of 20 years, 
with an option to extend for a further ten years. We anticipate that the 
store will open in the second calendar quarter of 2018.
In addition, in October 2017, we completed the acquisition of a 
1.34 acre industrial site at Merry Hill, around ten miles west of the 
centre of Birmingham, in a very prominent location close to Merry Hill 
regional shopping centre. Subject to receiving planning consent we 
expect to open a purpose-built freehold 55,000 sq ft store in the 
first quarter of 2019.
In Paris, where regulatory barriers are likely to continue to restrict new 
development inside the city, we will continue our policy of segmenting 
our demand and encouraging the customers who wish to reduce their 
storage costs to utilise the second belt stores. We will also manage 
occupancy and rates upwards in the more central stores and ensure 
that pricing recognises the value customers place on the convenience 
of physical proximity. The strong selling organisation and store network 
established by Une Pièce en Plus in Paris uniquely enables it to implement 
this commercial policy to complement the strong second belt markets 
in which we operate.
In April 2017, we completed the acquisition of a freehold site in 
south-eastern Paris adjacent to the M104 motorway at Combs-la-Ville. 
The cost to buy and convert the site was €6.3 million and the store 
opened for business in June 2017. The building was constructed in 
2001 and is in good condition, requiring a relatively simple reconfiguration 
for self-storage usage. The store has 73,500 sq ft of MLA and circa 
10,000 sq ft of serviced offices. 
We believe there will be further opportunities to develop new stores 
in the outer suburbs of Paris and are actively reviewing the market 
for new opportunities.
In November 2017, we exchanged contracts on a site at Poissy, in the 
west of Paris, an area where we currently have no stores. We expect 
to complete the acquisition of the site in the first calendar quarter of 
2018 and to open a freehold 80,000 sq ft store in summer 2018.  
In June 2017, we accepted an offer of £4.8 million on our leasehold 
Deptford store. The store contributed £0.4 million of EBITDA after rent 
in the year ended October 2016. The transaction was completed on 
31 August 2017.
In September 2017, we continued our programme of extending the 
leases on our leasehold store portfolio. The lease on our Oldbury store, 
which had six years remaining, has been extended to 2042 resulting in 
a certain term of 25 years. A year’s rent-free period was agreed as part 
of the extension. We have now extended the leases on 18 stores or 51% 
of our leased store portfolio in the UK over the last five years and our 
average lease length remaining now stands at 13.3 years as compared 
to 13.7 years at FY2016.
Acquisitions
Over the last 18 months Safestore has completed two acquisitions, 
adding 24 stores to the Group’s portfolio at a total consideration 
of £98.3 million (prior to potential working capital adjustments 
in respect of the Alligator acquisition). Both acquisitions are 
immediately earnings accretive.
Space Maker
At the end of July 2016 we completed the acquisition of Space Maker 
for a total consideration of £42.3 million. 
Space Maker was the ninth largest self-storage portfolio in the UK, 
with twelve stores, located in Bournemouth (two stores), Colchester, 
Redhill, Romford, Brentford, Chelmsford, Exeter, Leeds, Plymouth, 
Portsmouth and Poole, and had a fully invested built out lettable 
area of circa 496,000 sq ft. Six of the Space Maker stores are freehold 
or long leasehold and six are leasehold stores with an average remaining 
lease length of 14.9 years at 31 October 2017.
Space Maker has been fully integrated into the Safestore portfolio from 
an operational perspective during the course of the 2017 financial year, 
and is performing in line with its business plan.
Alligator
Subsequent to the year end, on 1 November 2017 the Group completed 
the acquisition of Stork Self Storage (Holdings) Limited (“SSSHL ”) trading 
as Alligator Self Storage. The consideration was £56.0 million (subject 
to customary working capital adjustment) and was paid in cash on 
completion of the acquisition.
SSSHL was the eleventh largest self-storage portfolio in the UK, with 
twelve stores with a maximum lettable area estimated at circa 569,000 
sq ft. SSSHL ’s stores, which are geographically complementary to the 
existing estate, are located in London (Camden), the South East of the 
UK (Fareham, Farnham, Luton and Winchester), Birmingham (three 
stores), Southampton, Bolton, Bristol and Nottingham. Ten of the 
SSSHL stores are freehold or long leasehold and two are leasehold 
stores with an average remaining lease length of 15.3 years.
The acquisition reinforces Safestore’s position as the UK’s largest 
self-storage group by number of sites with a combined total of 120 stores, 
67 of which are in London and the South East. The SSSHL portfolio 
was 70% occupied (of maximum lettable area) at 31 October 2017.
Pro forma EBITDA after rent is currently circa £4.3 million per annum on 
turnover of £7.5 million. At the consideration price, the SSSHL portfolio 
has an implied first year net operating income yield of circa 7.7%.
The SSSHL business, which had provisional net assets of £56.7 million 
at 31 October 2017, was acquired on a debt and cash-free basis. 
The acquisition was funded from the Group’s existing debt facilities, 
with the Group’s £60 million accordion facility converted into a committed 
revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, the Group’s LTV ratio post 
completion of the acquisition is 34% compared to 32% at 30 April 2017 
(as adjusted on a pro forma basis for our May 2017 refinancing). Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Portfolio summary
The self-storage market has been growing in the last 15 years across 
many European countries but few regions offer the unique characteristic 
of London and Paris, both of which consist of large, wealthy and densely 
populated markets. In the London region, the population is 13 million 
inhabitants with a density of 5,200 inhabitants per square mile in the 
region, 11,000 per square mile in the city of London and up to 32,000 
in the densest boroughs. 
The population of the Paris urban area is 10.7 million inhabitants with 
a density of 9,300 inhabitants per square mile in the urban area but 
54,000 per square mile in the City of Paris and first belt, where 72% of 
our French stores are located and which has one of the highest densities 
in the western world. 85% of the Paris region population live in central 
parts of the city versus the rest of the urban area, which compares with 
60% in the London region. There are currently circa 245 storage centres 
within the M25 as compared to only circa 90 in the Paris urban area. 
In addition, barriers to entry in these two important city markets are high, 
due to land values and limited availability of sites, as well as planning 
regulation. This is particularly the case for Paris and its first belt, which 
inhibits new development possibilities.
Our combined operations in London and Paris, with 69 stores, contribute 
£79.4 million of revenue and £55.1 million of store EBITDA and offer a unique 
exposure to the two most attractive European self-storage markets.
We have a strong position in both the UK and Paris markets operating 
108 stores in the UK (excluding Alligator), 62 of which are in London 
and the South East, and 26 stores in Paris. 
In the UK, 66% of our revenue is generated by our stores in London and 
the South East. On average, our stores in London and the South East 
are smaller than in the rest of the UK but the rental rates achieved are 
materially higher, enabling these stores to typically achieve similar or 
better margins than the larger stores. In London, excluding Alligator, 
we operate 43 stores within the M25, more than any other competitor. 
In France, we have a leading position in the heart of the affluent City 
of Paris market, with eight stores branded as Une Pièce en Plus (“UPP”) 
(“A spare room”) with more than twice the number of stores of our two 
major competitors combined. 69% of the UPP stores are located in a 
cluster within a five-mile radius of the city centre, which facilitates strong 
operational and marketing synergies as well as options to differentiate 
and channel customers to the right store subject to their preference 
for convenience or price affordability. The Parisian market has attractive 
socio-demographic characteristics for self-storage and we believe that 
UPP enjoys unique strategic strength in such an attractive market.
Together, as at 31 October 2017, London, the South East and Paris 
represent 66% of our owned stores, 74% of our revenues, as well 
as 59% of our available unlet capacity.
In addition, Safestore has the benefit of a leading national presence in 
the UK regions where the stores are predominantly located in the centre 
of key metropolitan areas such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, 
Bristol, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Market
The self-storage market in the UK and France remains relatively 
immature compared to geographies such as the USA and Australia. 
The Self Storage Association (“SSA”) Annual Survey (May 2017) confirmed 
that self-storage capacity stands at 0.64 sq ft per head of population in the 
UK and 0. 15 sq ft per capita in France. Whilst the Paris market density is 
greater than France, we estimate it to be significantly lower than the UK 
at around 0.36 sq ft per inhabitant. This compared with 7 .8 sq ft per 
inhabitant in the USA and 1.8 sq ft in Australia. In the UK, in order to reach 
the US density of supply would require the addition of around 12,000 
stores as compared to the current circa 1,000 stores. In the Paris 
region, it would require around 1,800 new facilities versus circa 90 
currently opened.
While capacity increased significantly between 2007 and 2010 with 
respondents to the survey opening an average of 32 stores per annum, 
new additions have been limited to an average of 19 stores per annum 
between 2011 and 2016 (including container storage openings).
New supply in London and Paris is likely to be limited in the short 
and medium term as a result of planning restrictions and the availability 
of suitable land. 
Respondents to the survey indicated aspirations to develop an average 
of 49 stores per annum from 2017 to 2019. Typically, actual developments 
have averaged less than 50% of respondents’ aspirations, although the 
25 new openings in 2016 were closer than usual to the previous year’s 
aspirations. This recent history suggests that circa 25 to 40 new stores 
are likely to be added in the coming year.
The supply in the UK market, according to the SSA survey, remains 
relatively fragmented. Safestore is the leader by number of stores 
with 120 wholly owned sites (including Alligator), followed by Big Yellow 
with 73 wholly owned stores, Access with 57 stores, Shurgard with 
26 stores, Lok’n Store with 25 stores and Storage King with 25 stores. 
In aggregate, the top ten leading operators account for 27% of the UK 
store portfolio. The remaining circa 1,000 self-storage outlets (including 
317 container-based operations) are independently owned in small 
chains or single units. In total there are 693 storage businesses 
operating in the UK.
Our French business, UPP, is mainly present in the core wealthier 
and more densely populated inner Paris and first belt areas, whereas 
our two main competitors, Shurgard and Homebox, have a greater 
presence in the outskirts and second belt of Paris. 
Consumer awareness of self-storage remains low, providing an 
opportunity for future industry growth. The SSA survey indicated that 
58% (58% in 2016) of consumers either knew nothing about the service 
offered by self-storage operators or had not heard of self-storage at all. 
The opportunity to grow awareness, combined with limited new industry 
supply, makes for an attractive industry backdrop.
Self-storage is a brand-blind product. 70% of respondents were unable 
to name a self-storage brand in the SSA survey, 88%
1
 of respondents 
would not consider brand in their decision and 97% would not even use 
brand as a search criteria. The lack of relevance of brand in the process 
of purchasing a self-storage product emphasises the need for operators 
to have a strong online presence. This requirement for a strong online 
presence was also reiterated by the SSA survey where 71% of those 
surveyed (68% in 2016) confirmed that an internet search would be their 
chosen means of finding a self-storage unit to contact, whilst knowledge 
of a physical location of a store as reason for enquiry was circa 23% of 
respondents (circa 28% in 2016).
Note
1 Source: Self Storage Association (“SSA”) Annual Survey (May 2016).
There are numerous drivers of self-storage growth. Most private and 
business customers need storage either temporarily or permanently for 
different reasons at any point in the economic cycle, resulting in a market 
depth that is in our view the reason for its exceptional resilience. The growth 
of the market is driven both by the fluctuation of economic conditions, 
which has an impact on the mix of demand, and by growing awareness 
of the product.
Our domestic customers’ need for storage is often driven by lifestyle 
events such as births, marriages, bereavements, divorces or by the 
housing market, including house moves and developments and moves 
between rental properties. Safestore has estimated that UK owner-occupied 
housing transactions drive around 8–13% of the Group’s storage revenue. 
The SSA survey confirmed that only 28% of domestic self-storage customers 
stored for reasons related to a property move and this would include 
people renting accommodation.
Our business customer base includes a range of businesses from 
start-up online retailers through to multinational corporates utilising 
our national coverage to store in multiple locations while maintaining 
flexibility in their cost base.

across London, Paris and the UK regions (including Alligator).
Business model
Safestore’s proven business model remains unchanged from our 
previous Annual Report.
The Group operates in a market with relatively low consumer awareness. 
It is anticipated that this will increase over time as the industry matures. 
Historically, despite the financial crisis and the implementation of VAT on 
self-storage in 2012, the industry has been exceptionally resilient. In the 
context of uncertain economic conditions as the UK approaches Brexit, 
the industry remains well positioned with limited new supply coming 
into the self-storage market.
With more stores inside London’s M25 than any other operator 
and a strong position in central Paris, Safestore has leading positions 
in the two most important and demographically favourable markets 
in Europe. In addition, our regional presence in the UK is unsurpassed 
and contributes to the success of our industry-leading National Accounts 
business. In the UK, Safestore is the leading operator by number of 
wholly owned stores. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
11 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Our capital-efficient portfolio of 134 wholly owned stores in the UK 
and Paris (146 stores including Alligator acquired on 1 November 2017) 
consists of a mix of freehold and leasehold stores. In order to grow 
our business and secure the best locations for our facilities, we have 
maintained a flexible approach to leasehold and freehold developments. 
Currently, (excluding Alligator) approximately one-third of our stores in the UK 
are leaseholds with an average remaining lease length at 31 October 2017 
of 13.3 years (FY2016: 13.7 years). Although our property valuation for 
leaseholds is conservatively based on future cash flows until the next 
contractual lease renewal date, Safestore has a demonstrable track record 
of successfully regearing leases several years before renewal whilst 
at the same time achieving concessions from landlords. 
In England, we benefit from the Landlord and Tenant Act that protects 
our rights for renewal except in the case of redevelopment. The vast 
majority of our leasehold stores have building characteristics or 
locations in retail parks that make current usage either the optimal and 
best use of the property or the only one authorised by planning. We 
observe that our landlords, who are property investors, value the quality 
of Safestore as a tenant and typically prefer to extend the length of the 
leases that they have in their portfolio, enabling Safestore to maintain 
favourable terms. 
In Paris, where 42% of stores are leaseholds, our leases typically benefit 
from the well enshrined Commercial Lease statute that provides that 
tenants own the commercial property of the premises and that they 
are entitled to renew their lease at a rent that is indexed to the National 
Construction Index published by the state. Taking into account this 
context, the valuer values the French leaseholds based on an indefinite 
property tenure, similar to freeholds.
Our experience is that being flexible in its approach has enabled 
Safestore to operate from properties that would have been otherwise 
unavailable and to generate strong returns on capital invested.
Safestore excels in the generation of customer enquiries which are 
received through a variety of channels including the internet, telephone 
and “walk-ins”. In the early days of the industry, local directories and 
store visibility were key drivers of enquiries. 
The internet is now by far the dominant channel, accounting for 82% 
of our enquiries in the UK and 72% in France. Telephone enquiries 
comprise 11% of the UK total and 19% in France, and “walk-ins” 
amount to only 7% (UK) and 9% (France). This key change is a clear 
benefit to the leading national operators that possess the budget and 
the management skills necessary to generate a commanding presence 
in the major search engines. Safestore has developed a leading digital 
marketing platform that has generated 40% enquiry growth over the 
last four years. Towards the end of 2015 the Group launched a new 
dynamic and mobile-friendly UK website, which has achieved its aim of 
providing the customer with an even clearer, more efficient experience. 
In December 2016, a similar website was launched in our Paris business.
Although mostly generated online, our enquiries are predominantly 
handled directly by the stores and, in the UK, we have a Customer 
Support Centre (“CSC”) which now handles 18% of all enquiries, 
in particular when the store staff are busy handling calls or outside 
of normal store opening hours.
Our pricing platform provides the store and CSC staff with system-
generated real-time prices managed by our centrally based yield 
management team. Local staff have certain levels of discretion to 
flex the system-generated prices but this is continually monitored.
Customer service standards are high and customer satisfaction feedback 
is consistently very positive. Over the last twelve months we have achieved 
over 96% customer satisfaction, based on “excellent” or “good” ratings 
as collected by Feefo via our customer website.
The key drivers of sales success are the capacity to generate enquiries 
in a digital world, the capacity to provide storage locations that are 
conveniently located close to the customers’ requirements and the 
ability to maintain a consistently high quality, motivated retail team that 
is able to secure customer sales at an appropriate storage rate, all of 
which can be better provided by larger, more efficient organisations.
We remain focused on business as well as domestic customers. Our 
national network means that we are uniquely placed to further grow the 
business customer market and, in particular, National Accounts. Business 
customers in the UK now constitute 49% of our total space let and have 
an average length of stay of 30 months. Within our business customer 
category, our National Accounts business continues to grow with storage 
revenue increasing by 102% compared with 2013. The space let to 
National Accounts customers has increased by 57% compared with 
2013 and, at 385,000 sq ft, constitutes 12% of our total occupied space 
in the UK business. Approximately two-thirds of the space occupied by 
National Accounts customers is outside London, demonstrating the 
importance and quality of our well invested national estate.
The business (excluding Alligator) now has in excess of 55,000 business 
and domestic customers with an average length of stay of 31 months 
and 22 months respectively.
The cost base of our business is relatively fixed. Each store typically 
employs three staff. Our Group Head Office comprises business 
support functions such as Yield Management, Property, Marketing, 
HR, IT and Finance.
Since the completion of the rebalancing of our capital structure in early 
2014 and the subsequent amendments and extensions of our banking 
facilities in summer 2015 and May 2017, as well as the May 2017 
refinancing of our US private placement notes, Safestore has secure 
financing, a strong balance sheet and significant covenant headroom. 
This provides the Group with financial flexibility and the ability to 
grow organically and via carefully selected new development or 
acquisition opportunities.
At 31 October 2017, prior to completion of the Alligator acquisition, 
we had 1.3m sq ft of unoccupied space in the UK and 0.3m sq ft in 
France, equivalent to over 40 full new stores. Our main focus is on filling 
the spare capacity in our stores at optimally yield-managed rates. The 
operational leverage of our business model will ensure that the bulk 
of the incremental revenue converts to profit given the relatively fixed 
nature of our cost base. Strategic report

The UK has delivered another strong year growing revenue by 11.6%. 
The annualisation of the acquisition of Space Maker (29 July 2016) has 
contributed to this growth as have the four recently opened stores so, 
on a like-for-like basis, revenue grew by 3.1% in the year. The first full year 
of our ownership of Space Maker has gone to plan with the business fully 
integrated into the Group from an operational perspective. The four recently 
opened stores (Wandsworth, Chiswick, Birmingham and Altrincham) 
are all performing at least in line with their business plans.
Total occupancy grew by 95,000 sq ft in the year (FY2016: 397,000 sq ft). 
The reduction reflected the acquisition of Space Maker, which constituted 
341,000 sq ft of the growth in the previous year. The recently opened 
four stores diluted total closing occupancy which ended the year at 
71.6% (FY2016: 69.7%) but like-for-like closing occupancy grew by 
0.6ppts to 72.5% (FY2016: 71.9%). Like-for-like average occupancy 
for the year grew by 1.5%.
We take a balanced approach to revenue management and our 
occupancy growth was accompanied by a 0.9% increase in the 
like-for-like average storage rate for the year. Sequentially, our Q4 
like-for-like average rate was 2.8% higher than the rate achieved 
in Q3 2017.
We remain focused on our cost base. During the year, our cost base, on 
a like-for-like basis, increased by just 0.5% or £0.2 million. Our total cost 
base grew by £3.8 million, reflecting the annualisation of the acquisition of 
Space Maker and the cost bases relating to the recently opened stores.
As a result, underlying EBITDA for the UK business was £52.8 million 
(FY2016: £46.5 million), an increase of £6.3 million or 13.5%.

Our Paris business had another strong year growing like-for-like revenue by 
4.0%. Combined with the impact of the two new stores opened since 
summer 2016, total revenue grew by 5. 1%. The impact of the 9% weakening 
of the average Sterling to Euro exchange rate across the period resulted in 
the Sterling equivalent revenue growing by 15.7% for the full year. 
Pricing was robust and our like-for-like average rate was up 2.3% for 
the full year. Like-for-like closing occupancy ended the year at 84.7% 
(FY2016: 80.7%). Our like-for-like average occupancy for the year 
was up 1.2% on 2016.
We opened a new store at Emerainville in the east of Paris at the end of 
the 2016 financial year, which added 60,000 sq ft of MLA to our portfolio. 
In June 2017, we opened a freehold site in south-eastern Paris adjacent 
to the M104 motorway at Combs-la-Ville, which added 73,500 sq ft of 
MLA and circa 10,000 sq ft of serviced offices. Given that these stores 
have only recently started to trade, they have a dilutive effect on total 
closing occupancy. In addition the extension of our Longpont store, 
which adds 22,600 sq ft of new space, completed in March 2017.
The cost base in Paris remained well controlled during the year with 
like-for-like costs growing by 3.1% or €0.4 million. The total cost base grew 
by 8.5% or €1.1 million, reflecting the new store openings which typically 
make a loss in the first full year of operations. As a result, like-for-like 
underlying EBITDA in Paris grew by €1.0 million and underlying EBITDA 
grew by €0.7 million to €23.1 million (FY2016: €22.4 million).

Notes
1  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. 
Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to bank loans and cash.
2 Occupancy excludes offices but includes bulk tenancy. As at 31 October 2017, closing occupancy includes 27,000 sq ft of bulk tenancy (31 October 2016: 37,000 sq ft).
3 MLA is maximum lettable area. At 31 October 2017, Group MLA was 5.71m sq ft (FY2016: 5.59m sq ft).
4 Average storage rate is calculated as the revenue generated from self-storage revenues divided by the average square footage occupied during the period in question.
5  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and Emerainville, as 
well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has been adjusted. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Principal risks
Risks and risk management
The Board recognises that effective risk management requires 
awareness and engagement at all levels of our organisation.
Risk management process
The Group faces a number of risks which, if they arise, could affect 
its ability to achieve its strategic objectives. The Board is responsible 
for determining the nature of these risks and ensuring appropriate 
mitigating actions are in place for managing them.
Effective risk management requires awareness and engagement at 
all levels of our organisation. It is for this reason that risk management 
is incorporated into the day-to-day management of our business, 
as well as being reflected in the Group’s core processes and controls. 
The Board has defined the Group’s risk appetite and oversees the risk 
management strategy and the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control framework. Risks are considered at every business level and 
are assessed, discussed and taken into account when deciding upon 
future strategy, approving transactions and monitoring performance. 
Strategic risks are identified, assessed and managed by the Board and 
the Audit Committee, with support from the Risk Committee. Strategic 
risks are reviewed at Board level to ensure they are valid and that they 
represent the key risks associated with the current strategic direction 
of the Group. Operational risks are identified, assessed and managed 
by the Risk Committee and Executive Team members, and reported 
to the Board and the Audit Committee. These risks cover all areas of 
the business, such as finance, operations, investment, development 
and corporate risks.
The risk management process commences with rigorous risk 
identification sessions incorporating contributions from functional 
managers and Executive Team members. The output is reviewed and 
discussed by the Risk Committee, supported by members of senior 
management from across the business. The Risk Committee identifies 
and prioritises the top business risks, which are then challenged by 
the Board. The process focuses on the identification of key strategic, 
financial and operational risks. The potential impact and likelihood of 
the risks occurring are determined, key risk mitigations are identified 
and the current level of risk is assessed against the Board’s risk 
appetite. These top business risks form the basis for the principal 
risks and uncertainties detailed in the section below.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties described are considered to have 
the most significant effect on Safestore’s strategic objectives. This list 
is not intended to be exhaustive. Some risks, however, remain outside 
of the Group’s full control, for example macro-economic issues, 
changes in government regulation and acts of terrorism.

Risks and risk management continued
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
The key strategic and operational risks are monitored by the Board and are defined as those which could prevent us from achieving our business 
goals. Our current strategic and operational risks and key mitigating actions are as follows:
Risk Current mitigation activities Developments since 2016
Strategy
The Group develops business plans 
based on a wide range of variables. 
Incorrect assumptions about the 
self-storage market, or changes in the 
needs of customers, or the activities 
of customers may adversely affect 
the returns achieved by the Group, 
potentially resulting in loss of 
shareholder value.
 — The strategy development process draws on 
internal and external analysis of the self-storage 
market, emerging customer trends and a range 
of other factors.
 — Continuing focus on yield management with 
regular review of demand levels and pricing 
at each individual store.
 — The portfolio is geographically diversified with 
performance monitoring covering the personal 
and business customers by segments.
The Group’s strategy is regularly reviewed through the annual planning 
and budgeting process, and regular reforecasts are prepared during 
the year.
This year has seen the twelve Space Maker stores and five development 
stores acquired or opened during 2016 successfully integrated into the 
Group’s store portfolio. Further developments during FY2017, including 
the acquisition of the twelve Alligator stores and four new sites, strengthen 
the Group’s portfolio and develop its geographical diversification.
However, no business strategy is without risk, and the level of this risk 
is considered to have remained broadly similar to last year.
Finance risk
Lack of funding resulting in inability 
to meet business plans or satisfy 
liabilities or breach of covenants.
 — Funding requirements for business plans and 
the timing for commitments are reviewed regularly 
as part of the monthly management accounts.
 — The Group manages liquidity in accordance 
with Board-approved policies designed to 
ensure that the Group has adequate funds 
for its ongoing needs.
 — The Board regularly monitors financial covenant ratios 
and headroom.
 — The Group’s banking facilities run to 30 June 2022, 
with an option to extend for a further year. The new 
US private placement notes mature in seven, 
ten and twelve years.
In May 2017, the Group refinanced its borrowing arrangements, which 
resulted in an increase of the weighted average maturity of the Group’s 
debt by more than three years and, along with the subsequent restructuring 
of our interest hedging arrangements, has reduced the overall cost of 
debt to 2.14% (FY2016: 3.58%).
Subsequently, in October 2017, the Group increased its committed 
borrowing facilities by the exercise of a £60 million accordion facility 
in anticipation of the acquisition of the Alligator portfolio, which 
completed after the year end on 1 November 2017.
Although the Group’s loan-to-value ratio (“LTV”) has increased due 
to the Alligator acquisition, this risk is considered to have decreased 
as a result of the refinancing.
Treasury risk
Adverse currency or interest 
rate movements could see the 
cost of debt rise, or impact the 
Sterling value of income flows 
or investments.
 — Guidelines are set for our exposure to fixed and floating 
interest rates and use of interest rate and currency 
swaps to manage this risk.
 — Foreign currency denominated assets are financed by 
borrowings in the same currency where appropriate.
We repaid our US Dollar-denominated borrowings during the year, 
and replaced them with additional Euro-denominated borrowings 
to provide a natural hedge against the Euro-denominated net 
assets of our French business.
Following the refinancing of our borrowing arrangements, we cancelled 
all our existing interest rate swaps and replaced them with new interest 
rate swaps at more competitive interest rates.
Despite the increase in the UK base rate shortly after the year end, it 
remains low; however, current forecasts suggest it may increase further 
over coming months. Therefore, despite the mitigation provided by our 
interest rate swaps and fixed interest borrowings, the risk of adverse 
interest rate fluctuations has increased during the year.
Property investment and development
Acquisition and development 
of properties that fail to meet 
performance expectations or 
overexposure to developments 
within a short timeframe may 
have an adverse impact on the 
portfolio valuation, resulting in 
loss of shareholder value.
 — Thorough due diligence is conducted and detailed 
analysis is undertaken prior to Board approval 
for property investment and development.
 — The Group’s overall exposure to developments 
is monitored and controlled, with projects 
phased to avoid overcommitment.
 — The performance of individual properties 
is benchmarked against target returns.
A robust due diligence process was undertaken prior to the Alligator 
acquisition. Other projects were considered during the year, but were 
not pursued when they failed to meet our rigorous investment criteria.
The capital requirements of development projects undertaken during 
the year have been carefully forecast and monitored.
We continue to pursue investment and development opportunities, 
and consider our recent track record to have been successful. Therefore, 
the Board considers that there has been no significant change to this risk 
since last year.
Principal risks continued Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
15 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Risk Current mitigation activities Developments since 2016
Valuation risk
Value of our properties declining as 
a result of external market or internal 
management factors.
In the absence of relevant transactional 
evidence, valuations can be inherently 
subjective leading to a degree 
of uncertainty. 
 — Independent valuations are conducted regularly 
by experienced, independent, professionally 
qualified valuers.
 — A diversified portfolio which is let to a large number 
of customers helps to mitigate any negative impact 
arising from changing conditions in the financial 
and property markets.
 — Headroom of LTV banking covenants is maintained 
and reviewed.
 — Current gearing levels provide sizeable headroom 
on our portfolio valuation and mitigate the likelihood 
of covenants being endangered.
The valuation of the Group’s portfolio has continued to grow during 
the year, reflecting both valuation gains arising from the increasing 
profitability of our portfolio and additions to our portfolio through 
corporate acquisitions and the opening of new development 
stores over the last two financial years.
In addition, there has been an increase in relevant transactional 
evidence recently.
As a result of the continuing strengthening of the Group’s balance sheet, 
the level of this risk is viewed as having decreased slightly since last year.
Occupancy risk
A potential loss of income and 
increased vacancy due to falling 
demand, oversupply or customer 
default, which could also adversely 
impact the portfolio valuation.
 — Personal and business customers cover a wide range 
of segments, sectors and geographic territories with 
limited exposure to any single customer.
 — Dedicated support for enquiry capture.
 — Weekly monitoring of occupancy levels and close 
management of stores.
 — Management of pricing to stimulate demand, 
when appropriate.
 — Monitoring of reasons for customers vacating and exit 
interviews conducted.
 — Independent feedback facility for customer experience.
 — The like-for-like occupancy rate across the portfolio 
has continued to grow due to flexibility offered on 
deals by in-house marketing and the customer 
support centre.
We have continued to grow like-for-like occupancy during the year, 
and the newly opened stores are performing well.
The new stores which have been acquired or opened over the last two 
financial years have diversified the potential impact of underperformance 
of an individual store.
As a result, the level of this risk has reduced since last year.
Real estate investment trust (“REIT”) risk
Failure to comply with the REIT 
legislation could expose the Group 
to potential tax penalties or loss 
of its REIT status.
 — Internal monitoring procedures are in place to ensure 
that the appropriate rules and legislation are complied 
with and this is formally reported to the Board.
The Group has remained compliant with all REIT legislation throughout 
the year.
There has been no significant change to this risk since last year.
Catastrophic event
Major events mean that the Group 
is unable to carry out its business 
for a sustained period; health and 
safety issues put customers, staff or 
property at risk; or the Group suffers 
a cyber-attack, hacking or malicious 
infiltration of websites. These may 
result in reputational damage, injury 
or property damage, or customer 
compensation, causing a loss 
of market share and income.
 — Business continuity plans are in place and tested.
 — Back-up systems at offsite locations and remote 
working capabilities.
 — Reviews and assessments are undertaken periodically 
for enhancements to supplement the existing compliant 
aspects of buildings and processes.
 — Monitoring and review by the Health and 
Safety Committee.
 — Robust operational procedures, including health 
and safety policies, and a specific focus on fire 
prevention and safety procedures.
 — Fire risk assessments in stores.
 — Specialist cyber-security advice and consultancy; 
dedicated in-house monitoring and security review; 
and external penetration testing.
 — Limited retention of customer data.
Continuing focus from the Risk Committee, with particular attention 
to specific issues. For example, a review of our store fire strategy was 
undertaken following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in London during 
the year.
The threat from cyber-attacks continues to grow, so this risk has 
increased since last year, and the risk management and mitigation 
actions have been developed accordingly. Strategic report

Risk Current mitigation activities Developments since 2016
Consequences of the UK’s decision to leave the EU (“Brexit”)
The UK is expected to leave the 
EU by March 2019. The terms of 
the UK’s departure remain unclear, 
which has generated uncertainty in 
the economy and also with regard 
to legislation changes both before 
and after Brexit.
Potential changes to UK legislation 
or regulations may include changes 
to the right of EU citizens to work in 
the UK, changes to direct or indirect 
tax legislation or other legislation 
changes such as health and safety.
 — Economic uncertainty is not a new risk for the Group, 
but increases the likelihood of previously recognised 
risks, and is addressed under the finance risk, 
treasury risk and valuation risk categories above.
 — Self-storage is a localised industry, with a broad and 
diversified customer base, so demand is unlikely to 
be significantly impacted by Brexit related changes.
The UK has now triggered Article 50, which sets the expected date 
of the UK’s departure from the EU for March 2019. We are developing 
contingency plans; however, until the terms of Brexit become clearer, 
limited progress can be made.
A review has identified that the UK workforce includes a low proportion 
of employees whose right to work in the UK may be impacted by 
potential Brexit related legislation changes.
The level of this risk has not changed since last year.
Viability statement
The Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a three-year period to October 2020, and have confirmed that they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due over this period. This assessment has been 
performed taking account of the Group’s current position and prospects, the Group’s strategy, the Board’s risk appetite and the potential impact 
of the principal risks, which are described on pages 13 to 16 of the strategic report.
The review period is consistent with the timeframes incorporated into the Group’s strategic planning cycle, and the review considers the Group’s cash 
flows, dividend cover, REIT compliance, financial covenants and other key financial performance metrics over the period. Following the refinancing 
undertaken by the Group during the year, no borrowings will fall due to be repaid during the three-year outlook period; however, the Directors consider 
that additional funding for the business in the form of equity or borrowings will be available in all likely market conditions, if required. In reaching their 
conclusion, the Directors have considered the impact of sensitivities and scenario testing to reflect more severe scenarios than the Group has 
previously experienced, even during the last financial downturn. This involved flexing a number of the main assumptions underlying the Group’s 
strategic plan and evaluating the potential impact of the principal risks facing the Group, along with mitigating actions, on the business model, 
future performance, solvency and liquidity over the review period.

as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. Management 
considers this presentation of earnings to be representative of the

statement impact of items not fully controllable by management, 
such as the revaluation of derivatives and investment properties, 
and the impact of exceptional credits, costs and finance charges.
Underlying EBITDA increased by 13.6% to £72.9 million 
(FY2016: £64.2 million), reflecting a 12.6% increase in revenue, 
and an 11.3% increase to the underlying cost base. This performance 
reflects a full year contribution from the acquisition of Space Maker 
in July 2016 as well as the impact of the six new stores opened 
since August 2016, offset by the closure of Deptford and our 
old Birmingham Central store.

Underlying income statement continued
Leasehold rent increased by 17.0% from £8.8 million to £10.3 million, principally due to an additional six leases in respect of the Space Maker 
business, plus an adverse currency impact of £0.4 million.
Underlying finance charges reduced by 6.9% from £10.1 million to £9.4 million. This principally reflects the benefit of the refinancing of our borrowing 
arrangements undertaken in May 2017, as well as the restructuring of our hedging arrangements undertaken in August 2017.
As a result, we achieved a 17.4% increase in underlying profit before tax to £52.7 million (FY2016: £44.9 million).
Given the Group’s REIT status in the UK, tax is normally only payable in France. The underlying tax charge for the year was £4.0 million (FY2016: £3.7 million), 
calculated at the French statutory income tax rate of 33.33% of the taxable profits earned by our Paris business.
Management had previously considered that the most representative earnings per share (“EPS”) measure is cash tax adjusted EPS, which has increased 
by 17.7% to 23.3 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence). Going forward this will be replaced by a new measure of EPS, Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS, which is 
explained further under earnings per share below. On a pro forma basis, Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS for the year was 23.2 pence (FY2016: 19.8 pence).

The gain on investment properties was £39.2 million, as compared to £41.7 million in 2016. The Group has recognised an exceptional cost of £1.4 million 
in the year (FY2016: £4.3 million net exceptional credit) in respect of corporate transaction costs arising on the acquisition of the Alligator business, 
which was agreed during the financial year, but did not complete until after the year end on 1 November 2017.

Underlying EBITDA in the UK increased by £6.3 million, or 13.5%, to £52.8 million (FY2016: £46.5 million), underpinned by an 1 1.6% or £10. 1 million increase 
in revenue, which was driven primarily by a full year contribution from the acquisition of Space Maker in July 2016 as well as the impact of the new stores 
opened in Wandsworth, Chiswick, Birmingham and Altrincham, offset by the closure of Deptford and our old Birmingham Central store. Underlying UK 
EBITDA after leasehold rent increased by 12.0% to £46.6 million (FY2016: £41.6 million).
In Paris, underlying EBITDA increased by €0.7 million, or 3.1%, to €23.1 million (FY2016: €22.4 million), reflecting a €1.8 million increase in revenue, 
arising from a 1.1% increase in the average storage rate and an 8.5% increase in closing occupancy. Underlying EBITDA after leasehold rent in 
Paris increased by 5.7% to €18.5 million (FY2016: €17.5 million).
Recently opened or immature stores have a dilutive effect on the Group’s reported performance. On a like-for-like basis, adjusting for the dilutive impact 
of immature stores, store EBITDA margin in the UK was 64.4% (FY2016: 62.9%) and in France it was 73.6% (FY2016: 72.6%).
The combined results of the UK and Paris delivered a 10.5% increase in underlying EBITDA after leasehold rent at constant exchange rates at Group level. 
Adjusting for a favourable exchange impact of £1.4 million in the current year, the Group’s reported underlying EBITDA after leasehold rent has increased 
by 13.0% or £7 .2 million to £62.6 million (FY2016: £55.4 million).
Revenue
Revenue for the Group is primarily derived from the rental of self-storage space and the sale of ancillary products such as insurance and merchandise 
(e.g. packing materials and padlocks) in both the UK and Paris.
The split of the Group’s revenues by geographical segment is set out below for 2017 and 2016.

The Group’s revenue increased by 12.6% or £14.5 million in the year. The Group’s occupied space was 170,000 sq ft higher at 31 October 2017 (4. 14 million sq ft) 
than at 31 October 2016 (3.97 million sq ft), and the average rental rate per square foot for the Group was 1.9% higher in 2017 at £26.67 than in 2016 (£26. 17).
Adjusting the Group’s revenue to a like-for-like basis (to reflect the Space Maker acquisition, the opening of four new stores in the UK and two in Paris, and the 
closures of Deptford and our old Birmingham Central store), revenue has increased by 5.9%. Adjusting further for the strengthening of the Euro during the year, 
Group like-for-like revenue at constant exchange rates has increased by 3.3%.
In the UK, revenue grew by £10.1 million or 11.6%, and on a like-for-like basis it was up by 3.1%. Occupancy was 95,000 sq ft higher at 31 October 2017 than 
at 31 October 2016, at 3.25 million sq ft (3. 15 million sq ft). The average rental rate for the year fell 0.7%, from £24.60 in 2016 to £24.42 in 2017 , due to the dilutive 
impact of the immature new stores. On a like-for-like basis, the average rental rate in the UK increased by 0.9% to £24.88 (FY2016: £24.65).
In Paris, revenue increased by 5.1% to €37.2 million (FY2016: €35.4 million). However, the strengthening of the Euro during the financial year had 
a favourable currency impact of approximately £3.0 million on translation, which results in a 15.7% increase when reported in Sterling. Closing 
occupancy grew to 0.89 million sq ft (FY2016: 0.82 million sq ft), and the average rental rate grew by 1.1% to €40.28 for the year (FY2016: €39.85), 
however, adjusting for the dilutive impact of immature stores, on a like-for-like basis the average rental rate grew 2.3% to €40.75 (FY2016: €39.85). Strategic report

Underlying cost of sales for 2017 (CER) (43.8)
– Foreign exchange (0.8)
Underlying cost of sales for 2017 (reported) (44.6)
In order to arrive at underlying cost of sales, adjustments are made to remove the impact of depreciation, which does not form part of underlying 
EBITDA, and contingent rent, which forms part of our leasehold rent costs in the presentation of our underlying income statement.
Cost of sales increased by £4.6 million in the year, from £40.0 million in 2016 to £44.6 million in 2017. Adjusting for a £0.8 million adverse currency 
impact, in constant currency underlying cost of sales grew by £3.8 million, which is attributable to a £4.0 million increase in costs of sales arising 
from the twelve Space Maker stores, four new stores in the UK and two in Paris, less the closures of our Deptford and old Birmingham Central 
stores. On a like-for-like basis, at constant exchange rates, cost of sales decreased by £0.2 million, with savings of £0.5 million from store 
maintenance and business rates, partly offset by a £0.3 million increase from employee remuneration and volume related costs.

Underlying administrative expenses for 2017 (CER) (12.0)
– Foreign exchange (0.4)
Underlying administrative expenses for 2017 (reported) (12.4)
In order to arrive at underlying administrative expenses, adjustments are made to remove the impact of exceptional and other non-underlying items.
Exceptional costs reported within administrative expenses include net costs relating to corporate transactions of £1.4 million (FY2016: £1.3 million).
Administrative expenses increased by £1.2 million in the year, from £11.2 million in 2016 to £12.4 million in 2017. Adjusting for a £0.4 million adverse 
currency impact, in constant currency underlying administrative expenses increased by £0.8 million to £12.0 million (FY2016: £11.2 million) due to 
higher employee remuneration costs (£0.3 million), professional fees and administration costs (£0.4 million) and £0.1 million arising from the impact 
of Space Maker and the new stores.
Total costs (cost of sales plus administrative expenses) on a like-for-like basis in constant currency have grown by £0.5 million, or 1.0%, 
to £50.1 million (FY2016: £49.6 million), principally as a result of the increase in administrative expenses explained above.

21 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Exceptional items
The Group incurred exceptional transaction related costs totalling £1.4 million during the year, which arose on the acquisition of Stork Self Storage 
(Holdings) Limited (which trades as Alligator Self Storage).  Although the transaction did not complete until after the year end, on 1 November 2017, 
we are required to recognise the costs in the period in which they were incurred.
In the prior year, the Group recognised a net gain of £4.3 million, arising on the acquisition of Space Maker Stores Limited, which comprised 
£5.6 million of negative goodwill less £1.3 million of transaction related costs.
Gain on investment properties
The gain on investment properties consists of the revaluation gains and losses with respect to investment properties under IAS 40 and finance 
lease depreciation for the interests in leaseholds and other items as detailed below.

Revaluation of investment properties under construction 0.9 0.5
Depreciation on leasehold properties (5.3) (4.6)
Gain on investment properties 39.2 41.7
In the current financial year, including investment properties under construction, the UK business contributed £28.6 million to the positive valuation 
movement and the Paris business contributed £15.9 million. The gain on investment properties principally reflects the continuing progress in the 
performance of both businesses, which drive positive changes in the cash flow metrics that are used to assess the value of the store portfolio. 
Operating profit
Operating profit increased marginally by £0.3 million from £109.3 million in 2016 to £109.6 million in 2017, with the £8.7 million increase in underlying 
EBITDA being broadly offset by the £2.5 million lower investment property gain and non-repeating negative goodwill of £5.6 million recognised in 
the prior year.
Net finance costs
Net finance costs includes interest payable, interest on obligations under finance leases, fair value movements on derivatives, exchange gains 
or losses, unwinding of discounts and exceptional refinancing costs. Net finance costs increased by £16.3 million in 2017, to £30.7 million from 
£14.4 million in 2016, principally due to £16.3 million of exceptional refinancing costs incurred during the year.

Underlying finance charge
The underlying finance charge (net bank interest payable) reduced by £0.7 million to £9.4 million, principally reflecting interest savings arising from 
the refinancing of our borrowing arrangements undertaken in May 2017, as well as the restructuring of our hedging arrangements in August 2017. 
Net bank interest payable also includes the amortisation of debt issue costs, which decreased to £0.3 million (FY2016: £0.4 million).

The above table sets out the position as at 31 October 2017, reflecting the refinancing of our borrowing arrangements in May 2017 and the 
restructuring of our hedging arrangements in August 2017. Further explanation is provided in the gearing and capital structure section below.
As at 31 October 2017, £166 million of the £250 million UK revolver and €43 million (£37.8 million) of the €70 million Euro revolver were drawn. 
The drawn amounts attract a bank margin of 1.25%, and the Group pays a non-utilisation fee of 0.50% on the undrawn balances of £84 million 
and €27 million. 
The Group has interest rate hedge agreements in place to June 2022, swapping LIBOR on £100 million at an effective rate of 0.8145% and 
EURIBOR on €30 million at an effective rate of 0.1635%.
The 2024 and 2027 US private placement notes are denominated in Euros and attract fixed interest rates of 1.59% (on €50.9 million) and 2.00% 
(on €74.1 million) respectively. The Euro-denominated borrowings provide a natural hedge against the Group’s investment in the Paris business.
The £50.5 million 2029 US private placement notes are denominated in Sterling and attract a fixed interest rate of 2.92%.
79% of the Group’s drawn debt is effectively at fixed rates of interest as a result of the hedging arrangements and fixed interest loan notes. Overall, 
the Group has an effective interest rate on its borrowings of 2.14% at 31 October 2017, compared to 3.58% at the previous year end, as a result of 
the benefits of the refinancing undertaken during the year.
Non-underlying finance charge
Interest on finance leases was £4.4 million (FY2016: £3.7 million) and reflects part of the leasehold rental charge. The balance of the leasehold rental 
charge is expensed through the gain/loss on investment properties line and contingent rent in the income statement. Overall, our leasehold rental 
charge increased to £10.3 million in 2017, £1.5 million higher than the charge of £8.8 million in 2016. This increase is principally due to a full year’s 
rent charge arising on the leased Space Maker stores (acquired in July 2016) and adverse currency movements on retranslation of the Paris results.
Prior to the May 2017 refinancing, the Group’s $112.9 million US Dollar loan notes were exposed to currency fluctuations, in respect of which a 
£4.5 million net exchange gain has been reported, arising due to the strengthening of Sterling against the US Dollar. The US Dollar borrowings 
were hedged by cross currency swap arrangements. The fair value movement on derivatives was a £5.2 million net loss (FY2016: £18.4 million 
net gain), which comprised a loss of £6.5 million arising on the US Dollar cross currency swaps, less a net gain of £1.3 million arising on our 
interest rate hedging arrangements.
The Group applies net investment hedge accounting in respect of the €125 million of Euro-denominated US private placement notes, so the 
retranslation of these borrowings is recognised directly in the translation reserve, with no impact on finance charges.
The Group incurred £16.3 million of exceptional finance costs as a result of the May 2017 refinancing, comprising a £12.4 million “make-whole” payment 
to holders of the cancelled US Dollar loan notes, with the balance relating to fees and the write off of previous unamortised issue costs. 
The Group also broke the Sterling/Dollar cross currency swap relating to the cancelled US Dollar loan notes, leading to the Group receiving 
£13.9 million, being the mark-to-market value of the swap which was in the Group’s favour and which was carried at that value at the date 
of breakage. The refinancing was broadly cash flow neutral.

Impact of tax rate change in France 8.8 —
Other 0.1 0.1
Deferred tax 3.4 (3.8)
Tax charge (0.6) (7.5)
The net income tax charge for the year is £0.6 million (FY2016: £7.5 million). In the UK, the Group is a REIT, so the tax charge relates solely to the Paris 
business. The underlying current tax charge relating to Paris amounted to £4.0 million (FY2016: £3.7 million), calculated at the French statutory income 
tax rate of 33.33% of its taxable profits. 
Deferred tax was a £3.4 million credit (FY2016: £3.8 million charge). In France, the 2017 Finance Bill, which was adopted in December 2016, 
introduced a reduction in the income tax rate from 33.33% to 28.0%, applicable progressively from 2017 to 2020 according to size of company. 
As a result of this change, a non-recurring deferred tax credit of £8.8 million (FY2016: £nil) has been recognised.
All other deferred tax movements are non-underlying and relate to Paris. The deferred tax impact of the revaluation gain on investment properties 
was a charge of £5.4 million (FY2016: £4.0 million).
Earnings per share
As a result of the movements explained above, profit after tax for 2017 was £78.3 million as compared with £87.4 million in 2016. Basic EPS was 
37.4 pence (FY2016: 42.0 pence) and diluted EPS was 37.3 pence (FY2016: 41.7 pence). Between 2013 and 2017, management has considered cash 
tax adjusted EPS to be more representative of the underlying EPS performance of the business and this is discussed above. However, in order to 
better reflect the underlying performance of the business and to align the key EPS metric with management incentivisation, management will 
be adopting Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS going forward.
Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the 
period after tax but excluding corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and the associated 
tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of exceptional items, IFRS 2 share-based payment charges, exceptional tax 
items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost is excluded as it is written back 
to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). Therefore, neither the 
Company’s ability to distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). The financial 
statements disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full reconciliation of the differences in 
the financial year in which any Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) awards may vest.
Management has introduced Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS as a new measure of EPS following the implementation of the Group’s new LTIP scheme. 
Management considers that the real cost to existing shareholders is the dilution that they will experience from the new LTIP scheme, therefore, 
earnings has been adjusted for the IFRS 2 share-based payment charge, and the number of shares used in the EPS calculation has been adjusted 
for the dilutive effect of the new LTIP scheme. Strategic report

Dividends
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 9.8 pence (FY2016: 8.05 pence), which shareholders will be asked to approve at the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2018. If approved by shareholders, the final dividend will be payable on 6 April 2018 to 
shareholders on the register at close of business on 9 March 2018. 
Reflective of the Group’s improved performance, the Group’s full year dividend of 14.0 pence is 20.2% up on the prior year dividend of 11.65 pence. 
The property income dividend (“PID”) element of the full year dividend is 11.9 pence (FY2016: 9.85 pence).
Property valuation and net asset value (“NAV”)
Cushman & Wakefield LLP has valued the Group’s property portfolio. As at 31 October 2017, the total value of the Group’s property portfolio was 
£999.2 million (excluding investment properties under construction of £7.8 million). This represents an increase of £55.9 million compared with the 
£943.3 million valuation as at 31 October 2016. A reconciliation of the movement is set out below:

The exchange rate at 31 October 2017 was €1.14:£1 compared with €1.11:£1 at 31 October 2016. This movement in the foreign exchange rate has 
resulted in a £5.1 million adverse currency translation movement in the year. This has impacted Group net asset value (“NAV”) but had no impact 
on the LTV covenant as the assets in Paris are tested in Euros.
The value of the UK property portfolio has increased by £36.9 million compared with 31 October 2016, comprising a £27.7 million valuation 
gain and capital additions (including reclassifications from investment properties under construction) of £17.3 million, less disposal proceeds 
of £8.1 million in respect of the sales of Deptford and our old Birmingham Central store.
Our pipeline of expansion stores in the UK, comprising sites at Mitcham, Paddington Marble Arch and Merry Hill in Birmingham, is valued at £7 .8 million.
In Paris, the value of the property portfolio increased by €27.7 million, of which €18.2 million was valuation gain and capital additions (including 
reclassifications) were €9.5 million. However, the net increase in Sterling amounted to £19.0 million, reflecting the foreign exchange impact 
described above.
Financial review continued Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
25 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
The Group’s freehold exit yield for the valuation at 31 October 2017 reduced to 7.06%, from 7.19% at 31 October 2016, and the weighted average 
annual discount rate for the whole portfolio has reduced from 10.75% at 31 October 2016 to 10.56% at 31 October 2017.
The adjusted EPRA NAV per share was 329 pence at 31 October 2017, up 9.7% since 31 October 2016, and reported NAV per share was 304 pence 
(FY2016: 282 pence), reflecting a £50.3 million increase in reported net assets during the year.
Gearing and capital structure
The Group’s borrowings comprise revolving bank borrowing facilities in the UK and France and a US private placement.
Net debt (including finance leases and cash) stood at £354.2 million at 31 October 2017, a decrease of £15.0 million from the 2016 position of 
£369.2 million. Total capital (net debt plus equity) increased from £956.6 million at 31 October 2016 to £991.9 million at 31 October 2017. The net 
impact is that the gearing ratio has decreased from 39% to 36% in the year. 
Management also measures gearing with reference to its LTV ratio defined as gross debt (excluding finance leases, but adjusted for the fair value of 
the US Dollar cross currency swaps) as a proportion of the valuation of investment properties and investment properties under construction 
(excluding finance leases). At 31 October 2017 the Group LTV ratio was 36% as compared to 31% at 31 October 2016; however, this has been 
distorted due to the drawdown of £56 million of loans just prior to the year end in anticipation of the Alligator acquisition, which completed 
immediately after the year end on 1 November 2017. On a pro forma basis, excluding this £56 million drawdown, LTV at 31 October 2017 would 
have been 31%, or by including the value of the Alligator stores at 31 October 2017, LTV would have been 34%. The Board considers the current 
level of gearing is appropriate for the business to enable the Group to increase returns on equity, maintain financial flexibility and to achieve our 
medium term strategic objectives.
Refinancing in May 2017
In May 2017, the Group announced the refinancing of its US private placement notes (“USPP”) and an amendment and extension of its existing 
bank facilities to extend the average maturity and lower the cost of the Group’s debt financing. The key terms of the new and amended 
arrangements, which came into effect on 31 May 2017, are as follows:
US private placement notes
 — The previous $65.6 million 5.83% 2019 USPP and $47.3 million 6.74% 2024 USPP were repaid in full;
 — New Euro and Sterling-denominated USPP notes were issued with the following tenor and fixed coupons:
 — €50.9 million 7 year notes at a coupon of 1.59%;
 — €74.1 million 10 year notes at a coupon of 2.00%; and
 — £50.5 million 12 year notes at a coupon of 2.92%.
Amendment and extension of bank facilities
 — The previous UK and Euro revolving credit facilities were extended by two years from June 2020 to June 2022, with an option (on an uncommitted 
basis) to extend for a further year; the previous £126 million term loan was cancelled.
 — As at 31 May 2017, the amended facilities comprised:
 — a £190 million revolving credit facility; and
 — a €70 million revolving facility.
 — The margin on the amended facilities was reduced by 25bps from 150bps to 125bps.
 — Similarly, the non-utilisation fee on the undrawn facilities reduced from 0.6% to 0.5%.
 — The Group also had the option (on an uncommitted basis) to increase the quantum of the Sterling revolving credit facility by £60 million. This option 
was exercised in October 2017 to increase the UK revolving facility to £250 million, in anticipation of the acquisition of the Alligator business, 
which completed following the year end on 1 November 2017.
As part of the refinancing, the Group made a “make-whole” payment to existing USPP noteholders of £12.4 million and broke the Sterling/Dollar 
cross currency swap relating to the existing USPP notes, leading to the Group receiving £13.9 million, being the mark-to-market value of the swap 
which was in the Group’s favour and which was carried at that value at the date of breakage. As noted above, exceptional finance charges reported 
by the Group in respect of the refinancing for the year were £16.3 million, comprising the £12.4 million “make-whole” payment, with the balance 
relating to fees and the write off of previous unamortised issue costs. The refinancing was broadly cash flow neutral.
Subsequent to amendment and extension of the bank facilities, the Group also restructured its interest rate hedge arrangements. Existing swaps, 
which mirrored the previous term of the bank facilities to June 2020, at weighted average fixed rates of 1.34% (over £100 million) and 0.309% (over 
€30 million), were broken, resulting in a cash outflow of £2.6 million. New interest rate hedge agreements were put in place to June 2022, swapping 
LIBOR on £100 million at an effective rate of 0.8145% and EURIBOR on €30 million at an effective rate of 0.1635%.
Borrowings at 31 October 2017
As at 31 October 2017, £166 million of the £250 million UK revolver and €43 million (£37.8 million) of the €70 million Euro revolver were drawn.  
Including the US private placement debt of €125 million (£109.9 million) and £50.5 million, the Group’s borrowings totalled £364.2 million 
(before adjustment for unamortised finance costs).
As at 31 October 2017, the weighted average remaining term for the Group’s committed borrowing facilities is 6.3 years.
Borrowings under the existing loan facilities are subject to certain financial covenants. The UK bank facilities and the US private placement share 
interest cover and LTV covenants. The interest cover requirement of EBITDA:interest is 2.4:1, where it will remain until the end of the facilities’ terms. 
Interest cover for the year ended 31 October 2017 is 6.7x.  Strategic report

Borrowings at 31 October 2017 continued
The LTV covenant is 60% in both the UK and France, where it will remain until the end of the facilities’ terms. As at 31 October 2017, there is 
significant headroom in both the UK LTV and the French LTV covenant calculations.
The Group is in compliance with its covenants at 31 October 2017 and, based on forecast projections, is expected to be in compliance for a period 
in excess of twelve months from the date of this report.
Cash flow
The table below sets out the underlying cash flow of the business in 2017 and 2016. For statutory reporting purposes, leasehold rent cash flows are 
allocated between finance costs, principal repayments and contingent rent, however, management considers a presentation of cash flows that 
reflects leasehold rent as a single line item to be representative of the underlying cash flow performance of the business.

Operating cash flow increased by £11.2 million in the year, principally due to the £8.7 million improvement in underlying EBITDA. Working capital, 
exceptional items and other resulted in a £0.7 million inflow, compared to a £1.8 million outflow in the prior year, with the year-on-year difference 
principally attributable to the timing of VAT recovery in the prior year, due to VAT incurred on capital expenditure during the fourth quarter of FY2016.
Free cash flow (before investing and financing activities) grew by 18.6% to £50.3 million (FY2016: £42.4 million). The free cash flow benefitted from the 
increase in operating cash flow, which was partly offset by a £0.9 million increase in interest payments as a result of the timing of cash flows, a £1.5 million 
increase in leasehold rental payments reflecting an equivalent increase in the rent charge and a £0.9 million increase in tax due to the timing of payments.
Investing activities experienced a net outflow of £12.8 million (FY2016: £69.4 million), which included £21.7 million (FY2016: £28.3 million) of capital 
expenditure on our investment property portfolio, of which £12.4 million was in respect of our new store at Combs-la-Ville and our three new pipeline 
sites at Mitcham, Paddington Marble Arch and Merry Hill in Birmingham. £8.1 million (FY2016: £nil) was generated from the sales of Deptford and our 
old Birmingham Central store. The prior year included £22.3 million of capital expenditure in respect of our five new stores at Chiswick, Wandsworth, 
Altrincham, Birmingham and Emerainville, plus the extension at Acton, as well as £41.8 million for the acquisition of Space Maker.
Financing activities generated a net cash inflow of £22.9 million (FY2016: £17.0 million). Dividend payments totalled £25.6 million (FY2016: £21.3 million). 
The net drawdown of borrowings of £38.9 million (FY2016: £38.6 million) included £56.0 million in anticipation of the Alligator acquisition, which completed 
immediately after the year end on 1 November 2017 (and which is the principal reason for the £60.4 million net increase in cash during the year), less the 
£12.4 million “make-whole” payment on cancellation of US private placement loan notes. In addition, financing activities includes a net inflow of £11.3 million 
(FY2016: £nil), comprising a receipt of £13.9 million on breaking the Sterling/Dollar cross currency swap relating to the cancelled loan notes less a cash 
outflow of £2.6 million on restructuring of our interest rate hedge arrangements.

Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) 
We continue to build stronger 
teams, improve customer service 
and develop relationships
At Safestore, corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) is important to 
our business processes and operations. We strive to ensure that our 
activities reflect our ongoing commitment to customer care, employee 
engagement, responsible supply chains, driving shareholder value and 
helping to maintain a sustainable environment for future generations.
The Group continues to contribute to the development of a sustainable 
society through:
 — creating a diverse, dynamic and engaged workplace;
 — developing and maintaining partnerships with local communities 
and charities;
 — mitigating the environmental effects of our activities; and 
 — fulfilling our responsibility to society through ethical sourcing.
2017 saw much change from a political and social perspective as the 
UK approaches Brexit. Whilst the self-storage industry remains resilient, 
we continue with our efforts to build stronger teams, improve customer 
service and develop relationships with local partners alongside our 
commitment to business growth. 
As the UK’s largest provider of self-storage facilities, we are very 
aware of the impact we can have in society and on the environment and 
therefore by making incremental changes year-on-year, we can ensure 
that our actions have positive implications for our employees, suppliers 
and wider society.
We are continuously adapting our business to respond to our customers’ 
changing expectations including improving customer convenience and 
offering flexibility for small, medium and large businesses.
We are proud of the role we continue to play in the lives of our customers 
as we meet the demand for space from home and business owners, and 
we want to keep pace with their needs and expectations whilst delivering 
our commercial objectives.
The Board has a collective responsibility to create and deliver 
sustainable value for our shareholders and the business has continued 
to make significant progress this year in the face of a challenging 
operating environment.
During the year, the Board continued to focus on delivering the Group’s 
strategy whilst addressing the key environmental, social and ethical 
factors facing Safestore. 
We continue to do this by:
 — ensuring our employees are engaged and have the expertise 
to deliver high quality customer service;
 — developing long term relationships with local charities and creating 
strong ties to the communities where we have a storage centre;
 — strengthening partnerships with our suppliers so we can serve our 
customers better and grow our businesses together going forward;
 — managing the resources we use in order to minimise any negative 
impact on the environment either through our direct operations 
or through our sourcing activities; and
 — maintaining our membership of the Self Storage Association 
to further industry standards and codes of ethics for the benefit 
of our customers. 
Our CSR objectives support the delivery of our business strategy. 
We report progress against them under four pillars: Our Customers, 
Our People, Our Community and Our Environment.
Highlights
 — The total space occupied in stores by local charities was 23,077 sq ft.
 — We achieved an overall recycling rate of 50.5%.
 — 40% of our stores have been fitted with LED lighting throughout.
 — 25 colleagues were successfully promoted to a more senior position. 
Our Customers
We put our customers at the very core of our business as we continue 
to build our capability to respond to changing customer expectations 
in today’s fast-paced world.
Our high standards of customer service online, on the phone and in 
store, alongside our leading digital platforms, mean that our skilled 
workforce across the Group is effective at converting enquiries by 
delivering the best to our customers in terms of price, service 
and quality.
We are continuing to see a sustained improvement in the feedback we are 
getting from customers on our service through Feefo, the independent 
customer rating system for businesses launched in 2013 which guarantees 
100% genuine feedback. Feefo polls real Safestore customers about their 
experiences meaning that feedback is a true representation of consumer 
opinion. All of our stores across the country receive feedback which 
means customers can view the ratings for each individual store.
In 2017 , Safestore once again achieved a customer service rating of 96% 
based on the customers who rated their experience as “Excellent” or 
“Good”. Having achieved this service level, Safestore was again recognised 
with a “Gold Trusted Merchant” award – given to businesses achieving 
over 95%. Strategic report

Our Customers continued
This award is evidence of our staff going above and beyond to deliver 
the best customer service possible and we are encouraged to see 
the impact of recruiting, developing and retaining the right people, 
and supporting and engaging them so that they are able to be 
the best they can be.
Une Pièce en Plus continues to use Trustpilot to obtain independent 
customer reviews. In the three years since launch, more than 1,350 reviews 
have been collected with an excellent average score of 4.56 out of 5. 
More than 93% of customers are satisfied with their customer service 
experience, rating it four stars and above.
Customer reviews are becoming increasingly important to the Group 
as a whole as they enable us to manage our high customer service 
standards and they increase the likelihood of online enquiries.
Our People
Our colleagues play a pivotal role in providing the best solution for 
our customers and we are passionate in providing a diverse CSR 
programme that ensures they are truly placed at the heart of our 
business. This helps our colleagues to achieve their goals and

best talent to shape our future success.
Health and safety
As a Board we play an active role in ensuring a healthy and safe 
environment for our people, customers, suppliers and contractors. 
Safestore endeavours to continuously strive to meet, and where 
possible, exceed best practice by:
 — conducting regular health and safety reviews across our portfolio

practices, policies and procedures. No team member or potential 
team member will receive less favourable treatment due to any 
of the following protected characteristics: age, disability, gender 
reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, 
marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity;
 — being an equal opportunities employer that maintains a workforce 
that reflects the uniqueness of the communities in which we operate;
 — continuing to nurture the talents of our people and the benefit they 
bring to our varying business functions through a clearly defined 
and transparent performance framework;

individual’s merits, abilities and needs, business needs, and the 
availability of appropriate training and development opportunities. 
All team members participate in the appraisal process and there 
is positive encouragement to discuss development and training 
needs and opportunities; and

is dependent on our highly motivated and well trained colleagues.
We are delighted that for the year FY2017 our people have participated

people and enable their performance as early as possible;
 — developing our colleagues’ sales and customer service skills 
continually regardless of length of service through onboarding 
and refresher programmes;
 — fulfilling health and safety requirements;
 — creating a coaching and performance culture determined by explicit 
standards, consistency and sustainability in order to support individual 
needs at all job levels whilst driving performance forward as a

29 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
In keeping with our approach of continuous improvement, we have 
delivered several key initiatives to support our people’s performance:
 — QUEST – this year we have continued to develop all new team 
members using the two-day selling skills programme QUEST. 
This workshop provides every team member at Safestore with 
skills and tools to enable them to focus on the customer’s 
needs at every stage of the buying cycle;
 — The Learning Space – our innovative e-learning platform is designed 
to aid effective adult learning and development in the workplace 
and completes our blended learning approach. There are currently 
18 modules available to our people in an engaging, bitesize and 
efficient format;
 — Our Values and Behaviours – our framework for articulating the 
attributes of high performing team members, along with commercial 
results, informs our performance related pay principles;
 — Pay for Skills – supporting internal talent creates clearly defined 
career pathways linked to reward and recognition which enable 
us to attract higher calibre individuals at entry level and develop 
our future store management population in a consistent way; and
 — The Safestore Store Management Development Programme 
prepares the next generation of internally developed managers. 
The twelve-month programme focuses on developing competent, 
business-focused managers who have a talent in building highly 
performing teams. We currently have 30 colleagues participating 
in the Store Management Development Programme.
Promotions
25 colleagues were successfully promoted to a more senior position. 
This compares to 15 last year (excluding the 37 promotions related 
to structure changes).
Our Community
The Safestore Group seeks to be an integral and trusted part of 
our communities nationwide and this is achieved largely in part by 
our partnerships with local charities. It is our continuing commitment 
to behave ethically and contribute to local communities and society 
at large as we believe that building and developing trust with those 
around us is one of the sources of steady business operations.
Over the year, we have sponsored charity events with cardboard box 
donations, employees have volunteered in community projects and 
we have provided free storage space for a number of charities.
We have:
 — provided fundraising support to existing and new local 
charity partnerships;
 — provided free or discounted storage space for 161 charities within 
our local communities through our “charity room in every store” 
scheme. This is a 41% increase on last year; and
 — leveraged social media and our blog platform to promote our charity 
partners and raise awareness of their cause.
Hands on London
Safestore has been supporting Hands on London’s “Wrap Up London” 
campaign for the past six years. The charity, which promotes community-
based volunteering, organises the annual campaign encouraging 
Londoners to donate any unwanted coats ahead of the winter season. 
In November 2016, we provided storage space at three London 
stores to facilitate the sorting, storage and distribution of coats 
to over 100 charities, homeless shelters, vulnerable women 
and children centres, elderly people in need and refugees. 
Several members of our Head Office team joined over 800 volunteers 
to collect nearly 23,000 coats. The rapidly growing annual campaign 
also added additional collection locations as part of a plan to grow 
it nationwide. Making its debut in Manchester, we supported the 
campaign with storage space in one of our northern stores.
Jon Meech, CEO, Hands on London, said:
“We are extremely grateful to Safestore for supporting Wrap Up London 
2016. Not only did they generously donate storage space at three Safestore 
locations around London to make the storage, sorting and distribution 
of thousands of coats possible, but the help and enthusiasm of all the 
Safestore team members at Head Office who came to help really did 
make a massive contribution to the campaign’s success. 
“The accessibility for people to donate a coat would not enjoy the 
impact that it does without the help of Safestore. We were also excited 
to launch Wrap Up Manchester, where a number of coats were collected 
– many thanks to Safestore for helping us to keep thousands of 
vulnerable Londoners and Mancunians warm this winter!” 
Grenfell Tower fire – our response
June 2017 saw the horrific fire in a tower block in West London, which 
claimed the lives of many people and left many others homeless. Our 
Notting Hill store is located very close to the tower block – in fact, the 
store was within the cordoned off area and was closed for two days.
Our marketing department received a lot of requests for help with 
storage space as donations poured in and space began to run out. 
Such was the response to this tragedy that donated items soon 
began to exceed the demand. 
We were able to offer storage space to enable the sorting and packing 
up of items. We also donated over 2,000 boxes and tape and pens to twelve 
different charities and organisations. In total we provided 800 sq ft 
in Notting Hill, eight rooms totalling 1,875 sq ft in Acton and 500 sq ft 
in Crystal Palace.
Perry Godfrey, Store Manager at Notting Hill, said:
“Following the Grenfell Tower fire and the amazing support from the 
public, as a store team we were able to offer a number of large spaces 
to eight different charities as well as offer support to the local tenants 
and the nearby local pre-school nursery. 
“All of the team really stepped up during these testing times, by showing 
a truly professional manner with a real sense of empathy to everyone 
who has been affected by this.”

The charity offers both respite breaks and outreach support to young 
carers and vulnerable children, many of whom would otherwise have 
nowhere to turn.
Not only did we donate free storage space to free up resources and 
funds for the charity, our Head Office colleagues held a charity breakfast 
event to raise money and awareness for this fantastic charity who work 
with young carers to give them a break from their responsibilities.
Melina Alexandrou, Corporate Partnerships Manager, 
The Honeypot Children’s Charity, said:
“We are extremely grateful to be partnering with Safestore Earls Court. 
They have enabled Honeypot to save money through offering us help 
and storage when moving office. 
“This support enables us to concentrate our efforts and direct the funds 
saved to our vital services. A direct benefit of which is ensuring young 
carers and vulnerable children have the opportunity to make the most 
of their one chance at childhood.” Strategic report

Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) continued
Our Community continued
DIY SOS – BBC TV show
In the summer we were contacted by DIY SOS, the BBC series 
hosted by Nick Knowles, which enables amazing home renovations to 
transform the lives of deserving families. In this case, the family was of 
PC Kris Aves, a survivor of the Westminster terror attack in March 2017 
who was left paralysed, wheelchair bound and subsequently unable to 
return home.
The BBC was looking to store the family’s belongings during the 
renovations and we were able to support by donating space at a local 
store. In addition, volunteers from Safestore’s Head Office were able 
to go along to the project and work alongside local tradespeople 
to complete the big build within ten days.
Wanjiku Calver, Safestore Marketing Manager, said:
“It’s been a privilege to have played a part in getting Kris home and 
back with his family. The sheer joy on their faces was an absolute 
pleasure to witness. It was great to be part of the local community, 
to work together and achieve so much in a short space of time!”
The big reveal will air sometime in 2018 but in the meantime 
Kris can now fully access the family home.
Other local charity support
In addition to our fundraising and voluntary activities, we continue 
to support individual charities with free storage space through 
our “charity room in every store” scheme. 
This year saw a 41% increase in the number of charities we have 
partnered with who are receiving free or discounted storage space. 
This space has enabled a diverse range of local charities to focus 
on their core activities without the added cost of storing donations 
and archives etc. 
In addition to the provision of storage space, we actively encourage our 
colleagues in Head Office and in stores to make a positive difference 
to the local community by supporting charities through fundraising 
and volunteering.
During the year, some of our colleagues took part in the gruelling 
Tough Mudder challenge whilst another speed-hiked the iconic 
Tour du Mont Blanc trail. Another group spent a cold night sleeping 
rough to raise money for a homeless charity whilst another store 
acted as a drop-off point for a local toy appeal.
Whilst we support many charities in the vicinity of our stores, 
we believe it is important for us to support our colleagues when they 
take the initiative and go above and beyond to raise awareness and 
fundraise for charities close to their hearts. 
Our Environment 
Safestore aims to minimise the impact of our business operations 
on the environment, both directly and through our sourcing activities. 
Management of natural resources is vital for us too as reducing our 
impact will help us save costs and compete more effectively. 
We continue to:
 — minimise waste production and promote reuse and recycling 
where possible;
 — ensure the safe handling and disposal of waste products;
 — continue to deploy cardboard recycling facilities across our stores;
 — reduce our energy usage through a range of initiatives;
 — work with our suppliers to build more sustainable supply chains; and
 — use eco-friendly solutions when building new stores and, as a 
minimum, building to the BRE Environmental Assessment Method.
During the year, we have made progress in a number of areas:
 — an overall recycling rate of 50.5% with recycling collections 
in place at all of our sites, 4.0% pts higher than last year; 
 — 80% of our stores have smart meters installed;
 — LED lighting installed within 40% of our stores, increasing to 50% 
by the end of 2017; and
 — 1.7% decrease in mileage driven by business vehicles (602,000 miles 
in twelve months to 31 August 2017). 
Chiswick – a case study
We opened a new store in Chiswick, London on 4 November 2016. 
The store is located on the A4 and is easily accessible to the local 
affluent catchment area.
The facility used to be an old local dairy, and provides 42,500 sq ft 
over six floors, including two levels in the basement. These basement 
levels have a water mist fire system, and a mechanical smoke extraction 
system to remove smoke in the event of a fire.
As well as our usual security features, 24-hour recorded CCTV, intruder 
alarms, fire protection and key fob entry for customers, this store has 
a couple of interesting eco-friendly features.
The building has solar panels on the roof, bringing the benefits 
of sustainable energy and therefore reduced energy costs. 
In addition, the store also has a “Green Wall”, a vertical garden facing 
the residential properties surrounding the facility, allowing for not only 
a better view for those living nearby, but also supplying a haven for 
bees and British wildlife, especially over the summer months. 
Our packaging range
A general increase in sales has meant that all areas have shown 
increases in volumes over the previous twelve-month period. Please 
see confirmation below of this year’s and last year’s numbers for 
comparison in kilos supplied.

The change last year of using a third party transport company to deliver 
to the Scottish and Northern English stores, we believe, will have saved 
in the region of 1,280kg of CO
2
 every month, or an annualised saving of 
15 tonnes of CO
2
.
As the total weight of corrugated material has increased, our continued 
commitment to fully recycled papers has minimised the cost to the 
environment; we estimate that at these volumes around 600 trees have 
been saved versus an 80% recycled mix product (on the basis that 
every tonne of recycled paper used instead of virgin kraft paper 
saves twelve trees).
We continue to work closely with our suppliers to explore any 
opportunity that might help to improve the impact of Safestore’s 
business on the environment. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Mandatory greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
emissions reporting 
This report was undertaken in accordance with the mandatory greenhouse 
gas (“GHG”) emissions reporting requirements outlined in the Companies 
Act for listed companies, which requires us to report on our GHG emissions 
each financial year. This report contains our GHG disclosure for the 
2016/17 financial year. 
Our GHG report covers the period 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017 and 
during this period there were 109 stores in the UK and 26 stores in France. 
Altrincham, Birmingham Goliath and Emerainville were opened between 
September 2016 and October 2016, which fall into the 2016 financial year, 
and Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville were opened in November 2016 and 
June 2017, which fall into the 2017 financial year. For the purposes of the 
GHG report, these five stores are all reported as new stores as they opened 
within our GHG reporting period (1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017). 
The Deptford store closed in August 2017 , which falls into the 2017 financial 
year, so is also included. This report contains the following environmental 
data for all 135 of our stores that were open during the reporting period: 
GHG emissions, electricity consumption, electricity transmission and 
distribution, gas consumption, water consumption, waste generation 
(recycling, landfill and energy from waste) and business travel.
Methodology 
Scope of analysis and data collection 
Over 2016/17 we have collected primary data for all of our stores, 
including: building size (sq ft), electricity consumption (kWh), electricity 
transmission and distribution (kWh losses), gas consumption (kWh), water 
consumption (m
3
), waste generation (tonnes by waste disposal method) 
and business travel (mileage). We do not have any refrigerant leakage 
to report for any of our stores in the UK or France. All primary data 
used within this report is from 1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017, 
covering the same reporting period as last year. 
KPI selection and calculation 
For the purposes of this report stationary energy use (electricity and 
gas consumption), water consumption, waste generation and business 
travel have been selected as the most appropriate key performance 
indicators (“KPIs”) for the Group. To ensure consistency in our reporting, 
particularly where there are differences between the UK and France, 
we are reporting all GHG emissions in units of CO
2
e. We have used 
the 2017 GHG conversion factors published annually by Defra and 
BEIS with the exception of the French CO
2
e conversion factors, which 
are no longer published by Defra and BEIS. This is outlined in further 
detail at the end of this report.
GHG emissions scope
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG Protocol”) differentiates between 
direct and indirect emissions using a classification system across 
three different scopes: 
 — Scope 1 emissions: includes direct emissions from sources which 
Safestore owns or controls. This includes direct emissions from fuel 
combustion and industrial processes. 
 — Scope 2 emissions: covers indirect emissions relating solely to the 
generation of purchased electricity that is consumed by the owned 
or controlled equipment or operations of Safestore.
 — Scope 3 emissions: covers other indirect emissions including third 
party-provided business travel. 
GHG emissions – scopes included in this report 
 — Scope 1 emissions: we are reporting our gas consumption and 
business mileage. 
 — Scope 2 emissions: we are reporting our electricity consumption. 
 — Scope 3 emissions: we are reporting our electricity transmission 
and distribution, waste generation and water consumption. 
Group environmental performance 
We recognise the importance of taking a proactive, strategic approach to 
environmental management and we aim to ensure that good environmental 
practices are applied throughout our stores, and that those working for 
or on behalf of Safestore are aware of the need to act responsibly and 
sustainably. Our most significant environmental impacts arise from the 
construction of new stores and the operational energy consumption 
of our existing stores. 
Safestore is committed to the protection of the environment, prevention 
of pollution and to continually improving our environmental performance. 
We will comply with all relevant legislation and strive to exceed legal 
requirements where possible in order to avoid or minimise any potential 
environmental impacts.
During the reported period, the Safestore Group included 109 stores in 
the UK and 26 stores in France, as described above. It is important to note 
that we completed our acquisition of Space Maker Stores Limited (“SMS”) 
on 29 July 2016. So, for our previous year’s GHG report (2015/16) we were 
only able to report on one month of data for each of these twelve stores. 
This year’s GHG report (2016/17) will be the first report where we will 
be reporting a full year’s worth of data for these twelve stores. 
The table below displays our “total Group performance” (including the 
Space Maker Stores and our two new sites) for electricity consumption, 
gas consumption, water consumption, waste generation (recycling, 
landfill and energy from waste) and business travel against the previous 
financial year.

Group environmental performance – analysis 
We have analysed the year-on-year change in our performance and 
provided commentary on our Group environmental performance, 
as below: 
Gas performance
We are continually seeking opportunities to reduce energy consumption 
to the lowest practicable levels appropriate with the operational needs 
of the business and to satisfy the needs of our customers. Our stores 
consume low volumes of gas for space heating in reception and office 
locations. At the design and construction stage we seek opportunities 
to design efficient, low consumption working environments.

Between September 2016 and August 2017, the total gas consumption 
across all of our stores was 2,349,277 kWh. 
Electricity performance
We are continually seeking opportunities to reduce energy consumption 
to the lowest practicable levels appropriate with the operational needs 
of the business and to satisfy the needs of our customers. To this effect 
we have installed smart meters in 80% of our stores and we are aiming 
to have 100% smart meter coverage by the end of 2017. Where possible 
we will consider installing energy management technology such as 
building management systems and voltage optimisation, although these 
are not currently suitable for our stores. 
Recognising that our electricity consumption is predominantly derived 
from our lighting requirements we have installed timers and PIR sensors 
at all of our stores and we are currently undertaking a portfolio-wide 
LED lighting upgrade programme. To date we have retrofitted LED 
lighting in 40% of our stores and by the end of 2017 we will have 
increased this to 50% of stores with a short term plan of investing 
across the entire portfolio over the coming year.

Between September 2016 and August 2017, the total electricity 
consumption across all of our stores was 22,005,201 kWh, which is 
a 14.8% increase compared with the previous financial year. We were 
expecting this increase in electricity consumption as we have opened 
five new stores during this period and this is the first year that we are 
reporting a full year’s worth of electricity consumption for the twelve 
Space Maker Stores (“SMS”) that we acquired in July 2016. In total, 
the twelve SMS stores accounted for 1,635,349 kWh of electricity 
consumption and our five new stores accounted for a further 
603,760 kWh of electricity consumption.
Water performance
Our stores consume very low volumes of water and we strive to 
further minimise our consumption of water wherever possible through the 
installation of efficient water fixtures and fittings. We also take a systematic 
approach for implementing biodiversity protection projects across our sites 
where these are deemed to be of importance, such as our Chiswick store 
where we built a Green Wall.

 of water consumption and our five new stores accounted for 
a further 816 m
3
 of water consumption.
Waste performance
We produce a relatively small amount of waste and we are seeking 
opportunities to further reduce or avoid the use of natural resources 
and minimise waste production by promoting reuse and recycling 
where possible. We continue to improve our waste segregation 
at our stores and are actively enhancing our recycling facilities 
to divert waste from landfill.

financial year. We have reduced the amount of waste going to landfill 
by 12% and we are pleased to report that the amount of waste being 
recycled has increased by 4% compared to the previous financial year. 
As a result, we are now sending 50.5% of all of our waste to recycling. 
Business travel performance
We report on our business travel, which includes vehicles owned 
by Safestore and business mileage. We are continually looking 
for opportunities to reduce the need to travel wherever possible.

accounting for 8%, Scope 2 accounting for 83% and Scope 3 accounting for 9% of the total GHG emissions. On a reporting basis total GHG 
emissions have decreased by 0.6% compared with the previous financial year. 
This reduction in GHG emissions, particularly Scope 2 emissions (purchased electricity) is partially attributed to rebasing of the GHG conversion 
factors. The rebasing of GHG conversion factors has seen the GHG emissions conversion factor for electricity reduced by 15%. This reflects 
changes to the UK’s energy mix during 2016/17 which saw a reduction in the use of coal-powered electricity generation and increases in gas 
and renewables generation.

How the Board works
The Board
The Code recommends that the Board should include a balance 
of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, such that no individual or 
small group of individuals can dominate the Board’s decision making. 
It further recommends that at least half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise Non-Executive Directors determined by 
the Board to be independent and that one Non-Executive Director 
should be nominated as the Senior Independent Director.
Following Keith Edelman’s retirement from the Board on 31 December 2016, 
the Company currently has seven Directors, which include the Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and four independent Non-Executive Directors. 
As a result, the Directors consider that there is a satisfactory balance 
of decision-making power on the Board.
The Board monitors the independence of its Non-Executive Directors. 
The Board is aware of the other commitments of its Directors and is satisfied 
that these do not conflict with their duties as Non-Executive Directors 
of the Company. The Executive Directors do not hold any executive 
or non-executive directorships in other companies.
Alan Lewis was deemed to be independent from January 2011 following 
the disposal by Bridgepoint of its major shareholding in the Company. Each 
of the remaining Non-Executive Directors was deemed to be independent 
upon their appointment. Ian Krieger is the Senior Independent Director.
A clear division of responsibility at the head of the Group is established, 
agreed in writing and approved by the Board. There is a clear division 
of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. 
The Chairman is responsible for the management of the Board and 
for aspects of external relations, while the Chief Executive Officer has 
overall responsibility for the management of the Group’s businesses 
and implementation of the strategy approved by the Board. The 
statement of the division of responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer is available on the Group’s website 
at www.safestore.com.
Composition of the Board at January 2018
Chairman 1
Executive Directors 2
Independent Non-Executive Directors 4
Appropriate directors’ and officers’ insurance cover is arranged by the 
Group through its insurance brokers and is reviewed annually.
Board process
The Board normally schedules at least eight meetings throughout the 
year, including an extended strategy review. Additional meetings are 
held as and when required.
It has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for its decision, 
which includes (amongst other things) the approval of strategic plans, 
annual budgets, interim and full year preliminary results announcements 
and financial statements and internal control and risk analysis.

Implementation of agreed plans, budgets and projects in pursuit of 
the Group’s strategy and the actual operation of the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management are delegated to the 
Executive Directors.
The services of the Company Secretary are available to all members 
of the Board. Board minutes are circulated to all Board members. 
There is also regular informal contact between Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors to deal with important matters that arise 
between scheduled Board meetings. A separate meeting for 
Non-Executive Directors only is held at least once in every year.
Board Committees
The Board has three principal Committees, each of whose terms of 
reference are available from the investor relations page of the Group’s 
website at www.safestore.com.
All Committees and all Directors have the authority to seek information 
from any Group Director or employee and to obtain professional advice.

Effectiveness
Board performance evaluation
During the year, an evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
Committees, the individual Directors and the Chairman was conducted. 
The scope of the Board and Committee evaluation process was agreed 
with the Chairman and undertaken by the Company Secretary. 
Directors completed detailed written questionnaires covering a number 
of key areas including strategy, succession planning, Board size and 
composition, risk management and the relationship between the Board 
and management. The results of the reviews were then considered by 
the Chairman and discussed by the Board as a whole.
The review also involved an assessment by the Chairman of individual 
Directors’ own performance. The Chairman’s own performance was 
assessed by the Senior Independent Director.
The anonymity of respondents was ensured in order to promote the 
open and frank exchange of views. A report was produced mapping 
the performance of the Board which addressed the following areas:
 — dynamics of the Board, including the engagement of the Directors 
in the affairs of the Company and the environment in the boardroom;
 — the priorities for Board meetings;
 — management of time and planning of the annual cycle of work 
and agenda;
 — evaluation of the Board’s oversight of operations;
 — management of risk, including the Board’s review and testing of risk 
management policies;
 — composition and performance of the Committees of the Board; and
 — identification of the main priorities for the Board for the coming year. 
The Directors have concluded that, following this evaluation, the Board 
and its Committees operate effectively. Recommendations were made 
for some enhancements, mainly comprising minor modifications to 
Board meeting material.
The content for any subsequent evaluation will be designed to 
build upon insights gained in the previous exercise to ensure that the 
recommendations agreed in the review have been implemented and 
that year-on-year progress is measured. It is intended that an externally 
facilitated Board evaluation will be held at least every three years.
Board appointments
Every decision to appoint further Directors to the Board is taken 
by the entire Board in a formal meeting based on a recommendation 
from the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee consults 
with financial and legal advisers and uses the services of external 
recruitment specialists. New members of the Board are provided with 
initial and ongoing training appropriate to individual needs in respect 
of their role and duties as directors of a listed company and an 
induction programme.
The service agreements of the Executive Directors and the letters of 
appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection 
at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours, 
including the 15 minutes immediately prior to the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). The letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors are in 
line with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating 
to expected time commitment.
Re-election of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that one-third of the 
Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director will seek 
re-election by the shareholders at the AGM at least once every three 
years. Additionally, new Directors are subject to election by shareholders 
at the first opportunity after their appointment. All Directors have offered 
to stand for re-election at the 2018 AGM and their details are given in 
the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Diversity
The Board has due regard for the benefits of diversity in its membership 
and strives to maintain the right diversity balance including gender, 
age and professional background. The Chairman seeks to ensure that 
the composition of the Board includes individuals with deep knowledge 
and experience, bringing a wide range of perspectives to the business.
The Board, as at the date of this Annual Report and Financial Statements, 
comprises 29% women (FY2016: 29%). The Board must continue to 
provide strong leadership at Safestore, and therefore continues to 
appoint only the most appropriate candidates to the Board. Governance

Accountability
Risk management and internal controls
A summary of the principal risks and uncertainties within the business 
is set out on pages 13 to 16.
The Board retains overall responsibility for setting Safestore’s risk 
appetite, and for risk management and internal control systems. The 
Risk Committee supports the Group’s risk management strategy and 
undertakes regular reviews of the formal risk assessment, and reports 
regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board. The Risk Committee 
is headed by the Chief Financial Officer and comprises Executives 
from the operations, finance, secretariat and property functions. Risk 
management remains an ongoing programme within the Group and 
is formally considered at operational meetings as well as at meetings 
of the Board.
In accordance with Section C.2.3 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board is responsible for reviewing their effectiveness and 
confirms that:
 — there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the principal risks faced by the Company;
 — the systems have been in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements;
 — they are regularly reviewed by the Board; and
 — the systems accord with the FRC guidance on risk management, 
internal control and related financial and business reporting.
The Group currently employs a risk manager supported by two store 
auditors who are responsible for reviewing operational and financial control 
at store level. The risk manager reports to the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer. Further details are provided in the 
Audit Committee report set out on pages 40 and 41.
During the financial year, the Board has directly, and through delegated 
authority to the Audit and Risk Committees, overseen and reviewed the 
performance and evolution of risk management activities and practices 
and internal control systems within Safestore. Through both its ongoing 
involvement and overview in risk management and internal control 
activities, the Board is satisfied that there have been no significant 
failings or weaknesses identified and the Directors believe that 
the system of internal control is appropriate for the Group. 
Budgetary process
A comprehensive budgeting process is in place, with an annual budget 
prepared and validated at a country and functional level. The budget 
is subject to consideration and approval by the Board. The Directors 
are provided with relevant and timely information required to monitor 
financial performance.
Investment appraisal (including acquisitions)
Budgetary approval and defined authorisation levels regulate capital 
expenditure. Acquisition activity is subject to internal guidelines governing 
investment appraisal criteria, financial targets, negotiation, execution 
and post-acquisition management.
Relations with shareholders
The Group places a great deal of importance on communication with 
its shareholders and maintains a dialogue with them through investor 
relations programmes. These include formal presentations of the full 
year and interim results and meetings with institutional investors and 
analysts as required. The remuneration report includes comment 
on extensive engagement with shareholders in respect of the 
renewal of the remuneration policy during the financial year. 
To ensure all Board members share a good understanding of 
the views of major shareholders about the Group, there is a formal 
process whereby the Board reviews announcements and reports 
prior to public distribution and is sent summaries of institutional 
investor comments following meetings on the full year and interim 
results. The Non-Executive Directors are available to meet major 
shareholders when requested.
The Board considers the Annual Report and Financial Statements 
and the AGM to be the primary vehicles for communication with 
private investors. Resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate issue and the Company indicates the level of proxy voting 
lodged in respect of each. The AGM gives all shareholders who are 
able to attend (especially private shareholders) the opportunity to 
hear about the general development of the business. It also provides 
an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions of the full Board 
of Directors, including the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
39 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Keith Edelman was a member of the Committee until his retirement 
from the Board in December 2016. The Nomination Committee 
is appointed by the Board and it comprises the Chairman of the 
Board and Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman does not chair 
or attend when the Committee is considering matters relating to 
his position, in which circumstances the Committee is chaired 
by an independent Non-Executive Director, usually the 
Senior Independent Director.
At the invitation of the Committee, any other Director may attend 
meetings of the Committee. 
Role
The Committee keeps the composition of the Board under review, makes 
recommendations on its membership and monitors succession planning 
for Directors. It also evaluates Board and Committee performance. 
The Committee adopts a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors to the Board.
Succession planning
The Board comprises a Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
four Non-Executive Directors who have wide business experience and 
skills as well as a detailed understanding of the Group’s philosophy and 
strategy. It is a key responsibility of the Committee to advise the Board 
on succession planning. The Committee ensures that future changes 
in the Board’s membership are anticipated and properly managed and 
that, in the event of unforeseen changes, management and oversight 
of the Group’s business and long term strategy will not be disrupted. 
The Committee also addresses continuity in, and development of, 
the Executive Team below Board level.
As a Board, we recognise the benefits of diversity. Diversity of skills, 
background, knowledge, experience and gender, amongst a number 
of other factors, are and will continue to be taken into consideration when 
new appointments to the Board are made. All aspects of diversity are 
considered at every level of recruitment. All appointments to the Board 
are and will continue to be made on merit. The Committee seeks a Board 
composition with the right balance of skills and diversity to meet the 
demands of the business. The Board does not consider that quotas are 
appropriate for its representation and has therefore chosen not to set 
targets. Gender diversity will, however, remain a consideration when 
reviewing the Board’s future composition.
The Committee previously identified a need to appoint 
Non-Executive Directors who had recent or current executive 
experience and had worked in retail or property businesses. 
Specialist recruitment consultants were engaged to undertake a 
search and selection process for additional Non-Executive Directors. 
Bill Oliver joined the Board on 1 November 2016 following a selection 
process undertaken by the Committee in the previous financial year, 
which involved the appointment of a specialist recruitment consultant, 
Ridgeway Partners, who shortlisted candidates with the appropriate 
range of skills for appointment as a Non-Executive Director.
During the year, the Committee considered the performance of the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.
Ian Krieger was appointed Senior Independent Director following 
the Company’s AGM in 2015.
New Director induction
During the 2017 financial year, the Chairman oversaw Bill Oliver’s 
induction, which commenced upon his appointment in November 2016. 
The Chairman agreed a full, formal and tailored induction programme 
with him, which included meetings with senior management, a number 
of site visits and briefings from the Company Secretary and the Company’s 
advisers. Bill completed his induction programme promptly and reported 
that he had found this a useful way of developing his understanding 
about the Group. 
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertook the annual evaluation of the performance of the 
Board and its Committees seeking to identify areas where performance 
and procedures might be improved. Further details are provided in the 
corporate governance section of this report.
Directors standing for re-election
All Directors will stand for re-election at the 2018 AGM. Following 
the annual Board performance reviews of individual Directors, 
as applicable, the Chairman considers:
 — that each Director subject to re-election continues to operate 
as an effective member of the Board; and
 — that each Director subject to re-election has the skills, knowledge 
and experience that enable them to discharge their duties properly 
and contribute to the effective operation of the Board.
The Board, on the advice of the Committee, therefore recommends the 
re-election of each Director standing for re-election. Full biographical 
details of each Director are available on pages 34 and 35.

Audit Committee report
Bill Oliver joined the Committee upon his appointment to the Board in 
November 2016. Keith Edelman was a member of the Committee until 
his retirement from the Board in December 2016. 
The Committee members have been selected to provide the wide range 
of financial and commercial expertise necessary to fulfil the Committee’s 
duties and responsibilities. The Board considers the Committee members’ 
financial experience to be recent and relevant for the purposes of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
In addition to the Committee members, the following were also 
in attendance by invitation:
 — the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Financial Controller;
 — other members of the Board, when considered appropriate – for 
example, the Chairman and the Chief Executive attended meetings at 
which the Group’s full year and half year results were considered; and
 — representatives from Deloitte.
The secretary of the Committee is the Company Secretary. Details 
of attendance at Committee meetings during the 2017 financial year 
are set out on page 36.
Role
The primary function of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its 
oversight responsibilities. This includes reviewing the financial reports and 
other financial information before publication. In addition, the Committee 
also reviews the systems of internal controls, with respect to finance, 
accounting, risk management, compliance, fraud and audit, that 
management and the Board have established on a continuing basis.
The Committee has responsibility for the financial reporting processes, 
along with reviewing the roles and effectiveness of both the internal store 
assurance team and the external auditor. The ultimate responsibility for 
reviewing and approving the annual and other accounts remains with 
the Board.
The terms of reference set out that the Audit Committee will:
 — serve as an independent and objective party to monitor the quality 
and timeliness of the financial reporting process and monitor the 
internal control systems;
 — review and appraise the effectiveness of the external auditor;
 — provide an open line of communication between the independent 
external auditor and the Board of Directors;
 — confirm and ensure the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor (in particular, in the context of the provision of additional 
services to the Company);
 — review and ensure the effectiveness of the risk management 
processes of the Company;
 — review and monitor the effectiveness of the store assurance function, 
management’s responsiveness to any findings and recommendations, 
and consideration of the need for the introduction of an internal 
audit function;
 — assess potential conflicts of interest of Directors on behalf of the 
Board; and
 — report to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.
Risk management and internal control
The Board, as a whole, including the Audit Committee members, 
considers that the nature and extent of Safestore’s risk management 
framework and the risk profile is acceptable in order to achieve the 
Company’s strategic objectives. As a result, it is considered that 
the Board has fulfilled its obligations under the Code.
Safestore’s internal controls, along with its design and operating 
effectiveness, are subject to ongoing monitoring by the Audit Committee 
through reports received from management, along with those from the 
external auditor. Further details of risk management and internal control 
are set out on page 38.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee has oversight responsibilities for the store 
assurance team, which is responsible for reviewing operational and 
financial controls at store level. The Group does not have a separate 
internal audit function and the Board, at least annually, reviews the 
requirement for establishing one. In addition, the Audit Committee will 
from time to time consider the requirement to commission externally 
facilitated reviews of the control environment, to supplement the work 
of the store assurance team, until the Audit Committee determines 
that it is appropriate for the Group to establish a separate internal 
audit function.
Main activities of the Committee during the year
During the year the Audit Committee’s business has included the 
following items:
 — review of the financial statements and announcements relating to 
the financial performance and governance of the Group at year end 
and half year;
 — principal judgemental accounting matters affecting the Group based 
on reports from both the Group’s management and the external auditor;
 — external audit plans and reports;
 — review of the adequacy and the effectiveness of the Group’s ongoing 
risk management systems and processes, through risk and assurance 
plans and reports, including:
 — store assurance audit reports;
 — internal financial control assessments;
 — fraud and loss prevention;
 — revenue protection; and
 — risk assessment;
 — information security and business continuity;
 — whistleblower reports;
 — store assurance team effectiveness and independence;
 — external audit effectiveness, independence and re-appointment 
in conjunction with audit tendering;
 — anti-bribery and corruption procedures; and
 — specific investigations as required.

Financial reporting and significant 
financial judgements 
The Committee assesses whether suitable accounting policies 
have been adopted and whether management has made appropriate 
estimates and judgements. The Committee reviews accounting papers 
prepared by management which provide details on the main financial 
reporting judgements. 
The Committee also reviews reports by the external auditor on the 
full year and half year results which highlight any issues with respect 
to the work undertaken on the year-end audit and half year review.
The Committee pays particular attention to matters it considers 
to be important by virtue of their impact on the Group’s results 
and remuneration, and particularly those which involve a high 
level of complexity, judgement or estimation by management.
Property valuations – The key area of judgement that the Committee 
considered in reviewing the financial statements was the valuation of the 
investment property portfolio. Whilst this is conducted by independent 
external valuers, it is one of the key components of the financial results 
and is inherently complex and subject to a high degree of judgement. 
As well as detailed management procedures and reviews of the process, 
members of the Committee met the Group’s valuers to discuss the 
valuations, review the key judgements and discuss whether there 
were any significant disagreements with management. The Committee 
reviewed and challenged the assumptions with the valuers in order to 
agree and conclude on the appropriateness of the assumptions applied. 
The Board considered the valuation in detail at its meeting to approve 
the financial statements.
Financial statements – The Committee considered and was satisfied 
with management’s presentation of the financial statements. 
Management confirmed to the Committee that it was not aware of any 
material misstatements and the auditor confirmed that it had found no 
material misstatements during the course of its work. The Committee 
is satisfied that the judgements made by management are reasonable 
and that appropriate disclosures have been included in the accounts.
After reviewing the reports from management and following its discussions 
with the valuers and auditor, the Committee is satisfied that the financial 
statements appropriately address the critical judgements and key estimates, 
both in respect of the amounts reported and the disclosures. The Committee 
is also satisfied that the processes used for determining the value of the 
assets and liabilities have been appropriately reviewed and challenged 
and are sufficiently robust.
At the request of the Board, the Committee also considered whether 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements was fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether it provided the necessary information 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The Committee is satisfied that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report and Financial Statements is fair, balanced 
and understandable. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee 
considered the overall review and confirmation process around 
the Annual Report and Financial Statements, going concern 
and viability.
The Committee was provided with, and commented on, a draft copy 
of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. In carrying out the 
above processes, key considerations included ensuring that there was 
consistency between the accounts and the narrative provided in the 
front half of the Annual Report, and that the programme of corporate 
reporting reviews focused on the balance between the reporting of 
weaknesses, difficulties and challenges, as well as successes, in an 
open and honest manner. The Committee is satisfied that alternative 
performance measures, not defined under IFRS or “non-GAAP” 
measures, are consistent with how management measures 
and judges the Group’s financial performance.
External auditor
During the year the Committee received and reviewed audit plans 
and reports from the external auditor. It is standard practice for 
the external auditor to meet privately with the Audit Committee, 
without any member of management or the Executive Directors being 
present, at each Audit Committee meeting. The Audit Committee 
has responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditor. Following an 
audit tender, Deloitte LLP was appointed auditor for the Group 
in September 2014 and re-appointed at the subsequent 
Annual General Meetings in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
Audit tendering
This has been Deloitte’s fourth year as the Company’s external auditor 
following the formal tender process conducted in 2014. There are no 
contractual obligations that restrict the choice of external auditor. The 
Committee confirms that Safestore has complied with the Statutory 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Responsibilities) Order 2014 
with regard to the requirement for formal tendering every ten years.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
To assess the effectiveness of the external audit process, the auditor 
is asked on an annual basis to articulate the steps that it has taken 
to ensure objectivity and independence, including where the auditor 
provides non-audit services. The Committee monitors the auditor’s 
performance, behaviour and effectiveness during the exercise of its 
duties, which informs the Audit Committee’s decision to recommend 
re-appointment on an annual basis.
External auditor independence and non-audit services
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference set out that it is responsible 
for the formal policy on the award of non-audit work to the auditor. 
The Committee has formalised procedures for the approval of non-audit 
services which stipulate the services for which the auditor will not be 
used. The policy also stipulates projects where the auditor may be used 
subject to certain conditions and pre-approval requirements. In order 
to preserve auditor objectivity and independence, the external auditor 
is not asked to provide consulting or advisory services unless this is 
in the best interests of the Company. A report of all audit and non-audit 
fees payable to the external auditor is provided to the Committee twice 
a year, including both actual fees for the year to date and a forecast for 
the full year, analysed by project and into pre-defined categories. In 
the current financial year, Deloitte LLP provided services of £102,000. 
It was determined that the nature of the work would not impact auditor 
objectivity and independence given the safeguards in place.
Deloitte was first appointed to conduct the audit for the 2014 financial 
year. In accordance with regulatory requirements, the lead audit partner, 
Mark Beddy, is required to change after five years and this would normally 
take place after the conclusion of the 2018 audit. However, the Committee 
has been advised that the lead audit partner will retire following the 2017 
audit, so a new lead audit partner is expected to be appointed in advance 
of the 2018 audit.
As part of the 2017 audit, Deloitte confirmed that it was independent within 
the meaning of applicable regulatory and professional requirements. Taking 
this into account, and having considered the steps taken by Deloitte to 
preserve its independence, the Committee concluded that Deloitte’s 
independence had not been compromised notwithstanding the level 
of non-audit fees incurred during the year.

Directors’ remuneration report
for the year ended 31 October 2017
PART A: ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the report on Directors’ 
remuneration for 2017. Similar to 2016, this year’s report is structured in 
four parts including an at a glance section which provides a summary of 
our remuneration policy (the “policy”), key 2017 Company performance 
highlights and the linkage to the remuneration outcomes for the year. 
The Remuneration Committee (“Committee”) has spent a significant 
amount of time during 2017 engaging with our shareholders around 
our new remuneration policy. We withdrew the resolutions relating to 
the proposed remuneration policy and new long term incentive, which 
was set out in last year’s Directors’ remuneration report, ahead of our 
2017 AGM given feedback from some of our shareholders, in order to 
engage in further consultation around this matter. Following substantive 
changes to both the policy and LTIP, we received marginal support from 
shareholders at the July EGM. I was disappointed with this result as 
both I and your Board strongly believe that the proposed remuneration 
structure, which is designed to break away from the conventional 
model and drive exceptional corporate performance from our talented 
management team over the next five years, is in the best interests of 
all stakeholders. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the 
shareholders who have supported our proposals, as well as all of those 
who have engaged with us and put considerable time and effort into 
analysing and providing feedback on our proposals.
Throughout the year the Committee has also followed the debate 
around the fairness of pay with great interest, and I would like to 
reassure you that this reinforces our approach and that the new 
remuneration structure should apply to a wide group of employees 
and not just the Executive Directors. The new structure has enabled 
a large number of key employees to share in the future success of 
the Company and work together with a common goal of driving 
value for shareholders. 
Additionally, the Committee has implemented a number of the 
commitments made throughout the engagement process to limit 
fixed pay and ensure alignment with best practice:
 — We committed to maintaining salary and benefits at conservative levels 
and we have integrated this element into the new remuneration policy 
by committing to only increase the Executive Director salaries in line 
with the wider workforce. The salary levels for our Executive Directors 
continue to be highly conservative against the market.
 — We have reduced Executive Directors’ maximum pension contribution 
from 20% to 10% of salary to ensure better alignment with the 
wider workforce.
 — We committed to a higher level of transparency around bonus targets 
and we have provided a thorough explanation of the assessment 
of the strategic and operational element of the bonus outcome 
for the year (please see pages 54 to 56). 
 — We committed to following best practice and introduced annual bonus 
share deferral as set out in the Investment Association guidelines;
 — We have granted the awards under the new LTIP arrangement to 
the Executive Directors and a wider group than first anticipated 
of circa 55 key individuals.
 — Finally, we pledged to enhance the alignment of interests of 
management and shareholders, and as such have increased 
shareholding requirements to 1,000% of salary for the CEO 
and 350% for the CFO.
Business context
You will have read earlier in this Annual Report that the Company 
delivered strong results for 2017 with:
 — Group revenues up 12.6% for 2017;
 — underlying EBITDA up 13.6% for 2017; 
 — cash tax adjusted earnings per share up 17.7% for 2017;
 — Adjusted Diluted EPRA earnings per share up 17.2% for 2017;
 — completion of the acquisition of the twelve-store Alligator portfolio on 
1 November 2017 and the opening of two new stores; and
 — Space Maker integration completed.
The results for 2017 are a continuation of the strong performance of the 
business since 2013, when the current team took over the management 
of Safestore. From 2013 to the current date, shareholders have 
benefitted from an increase in total shareholder return of circa 290% 
and significant outperformance of industry benchmarks as shown in the 
graph on page 45.

2017 remuneration outcomes
In line with the policy, the Committee has fully reflected corporate 
performance in assessing remuneration outcomes for 2017 such 
that there is a demonstrable link between pay and performance as 
set out below:
 — Executive Directors salaries will be reviewed in 2018 and will not 
exceed the increases awarded to the wider workforce for the 
three-year duration of the remuneration policy. 
 — Executive Directors will receive annual bonus payments of 122% 
of salary (82% of maximum) for 2017. In line with the payout 
schedule, the EBITDA element contributed a payout of 35% of 
maximum, whilst the Committee determined that 33% and 14% 
of maximum were achieved by the Executive Directors under the 
strategic and personal elements. In line with the new policy, the 
Executive Directors will receive a cash bonus of 100% of salary 
and a deferred share award of 22% of salary.
 — The 2014 PSP awards vested in full during the year.
 — The EPS element of the 2015 PSP awards will vest in full 
on 28 January 2018 (for the end of the performance period of 
31 October 2017) and it is anticipated based on current performance 
that the relative TSR element will vest in full in February 2018. 
Over the three-year performance period the Company achieved 
79% EPS growth (compared with a maximum performance 
level of 62% growth). 
In our assessment, overall remuneration for 2017 represents a balanced 
outcome and is aligned with Company performance. We believe the newly 
implemented remuneration policy, together with our clear remuneration 
strategy, will continue to ensure this remains true throughout the period 
of the delivery of the five-year strategy of the business.
Summary 
My goal has been to be thoughtful and clear in the layout of the 
Directors’ remuneration report. I hope that you find the information 
helpful and I look forward to your support on the advisory vote on the 
2017 Annual report on remuneration at the Company’s upcoming AGM. We 
are committed to listening, and take an active interest in, your views 
as shareholders. If you would like to discuss any further aspect of our 
remuneration strategy or disclosure and transparency in this area, I would 
welcome your views. I can be contacted via the Company Secretary, 
Sam Ahmed at SAhmed@safestore.co.uk.

Performance since new management team appointed
The results for 2017 are a continuation of the strong performance of the business since 2013, when the current team took over the management 
of Safestore. From 2013 to the current date, shareholders have benefitted from an increase in total shareholder return of circa 290% and significant 
outperformance of industry benchmarks as shown in the graph below. 
(iii) Outcomes for 2017
Below we summarise the targets and their outcomes for both Frederic Vecchioli and Andy Jones for the 2017 annual bonus and the 2015 PSP 
awards whose performance period was substantially completed in 2017.
2017 annual bonus assessment: 
At the start of the 2017 financial year, we set stretching performance targets for the annual bonus plan. The table below summarises the 
achievement of these targets (please see pages 54 to 56 for more detail).
Measure (weighting) Target Actual % of max achieved
Adjusted EBITDA before non-recurring items (53%) £71.4m £71.1m 35%
Strategic/operational measures (33%) — — 33%
Personal (14%) — — 14%
Overall 82%
Based on an assessment against the 2017 bonus scorecard, the Committee determined that Frederic Vecchioli would receive a bonus of £489,349 
(82% of maximum) and Andy Jones would receive £348,661 (82% of maximum). In line with the approved Directors’ remuneration policy any bonus 
payment above 100% of salary will be deferred into shares for two years.
2015 PSP award vesting
Measure (weighting) Performance range Actual % of max achieved
PBT-EPS growth (67%) 3%+RPI – 8%+RPI p.a. 100% p.a. 67%
Relative TSR vs FTSE Small Cap (33%) Median – upper quartile Expect above upper quartile 33%
Overall 100%
Based on an assessment against the 2015 PSP award performance measures, the Committee envisaged that the award would vest in full. Based 
on the average share price over the three months to 31 October 2017, this provided a value of £634,330 for Frederic Vecchioli and £497,707 for 
Andy Jones.

PART C: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
The Directors’ remuneration policy set out on the following pages was approved by shareholders at a General Meeting on 25 July 2017. 
The information on the following pages is largely replicated however some information such as the illustration of policy has been updated for 
the latest information. The Directors’ remuneration policy as approved can be found in the General Meeting Notice on the Company’s website 
www.safestore.co.uk.
The Committee has established the policy on the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Chairman. The Board has established the policy 
on the remuneration of the other Non-Executive Directors. Awards granted under the previous Directors’ remuneration policy will be honoured.
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy
The Directors’ remuneration policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board recognises 
that the Directors’ remuneration is of legitimate concern to shareholders and is committed to following current best practice. The Group operates within a 
competitive environment; performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and employees and the Group believes in rewarding 
exceptional performance.
When setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee endeavours to ensure that all Directors are provided with appropriate performance related 
and non-performance related pay to encourage enhanced performance and that they are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual 
contributions to the success of the Group. 
The Committee believes that the Directors’ remuneration policy below will support and motivate our Executive Directors in furthering the Group’s long term 
strategic objectives, including the creation of sustainable shareholder returns. Furthermore, the Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure 
of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivise undue risk taking or reward underperformance.

Normally reviewed annually 
with any changes taking 
effect from 1 May.
Salaries are paid monthly.
When determining the 
salary of an Executive, 
the Committee takes into 
consideration:
 — the individual Director’s 
experience and 
responsibilities;
 — the performance of 
the individual Director;
 — the performance of 
the Group; and
 — pay and conditions 
throughout the Group.
Levels of base salary are 
reviewed periodically against 
companies of a comparable 
size in both the Real Estate 
sector and the FTSE 250.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual basic 
salary increase, however, 
the increase in salary of the 
CEO or CFO will not be 
more than the increase of 
the general workforce for 
the duration of the policy.
Current salary levels are

individual and business 
performance is used as

 — strategic/operational 
measures; and
 — personal objectives.
The Committee has the 
discretion to adjust targets 
or performance conditions 
for any exceptional events 
that may occur during the 
year. As well as determining 
the measures and targets, 
the Committee will also 
determine the weighting 
of the various measures to 
ensure that they support 
the business strategy 
and objectives for the 
relevant year. 
Malus (up to vesting) and 
clawback (three years post 
vesting) provisions operate

corporate governance. 
Further details on the 
measures for 2017 are 
set out in the Annual 
report on remuneration 
on pages 54 to 56.
Strategic and operational 
measures have been

and to support the five-year 
financial targets of the 
new LTIP .
The maximum bonus 
opportunity has increased 
from 100% to 150% and 
was adjusted to ensure that 
levels are competitive against 
the market and reflective of 
the Company’s current value.
Deferral has been introduced 
to provide further alignment 
with shareholders during the 
five-year period prior to the 
LTIP vesting and underpins 
the one off nature of the LTIP . 
Any amount earned under 
the increased award level 
will be deferred into shares.

Long Term Incentive Plan
Incentivises Directors to

business plan and deliver 
long term sustainable value 
for shareholders.
One off equity grant made 
following the 2017 EGM 
with vesting dependent 
on the achievement of 
demanding performance 
conditions over a 
five-year period.
Awards will be made to 
participants expressed as 
a fixed number of shares.
Participants will be entitled 
to receive any dividends 
paid on vested shares 
during the vesting period. 
This benefit is delivered 
in the form of cash or 
additional shares at the 
time that award vests.
The total equity award for 
all participants is equal to 
3.25% of the current share 
capital with circa 1.6% for 
Executive Directors. 
The CEO was granted an 
award over 2m shares and 
the CFO was granted an 
award over 1.34m shares 
in September 2017.
Awards vest based 
on performance against 
stretching targets, 
measured over a five-year 
performance period. 
The performance measures 
and weightings are as follows:
 — Adjusted Diluted 
EPRA EPS growth 
(2/3 weighting);
 — relative TSR 
versus FTSE 250 
(1/6 weighting); and
 — relative TSR versus 
FTSE Real Estate Index 
(1/6 weighting).
In addition, no award will 
vest unless a minimum level 
of cash on cash return 
(“CoCR”) of 8% p.a. has 
been achieved. 
Malus (up to vesting) and 
clawback (three years post 
vesting) provisions operate. 
Further details on the 
performance measures are 
set out in the Annual report 
on remuneration on pages 
56 and 57.
The previous LTIP was 
structured as an annual 
rolling market standard 
long term incentive plan. 
This has been replaced 
with the simplified one off 
equity award, under which 
management will be provided 
with an opportunity to earn 
a fixed level of equity which 
is directly aligned with the 
delivery of the business 
strategy over the next 
five years.
The LTIP ensures that 
the Committee has a 
tool in place with which 
to incentivise the Executive 
Directors to execute the 
long term business plan 
and ultimately deliver 
long term sustainable 
value for shareholders. 
The extended five-year 
performance period will 
ensure a further lock-in 
period and an alignment 
between the interest 
of management and 
shareholders. Under the new 
LTIP an increased number of 
key senior employees have 
been invited to participate 
on the same terms as the 
Executive Directors but 
at lower award levels.
All-employee Sharesave scheme
Encourages long term 
shareholding in the 
Company by all employees.

Share ownership
To ensure that Executive 
Directors’ interests are 
aligned with those of 
shareholders over a longer 
time horizon.
Executive Directors are 
encouraged to build up 
their shareholding over 
a five-year period.
Executive Directors would 
be expected to retain any 
shares vesting (post-tax) 
under inflight awards and 
the proposed deferred 
bonus until they have 
acquired the necessary 
shares to meet their 
requirement.
Deferred, vested and 
beneficially owned shares 
would count towards the 
shareholding requirements. 
For current Executive 
Directors:
 — CEO: 1,000% of salary
 — CFO: 350% of salary
For any new recruits, 
the guideline level of 
shareholding would be 
500% for the CEO and 
350% for the CFO.
The level of shareholding 
will be tested five years 
from the date of approval 
of this remuneration policy 
or appointment if later.
No performance or recovery 
provisions applicable.
The shareholding 
ownership requirements 
have been increased 
from 100% of salary. 
The Committee considers 
that higher shareholder 
requirements ensure 
a long term alignment 
between the shareholders 
and management in light 
of the higher quantum of 
equity awards.
Discretion within the Directors’ remuneration policy
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative 
discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders. 
Legacy awards 
The Committee reserves the right to honour any historic awards that were granted under any previous share schemes operated by the Company 
but remain outstanding, notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of the payment or award were 
agreed before the new policy came into effect. Such payments or awards will be set out in the Annual report on remuneration in the relevant year.
Performance measures and targets 
The table below sets out the rationale for performance measures chosen in respect of the annual bonus and LTIP. 
Performance measures Rationale How targets are set
Annual bonus 
 — EBITDA growth (53%);
 — strategic/operational measures (33%); and
 — personal objectives (14%).
The combined use of financial, strategic 
and operational measures provides a holistic 
assessment of corporate performance and 
allows for the Company to focus annually on 
targets that work towards the delivery of the 
five-year financial measures under the LTIP .
The use of personal objectives allows for the 
tailoring of the annual bonus to each participant 
and ensures there is an element of payout that 
is assessed on specific measures which reflect 
successful performance of the individual in their 
roles as well as the Company.
The performance targets are determined annually 
by the appropriate line manager and calibrated 
by the Committee taking into account the 
Company’s business plan, market conditions and 
internal and external forecasts.
Targets are calibrated to reflect the Committee’s 
assessment of good to exceptional performance.
LTIP
 — Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS growth 
(2/3 weighting);
 — relative TSR vs FTSE 250 
(excluding investment trusts) 
(1/6 weighting); and
 — relative TSR vs FTSE Real Estate Index 
(1/6 weighting).
EPS is considered to be the most appropriate 
measure for aligning the interests of the 
Executive Directors with those of shareholders 
and is also an established measure of 
Safestore’ s long term sustainable profitability. 
Relative TSR performance measured against two 
peer groups (FTSE 250 and FTSE Real Estate 
Index) provides a balanced approach, recognising 
returns to shareholders against the broader market, 
whilst also ensuring performance is competitive 
against other real estate companies.
Targets have been calibrated to reflect the 
Committee’s assessment of good to exceptional 
performance, taking into account internal 
budgets and the current economic environment.
EPS targets were set by reference to the Company’ s 
business plan and market conditions and 
consideration is also given to external forecasts.
Relative TSR targets were determined 
taking into account the comparative market 
returns and the expected level of returns for 
Safestore’s shareholders.  Governance

PART C: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY continued
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy continued
Performance measures and targets continued
The Committee is of the opinion that disclosing precise targets for the annual bonus in advance would not be in shareholders’ interests. Except in 
circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at the end 
of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Comparison with other employees
All employees receive base salary, benefits and pension, and are eligible to participate in the Company’s Sharesave scheme. The Sharesave 
scheme gives all employees the opportunity to become shareholders in Safestore through the acquisition of shares (up to a limit) at a discount 
to the market price.
For below Board-level employees, Safestore operates a range of bonus plans appropriate to the various areas of its business with opportunity 
levels linked to seniority and role. 
Under the new LTIP an increased number of circa 55 key employees have been invited to participate allowing them to share in the success 
of the Company. The performance conditions for below Board-level employees in the LTIP are the same as those for the Executive Directors.
Any differences in an individual’s reward package is reflective of an individual’s location, seniority and level of responsibility. 
As part of the new remuneration policy, the Committee set out that Executive Directors’ salary increases would be in line with those of the 
wider workforce.
Reward scenarios 
The charts below seek to demonstrate how pay varies with performance for the Executive Directors based on the stated policy. The charts show 
an estimate of the remuneration that could be received by Executive Directors under the policy set out in this report. Each of the bars is broken 
down to show how the total under each scenario is made up of fixed elements of remuneration, the annual bonus and the LTIP. The charts 
indicate that a significant proportion of both target and maximum pay is performance related.

1  LTIP values are based on the annualised value of the shares awarded (i.e. 1/5th of the individual maximum shares granted) as at the grant date of 29 September 2017. The share price as at 
29 September 2017 was 436.7 pence. No share price growth has been factored into the calculation.
2 Dividend equivalents have not been added to the deferred share bonus and LTIP share awards.
Approach to recruitment and promotions
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience 
needed for the role. The remuneration package for any new recruit would be assessed following the same principles as for the Executive Directors and 
would be set in accordance with the terms of the Company’s prevailing approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account 
the skills and experience of the individual, the market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
 — Salary levels will take into account the individual’s experience, market data for the relevant role, internal relativities and their current base salary. 
Where an individual is recruited at below market norms, they may be realigned over time, subject to performance in the role.
 — Benefits and pension will be in accordance with the remuneration policy. 
 — Annual bonus will operate in line with the remuneration policy with the maximum opportunity set at 150% of salary. 
 — LTIP will operate in line with the remuneration policy. The amount of shares granted will be reflective of the role and where appropriate will be 
time apportioned for the time remaining until the end of the five-year period versus the total five-year period. The maximum award granted will 
be no more than 500% of salary.
The maximum variable remuneration will be the total of the annual bonus opportunity and grant of shares under the LTIP.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above will apply from the date of promotion but there would be no 
retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing elements of 
the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the employee. These would 
be disclosed to shareholders in the following year’s Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee does not have an automatic policy to buy out subsisting incentives granted by an Executive’s previous employer and which would 
be forfeited on cessation. Should, however, the Committee determine that it is appropriate to do so, the Committee may consider buying out 
incentive awards which an individual would forfeit upon leaving their current employer, although any compensation would, where possible, be 
consistent with respect to currency (i.e. cash for cash, equity for equity), vesting periods (i.e. there would be no acceleration of payments), expected 
values and the use of performance targets. The Committee may then grant up to the same expected values where possible under the Company’s 
incentive plans, subject to the annual limits under these plans. It does, however, retain the discretion to provide the expected value under specific 
arrangements in relation to the recruitment of the particular individual.
In instances where the new Executive is relocated from one work location to another, the Company will provide compensation to reflect the cost of 
relocation for the Executive in cases where they are expected to spend significant time away from their home location in accordance with its normal 
relocation package for employees. The level of the relocation package will be assessed on a case-by-case basis but may take into consideration 
any cost of living differences, housing allowance and schooling in accordance with the Company’s normal relocation package for employees.
If appropriate the Committee may agree on recruitment of a new Executive with a notice period in excess of twelve months, but to reduce this to 
twelve months over a specified period.
Service contracts for Executive Directors 
The service agreements of the Executive Directors are not fixed term and are terminable by either the Company or the Director on the following bases:
Director Date of current service contract Notice period
F Vecchioli 3 September 2013 12 months
A Jones 29 January 2013 12 months
When setting notice periods, the Committee has regard to market practice and corporate governance best practice. All service contracts are 
available for viewing at the Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
The Board allows Executive Directors to accept appropriate outside commercial non-executive director appointments provided the aggregate 
commitment is compatible with their duties as Executive Directors. The Executive Directors concerned may retain fees paid for these services, 
which will be subject to approval by the Board.  Governance

PART C: DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY continued
Payment for loss of office
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing Director the Committee will always seek to minimise cost to the Company whilst 
complying with the contractual terms and seeking to reflect the circumstances in place at the time. The Committee reserves the right to make 
additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach 
of such an obligation), or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s 
office or employment. 
With regard to salary, benefits and pension, there will be no compensation for normal resignation or in the event of termination by the Company due 
to misconduct. In other circumstances, Executive Directors will be entitled to receive payment in lieu of notice. A summary of the main contractual 
terms in relation to annual bonus and LTIP are set out below:
Cessation of employment Change of control
Annual bonus
 — Where a participant’s employment is terminated after the end of a 
performance year but before the payment is made, the participant 
may remain eligible for a bonus award for that performance year 
subject to an assessment of the performance targets over the 
period. Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully 
in cash. No award will be made in these circumstances in the event 
of gross misconduct.
 — If the participant is a good leaver during the performance year, a 
bonus will normally be paid in cash at the end of the year pro-rated 
for length of service and the achievement of performance targets 
measured over the full year. Any unvested deferred share bonus 
awards will vest on the normal vesting date.
 — The Committee has the discretion to determine that a bonus award 
may be paid in cash at the date of cessation, and/or that deferred 
share bonus awards will vest early, and/or in exceptional circumstances 
whether to pro-rate the award for time served as an employee.
 — A “good leaver” is defined as a participant ceasing to be in 
employment by reason of death, ill health, injury, disability, 
redundancy, retirement, the Company employing the participant 
ceasing to be a member of the Group, the participant’s employing 
business being sold out of the Group or at the Committee’s discretion.
 — Anyone who is not a good leaver will be a “bad leaver”. For a bad 
leaver, there will be no cash bonus payout for the year in which they 
leave and any unvested deferred share bonus awards will lapse.
 — The participant will receive the annual bonus in cash immediately 
prior to the date of the change of control. 
 — The level of cash payment will be determined by the Committee at 
its discretion by reference to the time elapsed from the start of the 
performance year to the change of control date and the performance 
levels achieved as at the date of the change of control (where applicable).
 — The Committee has the discretion to determine, in exceptional 
circumstances, whether to pro-rate the award for time served as 
an employee.
 — Any unvested deferred bonus shares will also vest immediately prior 
to a change of control.
 — In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, the 
Remuneration Committee may decide (with the consent of the 
acquiring company) to replace unvested deferred awards with 
equivalent new awards over shares in the acquiring company.
LTIP 
 — For good leavers, unvested awards will vest on the normal vesting date 
subject to (i) the extent any applicable performance targets have been 
satisfied at the end of the normal performance period and (ii) pro-rating 
to reflect the period of time between grant and cessation of 
employment as a proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed. 
 — The Committee has the discretion to determine that the end of the 
performance period is the date of cessation and whether to pro-rate 
the number of vested awards to reflect the vesting period completed.
 — A “good leaver” is defined as a participant ceasing to be in employment 
by reason of death, injury, ill health, disability, redundancy, retirement, 
the Company employing the participant ceasing to be a member of the 
Group, the participant’s employing business being transferred to a 
person who is not a Group member, or any other reason at the 
Committee’s discretion. 
 — Anyone who is not a good leaver will be a “bad leaver”. Bad leavers will 
forfeit all unvested awards.
 — On a change in control, the Committee will determine the level 
of vesting taking into account: (i) the extent that any applicable 
performance targets have been satisfied at that time; (ii) the bid 
consideration received; and (iii) the portion of the vesting period that 
has then elapsed. Options must then be exercised within one month, 
otherwise they will lapse.
 — In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, the Committee 
may decide to replace unvested awards with equivalent new awards 
over shares in the acquiring company. Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Non-Executive Directors and letters of appointment
The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chairman whose remuneration is 
determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board. 
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for Non-Executive Directors.
Strategic link Operation Maximum Performance targets and recovery provisions
To provide compensation that 
attracts high calibre individuals 
and reflects their experience 
and knowledge.
Non-Executive Directors may receive 
a base fee and additional fees for the 
role of Senior Independent Director 
or Chairmanship of a Committee.
Fees are reviewed annually with 
any changes generally effective 
from 1 May. 
Non-Executive Directors also 
receive reimbursement of 
reasonable expenses (and any tax 
thereon) incurred undertaking their 
duties and/or Company business.
Non-Executive Directors do not 
receive any variable remuneration 
element or pension contribution but 
may receive benefits if determined 
appropriate to the role. 
Any increases in fees will be 
determined based on time 
commitment and take into 
consideration level of responsibility 
and fees paid in other companies 
of comparable size and complexity. 
Where made, any increase in Non-
Executive Director fees will generally 
be in line with the increase awarded 
to the wider workforce; however, the 
increase may be higher to reflect any 
changes to time commitments or 
responsibilities.
No performance or recovery 
provisions applicable.
Letters of appointment
The Group’s policy is to appoint Non-Executive Directors to the Board with a breadth of skills and experience that is relevant to the Group’s business. 
Appointments are made by the Board upon the recommendations and advice from the Nomination Committee.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment. Each Non-Executive Director is subject 
to an initial three-year term followed by annual re-election at the Company’s AGM. The table below sets out the dates that each Non-Executive Director 
was first appointed.

No compensation is payable in the event of early termination apart from the notice period. All letters of appointment are available for viewing at the 
Company’s registered office and at the AGM.
Consideration of employee remuneration and shareholders
All-employee remuneration
In setting the remuneration policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees are taken into account, including any base salary 
increases awarded. The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors 
and uses this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company. 
The Committee has not expressly sought the views of employees and no remuneration comparison measurements were used when drawing 
up the Directors’ remuneration policy. Through the Board, however, the Committee is updated as to employee views on remuneration generally.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee has spent a significant amount of time during 2017 engaging with our shareholders around our new remuneration policy. 
Please see page 62, which sets out the changes to our remuneration policy made in response to shareholder feedback.  Governance

Service improvements — Significant improvement in reporting efficiency and tighter control over the cost base, cash flow 
management, risk management and controls.
The Committee felt that the strategic and operational objectives had been achieved in full and that both Executive Directors had fully met their personal 
objectives and approved 100% payout for these elements of the bonus. The achievement of the 2017 strategic, operational and personal targets will 
be taken into account when setting next year’s budget, as determined by the Board, and will therefore be reflected in future EBITDA targets.
The Committee has reviewed the overall bonus outcomes against corporate performance and believe that the bonus payout (82% of maximum payable) 
is commensurate with the shareholder experience in 2017 . No discretion was exercised by the Committee when determining the bonus outcomes.

2 No TSR portion of awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the TSR performance of the Group is reflective of the Group’s underlying performance.
3  Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss for the period after tax but excluding corporate 
transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of 
exceptional items, IFRS 2 share-based payment charges, exceptional tax items, and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost 
is excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). Therefore neither the Company’s ability to 
distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). The financial statements will disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and 
Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full reconciliation of the differences in the financial year in which any LTIP awards may vest.
Additionally, the LTIP includes a bespoke cash on cash return (“CoCR”) which will be tested at the end of the five-year performance period. This is 
defined as underlying EBITDA after leasehold rents divided by the original cost of investments. No awards will vest if the Company’s CoCR over the 
five-year performance period is below 8% per annum.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
for the year ended 31 October 2017
PART D: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued
Implementation of the Remuneration policy for the year ending 31 October 2018
Base salary
Base salary is determined by reference to the individual’s experience, performance, responsibility and pay levels across the Group more generally. 
In addition, the Committee periodically reviews base salary levels within similarly sized listed real estate and FTSE 250 companies, although the 
Committee is careful not to place excessive reliance on the use of external comparator analysis. Current base salary levels for Executive Directors 
are presented below:
Base
salary
F Vecchioli £400,000
A Jones £285,000
The next salary review will be effective from 1 May 2018. The increases in Executive Director salaries will not exceed the raises awarded to the wider 
workforce for the three-year duration of the remuneration policy.
Benefits
Taxable benefits provided will continue to include a car allowance and life, private medical and dental insurance. Benefits in kind are not pensionable 
and are not taken into account when determining basic salary for performance related remuneration. 
Pension
The Group will contribute 10% of basic salary for the pension arrangements of the Executive Directors. The maximum contribution under the policy 
has been reduced to 10% of salary from 20% of salary to reflect the standard annual contribution levels of 10%. 
Annual bonus
Consistent with the new policy the maximum bonus will be 150% of salary for each Executive Director. Any bonus in excess of 100% of salary will 
be deferred into shares which will vest at the end of two years following the financial year in which the bonus is earned. For the 2017 financial year, 
the bonus will be based on the following performance measures:
Performance measures
Provisional 
weighting
Adjusted EBITDA 53%
Operational/strategic 33%
Personal 14%
Total 100%
The Committee is of the opinion that disclosing precise targets for the annual bonus in advance would not be in shareholders’ interests. Except 
in circumstances where elements remain commercially sensitive, actual targets, performance achieved and awards made will be published at 
the end of the performance periods so shareholders can fully assess the basis for any payouts.
Long term incentives 
No further LTIP grants will be made under the current remuneration policy. The details of the one off LTIP awards made in 2017 are set out 
on page 57 of the annual report on remuneration.  Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report

Considerations by the Committee of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration for 2016
The Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the senior management and 
for setting the remuneration packages for each Executive Director. The Committee also has oversight of the remuneration policy for all employees. 
The written terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company’s website and from the Company on request.
Members of the Committee during 2017 Independent 
Number of 
meetings held

Number of
meetings 
attended
C Balmforth (Chairman) Yes 12 12
I S Krieger Yes 12 12
J L Kenrick Yes 12 12
B Oliver Yes 12 12
During the year, there were twelve Committee meetings. A large portion of the Committee’s time during the year was spent in relation to the remuneration 
and LTIP review and engagement with shareholders. Other matters covered at each meeting include salary decisions for 2017, annual bonus and 
PSP outturns for 2017 and long term incentive award operation.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders) in the decisions made by the Committee, conflicts 
of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. 
The Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the HR Director may attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee, 
but are not present when their own remuneration outcomes are being discussed. The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to the Committee.
The Committee received external advice in 2017 from PwC in connection with remuneration matters including the provision of general guidance on market 
and best practice. PwC is considered by the Committee to be objective and independent. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group 
and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee reviewed 
the nature of all the services provided during the year by PwC and was satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the provision of 
these services. 
The total fees paid to PwC in respect of services to the Committee during the year were £115,000. Fees were determined based on the scope 
and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
Shareholder voting
The table below shows the results of the latest shareholder votes on the Directors’ remuneration report and policy resolutions:
Votes for % Votes against % Votes withheld
2017 GM vote on annual report on remuneration 77,550,007 50.83 75,030,203 49.17 17,087,197
2016 AGM vote on annual report on remuneration 141,900,265 97.28 3,964,713 2.72 9,387,669
2014 AGM vote on Directors’ remuneration policy 160,763,590 94.48 9,376,570 5.51 75,087
The Committee spent a significant amount of time during 2017 engaging with shareholders around our new remuneration policy. As outlined in the 
associated RNS announcement, we withdrew the resolutions relating to the proposed remuneration policy and new long term incentive, which 
was set out in last year’s Director remuneration report, at our 2017 AGM given feedback from some of our shareholders in order to engage 
in further consultation around this matter. 
As a result, we made substantive changes to the policy and LTIP which included:
 — a 20% reduction in LTIP quantum for Executive Directors;
 — an increased stretch in the LTIP EPS target range;
 — a commitment to maintaining salary and benefits at conservative levels; and
 — a reduction in the maximum pension contribution from 20% to 10% of salary.
Following these changes to both the policy and LTIP as set out above, we received marginal support from shareholders at the July EGM for 
both the new policy and the associated LTIP. Our response to the vote was outlined in the Company Chairman’s statement included in the RNS 
announcement disclosing the EGM results. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the shareholders who have supported our proposals, 
as well as all of those who have engaged with us and put considerable time and effort into analysing and providing feedback on our proposals.
Going forward, to ensure transparency in the implementation of the new policy, we have improved disclosures in the annual report on remuneration, 
with particular focus on bonus targets which support our short term strategic priorities and how in year performance supports remuneration outcomes. 
The Committee are committed to listening, and take an active interest in, your views as shareholders and continue to engage on remuneration 
on an ongoing basis.

statements for the year ended 31 October 2017. References to Safestore, 
“the Group”, “the Company”, “we” or “our” are to Safestore Holdings plc, 
and its subsidiary companies where appropriate.
Strategic report
A review of the development of the Group’s business during the year, 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group and its future 
prospects are included in the Chairman’s statement and the strategic 
report, which should be read in conjunction with this report.
Results for the year and dividends
The results for the year ended 31 October 2017 are set out in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 72.
An interim dividend of 4.20 pence (FY2016: 3.60 pence) was paid on 
18 August 2017 and this included a property income dividend (“PID”) 
of 2.10 pence (FY2016: 1.80 pence). The Directors recommend a final 
dividend in respect of the year ended 31 October 2017 of 9.80 pence 
per ordinary share (FY2016: 8.05 pence). The PID element of the final 
dividend will be 9.80 pence (FY2016: 8.05 pence). If authorised at 
the 2018 AGM, the dividend will be paid on 6 April 2018 to members 
on the register on 9 March 2018.
The PID will be paid after the deduction of withholding tax at the basic 
rate (currently 20%). However, certain categories of shareholder may 
be entitled to receive payment of a gross PID if they are UK resident 
companies, UK public bodies, UK pension funds and managers of ISAs, 
PEPs and child trust funds. Information, together with the relevant forms 
which must be completed and submitted to the Company’s Registrar, 
for shareholders who are eligible to receive gross PIDs, is available in

dividend is not subject to withholding tax.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors of Safestore are confident that, 
on the basis of current financial projections and facilities available and 
after considering sensitivities, the Group has sufficient resources for 
its operational needs and to enable the Group to remain in compliance 
with the financial covenants in its bank facilities for the foreseeable 
future, a period of not less than twelve months. The Directors have 
assessed Safestore’s viability over a three-year period to October 2020. 
This is based on three years of the strategic plan, which gives greater 
certainty over the forecasting assumptions used. The viability 
statement is set out on page 16.

Directors’ report continued
Directors continued
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one-third of 
Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director must retire 
at intervals of not more than three years. Non-Executive Directors must 
retire annually once they have been in office for a period of more than 
eight years. In accordance with best practice, the Directors will retire at 
the AGM and will offer themselves for election and annual re-election, 
as required.
The Board, which is responsible for the management of the

the provisions of relevant legislation and the Company’s Memorandum 
and Articles of Association. The powers of the Directors set out in

significance with the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, at any time

conflict or potential conflict of interest. 
The Company’s policy is that Directors notify the Chairman and the 
Company Secretary of all new outside interests and conflicts of interest

identified or notified to the Company during the year and, accordingly, 
the Board has not authorised any conflicts of interest as permitted by 
the Company’s Articles of Association.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under company law 
the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and the parent company and of the profit or loss of 
the Group for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 — make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 — state whether Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure 
Framework’ has been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 — properly select and apply accounting policies;
 — present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 — provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 — make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the parent 
company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Group’s website 
at www.safestore.com. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
 — the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
 — the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
 — the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, 
are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 October 2017 and of the 
Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 — the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements of Safestore Holdings plc (“the parent company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) which comprise:
 — the consolidated income statement;
 — the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 — the consolidated and Company balance sheets;
 — the consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity;
 — the consolidated cash flow statement; and
 — the Group related notes 1 to 30 and parent company related notes 1 to 11.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the Group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the 
Group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matter that we identified in the current year was Valuation of the Investment Properties.
Materiality The materiality that we used in the current year was £12.4 million (FY2016: £10.6 million) which was determined as 2% 
of net assets. 
Scoping As in the prior year, we determined that there were two components within the Group: the United Kingdom and France 
operations. Our component audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component 
which were lower than Group materiality, ranging from £6.2 million to £8.7 million.
Significant changes 
in our approach
In the prior year we reported on a key audit matter relating to Space Maker Stores because this related to the acquisition 
which took place that year. We also reported on revenue recognition, but this was no longer considered a key audit matter 
in the current year. 68 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern and viability statement
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the financial statements and 
the Directors’ statement on the longer term viability of the Group contained on page 16.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw 
attention to in relation to:
 — the disclosures on pages 13 to 16 that describe the principal risks and explain 
how they are being managed or mitigated;
 — the Directors’ confirmation on page 13 that they have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; 
 — the Directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether 
they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group and the parent company’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; 
 — the Directors’ explanation on page 16 as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions; or
 — whether the Directors’ statements relating to going concern and the prospects 
of the Company required in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) are 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to add or draw 
attention to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period 
and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which 
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Valuation of investment properties 
Key audit matter description Investment properties are held at a fair value of £1,063.2 million at 31 October 2017. This is the most 
quantitatively material balance in the financial statements.
Property valuation, which is performed by an independent valuer, is by its nature subjective with significant 
judgement applied, particularly in the self-storage market where there is market uncertainty due to the lower 
volume of transactions in comparison with other property markets. We therefore identified a risk of fraud 
relating to valuation of investment properties. 
The key judgements about individual properties are capitalisation rate, discount rate, rental growth and stabilised 
occupancy levels. These judgements drive a cash flow model that is used as the basis of the valuation of each 
individual property. For further details of the Group’s valuation method and assumptions, refer to notes 2 and 11 
of the financial statements. The valuation of property is also discussed in the Audit Committee report on page 41. 
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
We met with the third party valuer and assessed the appropriateness of the valuer’s scope and whether the 
valuer had sufficient expertise and resource.
We obtained the source information provided by management to the valuer (e.g. historical revenue on a  
store-by-store basis) and tested the integrity of a sample of such information. 
We provided the valuations to our own internal real estate experts, who are members of the Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors. Our experts performed an independent assessment of the assumptions that underpin 
the valuations, namely capitalisation rates, discount rate, rental growth and stabilised occupancy on a 
property-by-property basis, based on their knowledge of the self-storage industry and wider real estate market.
We confirmed with the valuer and with our internal real estate experts that the Group’s valuation methodology 
remains appropriate, and, noting that the number of transactions in the self-storage market has continued to 
increase year on year, assessed whether indicative rents and yields achieved in recent comparable transactions 
were consistent with the assumptions used in the Group’s valuations.
Key observations We found the assumptions adopted by the valuers in the valuation were reasonable and the methodology 
applied was appropriate in all material aspects. 69 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
Our application of materiality 
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £12.4 million (FY2016: £10.6 million).
Basis for determining 
materiality 
2% of net assets. 
Rationale for the benchmark 
applied
We consider net assets to be a critical financial performance measure for the Group on the basis that it is a key 
metric used by management, investors, analysts and lenders.  
In addition to net assets, we also consider profit before income tax, adjusted to exclude the gain on revaluation of investment properties and 
movements in the fair value of derivatives, to be a critical financial performance measure for the Group, which aligns closely with EPRA earnings. 
We applied a lower threshold of £3.4 million (FY2016: £2.7 million), which has been determined as 5% (FY2016: 5%) of profit before income tax 
adjusted for testing of balances impacting that measure to exclude the gain on revaluation of investment properties and movements in the fair value 
of derivatives.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.6 million (FY2016: £0.5 million), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement at the Group level. 
As in the prior year, we determined that there were two components within the Group: the United Kingdom and France operations. In addition to 
performing the Group audit procedures, which included the testing of the consolidation process, the Group audit team also performed the audit 
of the United Kingdom component given all United Kingdom entities operate from the same office with the same financial system. We instructed 
component auditors to perform the audit of the France component, supervised their work through regular communication and participation in 
planning and closing meetings with management. We reviewed the outputs of the work performed by them during their audit and challenged 
their conclusions. Our component audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component which were lower 
than Group materiality, ranging from £6.2 million to £8.7 million (FY2016: £5.3 million to £8.5 million). In addition, for the lower threshold described 
above, our component thresholds ranged from £1.2 million to £1.7 million (FY2016: £1.3 million to £2.2 million).
Other information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise 
explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether 
there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based 
on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the 
other information include where we conclude that:
–  Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the Directors that they consider the Annual Report and 
Financial Statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit; or
–  Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee; or
–  Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the Directors’ statement 
required under the Listing Rules relating to the Company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
containing provisions specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly 
disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters. 70 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Responsibilities of Directors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation 
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors 
either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
 — the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
 — the strategic report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the Directors’ report.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect 
of these matters.
Other matters
Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Directors on 12 October 2014 to audit the financial statements 
for the year ending 31 October 2014 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals 
and re-appointments of the firm is four years, covering the years ending 31 October 2014 to 31 October 2017.
Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

Financial statements
1. General information
Safestore Holdings plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together, “the Group”) provide self-storage facilities to customers throughout the UK 
and Paris. The Company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The address of its registered office is Brittanic House, Stirling Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire WD6 2BT.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies of the Group are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to each of the years presented, 
unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) interpretations. They also comply with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling and are rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, unless otherwise stated. They 
are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and the fair 
value of derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during 
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual amounts may 
differ from those estimates.
Going concern
The Group’s viability statement is set out on page 16. In preparing the viability statement, the Directors of Safestore have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period to October 2020 and are confident that, on the basis of current financial projections and facilities available, 
it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

The Directors are currently considering the potential impact arising from the future adoption of these standards and interpretations.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 
31 October each year. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Company:
 — has power over the investee;
 — is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 — has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used 
by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity 
instruments issued by the Group. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are 
measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of 
net identifiable assets including intangible assets of the acquired entity at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any discount received 
is credited to the income statement in the year of acquisition as negative goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary. Costs attributable to an acquisition 
are expensed in the consolidated income statement under the heading “administrative expenses”.
Segmental reporting
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ (“IFRS 8”) requires operating segments to be identified based upon the Group’s internal reporting to the chief operating 
decision maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments and to assess their performance. The CODM is the person 
or group that allocates resources to and assesses the performance of the operating segments of an entity. The Group has determined that its CODM 
is the Executive Directors. 
A business segment is a distinguishable group of assets and operations, reflected in the way that the Group manages its business, that is subject 
to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments. The Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable 
to one principal activity, the provision of self-storage, in two geographical reporting segments, the United Kingdom and Paris in France. 
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to segments as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self-storage services (rental space, customer goods insurance and consumables) which 
fall within the Group’s activities provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT (where applicable) and other sales related taxes.
Rental income is recognised over the period for which the space is occupied by the customer on a time apportionment basis. No revenue is 
recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due. Insurance income is recognised over the period for 
which the space is occupied by the customer on a time apportionment basis. 
The Group acts as principal in the provision of insurance services to its customers, and therefore revenue from insurance premiums is reported 
on a gross basis. The portion of insurance premiums on occupied space that relates to unexpired risks at the balance sheet date is reported as 
unearned premium liability in other payables.
Income for the sale of assets and consumables is recognised when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
For property sales this is generally at the point of completion. Where any aspect of consideration is conditional then the revenue associated 
with that conditional item is deferred. Income earned on the sales of consumable items is recognised at the point of sale.
Income from insurance claims is recognised when it is virtually certain of being received.  78 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Foreign currency translation
Functional and presentation currency
The individual financial statements for each company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
(its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of the Group are expressed in 
Sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance 
sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at 
the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for 
exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated into the Group’s presentational currency at exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
differences arising are classified as equity and are recognised as a separate component of equity, within the translation reserve. Such translation 
differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are included within the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their 
expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Investment properties, investment properties under construction and interests in leasehold properties
Investment properties are those properties owned by the Group that are held to earn rental income, or for capital growth, or both. Investment properties 
and investment properties under construction are initially measured at cost, including related transaction and borrowing costs. After initial recognition, 
investment properties and investment properties under construction are held at fair value based on a market valuation by professionally qualified external 
valuers at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of investment properties and investment properties under construction reflects, among other things, rental income from current leases and 
assumptions about rental income from future leases in the light of current market conditions. The fair value also reflects, on a similar basis, any cash 
outflows that could be expected in respect of the property. Some of these outflows are recognised as a liability, including finance lease liabilities in respect 
of leasehold land and buildings classified as investment properties; others, including contingent rent payments, are not recognised in the balance sheet.
Land and properties held under operating leases are classified and accounted for by the Group as investment property in accordance with IAS 40 
when the rest of the definition of an investment property is met. In such cases, the operating leases concerned are accounted for as if they were finance 
leases. For investment properties held under leases that are classified as finance leases, the properties are initially recognised at the lower of fair value of 
the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. An equivalent amount is recognised as a finance lease liability. After initial recognition, 
leasehold properties classified as investment properties are held at fair value, and the obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is 
included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Depreciation is provided on the minimum lease payment valuation 
over the lease term. 
Gains or losses arising on changes in the fair values of investment properties and investment properties under construction at the balance sheet date 
are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains or losses on sale of investment properties are calculated as the difference between the consideration received and fair value estimated at the 
previous balance sheet date.
If an investment property or part of an investment property becomes owner occupied, it is reclassified as property, plant and equipment, and its fair 
value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for accounting purposes.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment not classified as investment properties or investment properties under construction is stated at historical cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Historical cost comprises the purchase price and costs directly incurred in 
bringing the asset into use.
Assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted at each balance sheet date. If the carrying amount of an asset is 
greater than the recoverable amount then the carrying amount is written down immediately to the recoverable amount.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of an asset less estimated residual value of each asset over its expected useful life using the 
straight line method. The principal rates are as follows:
Owner-occupied freehold buildings 2% per annum
Motor vehicles 20–25% per annum
Computer hardware and software 15–33% per annum
Fixtures, fittings, signs and partitioning 10–15% per annum 
The gain or loss arising on the retirement or disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement on disposal. 79 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of tangible assets (excluding investment property)
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the 
extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is deemed to be the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or 
cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories 
to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price 
less directly associated costs. Provision is made for slow-moving or obsolete stock, calculated on the basis of sales trends observed in the year.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or 
delinquency in payments are considered indicators that a trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement 
within “administrative expenses”. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent only liquid assets with original maturity of 90 days or less. Bank overdrafts that cannot be offset against other 
cash balances are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value. Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Leases
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and the reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rent payable under finance leases, being the difference between the rent currently payable and the minimum lease payments when 
the lease obligation was originally calculated, is charged as an expense in the years in which it is payable.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised 
in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the 
effective interest method and are included within the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which 
they arise. Where fees are payable in relation to raising debt the costs are disclosed in the cash flow statement within financing activities. Where 
payments are made to exit or modify derivative financial instruments, these costs are disclosed in the cash flow statement within financing activities. 
Where existing borrowings are replaced by others from the same lenders on substantially different terms, or the terms of existing borrowing are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original borrowings and the recognition of new 
borrowings, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts, including issuance costs, is recognised in the income statement. Otherwise, 
issuance costs incurred on refinancing are offset against the carrying value of borrowings.  80 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps, to hedge risks 
associated with fluctuations on borrowings and foreign operations transactions. Such derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on 
the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting date. The gain or loss on re-measurement 
is taken to finance expense in the income statement except where the derivative is designated as an effective cash flow hedging instrument. Interest 
costs for the period relating to derivative financial instruments, which economically hedge borrowings, are recognised within interest payable on bank 
loans and overdrafts. Other fair value movements on derivative financial instruments are recognised within fair value movement of derivatives. 
Designation as part of an effective hedge relationship occurs at inception of a hedge relationship.
The effective part of any gain or loss on borrowings that are designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part 
of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in 
the Group income statement.
(a) Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or loans or receivables as appropriate. The Group determines 
the classification of its assets at initial recognition. 
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the Group transfers 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Financial assets consist of loans and receivables and derivatives.
Financial assets recognised as trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables. They are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents are also classified as loans and receivables. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Cash and cash 
equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or less.
At each balance sheet date the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired. If there is 
objective evidence the asset is impaired, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is 
reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
(b) Financial liabilities
Liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other liabilities, as appropriate.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. All loans and borrowings are classified 
as other liabilities. Initial recognition is at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial liabilities included within trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost. The fair value of a 
non-interest-bearing liability is its discounted repayment amount. If the due date of the liability is less than one year, discounting is omitted.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as effective hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in 
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast 
transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the non-financial asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or 
losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that 
do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which 
the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At 
that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Taxation including deferred tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates for that period that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on items that may become taxable at a later date, on the difference between the balance sheet value and the tax base 
value, on an undiscounted basis. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 81 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Employee benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are 
equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Share-based payments
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Group’s Performance Share Plan, Long Term Incentive Plan and employee Sharesave 
schemes. The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using 
Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not 
subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined 
at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure 
to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Actual outcomes 
may therefore differ from these judgements, estimates and assumptions. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies 
The following critical judgement has been made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies:
Accounting for transactions
The Group frequently enters into transactions for the purchase or sale of properties or businesses, which can be material to the consolidated 
financial statements. Accounting for transactions requires judgement such as in calculating a gain or loss or, for a business combination, goodwill. 
Each transaction is considered separately by management.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following key estimate has significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
consolidated financial statements:
Estimate of fair value of investment properties and investment property under construction
The Group values its investment properties using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income. 
Principal assumptions and management’s underlying estimation of the fair value of those relate to: stabilised occupancy levels; expected future growth 
in storage rental income and operating costs; maintenance requirements; capitalisation rate; and discount rates. A more detailed explanation of the 
background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the investment properties is set out in note 11 to the financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial information
The Directors have identified certain measures that they believe will assist the understanding of the performance of the business. The measures 
are not defined under IFRS and they may not be directly comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. The non-GAAP measures are not 
intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but they have been included as the Directors consider them to 
be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance. The following are the key non-GAAP measures 
identified by the Group:
 — The Group defines exceptional items to be those that warrant, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, separate disclosure on the face of the 
income statement where, in the opinion of the Directors, this enhances the understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
 — Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives,  
gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation. Management considers this presentation to be representative of the 
underlying performance of the business, as it removes the income statement impact of items not fully controllable by management, such as 
the revaluation of derivatives and investment properties, and the impact of exceptional credits, costs and finance charges. A reconciliation of 
statutory operating profit to underlying EBITDA can be found in the financial review on page 18.
 — Cash tax adjusted earnings per share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change 
in fair value of derivatives, gain or loss on investment properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred 
tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the Safestore Employee Benefit Trust). 
A reconciliation of statutory basic earnings per share to cash tax adjusted earnings per share can be found in note 10. 82 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Non-GAAP financial information continued
 — Adjusted Diluted EPRA EPS is based on the European Public Real Estate Association’s definition of earnings and is defined as profit or loss 
for the period after tax but excluding corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties and 
the associated tax impacts. The Company then makes further adjustments for the impact of exceptional items, IFRS 2 share-based payment 
charges, exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges. This adjusted earnings is divided by the diluted number of shares. The IFRS 2 cost is 
excluded as it is written back to distributable reserves and is a non-cash item (with the exception of the associated National Insurance element). 
Therefore neither the Company’s ability to distribute nor pay dividends are impacted (with the exception of the associated National Insurance 
element). The financial statements disclose earnings both on a statutory, EPRA and Adjusted Diluted EPRA basis and will provide a full reconciliation 
of the differences in the financial year in which any LTIP awards may vest. A reconciliation of statutory basic earnings per share to Adjusted 
Diluted EPRA EPS can be found in note 10.
 — EPRA basic net assets per share is an industry standard measure recommended by the European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”). 
The basis of calculation, including a reconciliation to reported net assets, is set out in note 13.
3. Segmental analysis 
The segmental information presented has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8. The Group’s revenue, profit before income tax 
and net assets are attributable to one activity: the provision of self-storage accommodation and related services. Segmental information is presented in 
respect of the Group’s geographical segments. This is based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Safestore is organised and managed in two operating segments, based on geographical areas, being the United Kingdom and Paris in France.
The chief operating decision maker, being the Executive Directors, identified in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8, assesses the performance 
of the operating segments on the basis of underlying EBITDA, which is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, 
change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent and depreciation.
The operating profits and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The Group is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). As a result the Group is exempt from UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from its 
qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions. Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group remain subject to 
corporation tax as normal. The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions. There have been no breaches of the conditions to date. 
The main rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 20% to 19% from 1 April 2017. Accordingly the Group’s results for this accounting 
period are taxed at an effective rate of 19.4% (FY2016: 20.0%). Finance (No.2) Bill 2015 provides that the rate of corporation tax from 1 April 2020 
would be 18%. At Budget 2016, the government announced a further reduction to the corporation tax main rate (for all profits except ring fenced 
profits) for the year starting 1 April 2020, setting the rate at 17%. This rate was incorporated in the Finance Act 2016 which was fully enacted on 
15 September 2016. Due to the Group’s REIT status there will be no deferred taxation impact in respect of the changes in taxation rates.
In France, the 2017 Finance Bill, which was adopted in December 2016, introduced a reduction in the income tax rate from 33.33% to 28.0%, 
applicable progressively from 2017 to 2020 according to size of company. As a result, the deferred tax charge includes a non-recurring deferred 
tax credit of £8.8 million (FY2016: £nil) relating to this change.
9. Dividends per share 
The dividend paid in 2017 was £25.6 million (12.25 pence per share) (FY2016: £21.3 million (10.25 pence per share)). A final dividend in respect of the year 
ended 31 October 2017 of 9.8 pence (FY2016: 8.05 pence) per share, amounting to a total final dividend of £20.5 million (FY2016: £16.8 million), is to be 
proposed at the AGM on 21 March 2018. The ex-dividend date will be 8 March 2018 and the record date will be 9 March 2018 with an intended payment 
date of 6 April 2018. The final dividend has not been included as a liability at 31 October 2017 .
The property income distribution (“PID”) element of the final dividend is 9.8 pence (FY2016: 8.05 pence), making the PID payable for the year 11.9 pence 
(FY2016: 9.85 pence) per share.
10. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding ordinary shares held as treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares. The Company has one category of dilutive 
potential ordinary shares: share options. For the share options, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been 
acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market price of the Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription 
rights attached to the outstanding share options. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would 
have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

11. Investment properties, investment properties under construction and interests in leasehold 
properties continued
The valuation of £999.2 million (FY2016: £943.3 million) excludes £0.6 million in respect of owner-occupied property, which is included within property, 
plant and equipment. Rental income earned from investment properties for the year ended 31 October 2017 was £107.4 million (FY2016: £95.2 million).
The Group has classified the investment property and investment property under construction, held at fair value, within Level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy. There were no transfers to or from Level 3 during the year.
The freehold and leasehold investment properties have been valued as at 31 October 2017 by external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP (“C&W”). 
The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the current edition of the RICS Valuation – Global Standards, which incorporate the International 
Valuation Standards and the RICS UK Valuation Standards (“the RICS Red Book”). The valuation of each of the investment properties has been prepared 
on the basis of fair value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential. One non-trading property was valued on the basis 
of fair value. The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and, as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book. 
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W has confirmed that:
 — the member of the RICS who has been the signatory to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation has done 
so since October 2006. The valuations have been reviewed by an internal investment committee comprising two valuation partners and an 
investment partner, all unconnected with the assignment;
 — C&W has been carrying out regular valuations for the same purpose as this valuation on behalf of the Group since October 2006;
 — C&W does not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group;
 — in relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less 
than 5%; and
 — the fee payable to C&W is a fixed amount per property and is not contingent on the appraised value.
Market uncertainty 
C&W’s valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from low liquidity in the market for self-storage property. C&W notes that in 
the UK since the start of 2013 there have only been 13 transactions involving multiple assets and 13 single asset transactions, and C&W is aware of 
only one comparable transaction in the Paris market. C&W states that due to the lack of comparable market information in the self-storage sector, 
there is greater uncertainty attached to its opinion of value than would be anticipated during more active market conditions.
Portfolio premium 
C&W’s valuation report confirms that the properties have been valued individually but that if the portfolio was to be sold as a single lot or in 
selected groups of properties, the total value could be different. C&W states that in current market conditions it is of the view that there could 
be a material portfolio premium.
Valuation method and assumptions
The valuation of the operational self-storage facilities has been prepared having regard to trading potential. Cash flow projections have been 
prepared for all of the properties reflecting estimated absorption, revenue growth and expense inflation. A discounted cash flow method of 
valuation based on these cash flow projections has been used by C&W to arrive at its opinion of fair value for these properties.
C&W has adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold (UK and Paris)
The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten-year period and a notional sale of the asset at the end 
of the tenth year.
Assumptions:
 — Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% 
of the estimated annual revenue, subject to a cap and collar. The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income 
in the first twelve months following the valuation date.
 — The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming either straight line absorption from day one actual occupancy or variable absorption 
over years one to four of the cash flow period, to an estimated stabilised/mature occupancy level. In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy 
level for the trading stores (both freeholds and all leaseholds) open at 31 October 2017 averages 80.91% (31 October 2016: 80.23%). The projected 
revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth. The average time assumed for stores to trade at their 
maturity levels is 23.10 months (31 October 2016: 23.78 months).
 — The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flows have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail 
warehouse property, yields for other trading property types such as purpose-built student housing and hotels, bank base rates, ten-year money rates, 
inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector. The valuation included in the accounts assumes rental growth in future periods. If an 
assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre-administration expenses for mature stores (i.e. excluding 
those stores categorised as “developing”) is 7.84% (31 October 2016: 7.98%), rising to a stabilised net yield pre-administration expenses of 8.80% 
(31 October 2016: 8.99%).
 — The future net cash flow projections (including revenue growth and cost inflation) have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated 
with each asset. The weighted average annual discount rate adopted (for both freeholds and all leaseholds) is 10.55% (31 October 2016: 10.75%).
 — Purchaser’s costs in the range of approximately 4.0% to 6.8% for the UK and 7.5% for Paris (see page 89) have been assumed initially, reflecting 
the progressive SDLT rates brought into force in March 2016 in the UK, and sales plus purchaser’s costs totalling approximately 6.0% to 8.8% (UK) 
and 9.5% (Paris) are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to freehold and long leasehold stores. 89 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc
Financial statements Governance Overview Strategic report
11. Investment properties, investment properties under construction and interests in leasehold 
properties continued
Valuation method and assumptions continued
Short leaseholds (UK)
The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted 
cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease. The average unexpired term of the Group’s UK short-term leasehold properties is 13.3 years 
(31 October 2016: 13.7 years). The average unexpired term excludes the commercial leases in Paris.
Short leaseholds (Paris)
In relation to the commercial leases in Paris, C&W has valued the cash flow projections in perpetuity due to the security of tenure arrangements in that 
market and the potential compensation arrangements in the event of the landlord wishing to take possession. The valuation treatment is therefore the 
same as for the freehold properties. The capitalisation rates on these stores reflect the risk of the landlord terminating the lease arrangements.
Investment properties under construction
C&W has valued the stores in development adopting the same methodology as set out above but on the basis of the cash flow projection expected for 
the store at opening and allowing for the outstanding costs to take each store from its current state to completion and full fit out. C&W has allowed for 
carry costs and construction contingency, as appropriate.
Immature stores: value uncertainty
C&W has assessed the value of each property individually. However, five of the stores in the portfolio are relatively immature and have low initial 
cash flow. C&W has endeavoured to reflect the nature of the cash flow profile for these properties in its valuation, and the higher associated risks 
relating to the as yet unproven future cash flow, by adjustment to the capitalisation rates and discount rates adopted. However, immature low cash 
flow stores of this nature are rarely, if ever, traded individually in the market, unless as part of a distressed sale or similar situation. Although, there 
is more evidence of immature low cash flow stores being traded as part of a group or portfolio transaction. 
C&W considers there to be market uncertainty in the self-storage sector due to the lack of comparable market transactions and information. The 
degree of uncertainty relating to the five immature stores is greater than in relation to the balance of the properties due to there being even less 
market evidence than might be available for more mature properties and portfolios. 
C&W states that in practice, if an actual sale of the properties were to be contemplated then any immature low cash flow stores would normally 
be presented to the market for sale lotted or grouped with other more mature assets owned by the same entity, in order to alleviate the issue of 
negative or low short term cash flow. This approach would enhance the marketability of the group of assets and assist in achieving the best price 
available in the market by diluting the cash flow risk.
C&W has not adjusted its opinion of fair value to reflect such a grouping of the immature assets with other properties in the portfolio and all stores 
have been valued individually. However, C&W highlights the matter to alert the Group to the manner in which the properties might be grouped or 
lotted in order to maximise their attractiveness to the marketplace. 
C&W considers this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an assumption that assumes facts that 
differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material difference in value. 
Lotting of stores with customer transfers 
Where stores within the portfolio are expected to close in the short term, C&W has assumed that a proportion of the customer base from these 
stores will be transferred, at closure, to nearby stores also owned by the Group.
C&W has assumed that the properties that are closing would be sold together with the stores where customers will be transferred to, in the event 
they were offered to the market. C&W considers this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an 
assumption that assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material 
difference in value.
Valuation assumption for purchaser’s costs 
The Group’s investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after adjusting for notional purchaser’s costs 
in the range of approximately 4.0% to 6.8% (UK) and 7.5% (Paris), as if they were sold directly as property assets. The valuation is an asset valuation 
which is strongly linked to the operating performance of the business. They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, 
employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing 
a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs. A sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the 
assumed stamp duty land tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchaser’s 
cost of circa 2.75% of gross value. All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a 
corporate structure. The Group therefore instructed C&W to prepare additional valuation advice on the basis of purchaser’s cost of 2.75% of gross 
value which are used for internal management purposes.
Sensitivity of the valuation to assumptions
All other factors being equal, higher net operating income would lead to an increase in the valuation of a store and an increase in the capitalisation 
rate or discount rate would result in a lower valuation, and vice versa. Higher assumptions for stabilised occupancy, absorption rate, rental rate 
and other revenue, and a lower assumption for operating costs, would result in an increase in projected net operating income, and thus an increase 
in valuation. 90 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Basic net assets per share is shareholders’ funds divided by the number of shares at the year end. Diluted net assets per share is shareholders’ 
funds divided by the number of shares at the year end, adjusted for dilutive share options of 1,049,438 shares (FY2016: 1,480,168 shares). EPRA 
diluted net assets per share exclude deferred tax liabilities arising on the revaluation of investment properties. The EPRA NAV, which further 
excludes fair value adjustments for debt and related derivatives net of deferred tax, was £688.7 million (FY2016: £626.0 million), giving EPRA net 
assets per share of 329 pence (FY2016: 300 pence). The Directors consider that these alternative measures provide useful information on the 
performance of the Group.

At 31 October 1.6 1.5
The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in cost of sales in the income statement.
The provision for impairment of trade receivables is estimated by reference to the ageing of the receivable balance and historical experience. 
As at 31 October 2017, trade receivables of £3.5 million (FY2016: £3.2 million) were determined to be impaired. Provision for impairment of trade 
receivables is also made on a portfolio basis against trade receivables which are not individually determined to be impaired. There is no concentration 
of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers.
As at 31 October 2017, trade receivables of £4.0 million (FY2016: £3.6 million) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of customers 
for whom there is no recent history of default, some of whom benefit from an extension to normal terms. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables 
is as follows:
2017 
£’m
2016 
£’m
Up to 28 days overdue 3.5 3.2
Up to 60 days overdue 0.5 0.4
The above balances are short term (including other receivables) and therefore the difference between the book value and the fair value of the above 
receivables is not significant. Consequently these have not been discounted. 93 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc

The Group’s borrowings consist of bank facilities of £250 million and €70 million, which run to June 2022, and US private placement notes of €125 million, 
with maturities extending to 2024 and 2027, and £50.5 million, maturing in 2029. The blended cost of interest on the overall debt is 2.14% per annum. 
The bank facilities attract a margin over LIBOR/EURIBOR. The margin ratchets between 1.25% and 2.50%, by reference to the Group’s performance 
against its interest cover covenant. Approximately 62% of the drawn bank facilities have been hedged at an effective rate of 0.8145% (LIBOR) 
or 0.1635% (EURIBOR).
The Company also has in issue €50.9 million 1.59% Series A Senior Secured Notes due 2024, €74.1 million 2.00% Series B Senior Secured Notes 
due 2027 and £50.5 million 2.91% Series C Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (FY2016: $65.6 million 5.52% Series A Senior Secured Notes due 2019 
and $47.3 million 6.29% Series B Senior Secured Notes due 2024). The €125.0 million of Euro-denominated borrowings provide a natural hedge 
against the Group’s investment in the Paris business, so the Group has applied net investment hedge accounting and the retranslation of these 
borrowings is recognised directly in the translation reserve.
The bank loans and overdrafts are secured by a fixed charge over the Group’s investment property portfolio. As part of the Group’s interest rate 
management strategy, the Group entered into several interest rate swap contracts, details of which are shown in note 19.
Bank loans and secured notes are stated before unamortised issue costs of £0.6 million (FY2016: £1.8 million).

Financial risk management
Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign 
exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The overall aim of the Group’s financial risk management policies is to minimise potential 
adverse effects on financial performance and net asset values (“NAV”). The Group manages the financial risks within policies and operating parameters 
approved by the Board of Directors and does not enter into speculative transactions. Treasury activities are managed centrally under a framework of 
policies and procedures approved and monitored by the Board. These objectives are to protect the assets of the Group and to identify and then 
manage financial risk. In applying these policies, the Group will utilise derivative instruments, but only for risk management purposes.
The principal financial risks facing the Group are described below.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, issued share capital and bank borrowings. The Group borrows in Sterling 
and Euros and, previously, US Dollars at floating rates and, where necessary, uses interest rate swaps to convert these to fixed rates to generate 
the preferred interest rate profile and to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A 1% change in interest rates would have a £0.8 million 
(FY2016: £1.0 million) impact on net interest. This sensitivity impact has been prepared by determining average floating interest rates and flexing 
these against average floating rate deposits and borrowings by major currency area over the course of the year.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net 
debt over the medium term. The Group’s principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of term loans 
and overdrafts. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak 
gross debt levels. Further details of the Group’s borrowing facilities, including the repayment profile of existing borrowings and the amount of 
undrawn committed borrowing facilities, are set out in note 18.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade and other receivables and short term bank deposits. Policies and procedures exist to ensure 
that customers have an appropriate credit history and account customers are given credit limits that are monitored. Short term bank deposits are 
executed only with A-rated or above authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies. Counterparty exposure positions 
are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits. Overall, the Group considers that it is not 
exposed to a significant amount of credit risk. The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure 
to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year. Based on management information collected as 
at month ends the maximum level of net trade receivables at any one point during the year was £11.7 million (FY2016: £11.3 million). 96 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the Euro. Foreign exchange risk arises from future 
commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. 
The Group has investments in foreign operations in France, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. Currency exposure 
arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
The Group holds Euro-denominated loan notes totalling €125 million and as such is exposed to foreign exchange risk on these notes. The foreign 
exchange risk relating to the notes provides a natural hedge against the Euro-denominated assets of its operations in France. As a result, the Group 
applies net investment hedging in respect of these loan notes, so the Group income statement is not exposed to exchange risk.
At 31 October 2017, if Sterling had weakened by 10% against the Euro with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have 
been unchanged (FY2016: unchanged), as a result of foreign exchange gains and losses on translation of Euro-denominated receivables. Equity 
would have been £4.3 million higher (FY2016: £14.4 million higher), arising primarily on translation of Euro-denominated net assets held by 
subsidiary companies with a Euro functional currency.
The Group is not exposed to significant transaction foreign exchange risk as purchases are invoiced in either Sterling or Euros.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Being a REIT, the Group is required to distribute as a dividend a minimum of 90% 
of its property rental income to shareholders. This is factored into the Group’s capital risk management.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by 
total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including “current and non-current borrowings” as shown in the consolidated balance 
sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 October 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
2017
£’m
2016
£’m
Total borrowings (excluding derivatives) 419.8 374.6
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 16) (65.6) (5.4)
Net debt 354.2 369.2
Total equity 637.7 587.4
Total capital 991.9 956.6
Gearing ratio 36% 39%
The Group considers that a loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio, defined as gross debt (excluding finance leases, but adjusted for the fair value of the US 
Dollar cross currency swaps) as a proportion of the valuation of investment properties and investment properties under construction (excluding 
finance leases), of between 30% and 40% represents an appropriate medium term capital structure objective. The Group’s LTV ratio was 36% at 
31 October 2017 (FY2016: 31%). On a pro forma basis, adjusting for cash held in a solicitor client account, the LTV ratio at 31 October 2017 would 
have been 31%, or by including the value of the Alligator stores at 31 October 2017, LTV would have been 34%.
The Group has complied with all of the covenants on its banking facilities during the year. 97 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market, such as over the counter derivatives, is determined using valuation 
techniques. The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each 
balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book value, with the exception of bank loans which are set out below. The carrying value less 
impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and the carrying value of trade payables and other payables approximate their fair value.

Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in the 
measurements, according to the following levels:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which fair value measurements have been categorised:

There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior year.
Over the life of the Group’s derivative financial instruments, the cumulative fair value gain/loss on those instruments will be £nil as it is the Group’s 
intention to hold them to maturity.
Interest rate swaps not designated as part of a hedging arrangement
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 October 2017 were £100 million and €30 million (FY2016: £100 million 
and €30 million). At 31 October 2017 the weighted average fixed interest rates were Sterling at 0.8145% and Euro at 0.1635% (FY2016: Sterling at 1.34% 
and Euro at 0.309%) and floating rates are at quarterly LIBOR and quarterly EURIBOR. The LIBOR swaps and the EURIBOR swaps expire in June 2022. 
The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement was a net gain of £1.3 million (FY2016: £2.4 million net loss).
Cross currency swaps not designated as part of a hedging arrangement
The Group had previously entered into cross currency swaps to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising on future interest payments and the principal 
repayments arising from the $65.6 million and $47.3 million US Senior Secured Notes. These cross currency swaps commenced in May 2012 and 
were due to terminate in 2019 and 2024 in line with the maturity of the notes. When the loan notes were repaid early during the year, the cross currency 
swaps were also terminated, resulting in a £13.9 million receipt to the Group. The movement in fair value during the year recognised in the income 
statement was a net loss of £6.5 million (FY2016: £20.8 million net gain). 98 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

26. Contingent liabilities
As part of the Group banking facility, the Company has guaranteed the borrowings totalling £364.2 million (FY2016: £317.5 million) of fellow Group 
undertakings by way of a charge over all of its property and assets. There are similar cross guarantees provided by the Group companies in 
respect of any bank borrowings which the Company may draw under a Group facility agreement. The financial liability associated with this 
guarantee is considered remote and therefore no provision has been recorded.
Following a tax audit carried out on the Group’s operations in Paris, elements of tax were challenged by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) 
for financial years 2011 to 2013. Similar challenges from the FTA have also been made to other operators within the self-storage industry. The 
Company and its legal advisers are of the opinion that there are no valid grounds for these challenges and intend to strongly contest the findings 
of the FTA. The duration and outcome of this dispute cannot be anticipated at this stage of the proceedings. Based on our analysis of the relevant 
information, any potential exposure in relation to the tax audit issues is not likely to be material, and no provision for any potential exposure has 
been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Bank guarantees to cover any potential additional tax assessment will be put in place 
during the coming financial year.
27. Capital commitments
The Group had £61.6 million of capital commitments as at 31 October 2017 (FY2016: £1.7 million), including £56.0 million consideration for the 
acquisition of Stork Self Storage Holdings Limited (“SSSHL”), which completed after the year end on 1 November 2017. Further details are set out 
in note 30.

29. Parent company
Safestore Holdings plc is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the UK. It operates as the ultimate parent 
company of the Safestore Holdings plc Group. 
30. Post balance sheet events
Following the year end, on 1 November 2017 the Group completed the acquisition of Stork Self Storage Holdings Limited (“SSSHL”) trading as 
Alligator Self Storage, a company controlled by funds managed or advised by York Capital Management, for an initial consideration of £56.0 million 
(subject to working capital adjustments). The estimated consideration paid is greater than the provisional fair value of the identifiable net assets and, 
as a result an estimated £0.9 million of goodwill is expected to be recognised within the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 October 2018. 
In respect of this transaction, £1.4 million of transaction related costs are reported as an exceptional item within administrative expenses for the 
year ended 31 October 2017. 
Due to the timing of the acquisition, the determination of the fair values of the net assets acquired is provisional and will be subject to further review 
during the twelve months following the acquisition date. The transaction will be reported in the Group’s 2018 financial statements. The provisional 
fair values of the net assets acquired and the fair value of the consideration paid and expected to be paid are as follows:

Notes to the Company financial statements
for the year ended 31 October 2017
1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (“FRS 101”). 
In preparing these financial statements the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and sets out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
 — a cash flow statement and related notes;
 — comparative period reconciliations for tangible fixed assets;
 — disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
 — disclosures in respect of capital management;
 — the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
 — IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in respect of Group-settled share-based payments; and
 — certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’.
The above disclosure exemptions are permitted because equivalent disclosures are included in the Group consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention. The Company’s principal accounting policies 
are the same as those applied in the Group financial statements, except as described below: 
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.

authority conferred on them to allot such shares or grant such rights by that resolution and/or to sell ordinary shares held by the Company as 
treasury shares for cash as if Section 561(1) and subsections (1) – (6) of Section 562 of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided

authority granted under resolution 14.2 by way of a rights issue only) and any other persons entitled to participate in such issue or 
offering where the equity securities respectively attributable to the interests of such holders and persons are proportionate (as nearly 
as may be) to the respective number of equity securities held by or deemed to be held by them on the record date of such allotment,

shares, fractional entitlements or legal or practical problems under the laws or requirements of any recognised regulatory body or

 16.1  the maximum number of Ordinary Shares hereby authorised to be purchased is 20,949,529;

of an Ordinary Share and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary Share as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Trading System (“SETS”);

of the Company to be held in 2019 or close of business on 30 April 2019; and
 16.5  the Company may make a contract to purchase its own Ordinary Shares under the authority conferred by this resolution prior to the 
expiry of such authority, and such contract will or may be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of such authority, and the Company 
may make a purchase of its own Ordinary Shares in pursuance of any such contract.
17.  THAT a general meeting of the Company other than an Annual General Meeting may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ notice, provided 
that this authority expires at the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting after the date of the passing of this resolution.

Notes to Notice
(i)  A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting convened by the above notice (“the Notice”) is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or 
any of the rights of the member to attend and speak and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. A member 
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that member. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) to enjoy information rights (“a Nominated Person”).
(ii) To appoint a proxy you may:
 (a)  use the proxy form enclosed with this Notice. To be valid, the proxy form, together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) 
under which it is signed or a notarially certified or office copy of the same, must be received by post or (during normal business hours 
only) by hand at Link Asset Services, PXS, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, in each case no later than 
12.00 noon on 19 March 2018 or not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for any adjourned meeting (as an alternative you may 
appoint a proxy electronically at www.signalshares.com); or 
 (b)  if you hold your shares in uncertificated form, use the CREST electronic proxy appointment service as described in notes (vi), 
(vii) and (viii) below.
 Completion of the proxy form or appointment of a proxy through CREST will not prevent a member from attending and voting in person.
  You may submit your vote electronically at www.signalshares.com not later than 48 hours before the time fixed for the Meeting or adjourned 
meeting at which your proxy proposes to vote.
(iii) Any member or his or her proxy attending the Meeting has the right to ask any question at the Meeting relating to the business of the Meeting.
(iv)  Pursuant to Section 360B of the Act and Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended), only shareholders 
registered in the register of members of the Company as at close of business on 19 March 2018 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the 
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at such time. If the Meeting is adjourned, the time by which a person must 
be entered on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the adjourned Meeting is close of 
business on the day preceding the date fixed for the adjourned Meeting. Changes to the register of members after the relevant times shall be 
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Meeting.
(v)  In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote whether in person or by proxy shall be accepted to the exclusion 
of the votes of the other joint holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the register 
of members of the Company in respect of the relevant joint holding.
(vi)  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using 
the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members 
who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf.
(vii)  In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (“a CREST Proxy Instruction”) must 
be properly authenticated in accordance with the specifications of Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“Euroclear UK & Ireland”) and must contain 
the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by 
the Company’s agent, Link Asset Services (CREST participant ID RA10), by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this 
Notice. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Application Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
(viii)  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors and voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation 
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any 
particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, 
in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may 
treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 
(as amended). 114 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Explanatory notes to resolutions
Resolutions 6–12 – Re-election of Alan Lewis, Frederic Vecchioli, Andy Jones, Ian Krieger, Joanne Kenrick, Bill Oliver and Claire 
Balmforth as Directors (ordinary resolutions)
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, one-third of the Directors are to retire from office and offer themselves for re-election. For the sake 
of good corporate governance as a FTSE 350 company, it has been decided that the entire Board (and not just one-third of the Board) will be put 
up for re-election and, therefore, all the Directors will stand for re-election to the Board. 
Following the annual Board performance reviews of individual Directors, the Chairman considers that each Director continues to operate as an 
effective and committed member of the Board and that they have the skills, knowledge and experience to enable them to discharge their duties 
properly and contribute to the effective operation of the Board. 
Brief biographies of the Directors are set out on pages 34 and 35 of the Company’s Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 
31 October 2017. 
Resolutions 6–12 (inclusive) propose the re-election of Directors, each of which will take effect at the conclusion of the Meeting.
Resolution 13 – Political donations and political expenditure (ordinary resolution)
Resolution 13 seeks to renew the authority granted at last year’s Annual General Meeting for the Company to make political donations to political 
parties, to other political organisations and to independent election candidates or to incur political expenditure.
It is not the policy of the Company or its subsidiaries to make political donations of this type and the Directors have no intention of changing that policy. 
However, as a result of the wide definitions in the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”) of matters constituting political donations, normal expenditure (such 
as expenditure on organisations concerned with matters of public policy, law reform and representation of the business community) and business 
activities (such as communicating with the government and political parties at local, national and European level) might be construed as political 
expenditure or as a donation to a political party or other political organisation and fall within the restrictions of the Act.
This resolution does not purport to authorise any particular donation or expenditure but is expressed in general terms as required by the Act 
and is intended to authorise normal donations and expenditure. If passed, resolution 13 would allow the Company and its subsidiaries:
(i) to make donations to political parties and/or independent election candidates up to an aggregate limit of £100,000; 
(ii) to make donations to other political organisations up to an aggregate limit of £100,000; and 
(iii) to incur political expenditure (as defined in the Act) up to an aggregate limit of £100,000, 
during the period up to the conclusion of the end of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2019 or, if earlier, at close of 
business on 30 April 2019, whilst avoiding inadvertent infringement of the statute. Any political donation made or political expenditure incurred 
which is in excess of £2,000 will be disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report for next year, as required by the Act. The authority will not be 
used to make political donations within the normal meaning of that expression.
Resolution 13 replaces a similar authority put in place at the Annual General Meeting held on 22 March 2017. No payments were made under 
this authority.
Resolution 14 – Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant subscription or conversion rights (ordinary resolution)
The resolution asks shareholders to grant the Directors authority under Section 551 of the Act to allot shares or grant such subscription or conversion rights 
as are contemplated by Sections 551(1)(a) and (b) respectively of the Act up to a maximum aggregate nominal value of £1,396,634, being approximately 
two-thirds of the nominal value of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 1 February 2018. As at 1 February 2018, the Company did not 
hold any treasury shares. £698,317 of this authority is reserved for a fully pre-emptive rights issue. This is the maximum permitted amount under best 
practice corporate governance guidelines. The Directors consider it important to have the maximum ability and flexibility commensurate with good corporate 
governance guidelines to raise finance to enable the Company to respond to market developments and conditions. The Directors have no present intention 
of exercising such authority. The authority will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2019 or, if earlier, at close of 
business on 30 April 2019. The resolution replaces a similar resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 22 March 2017 . 
Resolution 15 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights (special resolution)
If the Directors wish to allot new shares or other equity securities for cash, the Act requires that such shares or other equity securities are offered 
first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holding. Resolution 15 asks shareholders to grant the Directors authority to allot shares 
(or sell any shares which the Company holds in treasury following a purchase of its own shares) for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £104,747 
(being 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 1 February 2018) without first offering the securities to existing shareholders. 
The Directors confirm that equity securities in excess of 7.5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital will not be issued for cash on a 
non-pre-emptive basis over a rolling three-year period without suitable advance consultation with shareholders. The resolution also disapplies 
the statutory pre-emption provisions in connection with a rights issue and allows the Directors, in the case of a rights issue, to make appropriate 
arrangements in relation to treasury shares, fractional entitlements or other legal or practical problems which might arise.
The authority will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2019 or, if earlier, at close of business on 
30 April 2019. The resolution replaces a similar resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 22 March 2017. 116 Safestore Holdings plc | Annual report and financial statements 2017

Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
Explanatory notes to resolutions continued
Resolution 16 – Purchase of own shares by the Company (special resolution)
Resolution 16 to be proposed at the Meeting seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to make market purchases of its own ordinary shares 
of 1 pence each (“Ordinary Shares”), such authority being limited to the purchase of 10% of the Ordinary Shares in issue as at 1 February 2018. The 
maximum price payable for the purchase by the Company of its own Ordinary Shares will be limited to the higher of 5% above the average of the middle 
market quotations of the Ordinary Shares, as derived from The Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange, for the five business days prior to the 
purchase and the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an Ordinary Share and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary Share 
as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System. The minimum price payable by the Company for the purchase of its own Ordinary Shares 
will be 1 pence per Ordinary Share (being the amount equal to the nominal value of an Ordinary Share). The authority to purchase the Company’s own 
Ordinary Shares will only be exercised if the Directors consider that there is likely to be a beneficial impact on earnings per Ordinary Share and that it is 
in the best interests of the Company at the time. The authority will expire at the earlier of the end of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be 
held in 2019 or close of business on 30 April 2019. The resolution renews a similar resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
held on 22 March 2017 . The Company will be able to hold the Ordinary Shares which have been repurchased as treasury shares and re-sell them 
for cash, cancel them or use them in connection with certain of its share schemes. 
Options to subscribe for up to 7,594,385 Ordinary Shares have been granted and are outstanding as at 1 February 2018 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this document) representing 3.6% of the issued Ordinary Share capital at that date (excluding shares 
held in treasury). If the Directors were to exercise in full the power for which they are seeking authority under resolution 16, the options outstanding 
as at 1 February 2018 would represent 4.0% of the Ordinary Share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) in issue following such exercise.
Resolution 17 – Calling of general meetings (special resolution)
Resolution 17 to be proposed at the Meeting seeks authority from shareholders to hold general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) 
on 14 days’ clear notice. This is permissible under the existing Articles of Association of the Company and the Act. However, pursuant to the 
EU Shareholders’ Rights Directive, the Company must offer the facility, accessible to all shareholders, to vote by electronic means and must 
obtain specific shareholder approval annually in order to retain this ability. The Directors believe that there may be circumstances in which it 
will be important for the Company to be able to call meetings at such short notice. The shorter notice would not be used as a matter of course, 
but only where it is merited by the business of the Meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, 
the Directors believe that it is important for the Company to retain this flexibility.
Directors’ recommendation
The Board of Directors considers that each of the resolutions being proposed at the Meeting are in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions as they intend 
to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings. 117 Annual report and financial statements 2017 | Safestore Holdings plc

Notes
1.  A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting 
of the Company.
  A member may appoint as his/her proxy persons of his/her own choice by inserting their name in the space provided. If no name is inserted 
in the space provided, the Chairman will be deemed appointed as the proxy. A member of the Company may appoint more than one proxy, 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares. If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than 
a member’s full voting entitlement, the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as proxy should be entered in the box 
next to the proxy holder’s name. When two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or received for the same share for 
use at the same meeting, the one which is last validly delivered or received (regardless of its date or the date of its execution) shall be treated 
as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine which appointment was last validly 
delivered or received, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of that share. To appoint more than one proxy, you should contact 
Link Asset Services at the address stated in the information included with this proxy form, or you may photocopy this form.
2.  A member is entitled to appoint a proxy of his or her own choice. The Chairman of the meeting will act as proxy unless another proxy is chosen. 
A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in person.
3.  In the case of an individual, this proxy form should be signed by the appointer or his or her attorney. In the case of a corporation, this proxy 
form must be executed under its common seal or under the hand of an officer, attorney or other person duly authorised.
4.  In the case of joint holders, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, in respect of the holding will be accepted 
to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority is determined by the order in which the names appear in the 
register of members in respect of the joint holding.
5.  Please indicate with a cross in the appropriate box how you wish your votes to be cast. In the absence of any specific direction, the proxy 
will vote (or abstain from voting) at his or her discretion. The proxy will act in his/her discretion in relation to any other business at the meeting 
(including any resolution to amend a resolution or to adjourn the meeting).
6.  To be effective, the proxy form and any authority under which it is executed (or a certified copy of such authority) must be deposited with 
Link Asset Services at Link Asset Services, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time 
for holding the meeting.
7. Completion and return of this proxy form will not prevent a member from attending and voting at the Annual General Meeting.
8. Any alteration or deletion must be signed or initialled. Park is an EMAS certified company and its Environmental Management System is certified 
to ISO 14001.
