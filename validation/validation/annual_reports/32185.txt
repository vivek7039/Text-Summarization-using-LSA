Chairman’s Statement
We believe that excellent progress 
has been made across each of the 
five key pillars that underpin the 
strategy.
Overview
Since setting out our Moving Up A Gear strategy 18 
months ago, excellent progress has been made across 
each of the five key pillars that underpin the strategy. 
This has been reflected in robust sales growth, an 
expanded knowledge of our customer preferences, 
further improvements in service levels, many new and 
unique product introductions, progress in building a 
fit for purpose infrastructure and strong growth in our 
value-added service offerings. T o this end, and on behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank our Management team 
and our 10,000 plus colleagues for their hard work and 
commitment in driving the business forward and for their 
passion to help our customers on their journeys.
Performance
We achieved solid sales growth from our Motoring 
activities, in both Retail and Autocentres, and strong 
growth in Cycling where we continued to register 
market share gains and can uniquely offer customers 
the full range: from children’s balance bikes to high 
end performance road bikes. Whilst the depreciation 
in Sterling following the EU referendum and other cost 
headwinds, such as the introduction of the National Living 
Wage, clearly impacted earnings, the underlying business 
performance was positive and cash flow was robust.
We applied our capital allocation policy consistently: 
firstly, by further investment in our colleagues and our 
infrastructure; secondly, with an increased ordinary 
dividend; thirdly, with two complementary acquisitions – 
100% of T redz and Wheelies in May 2016 and a minority 
stake in TyresOnTheDrive.com in January 2017; and, 
thereafter, by paying a special dividend of 10 pence per 
share in February 2017. Progress was thus made towards 
our debt target of 1 times EBITDA. In line with our policy 
of paying an increasing ordinary dividend, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per share, 
payable in August 2017 which would result in a total full-year 
ordinary dividend of 17.51 pence per share, up 3.0% over 
the previous year.
Investment in our colleagues continues to reap benefits 
and I am pleased that Halfords was, for the 4th year in a 
row, awarded an improved place in the list of T op 30 Best 
Big Companies T o Work For. This was also confirmed by 
an increased internally measured engagement score, 
improved customer ratings and lower colleague turnover. 
We are also proud of the recognition we have achieved, 
and the awards won, for our community partnerships, 
including many individual local projects, and for our work 
in prisons to help provide employment to prisoners on 
release. Our colleagues in Retail have progressed strongly 
through the “Gears” training programme, gaining increased 
pay awards and career development opportunities in 
return. We also continued to invest in our leadership 
development programmes and apprenticeship schemes.
Outlook
The year ahead brings challenges in the form of further 
cost headwinds, particularly from a full year’s impact 
in the fall in Sterling, and uncertainty around consumer 
spending, but we approach these from a position of 
strength. We hold leading positions in fragmented 
markets, have detailed plans and initiatives to mitigate 
cost headwinds and our growing service and services 
propositions set us apart as a specialist retailer.
It was disappointing that, earlier this month, our CEO Jill 
McDonald tendered her resignation to take up a senior 
role at M&S at the end of October. We are grateful for the 
positive contribution she has made across the business 
and she will leave Halfords with a clear direction to 
drive future growth. The Moving Up A Gear strategy is 
well underway and is delivering significant momentum 
across the organisation. Crucially, we have a talented 
group of engaged colleagues who remain focused on 
implementing our strategy and providing customers with 
the very best customer service; in doing so we will drive 
sustainable long-term growth.

Chief Executive’s Statement
The underlying business 
performance is strong and we 
remain confident in the long-term 
prospects for the Group.
We are pleased with the sales 
performance this year, with 
growth across all areas of our 
business and market share 
gains in both Motoring and 
Cycling. 
It is now 18 months since we launched the Moving Up A 
Gear strategy, aimed at modernising the business and 
consolidating our position as a specialist, service-led 
retailer in order to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
In this report we set out the strong progress in the year, 
alongside good sales performance and continued market 
share gains.
Strategic Progress
Our goal is to be customers’ first choice for their life on 
the move and we will achieve this by being committed to 
Making Customers’ Journeys Better. Our Group strategy 
has five key pillars:
Putting Customers in the Driving Seat 
— investing in customer data and insight 
capabilities to maximise the lifetime customer 
value 
Service in Our DNA  
— embedding the focus on customer service
Building on Our Uniqueness  
— exclusive products, relevant innovation and 
unique partnerships
Better Shopping Experience  
— a seamless customer experience, online as 
well as in store
Fit for the Future Infrastructure  
— moving from fixing the basics to improving 
efficiency and fulfilment 
On pages 16 and 17 we have set out a more detailed 
explanation of the Group strategy, our progress on each 
of these pillars during FY17 and the key areas of focus  
for FY18. 
Market Update
A full review and update of the markets in which we 
operate is set out on pages 10 and 11.
Alternative Performance Measures
In the reporting of financial information, the Directors 
have adopted various Alternative Performance Measures 
(APMs).
*  These APMs are defined within the Key Performance Indicators 
table on page 18.
** Free Cash Flow is defined on page 40.
Summary of Group Results
Revenue of £1,095.0m was up 7.2%, with like-for-like 
(“LFL”)* growth of 2.7%. Gross margin of 51.0% was 220 
basis points lower than the prior year, predominantly 
due to the impact of the movement in foreign currency 
exchange rates. T otal operating costs before non-
recurring items rose by 5.0% reflecting planned 
investments for the Moving Up A Gear strategy and 
the first-time inclusion of the operating expenditure in 
respect of the acquired Tredz and Wheelies businesses. 
The increase in cost of goods associated with the 
depreciation in Sterling had an adverse impact of circa  
£14m (pre-mitigation) which more than accounted for 
the decline in profit for the year. Underlying EBITDA* was 
down 5.1% to £108.7m. Underlying EBIT* was £77.1m, 
which compares with £84.5m in the prior year. Underlying 
Profit Before Tax* was £75.4m and Underlying Basic 
Earnings Per Share* was 30.3p, down 7.5% and 8.7% 
respectively. Profit after tax for the year was £56.4m 
(FY16: £63.5m).

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   4 6/7/2017   10:47:11 PM slugline
Cash generation remained strong, with Free Cash Flow** 
of £37.7m. Net Debt* at the end of the year was up 
£38.0m at £85.9m, with a Net Debt to Underlying EBITDA 
ratio* of 0.8:1 versus 0.4:1 in the prior year. The increase 
is consistent with our previously stated intention to move 
towards a debt target of 1.0x and reflects our acquisition 
of Tredz and Wheelies in May 2016 for an initial cash 
consideration of £18.0m, the £4.1m investment made in 
Tyres on the Drive Limited (“TOTD”) in January 2017 (with 
a further circa £4m to follow in FY18) and the circa £20m 
special dividend paid in February 2017. 
The Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend 
of 11.68 pence per share (FY16: 11.34 pence) which, if 
approved, would take the full-year ordinary dividend to 
17.51 pence per share, an increase of 3.0% on the prior 
year. Including the special dividend of 10 pence per 
share paid in February 2017, the full-year dividend per 
share was 27.51 pence, an increase of 61.8% on the  
prior year. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 
25 August 2017 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 4 August 2017. 
Retail Operational Review
Halfords Retail achieved a strong year of sales 
performance, with revenue up 8.0% to £938.4m. LFL 
growth of 3.1% reflected Motoring LFL of 2.0% and 
Cycling LFL of 5.1%. Our service-related sales grew by 
11.1% as we continued to consolidate our specialist, 
service-led retail proposition. The LFL sales growth 
is principally attributable to our growing service and 
services proposition, new products and ranges, better 
trained and engaged colleagues and investments made 
to modernise the business as part of the Moving Up A 
Gear strategy.
Within Motoring, Car Maintenance revenues increased 
by 3.1% on a LFL basis, driven by good growth in sales 
of car parts and the fitting and sale of bulbs, blades 
and batteries (“3Bs”). Metal storage and hand tools 
performed very strongly, particularly the increasingly 
popular Halfords Advanced range to which we added new 
products in the year. We were disappointed with the 2.8% 
decline in Car Enhancement LFL revenue, which was 
driven by the continued decline in the sat nav market. 
Partially offsetting this was strong growth in dash cams, 
in-car connectivity equipment and car cleaning products. 
Excluding sat navs, Car Enhancement LFL was up 3.7% 
and sat navs now represent only 3% of Group sales. 
Travel Solutions LFL revenues increased 7.9%, driven by 
robust growth in roof bars and boxes, cycle carriers and 
child seats; all of which benefit from our market-leading 
positions and friendly, highly-trained fitters. 
Cycling sales improved by 5.1% on a LFL basis and 
18.2% on a total sales basis. We took a significant step 
forward in consolidating the Group’s market-leading 
position, growing market share on a like for like basis 
as well as continuing to grow the Cycle Republic chain, 
which grew over 20% like-for-like in the year. Tredz 
and Wheelies also performed strongly in the year, with 
revenue growing over 20%.
The like-for-like growth in Retail was driven by strong 
performances across each of the sub-categories of 
bikes, Parts, Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) and 
repair. PACs sales returned to growth for the first time 
in two years due to stronger attachment sales, new 
products and a more disciplined approach to ranging, 
using our improving customer insight to introduce a 
“good, better, best” hierarchy. Bike sales were supported 
by the relaunch of our mainstream, award winning 
ranges (Carrera and Apollo) as well as the launch of the 
new, exclusive Wiggins range, and growing demand 
for electric bikes. Our credentials in kids’ bikes were 
validated by the public accreditation from Netmums 
during the year, and Boardman won a host of industry 
awards including the prestigious “BikeBiz” bike brand of 
the year.  
Tredz/Wheelies performed strongly since acquisition 
and we were also very pleased with the Cycle Republic 
performance, now trading from 15 shops and online. We 
now have a unique balance in our offering, able to serve 
the lifestyle consumers through our Halfords stores 
and website, the growing commuter population through 
Cycle Republic and the enthusiast and elite segments 
through both Tredz and Boardman Elite. 
Service-related sales increased by 11.1%, driven in 
particular by cycle repair and elements of motoring 
fitting, such as 3B’s and roof boxes. Although currently a 
small part of the mix, our new “2Bs” (bulbs and batteries) 
fitting for motorbikes and windscreen chip repair for 
cars were contributors to growth. Our service capability 
continues to be a key focus for us, with the Gears training 
programme providing depth and breadth of experience 
for colleagues, supporting our ability to establish 
Halfords as a differentiated, service-led specialist retailer. 
Online Retail revenue grew by 30.5% in total and 6.3% 
LFL. The importance of our store network and service 
overlay continued to be highlighted by the strength 
of Click & Collect, with around 85% of Halfords Retail 
online orders picked up in store. This high proportion of 
click and collect continues to differentiate us from other 
retailers, as our online business, instead of cannibalising 
our bricks and mortar operation, drives footfall into our 
stores, with over 80% of customers wanting advice or 
fitting service with their purchase.
We enter the new financial year with good momentum. 
We have published trading performance for the 15 
weeks to the end of April 2017, which includes the 11 
weeks to the end of the financial year and the first 4 
weeks of the new year. We consider this period to be 
more representative of performance because it includes 
Easter in both the current year and the comparatives. 
Revenue for this 15-week period was up 3.9% on a LFL 
basis, comprising Motoring +0.9% and Cycling +11.1%.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Autocentres
Autocentres revenues were up 2.4% and, on a LFL basis, 
up 0.6%. Online sales were strong, with web booking 
revenues up 29.1%. Consistent with our strategic 
priorities of  ‘Service in Our DNA’ and ‘putting customers 
in the driving seat’, it has been a year of long-term 
investment in colleagues and creating an improved offer 
to customers. 
T o benefit colleagues, we have introduced a new 
technician pay grading system this year, to reward both 
teamwork and training. We also continued to invest in 
training and development, with 86 apprentices taken on 
in the year demonstrating our commitment to developing 
young talent and helping our colleagues learn long-
lasting skills. We now have 4 training centres open to 
develop our MOT and hybrid testers. During the year our 
colleague turnover reached the lowest that it has been 
for almost 3 years, reflecting these investments as well 
as the operational changes we introduced. 
T o benefit customers, we have introduced Sunday and 
Bank Holiday opening and are also committed to training 
one technician in every centre in electric and hybrid car 
maintenance by April next year. We are well underway 
on this journey. In addition, 16 centres were refreshed 
during the year and these refreshes included customer 
service pods, TV screens, Wi-Fi, coffee and large viewing 
windows. They resonated well with customers, enhancing 
the shopping experience. 
These operational changes were made for long-term 
benefit, but have been disruptive in the short-term 
and despite many positive developments we were 
dissatisfied with the financial results for the year. 
Accordingly, we are taking a number of actions including 
a review of the operating model. We see a presence in 
the car servicing and repair market as important for the 
Group in order to have a comprehensive suite of services 
for the “second life of the car”. We also see a good 
growth opportunity; we currently only have around a 
1.5% share of a highly fragmented circa £9bn market. We 
will report our conclusions in due course. 
M&A Activity
During the year we expanded the Group’s capabilities 
in motoring and cycling with two modest, highly 
complementary investments. 
In May 2016 we acquired Tredz and Wheelies for an initial 
£18.0m, with a further circa £5m to be paid in the first 
half of FY18. Tredz is a UK-wide online retailer of premium 
bikes and PACs and Wheelies is the UK’s largest provider 
of bicycle replacement for insurance companies. This 
acquisition extends our presence in the online market 
for premium bikes, parts, accessories and clothing, and 
together with our rollout of Cycle Republic means we 
now address all major segments of the cycling market.
In January 2017 we entered into an operating agreement, 
accompanied by the acquisition of a minority stake, with 
TyresOnTheDrive.com (“TOTD”), a UK mobile tyre fitting 
business, to develop opportunities to leverage each 
other’s capability and expertise. We see a number of 
sales and cost synergies as well as the opportunity for 
Halfords to trial an innovative mobile delivery proposition 
for motoring services, which fits squarely with our focus 
on improving our service and convenience credentials. 
We continue to investigate similar opportunities to 
expand our capabilities and strengthen our positions in 
our core markets.
Financial Targets and  
Capital Allocation Priorities 
We continue to apply our four key financial targets: 
• Grow sales faster than the markets in which we 
operate; 
• Hold group EBITDA margin broadly flat over the next 
few years (excluding the impact of FX);
• Grow the ordinary dividend every year with a dividend 
coverage of 2 times on average over time (excluding 
the impact of FX); and
• Net debt target of 1x Underlying EBITDA with a range 
of up to 1.5x.
In the Chief Financial Officer’s review we explain these 
targets in more detail and appraise our performance 
against them.
During the year we made progress towards our debt 
target, moving from 0.4x to 0.8x through consistent 
application of our clear capital allocation priorities. 
Central to our capital allocation policy is to maintain a 
strong and prudent balance sheet, and we will use our 
debt target as a guide for that. Our priorities for use of 
cash will continue to be: firstly, capital investment to grow 
the business in line with previous guidance; secondly, to 
pay and grow the ordinary dividend every year; thirdly, 
for any appropriate M&A opportunities which may arise; 
and thereafter, any excess cash would be available for 
additional distribution to shareholders.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   6 07/06/2017   16:36:09 slugline
Summary and Outlook 
We are pleased with the sales performance in the 
last financial year, with growth across all areas of our 
business and market share gains in both Motoring and 
Cycling. Our focus on, and investment in, services was 
reflected in the significant growth of service-related 
sales. We are also pleased with the momentum building 
as we implement our Moving Up A Gear strategy. There 
is demonstrable progress across each of the five pillars 
of the plan and plenty more to come. Whilst the currency 
movements have impacted on reported earnings, the 
underlying business performance was strong.
Our priorities for the financial year we are now in will 
include further improving and utilising our customer 
data, consolidating our service and services credentials, 
continuing to invest in our colleagues, further investment 
in our online platforms and rolling out our successful new 
store refresh concept.
We enter a challenging period from a macroeconomic 
perspective, with uncertainty over consumer spending 
and Sterling depreciation bringing input cost headwinds. 
However, we approach this on the front foot and from 
a position of strength as we have leading positions 
in fragmented markets and offer a customer driven, 
service-led proposition that differentiates us from 
competitors, both physical and online. 
Our FX headwind mitigation plans are well developed 
and gaining traction. We are seeing the benefits of good 
strategic progress on performance and have not so far 
observed any noticeable adverse impact of a change in 
consumer sentiment on our trading. Taking these factors 
into account we anticipate FY18 profit to be in line with 
current market expectations. 
I would like to thank all colleagues for their fantastic 
contribution, support and commitment to Halfords. Our 
customer-centric, service-led strategy has real traction 
and I have every confidence in the team to drive the 
Moving Up A Gear strategy to the next level so that we 
continue to deliver further progress across the Group.

Our Marketplace
Competitive landscape
Halfords principally operates in two broad markets: 
Motoring and Cycling. Around 70% of Group sales 
are generated from products and services that are 
principally Motoring related with the remaining 
30% coming from Cycling. 
At a profit level, the contribution of Motoring is even greater. 
These markets continue to display generally favourable 
trends and we are particularly well placed to capitalise on 
them, given our strong service and services proposition, 
technical expertise and geographic footprint.
Service and services are key differentiators for us, providing 
us with a unique advantage over much of the competition 
that are either generalist or fragmented independents. This 
is reflected in two key statistics: 80% of our customers want 
some form of advice or service with their purchase and 
around 85% of online sales on Halfords.com are collected in 
store. 
Our Moving Up A Gear strategy is aimed at strengthening our 
position as a customer centric, service-led specialist retailer. 
This, combined with our leading positions in fragmented 
markets, gives us clear competitive advantages and a solid 
platform from which to drive sustainable long-term growth.  
Motoring Market
Market share and competitive landscape
Within Motoring, the Halfords Group operates in two segments:
• Car parts, accessories, consumables and technology, with a 
total market worth up to an estimated £7bn. This element of the 
Motoring market has grown by around 3% per annum in the last 
few years. Halfords Retail competes in a portion of this market, 
holding around a 15% market share.
• Car servicing and aftercare, with a total market worth around £9bn. 
This element of the market has grown by around 2% per annum 
in the last few years and is where Autocentres competes, holding 
around 1.5% share of a highly fragmented market.
There is no single equivalent competitor of Halfords in the UK and these 
motoring markets are highly fragmented. There are over 30,000 garages in 
the UK of which two-thirds are estimated to be independents.
Market trends
New car registrations have grown consistently year on year between 
2012 and 2016. After a record year for new car registrations in 
2016, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (“SMMT”) 
has forecast a decline in new car registrations of 2.6% in 2017. A 
reduction in new car registrations typically results in used cars being 
held onto for a longer time period. Combined with a strong pipeline of 
cars feeding into the used car category, this means that we anticipate 
the used car parc to grow in the years ahead. This will be a positive 
trend for Halfords given that we predominantly support cars that are 
over three years old, what we call the “second life of the car”.
Cars are also becoming more complex and customers increasingly need 
support for small as well as large maintenance jobs. We are seeing an on 
going trend from ‘do it yourself’ to ‘do it for me’, which plays strongly to 
our service and services proposition. Our own market research indicates 
that 80% of Halfords customers want advice or service with their 
purchase. We also identified that 75% of UK consumers have medium to 
low expertise in DIY and are therefore more inclined to pay for someone 
else to “do it for them”. We continue to invest in training and equipment 
to ensure that we remain at the forefront of technological changes, 
such as having the ability to replace stop-start batteries on-demand 
and being able to service electric and hybrid vehicles. We estimate that 
over 50% of the market for car servicing and aftercare is represented 
by independents, who are finding it increasingly challenging to meet the 
increasing complexities of cars and their parts.

We continue to see good growth in segments of our in-car technology 
offering. We are a market leading retailer of in-car cameras (“dash 
cams”) which continued to grow fast in FY17. We are also uniquely 
placed to offer a fitting service for these products; with around 40% 
of dash cam sales fitted into the car. Multimedia, connectivity and 
streaming technology continue to grow as customers look for ways to 
bring their in-car environment more technologically up-to-date. 
The sat nav market continues to decline, but this is becoming an 
increasingly smaller part of our business, now representing only 3% 
of Group sales. Across our stores we have an increasing number of 
accredited child car seat fitters and thousands of colleagues able to 
fit and provide detailed advice on roof bars and boxes, cycle carriers 
and number plates. The expert, friendly advice they provide is unique, 
loved by our customers and key to our further market share gains in 
these areas. 
The services that we offer alongside our products continue to evolve 
and we now offer a suite of over 30 in-store services for motoring 
and cycling, complimenting the continued success of our “3Bs” 
(bulbs, blades, batteries) fitting and cycle repair services.
Going forward we anticipate the Motoring market in which we operate 
to continue to grow at an average rate of 2-3% per annum over the 
medium-term and we continue to aim to better those growth rates 
through our growing service and services proposition.
Market share and competitive landscape
In Cycling, Halfords has strong market shares of around 26% for bikes, 
16% for P ACs and 10% for cycle repair. We estimate these markets to be 
worth annual sales of around £800m, £750m and £100m respectively . 
The majority of our offer is aimed at mainstream, leisure and family 
cyclists. However, the recent acquisition of T redz and Wheelies alongside 
the development of Cycle Republic means we can now meet the needs 
of all key customer segments. Over 80% of the bikes sold by the Group 
are own brands including Apollo, the biggest bike brand in the UK by 
volume, Carrera, the biggest bike brand in the UK by value and Boardman, 
the fastest growing premium bike brand in recent years and voted Bike 
Brand of the year 2017 by BikeBiz. We have added to our own brands this 
year with the launch of the Wiggins range in July 2016, further enhancing 
our portfolio of exclusive collaborations with T eam GB Olympians. Our 
own brands are supported by selected third party brands, which include 
Specialized, Giant, Cannondale, Cube and VooDoo.
The cycling market is highly fragmented. There are an estimated 
2,500 bike shops in the UK. Other than Halfords and a small number 
of chain retailers, the majority of the market is represented by 
independents. As market leader we conduct extensive research 
into customer behaviour and trends, as well as the competitive 
landscape. Over the past year we have identified that the number of 
independent bike shops in the UK has declined by around 10%. 
Market trends
After a difficult year for the cycling market in 2015 due to a 
combination of high stock levels and poor weather, 2016 was better. 
The first part of the year saw a continuation of the conditions observed 
in 2015 compounded by relatively high stock levels in the market and 
poor weather, which prompted heavier and earlier discounting by 
competitors than in previous years. However, the peak summer period 
benefited from warmer weather and the success of T eam GB at the Rio 
Olympics, as well as discounting across the market, which helped to 
clear much of the stock that had been building up in the market. 
Looking ahead we see good growth prospects for the cycling market 
for several reasons:
• participation levels in the UK remain much lower than in many 
other European countries. Despite the increase in popularity of 
the sport in recent years, the number of bikes sold in the UK  has 
remained broadly flat at an average 3.3m bikes per year; 
• the level of female participation also remains very low. Recent 
data suggests that, in the UK, women make up to 27% of cycle 
journeys compared to 55% in Denmark and the Netherlands; 
• the health and wellbeing benefits associated with cycling;
• government infrastructure investment in London and other UK 
cities;
• the rapidly growing e-bike segment, which makes cycling more 
accessible to both commuters and older generations; and 
• we are seeing existing participants in the cycling market spending 
more as they increase the amount they use their bikes.
As evidenced by the differing performance in the early and late summer 
periods this financial year, the weather will continue to have an impact 
on the timing of customer purchase, but the overall trends are positive. 
We expect the cycling market to grow on average at 3-5% per annum 
and we continue to aim to beat that market growth rate, through growing 
our service and services proposition.

Business Review
Over the course of the financial year 
we have been rapidly improving 
our customer data knowledge and 
capability. 
We continue to collect customer email 
addresses across our Retail stores. 
We have gathered around 5.3m email 
addresses within our Retail stores over 
the last 18 months. The majority of 
these customers are new contacts to 
our database.
We can now match 46% of Retail sales to customers, up from 3% 
as of November 2015. We completed the first phase of our ‘single 
customer view’ project, joining up 15 different databases. Across the 
Group we can now match 59% of sales to customers. Investment in 
customer data has allowed us to move from generic email marketing 
to a more personalised approach, which in turn is driving incremental 
revenue and awareness of our services. A few examples include: 
• We have added detailed individualised data into our group single 
customer view, which has informed the timing, content, frequency 
and channel of all communications to customers, based on the 
preferences we infer from their behaviour (for example, a family 
cyclist will see different communications to a camping enthusiast); 
• Over winter we targeted customers on their mobiles with bulbs, 
blades and batteries messages based on the age of their car 
obtained from the DVLA, their proximity to store through their 
mobile phone data and the local weather from the Met Office; and
• We sent geo-targeted messages to customers who live, work or 
shop in the location of our new store in Sutton Coldfield to share 
with them a virtual tour of the revamped store, emailing customers 
who used to shop in the old store to let them know the new one 
was opening. This will be replicated for upcoming store refreshes 
across the estate. 
As a result of these initiatives, we have seen email traffic in FY17 up 
49% against the prior year, with an incremental 1.2m visits to the 
website. Overall, sales attributed to email campaigns were up 19%, 
and open rates were up from 15% to 21%, on average.  
We launched our new brand positioning in June 2016, under the 
strapline of Halfords - For Life’s Journeys. The new campaign is 
helping to drive a clearer understanding of Halfords’ offer, particularly 
amongst younger customers. We have improved the richness of 
online content, with more videos and “how to” guides, reinforcing our 
service credentials online as well as in shops.
Looking ahead to FY18, we will focus on enhancing some key 
initiatives, such as smarter search and guided selling functions, 
to continually improve our personalisation, relevance and to drive 
greater incremental sales.

Business Review
We have a menu of over 30  
in-store services across Motoring 
and Cycling, which are key to 
our uniqueness as a service-led, 
specialist retailer, driving our distinct 
competitive advantage. 
We introduced two new motoring 
services in the year: windscreen chip 
repair and motorcycle bulb and battery 
fitting which are both growing strongly. 
We also introduced new services in cycling, such as bike sizing using 
‘Smartfit’ technology in our recently refreshed concept stores, as well 
as slime puncture proofing. We will be launching many more in-store 
services across both Motoring and Cycling in the months ahead.
We remain focused on growing the important metric of service-
related sales, which we aim to grow faster than overall sales; in 
FY17 we achieved LFL growth of 11.1%. We completed nearly 5 
million fitting services during the year, which equates to over 10,000 
services per Retail store. There remains an opportunity to grow our 
service-related sales through increasing customer awareness of our 
services, as well as  harnessing the trend away from ‘do it yourself’ to 
‘do it for me’.
We have updated our net promoter score methodology with a 
new programme of customer experience measurements in shops, 
weighted according to what matters most to customers. We have 
opened up more channels for customers to give us their feedback, 
including exit interviews as customers leave the store, carried out by 
an external third party and direct links to e-receipts. 
We remain committed to the 3-Gears training programme; nearly 
100% of eligible colleagues are at Gear 1, around 70% of colleagues 
had qualified for Gear 2 by the end of FY17 and we also now have 
circa 10% of colleagues trained to Gear 3 “guru” level, which is in line 
with our target proportions. Going forward we will continually refresh 
existing colleagues’ training and also develop new colleagues.
Our Retail apprenticeship scheme remains popular and we have now 
placed over 40 trainees into permanent roles across our stores. We 
continued to build our pipeline of Assistant Store Managers and Store 
Managers through our Aspire programme; in FY17 we filled 48% of 
store management vacancies internally. 
Retail colleague turnover has further improved during the year to 
record lows and is now circa 33% which will deliver long term benefits 
for the business. We were also pleased to once again be included 
within the Sunday Times Best Big Companies to Work For list, moving 
up to 13th place from 18th place last year. 
As of April 2016 we introduced the National Living Wage for our 
colleagues aged 25 and over, and at the same time introduced our 
20p supplement for all colleagues upon qualifying for Gear 1. This, 
combined with other changes to our pay structures, lifted the pay of 
all colleagues of the Halfords Group to above the minimum wage.
Service in  
Our DNA

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   22 07/06/2017   16:36:40 Case Study: 3-Gears training
In 2013 we launched ‘3-Gears’, a qualification programme that trains and 
rewards colleagues for gaining expertise. 
slugline
The programme is now well embedded and is absolutely core to our 
customer-centric, service-led proposition. 80% of our customers 
want some form of assistance with their purchases and so it is 
imperative that we have a team of engaged, friendly experts.
The three Gears represent the different stages of qualification: 
• GEAR 1 – Gear 1 applies to all colleagues and is completed over 
their first three-month period with Halfords. We use structured 
e-learning modules that cover health & safety, processes & 
policies, retail skills and customer service. The outcome is that all 
store colleagues will be qualified to serve customers confidently 
and receive a pay award.
• GEAR 2 – Gear 2 involves a nine-month training programme which 
leads to an expert level of product knowledge, with a specialism in 
either motoring or cycling. Learning is through e-learning, in-store 
practical and face-to-face training programmes. There are regular 
refresher courses for Gear 2 colleagues and a pay award for those 
who attain this level. 
• GEAR 3 – Gear 3 colleagues are our T echnicians. They are product 
experts who are qualified to perform more advanced services. 
They keep their skills and knowledge current and market leading 
- through workshops, attending product and trade shows and by 
linking with and visiting suppliers. Our T echnicians also receive 
industry recognised qualifications, continuous professional 
development and a pay award. 
At the end of FY17 around 70% of our colleagues had qualified for 
Gear 2 and we had over 500 Gear 3 level colleagues. 
There are many benefits of this investment in training. We have 
more multi-skilled colleagues, which means that rather than having 
one fitter per store, we have many colleagues capable of replacing 
bulbs, wiper blades or batteries, or child car seats, enabling us to 
meet demand. Customer satisfaction measures have also improved 
significantly, reflecting the focus on providing great service as well as 
enhanced technical and product knowledge. Colleague engagement 
has increased, evidenced by Halfords’ listing in the Sunday Times 
Best Big Companies T o Work For (13th place in 2017) and record low 
Retail colleague turnover of 33% at the end of FY17. Finally, we are 
also seeing the benefits in financial outputs. Service-related sales 
have grown strongly and in FY17 we undertook nearly 5 million in-
store services, which equates to over 10,000 per store. We fitted five 
times as many dash cams in FY17 as we did the year before and we 
also achieved a sales growth in child car seats that was double the 
market growth rate.
We have made great progress 
in our ability to match sales to 
customers during the year and also 
in understanding their behaviours 
better. 
Going forward, this will support us 
to raise awareness of our services, 
in-turn becoming more relevant 
to our customers and driving 
incremental sales.

Business Review
Exclusive products, relevant 
innovation and unique partnerships 
all strengthen our clear 
differentiation as a retailer. 
During the year we introduced the 
following new initiatives and products:
• Launched a new range of mainstream adult Carrera and Apollo 
bikes, alongside a new and exclusive Wiggins range;
• Developed our capability of being a market-leading fitter of dash 
cams, differentiating us from online or generalist retailers;
• Launched our “safer seat” campaign helping customers to fit their 
child car seats with greater peace of mind; 
• Enhanced our range of PACs for the Boardman brand, which  won 
Best Bike brand in the prestigious BikeBiz 2017 awards, together 
with a host of other coveted industry awards;
• Launched an exclusive range of Orla Kiely camping and travel 
accessories; and
• Expanded our range of motorcycling parts and accessories.
Tradecard sales grew 14.6% in the year, supported by an enhanced 
central support team and from the enabling of cards to be used online 
for the first time. 
Looking ahead to FY18 we have recently enhanced our range of 
e-bikes, a fast-growing segment of the cycling market, with an 
increased range of new own-brand e-bikes which have been rolled-
out to almost all retail stores from around 120, since the start of April 
2017. We will also be building our Boardman Performance Centre, 
due to open in 2018. This will be a revolutionary cycling research and 
development centre, including a wind tunnel and physiological testing 
and also provide access to the growing ranks of enthusiasts to test 
their capability alongside experts. 
From a services perspective, in Motoring we will be launching 
an ad-blue top-up service and car key fob repair, which will both 
complement and enhance our existing offering.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   24 07/06/2017   16:36:57 Case Study: Exclusive Ranges
Halfords occupies a unique position in the markets in which we operate and 
building upon this further strengthens our clear differentiation. Exclusive 
Ranges are a key part of this. 
We have many exclusive ranges within Halfords, ranging from the 
Halfords Advanced own brand tool ranges, the Halfords own brand 
batteries and bulbs, to our bike brands such as Apollo and Carrera. 
In fact, around 80% of the bikes that we sell across the Group are 
exclusive to Halfords. 
During the year we have continued to enhance our product ranges, 
including:
• New modular tool sets under our Halfords Advanced brand. These 
come with a lifetime guarantee and are becoming increasingly 
popular among professional and amateur mechanics alike.
• A partnership with Olympian and T our de France champion, Sir 
Bradley Wiggins comprising an exclusive range of 10 high quality 
children’s bikes ranging from a balance bike for toddlers to a 
junior road bike. The Wiggins collection of kids’ bikes is Halfords’ 
third venture with an Olympic champion. Halfords also owns the 
Boardman Bike brand launched by Chris Boardman MBE, and also 
launched the exclusive Pendleton range of women’s bikes with 
double Olympic medallist, Victoria Pendleton. 
• A partnership with fashion designer Orla Kiely to bring a new 
and exclusive Olive and Orange range to Halfords. The collection 
includes printed hybrid bikes, cycle accessories, as well as 
camping essentials for festival season. 
In addition to product range enhancements we also continued to add 
to our range of services. We have over 30 in-store services across 
motoring and cycling. In FY17 we introduced two new motoring 
services: windscreen chip repair and motorcycle bulb and battery 
fitting. We also introduced new services in cycling, such as bike sizing 
using ‘Smartfit’ technology in our recently refreshed concept stores, 
as well as slime puncture proofing. We will be launching more in-store 
services across both motoring and cycling in the months ahead.

Business Review
During the year we evolved our Retail 
store refresh concept, opening the 
first of these in Derby in November 
2016 and subsequently opening four 
more by the end of the financial year. 
The previous store programme had 
been successful, delivering good sales 
uplifts, and therefore did not require 
fundamental changes.
However, we have updated the concept to reflect the Moving Up A 
Gear strategy and to incorporate advances in our customer insight 
and technological capabilities. The differences to the previous store 
refresh format include:
• Enhancements to reflect our growing service proposition, 
including customer waiting areas with coffee machines and more 
prominence placed on in-store services to raise awareness;
• T echnological enhancements, including digital imaging bike fitting, 
dedicated hubs for service, technology, click & collect;
• Colleague headsets to enable better communication between 
colleagues supporting better customer service;
• A shop-in-shop feel with clear differences between the Motoring 
and Cycling sections; and 
• New brand positioning internally and externally.
Early signs are very encouraging, both in terms of customer response 
and sales uplifts; the latter running at higher levels than achieved in 
the early days of the previous store refresh iteration. The priority for 
our first store in Derby was to establish a basic blueprint from which 
to roll out at an accelerated rate in FY18. We will continually evolve 
the concept, learning as we go and adding new features. We will also 
launch a “light” version, designed to bring some of the principles to 
stores that do not financially justify a full refresh. In total we anticipate 
refreshing around 30 stores in FY18. 
During the year we successfully rolled-out the use of Apple Pay and 
contactless card payments across the Retail estate, thereby improving 
the in-store shopping experience for our customers. As at March 2017, 
around 50% of in-store transactions were completed using one of these 
new methods. We are also making great progress in mobile, with traffic up 
31% in the year and one in three online orders made using a mobile device 
this year, compared to one in four last year. 
During the year we also implemented a more agile approach to web 
development, whereby we complemented the core digital team at our 
Support Centre in Redditch with a separate web development team in 
central London. 
This enabled us to accelerate the improvement of our websites 
during the year through the following means: 
• Deploying code changes five times more frequently than in the 
prior year; 
• Introducing a guided selling tool, helping customers reach a 
purchase decision through various questions; 
• Redeveloping our mobile check-out process to provide a more 
seamless customer journey; and
• Making a series of incremental changes to drive conversion rates 
across our sites. 
These changes, along with completing a number of site performance 
enhancements, supported the development of richer online content 
and enabled us to maintain our group website performance through 
peak periods. 
By the year-end, Cycle Republic reached 15 stores and represented 
circa 1% of Group revenue. We opened 5 new stores during the 
year in Purley, Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton and Edinburgh.  
We are encouraged by the progress, with strong double-digit LFL 
sales growth and a successful launch of the transactional website 
in August 2016. Building on this success we will continue to roll out 
more stores and further develop the online presence. We anticipate 
opening around 5 stores in FY18.
We are very pleased with the performance of Tredz during the year, as 
sales have grown 22.0% year-on-year in the period since acquisition.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   26 07/06/2017   16:37:03 Case Study: Updated store refresh concept
Physical and IT 
infrastructure
Halfords is a service-led specialist retailer. This is 
reflected in some important statistics:
• 80% of our customers want some form of assistance with their 
purchases. 
• Around 85% of customers shopping on Halfords.com collect their 
purchases in store. 
This means our stores are absolutely central to our proposition and 
we need to continue to invest in them. In 2013 we embarked upon a 
store refresh programme and around 100 stores were refreshed in the 
subsequent three years. This programme was a success with positive 
customer feedback and sales uplifts that justified the capital investment.
Following the launch of our Moving Up A Gear strategy in November 
2015 we decided to take another look at our refresh programme; 
evolving it to reflect improvements in customer data, branding and 
technological capability, and to showcase our key differentiators: 
service and services. In November 2016 we opened the first of these 
new refresh concepts in Derby. We have since refreshed a further 
four stores before the year end. 
The key features of the refresh concept are:
• Greater focus on services, including in-store service menu and 
clearer signage;
• ‘Park up and relax’ lounge, where customers can sit and have a hot 
drink whilst waiting for services on their car or bike;
• Dedicated, covered fitting bays in the car park for on-the-spot 
bulb, blade and battery fittings and other services, such as 
windscreen chip repair;
• Electric car charging points, in support of the growing number of 
electric cars on the road;
• Dedicated hubs within the store for service, parts, technology and 
‘click & collect’;
• Updated design principles, to reflect the “Halfords – For Life’s 
Journeys” brand positioning that was launched in June 2016;
• An exciting new ‘Smart Fit’ centre that enables customers aged 
8 and over to have their measurements taken virtually to find the 
perfect bike for them; 
• Headsets to enable colleagues to communicate instantly 
regardless of whether they are inside or outside the shop; and
• Two distinct ‘shops within a shop’. The cycling area has a softer 
feel, whilst the motoring area is more functional. 
We are learning as we go and we’ll be continually testing new 
concepts along the way. However we are encouraged by the initial 
response, both in terms of customer feedback and sales uplifts. We 
plan to refresh around 30 stores in FY18.

Business Review
After a number of changes in the 
previous two years in our supply 
chain infrastructure, this year has 
been much more stable. 
The delivery-to-store model is fully-
embedded and working well, with 
resilient performance through the peak 
Black Friday and Christmas periods.
Leveraging these firm foundations we took the opportunity to review 
our warehousing arrangements resulting in the consolidation of a 
number of external storage units into a third distribution centre in 
Daventry, adding to our existing centres in Coventry and Redditch. 
This arrangement is broadly cost neutral but is more flexible and 
enables swifter replenishment of stores. 
During the year we also joined up our stock systems, giving us a 
single view of stock for the first time. This enables better fulfilment of 
online purchases and improved availability in stores. 
After a successful pilot we implemented Dayforce (our colleague 
resource planning system) in February and March 2017, removing 
eleven systems and replacing them with one tool that we now use 
across the Group. Colleagues and line managers can log into the 
system to view and change shifts, and the system enables us to 
better optimise scheduling of resource. 
We continue to develop the i-Serve project to replace our till 
hardware and software. This is a major piece of IT change spanning 
stores and Autocentres. We are in pilot stage, including testing the 
mobile tablets and we anticipate rolling out to stores and Autocentres 
towards the end of FY18.  
We remain focused on our successful We Operate For Less 
programme, delivering efficiency improvements. Examples of 
initiatives completed during the year include:
• A new stock put-away process, saving around 3 hours per store 
per week;
• Installing a Click & Collect cabinet at the front of shops, saving 
time for customers and colleagues;
• “Jade”, a secure tool box positioned in the car park, saving around 
2.5 hours per week for colleagues; and 
• Rolling-out colleague headsets, enabling colleagues to share 
knowledge, free-up time and improve customer service.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Colleagues:
Finding, supporting and developing 
great people throughout their 
Halfords journey
We aim to be an inclusive employer of choice, giving colleagues equal 
opportunities to prosper within rewarding and inspiring teams. We 
strive to ensure all colleagues enjoy their work and have opportunities 
to consistently amaze our customers through their friendly expertise. 
In support, we continue to invest in our ‘3-Gears’, apprenticeship and 
leadership development programmes and actively look for ways in 
which we can promote and increase the diversity of our workforce.
A great place to work
For the fourth year running, Halfords Retail has featured in the 
‘Sunday Times 30 Best Big Companies’ T o Work For list, this year 
moving up five places to take 13th place and scoring in the upper 
quartile for questions relating to ‘Recognition for my Contribution’, 
‘Wellbeing’, ‘My T eam’ and ‘My Manager’. 
Friendly expertise
As a business, one of our central strategies is to offer great products 
that are delivered with great service. This is one of the five key 
strategic pillars of our business. We refer to it as ‘Service in Our 
DNA’. T o achieve the highest possible levels of service we invest 
heavily in training our colleagues. As part of this investment we have 
developed a qualification programme called ‘3-Gears’. This plays a 
key role in enabling retail colleagues to achieve industry recognised 
qualifications. They are rewarded as they progress ‘through the gears’ 
by gaining experience and qualifications. 
All colleagues complete Gear 1 within three months of starting.  
Gear 2 involves a nine-month programme leading to an expert level  
of knowledge with a specialism in either Auto & Leisure or Cycling.  
By the end of FY17 we had nearly 70% of the eligible headcount trained 
to Gear 2 level. Colleagues can also complete Gear 3 if nominated 
which gives them ‘technician’ status in either Auto or Cycling and 
enables them to complete complex fits and repairs. So far, we have 
around 10% of eligible colleagues trained to Gear 3 level.
We continually enhance and update our training programmes. This 
year we delivered additional training following new car seat legislation 
and our colleagues who work in our in-store ‘Bikehuts’ benefited from 
specialist training on electric bikes (e-bikes). 
In accordance with our aim to lead the way in the repair of electric and 
hybrid cars, we also began a programme to have a trained mechanic 
at each of our Autocentres in 2018. We were one of the first to deliver 
a new Institute of Motor Industry (“IMI”) Level 2 award and our aim is to 
train more than 300 colleagues to become MOT testers every year.

We have a policy of continuous improvement to support ongoing 
development. We use a blended learning approach which encourages 
colleagues to attain more skills and progress their career throughout 
their Halfords  journey. In 2017, thousands of colleagues took 
advantage of our ongoing development programmes. We operate a 
programme named ‘Aspire’, which is a guided learning suite that offers 
individuals the opportunity to take their careers further and become 
leaders. Since it began,  420 colleagues have benefited from the 
Aspire programme to graduate to new roles as an Assistant Manager 
or a Store Manager. One of the additional benefits of Aspire is that 
over 80% of store manager vacancies are filled internally.
Right job, right person, right time 
We recognise the value that diversity brings and we continue on our 
journey to address the balance in some inherently male-dominated 
areas. We understand that this will take time but in recent years we 
have made great progress on our gender strategy. Women now 
represent 50% of our Board, 40% of our senior management team 
and 23% of our total population of employees (which is an increase 
from 22% in 2016). We have also introduced development resources 
aimed specifically at supporting women. 
In our retail business, we continue to invest in our apprenticeship 
programme and will be launching the new apprenticeship standards 
this academic year. In addition, our traineeship programme for NEETS 
(not in education, employment or training) has resulted in the placing 
of 159 trainees to date. 
Our work at Onley Prison where we train inmates to build and repair 
bikes, with a view to offering future employment for those who 
successfully pass our qualifying criteria, has been a great success. 
We are very proud that this programme won Retail Week’s ‘CSR 
Initiative of the Year’. We have built on this success and during the 
year opened a second Cycle Academy at Drake Hall Women’s Prison. 
Upon release, one of the graduates of our Cycle Academy started 
as a bike technician at one of our stores and is now training to be an 
assistant manager.
Case Study: Scoring a try 
with Dallaglio RugbyWorks
Halfords Autocentres began operating an 
apprenticeship scheme over 22 years ago and now 
runs one of the largest motor schemes in the UK, 
with 213 of the current cohort at differing stages 
of their three-year programme.
The true value of apprenticeships lies in how they provide people 
with the opportunity to develop skills that they might not have 
been able to achieve through education alone. 
In 2016 the Autocentres team started working with Dallaglio 
RugbyWorks to take on young people who have participated in 
its social inclusion programme. The charity’s coaches work with 
young people across the UK, between the ages of 14 and 17, 
who are outside of mainstream education.

People benefited from free workshops
Community:
Helping to keep families safer on their 
journeys and encouraging an active 
lifestyle
We know that parents recognise the great benefits that are derived 
from cycling, but we are also aware that they can be concerned about 
it because they want to ensure it is as safe as possible and that both 
they, and their children, are able to fix things should any problems 
occur. T o improve their confidence in these areas we have organised 
workshops where our colleagues can share their knowledge and 
expertise and so give customers the confidence to get out on their 
bikes. The majority of workshops focus on primary school children, an 
age when they are often starting to cycle without adults and are also 
doing the ‘Bikeability’ programme.
Kids bike workshops 
In FY17, over 18,500 children and their parents attended free in-store 
bike workshops. These workshops significantly help to improve their 
skills in basic bike maintenance and cycling safely, giving parents and 
children greater confidence to go out cycling more. 
School bike workshops
Our colleagues also went out to primary schools to teach bike 
maintenance and safety to pupils in their final year. Complementing 
the Government scheme known as ‘Bikeability’, which teaches 
children how to ride a bike safely, our ‘Gear-Up’ workshops teach 
basic bike maintenance and so help children to cycle more safely by 
recognising, and so being able to avoid, safety hazards. These are 
important skills for pupils who are preparing to make the transition to 
secondary school. Over 5,100 pupils benefited from the programme 
in FY17.

Partnering with organisations 
British Cycling’s Breeze 
We understand the fear many adults have of getting back on a bike 
after years out of the saddle so, to help, we partnered with British 
Cycling’s Breeze network. In addition to promoting the women’s 
network to customers on our website and through emails, in FY17 
we ran bike maintenance workshops in partnership with Breeze, with 
over 1,600 women attending. The partnership has also provided the 
opportunity for colleagues to become Breeze champions.
Cub bike workshops
Through our partnership with the Scouts Association, in FY17 we 
helped over 3,300 Cubs achieve their Cyclist Activity Badge. In 
addition to running an in-store workshop, a resource pack also 
supports Cub Leaders, guiding them through requirements for Cubs 
to achieve their cycle badge.
Case Study: School kids 
‘wheeling for joy’ with free 
bikes from Halfords
For some families, buying a bike can be too 
much of a stretch when they’ve got other, more 
immediate household bills to pay. To help address 
this, schools across the country are benefiting from 
a scheme to help encourage more children, who 
may not necessarily have access to bikes, to cycle.
In a virtuous cycle the bikes are donated by members of 
the public, they are then re-conditioned at one of our cycle 
workshops in Onley and Drake Hall prisons, which train prisoners 
to be professional cycle mechanics, before being donated along 
with new helmets to disadvantaged schools.
So far, over 400 bikes have been donated.

Environmental Management:
Managing our impact on the 
environment in a responsible and 
ethical manner
We know that our work has an impact on the environment and that we 
have a duty to manage that impact in a responsible and ethical manner. 
We do this through identifying all significant environmental impacts 
and putting processes into place to prevent, reduce and mitigate them. 
T o meet our commitment of protecting the environment, we aim to: 
• comply with all relevant environmental legislation;
• operate our business in a way that protects the environment;
• promote environmental awareness to colleagues and enlist their 
support in improving the Company’s performance with training 
and instruction;
• minimise waste by making sure processes are as efficient as 
possible;
• look to reduce energy and water usage;
• promote recycling internally and with our suppliers and customers;
• minimise the environmental impact of our logistics activities; and 
• continually develop our environmental management system.

Building and maintaining the highest 
standards amongst our suppliers
We are committed to maintaining the highest standards amongst our 
suppliers. We are strongly opposed to the exploitation of workers and 
we will not tolerate forced labour, or labour which involves physical, 
verbal or psychological harassment, or intimidation of any kind. 
We will not accept human trafficking or the exploitation of children 
and young people in our business and undertake all possible steps to 
ensure that these high standards are maintained. We regularly review 
related policies to ensure that they remain up-to-date and fit-for-
purpose. 
Case Study:  
Smart Solutions
Case Study: Testing 
environmental enhancements
In 2013, we introduced national trade-in events. 
These are run in addition to our ongoing bike 
donations at over 75 shops. 
We invite customers to donate their unwanted bikes to charity and 
so support a sustainable and life changing cause. Our core charity 
partner is Re~Cycle, who divert unwanted bikes from landfill/disuse 
and donate them to people and communities both in the UK and 
in Africa. This programme really does transform the lives of those 
who benefit from it.
In February 2017, a team of colleagues from Halfords, who had won 
our ‘Journey of a Lifetime’ competition, went to see for themselves 
the benefit that the donated bikes have provided. Fundraising, 
collecting bikes, loading a container and following it over to Gambia, 
they met with partners there on the ground, as well as delivering 
bike workshops to local children. Commenting on the adventure, the 
team’s leader Stephen Roche, said: “It was a fantastic experience 
and great to see the real difference every single bike makes. We 
loved the trip from start to finish!” Our partnership with Re~Cycle has 
raised nearly £400,000 and has changed the lives of over 180,000 
people in Africa from the 30,000 bikes donated, diverting over 450 
tonnes from potential landfill waste.
The opening of our new Derby store, to 
begin testing different concepts, provided an 
opportunity to introduce new environmental 
features, including:
• LED lights throughout on motion and daylight sensors;
• back of house lights on motion sensors, warehouse 
lights also include auto dimming to help reduce energy 
consumption levels; and
• air movement fans – low energy/high performance air 
movement fans installed, reducing running costs and moving 
air more efficiently.

Group revenue in FY17, at £1,095.0m, was up 7.2% and comprised 
Retail revenue of £938.4m and Autocentres revenue of £156.6m. This 
compared to FY16 Group revenue of £1,021.5m, which comprised 
Retail revenue of £868.5m and Autocentres revenue of £153.0m. 
Group gross profit at £558.6m (FY16: £543.1m) represented 51.0% 
of Group revenue (FY16: 53.2%), reflecting a decrease in the Retail 
gross margin of 260 basis points (“bps”) to 48.6% partially offset by 
an increase in the Autocentres gross margin of 80 bps to 65.1%.
T otal Operating Costs before non-recurring items increased to 
£481.5m (FY16: £458.6m) of which Retail represented £379.8m 
(FY16: £363.0m), Autocentres £99.8m (FY16: £94.5m) and 
unallocated costs £1.9m (FY16: £1.1m). Unallocated costs 
represent amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets 
acquired through business combinations, namely the acquisition of 
Autocentres in February 2010, Boardman Bikes in June 2014 and 
Tredz and Wheelies in May 2016, which arise on consolidation of the 
Group.  
Group Underlying EBITDA* decreased 5.1% to £108.7m (FY16: 
£114.6m), whilst net finance costs before non-recurring items were 
£1.7m (FY16: £3.0m). Group Underlying EBITDA margin, one of our 
financial targets, was 9.9% (FY16: 11.2%).
Underlying Profit Before Tax* for the year was down 7.5% at £75.4m 
(FY16: £81.5m). Non-recurring items of £4.0m (FY16: £1.7m) 
across Retail and Autocentres related primarily to costs associated 
with the acquisition of Tredz and Wheelies and investment in 
TyresOnTheDrive.com, the settlement of a historic legal case and 
organisational restructure costs. After non-recurring items, Profit 
Before Tax in the year was £71.4m (FY16: £79.8m).

Chief Financial Officer’s Review
Revenue for the Retail business of £938.4m reflected a like-for-like 
(“LFL”)* sales increase of 3.1%. Non-LFL sales, including five new 
Cycle Republic store openings since the prior year, and the acquired 
Tredz and Wheelies businesses contributed £53.3m revenue in the 
year.
Motoring sales represented 62.0% of Retail sales and LFL grew by 
2.0%. Car Maintenance LFL revenues increased by 3.1%, reflecting 
strong growth in the sale and fitting of bulbs, blades and batteries 
(“3Bs”) and good growth in workshop products, particularly the 
increasingly popular Halfords Advanced range to which we added 
new products during the year. Our new motorcycling parts and 
accessories ranges also performed well. 
Car Enhancement LFL revenues declined by 2.8% reflecting the 
continued decline in the market for sat navs. This was partially offset 
by excellent growth in dash cams, with our range authority and 
increasingly popular fitting service consolidating our market-leading 
position in this category. Car cleaning also performed well, supported 
by new product ranges such as Christmas gift packs. Travel Solutions 
LFL revenues increased 7.9% LFL, driven by strong growth in roof 
bars, roof boxes, cycle carriers and child car seats.
Cycling sales grew by 5.1% on a like-for-like basis and 18.2% in 
total after including new Cycle Republic stores and the acquisition 
of Tredz and Wheelies. The like-for-like growth was driven by strong 
performances across each of the sub-categories of bikes, Parts, 
Accessories and Clothing (“PACs”) and repair. 
Bike sales were supported by the relaunch of our Apollo and Carrera 
mainstream cycle ranges and the launch of the exclusive Wiggins 
range, as well as the cycling promotion and favourable weather in the 
peak summer period. Cycle Republic sales grew by strong double-
digit LFL and we opened 5 new stores.

Tredz & Wheelies) are split by category below:

Gross profit for the Retail business at £456.6m (FY16: £444.8m) 
represented 48.6% of sales, 260 bps down on the prior year  
(FY16: 51.2%). This movement is explained as follows: 
• Circa 80 bps decline from the inclusion of Tredz and Wheelies, 
which operate in the lower-margin-percentage but higher average 
selling price category of premium cycling; 
• Circa 150 bps from the gross impact of the depreciation of 
Sterling against the US Dollar; and 
• Circa 30 bps decline from the adverse mix impact of faster cycling 
sales growth and the cycling promotion in the first half, partially 
offset by the favourable mix impact from service-related sales and 
the FX mitigation measures, which started to take effect towards 
the end of the year. 
Operating Costs before non-recurring items were £379.8m (FY16: 
£363.0m) and, improved as a percentage of Retail sales from 41.8%

volumes leading to incremental investment in store hours. The opening 
of 5 Cycle Republic stores also contributed to the increase.
Store Occupancy costs increased by 0.2%, reflecting broadly flat rent 
and rates costs on the existing estate with incremental costs arising 
from new Cycle Republic stores.
Warehouse & Distribution costs decreased by 0.7%, driven by cost 
savings in the first half when the more efficient 3-day-a-week delivery-
to-store schedule annualised against the 5-day-a-week model 
operating at the start of the previous year.
Support Costs increased by 1.8% due to higher depreciation charges 
on non-store-related capital expenditure and a modestly increased 
marketing spend. T redz and Wheelies added £8.2m of operating costs 
since acquisition. Going forwards these costs will be allocated to the 
cost categories presented in the table above.

Autocentres generated total revenues of £156.6m (FY16: £153.0m), 
an increase of 2.4% on the prior year with a LFL revenue increase of 
0.6%. Online-booking revenues grew 29.1% in the year. Gross profit 
at £102.0m (FY16: £98.3m) represented a gross margin of 65.1%; 
an increase of 80 bps on the prior year, reflecting improved margins 
across Service, MOT, repair and tyres. 
Autocentres’ underlying EBITDA* of £7.6m was 11.6% lower 
than FY16 (FY16: £8.6m), with the upside in gross profit offset by 
continued cost investments as part of the long-term growth plans. 
Underlying EBIT* was £2.2m (FY16: £3.8m). 
As referred to in the CEO Statement, we are dissatisfied with the 
financial results for the year and are taking a number of actions to 
improve performance. 
As part of pre-existing strategic plans we have taken the decision to 
cease participation in a tyre affiliate programme, having determined 
that it was generating insufficient net profit for the workload capacity 
that it consumed in our centres. 
We anticipate the impact of this to result in a decline in LFL sales in 
FY18, accompanied with an improvement in gross margin percent, 
such that there is a net profit benefit year-on-year from this initiative.
Portfolio Management  
The Retail store portfolio at 31 March 2017 comprised 479 stores 
(end of FY16: 472). 
The following table outlines the changes in the Retail store portfolio 
over the year:

Of the six openings in the Retail portfolio, five were Cycle Republic. 
Management anticipates opening around five Cycle Republic stores 
in FY18.
17 Retail stores were refreshed in the year (FY16: 25) and 
management anticipates refreshing 30 in FY18.
Five new Autocentres were opened and six were closed during the 
year, taking the total number of Autocentre locations to 313 as at  
31 March 2017 (end of FY16: 314). 16 Autocentres were refreshed in 
the year (FY16: 24).
With the exception of eight long leasehold and two freehold 
properties within Autocentres, the Group’s operating sites are 
occupied under operating leases, the majority of which are on 
standard lease terms, typically with a 5 to 15-year term at inception 
and with an average lease length of less than 7 years.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review
Net Non-recurring Items
The following table outlines the components of the non-recurring 
items recognised in the year:
FY17 
£m
FY16 
£m
Organisational restructure costs (0.6) (1.7)
Costs in relation to a historic legal case (0.8) —
Acquisition and investment related fees (1.7) —
Operating lease obligation (0.3) —
Net non-recurring operating expenditure (3.4) (1.7)
Acquisition related interest charge (0.6) —
Net non-recurring items (4.0) (1.7)
In the current and prior year £0.6m and £1.7m of costs were 
respectively incurred in relation to separate and unrelated 
organisational restructuring initiatives across Autocentres and Retail. 
During the year a court case was settled relating to activities during 
FY12, resulting in costs of £0.8m.
Acquisition costs of £1.7m (FY16: £nil) in the period related to the 
costs associated with the purchase of the entire share capital of 
Tredz and Wheelies, and the minority investment in TyresOnTheDrive.
com. The interest element relates to the unwinding of the discounting 
applied to the contingent consideration due on the acquisition of 
Tredz, which will be paid in the first half of FY18.
The operating lease obligation of £0.3m in FY17 related to 
rectification work unique to one of the Group’s retail stores, which 
was required to make good an area of land upon which the store is 
located. 
Net Finance Costs
The Net Finance Costs excluding acquisition related interest charge 
for the year was £1.7m (FY16: £3.0m). The primary driver of the lower 
costs was £1.4m income (FY16: £0.1m expense) in relation to points 
on foreign exchange forward contracts. 
Taxation
The taxation charge on profit for the financial year was £15.0m (FY16: 
£16.3m), including a £0.9m credit (FY16: £0.3m credit) in respect 
of non-recurring items. The effective tax rate on profit before tax 
and non-recurring items of 21.0% (FY16: 20.5%) was higher than 
the UK corporation tax rate (20.0%) principally due to the effect of 
non-deductible depreciation and amortisation charged on capital 
expenditure. For FY18 we anticipate the effective tax rate to be  
circa 20%.
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Underlying Basic EPS* was 30.3 pence and after non-recurring items 
28.7 pence (FY16: 33.2 pence, 32.5 pence after non-recurring), an 
8.7% and 11.7% decrease on the prior year. Basic weighted-average 
shares in issue during the year were 196.6m (FY16: 195.2m).
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per 
share (“DPS”) (FY16: 11.34 pence), taking the full year ordinary 
dividend to 17.51 pence per share, an increase of 3.0%. If approved 
the final dividend will be paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders on 
the register at the close of business on 4 August 2017. Including the 
10.00 pence special dividend paid in February 2017 the total full year 
dividend is 27.51 pence.
We continue to target coverage of around 2 times on average over 
time. However, the impact of adverse FX movements will reduce cover 
initially until fully mitigated, which will take some time. 
Capital Expenditure
Capital investment in the year totalled £36.1m (FY16: £40.3m) 
comprising £29.5m in Retail and £6.6m in Autocentres. This total 
includes £1.8m of assets capitalised through the acquisition of Tredz 
& Wheelies in May 2016.
Within Retail, £11.5m (FY16: £13.4m) was invested in stores, 
including 17 store refreshes, 9 of which were also store relocations 
or right-sizes, 5 new Cycle Republic stores as well as general capital 
spend relating to training rooms, roofing, flooring and heating. By 
the end of FY17, 114 (FY16: 87) stores were trading in either the 
latest or preceding refresh format. Additional investments in Retail 
infrastructure included a £12.5m investment in IT systems, such as 
continual development of the online Retail proposition, the ‘Dayforce’ 
integrated people management solution, development of the ‘iServe’ 
till hardware and software project, and a Cycle Republic website.
The £6.6m (FY16: £8.2m) investment in Autocentres comprised the 
opening of 5 centres in the year (FY16: 11) along with an investment 
in refreshing centres and new equipment.
On a cash basis, total capital expenditure in the year was £34.4m 
(FY16: £38.5m).
In FY18 we anticipate capital expenditure to be circa £40m, split 
broadly half on store refreshes and half on IT investments. We 
anticipate the Group depreciation and amortisation charge to be 
circa £33m for FY18.
Inventories
Group inventory held as at the year-end was £191.1m (FY16: 
£157.9m). Retail inventory increased to £189.8m (FY16: £156.6m) 
comprising c. £14m from the impact of foreign exchange, c. £13m 
stock build for Easter and new ranges (such as e-bikes, launched 
in the final week of the year) and £5.9m Tredz & Wheelies inventory. 
Autocentres’ inventory was £1.3m (FY16: £1.4m).
Cash flow and Borrowings
Operating Cash Flow** during the year was £90.0m (FY16: £103.7m). 
Free Cash Flow*** of £37.7m (FY16: £45.4m) was generated in the 
year. Group Net Debt* was £85.9m (FY16: £47.9m), with the Net Debt to 
Underlying EBITDA ratio* at 0.8:1.
* Definitions to these Alternative Performance Measures are shown on page 18
** Operating Cash Flow is defined as Underlying EBITDA plus share based 
payment transactions and loss on disposal of property, plant and 
equipment, less working capital movements and movements in provisions.
*** Free Cash Flow is defined as Operating Cash Flow (as defined above) 
less capital expenditure, net finance costs, taxation and fair value gain on 
derivatives.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   40 07/06/2017   16:37:21 slugline
Financial Targets
We continue to apply four key financial targets, which we reaffirm and appraise ourselves against below:
DESCRIPTION FY17 PERFORMANCE
1 Grow sales faster than the markets in which we operate. We 
continue to anticipate that the motoring market will grow at an 
average rate of 2-3% per annum and the cycling market at an 
average rate of 3-5% per annum over the medium term.  We will 
aim to beat whatever those growth rates are.
In Retail we gained share in both motoring and cycling. In 
Autocentres we gained share on a total sales basis, whilst the 
operational changes had a short-term impact on like-for-like 
performance.
2 Maintain Group EBITDA % margin roughly flat as we continue 
to invest for sustainable growth. The impact of adverse FX 
movements will reduce margin initially, until fully mitigated, which 
will take some time.
Group EBITDA margin was 9.9% (FY16: 11.2%). Excluding the 
impact of adverse foreign exchange movements, EBITDA margin 
was broadly flat in FY17 compared to FY16.
3 Grow the dividend per share every year, with coverage of 
around 2 times on average over time. The impact of adverse FX 
movements will reduce cover initially, until fully mitigated, which 
will take some time. 
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 11.68p, which would 
take the full year dividend to 17.51p, an increase of 3.0% on the 
previous year.
4 A debt target of 1.0x Underlying EBITDA with a range of up to 
1.5x to allow for appropriate M&A. We anticipate moving towards 
the debt target over time. 
We have moved from 0.4x to 0.8x net debt to Underlying EBITDA 
in FY17 through the consistent application of our capital allocation 
priorities which resulted in M&A of circa £22m and a special 
dividend of circa £20m.
Brexit
The decision of the UK to leave the European Union (“Brexit”) 
presents significant uncertainties to the Group as a result of the 
impact on the wider UK economy. The main areas in which Brexit is 
likely to impact the Group are as follows:
• Impact on foreign currency exchange rates – the value of Sterling 
fell by nearly 20% since FY16. The Group buys a significant 
proportion of its goods in US Dollars; between $250m and 
$300m a year. At a spot rate of £1:$1.25 the total FX headwind 
pre mitigation is nearly £50m of annual cost inflation compared to 
the FY16 average rate flowing through cost of sales of $1.60. Our 
hedging programme means that this phases into our P&L roughly 
as follows: circa £14m in FY17, a further circa £25m in FY18 and 
a further circa £10m in FY19. Good progress is being made on FX 
mitigation, through supplier negotiations, operational efficiencies 
and pricing. We are seeing prices rise in the cycling market, both 
from suppliers into retailers and then onto customers. Some of 
our prices have also risen, but we continue to look to maintain 
good value against the competition. It is early days and we are yet 
to see how wider cost inflation impacts on consumer spending 
more generally, however we are encouraged by the limited volume 
impact observed to date. We continue to anticipate that we will 
fully recover the FX impact over time.
• Prolonged uncertainty over exit terms and continued weakness 
in Sterling could lead to a slowdown in the UK economy, and 
consequent loss of consumer confidence, impacting trading 
conditions for the Group. However, Halfords has strong positions 
in fragmented Motoring and Cycling markets, and a service-led 
offer that differentiates us from our competitors, physical and 
online.  Much of our sales are in needs-based categories that are 
more resilient to macro-economic cycles and our discretionary 
categories, such as cycling, camping and travel solutions, could 
benefit from an increase in the number of people choosing to stay 
at home rather than holidaying abroad; a trend that we observed 
in 2009. 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The Board considers risk assessment, identification of mitigating 
actions and internal control to be fundamental to achieving Halfords’ 
strategic corporate objectives.  In the Annual Report & Accounts the 
Board sets out what it considers to be the principal commercial and 
financial risks to achieving the Group’s objectives. The main areas of 
potential risk and uncertainty in the balance of the financial year are 
described on pages 42 to 47 and note 21 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts.  These include:
• Economic risks; including market risks
• Business strategy risks
• Competitive risks
• Compliance
• Supply chain disruption
• Product and service quality
• Information technology systems and infrastructure; and
• Dependence on key management personnel
Specific risks associated with performance include Christmas 
trading as well as weather-sensitive sales, particularly within the Car 
Maintenance and Cycling categories in the Retail business.

Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and uncertainties that 
could impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy.  These 
risks are accepted as being a part of doing business.  The Board 
recognises that the nature and scope of these risks can change and 
so regularly reviews them as well as the systems and processes to 
mitigate them.
Our corporate risk register is maintained by the Head of Internal Audit 
and Risk and is regularly updated following discussions with executives 
and senior management.  It is subject to an annual in-depth review 
by the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee is also alerted to any 
material changes to the register at each of its meetings.  The Board is 
regularly updated on Audit Committee proceedings.
The Directors have therefore carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Corporate Governance Report on pages 58 to 69 further 
discusses the Board’s responsibilities in relation to risk management 
and internal control systems.
Senior management colleagues assess risks on a department-by-
department basis using a variety of techniques to identify risk. The 
likelihood and impact of these risks are considered and scored against a 
recognised framework dependent upon their effect on the achievement 
of our corporate objectives. Responsibility for taking the necessary 
actions to manage risk is delegated to appropriate colleagues in the 
business, with executive manager sponsor involvement. 
Mindful of corporate strategy, executive management and the Board 
consider the risks reported within the risk register and review and 
monitor new risks and all mitigating actions to ensure that the Group’s 
appetite for risk is not exceeded. The Board recognises that each of 
its strategic pillars could be compromised by any of the risks set out 
below. Individual ‘Moving Up A Gear’ initiatives are reliant on some of 
the mitigations identified. For example, ‘Service in Our DNA’ delivery is 
reliant on full utilisation of our online training system and on our ability 
to attract and retain good colleagues. ‘Better Shopping Experience’ is 
reliant on our continuing investment in modernisation of our stores.
The Group has discussed its risk register with its insurance broker 
and ensures that it has cover to help to mitigate significant risks 
where practicable and cost-effective.
Specific financial risks (e.g. liquidity, foreign currency) are detailed in 
note 21 to the Financial Statements on page 133.

1. Economic, Environmental and Political
The economy is a major influence 
on consumer spending. Trends 
in employment, inflation, 
taxation, consumer debt levels, 
weather and interest rates 
impact consumer expenditure 
in discretionary areas. Changes 
in Government policies (e.g. 
Cycle to Work) may also affect 
our customers’ ability to benefit 
from our products and services.  
Withdrawal from the EU may 
have an impact on consumer 
spending, please refer to page 41 
for further information.
The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining a focus on 
the ‘defensive’ characteristics of its ‘needs driven’ product 
groups. A firm focus is maintained on cost control. Targeted 
promotions and excellent service are designed to attract and 
retain customers.  Advanced econometric modelling is used to 
understand the effect of weather conditions on our business 
and we ensure that marketing and merchandising can be 
revised quickly.
We also ensure that we have representation with 
Governmental decision-makers in the areas supporting our 
core categories, both directly and through membership of 
trade bodies.
2. Business Strategy
The aim of the Group’s business 
strategy is to deliver long-term 
value to our shareholders. 
The Board understands that 
if the strategy and vision are 
inappropriately formulated, 
communicated, or executed then 
the business will suffer.
Key investments and acquisitions 
could fail to deliver sufficient 
returns.  The Autocentres and 
Cycle Republic businesses, and 
our new acquisitions, could fail to 
meet growth expectations.
The Group has set out its ‘Moving Up A Gear’ strategy. 
Strategic issues are regularly reviewed at Board meetings. 
Regular assessment is made to ensure that strategy remains 
appropriate, and that the business is making progress in 
meeting its strategic objectives. KPIs relating to strategy have 
been communicated clearly, both within the business and to 
the market. These KPIs are regularly discussed by the Board. 
Our budget process recognises the importance of strategic 
initiatives.
The Group has delegated authorities processes to approve 
significant investments, including review by an Investment 
Committee and the Board.  We have recently created the 
post of ‘Business Transformation Director’, an executive level 
role with a Group-wide remit to oversee strategic project 
management.
Autocentres, Cycle Republic and our new acquisitions have 
dedicated, experienced management teams supported by 
appropriate infrastructure and allocated resources. The 
businesses have their own websites.  The performances of 
these businesses are closely monitored by the Board.

3. Competition
The retail industry is highly 
competitive and dynamic. The 
Group competes with a wide 
variety of retailers of varying 
sizes and faces competition from 
UK retailers, in both shops and 
online, as well as international 
operators. The car servicing 
market is a service-based market 
with a number of different-sized 
providers where trust is extremely 
important to customers. Failure 
to compete with competitors on 
areas including price, product 
range, quality, service and 
trustworthiness could have an 
adverse effect on the Group’s 
financial results.
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK retailers both in-
shop and online, and from the national car-servicing networks 
and smaller independents.
We have a significant investment programme to support 
‘Moving up A Gear’. The investment programme is allowing us 
to improve the service we provide to customers by improving 
the quality of our shops, IT infrastructure, training and website 
(including optimisation for mobile and tablet devices). Excellent 
service is fundamental to differentiating ourselves from our 
competitors. We are increasing the number of sales that we are 
able to associate with individual customers.
The national geographical coverage of our shops underpins our 
‘Click & Collect’ offering. Our WeFit service is a key differentiator. 
Our Cycle Repair and extended Parts, Accessories and Clothing 
range offer confirm our credibility within the Cycling market.
The Group seeks to continually strengthen its ‘own-brand’ retail 
offer and develop opportunities to differentiate the Halfords 
brand, including TV, radio, press and social media advertising.  
We also have high profile partnerships to market brands like 
‘Pendleton’, ‘Wiggins’, ‘Boardman’ and ‘Orla Kiely’.
Our Autocentres business continually seeks to provide 
innovative solutions for their customers, such as ‘brakes4life’.
Particular attention is given to the changes to our marketplace 
that are driven by the ‘connected car’. The retail motoring 
team, digital team, and Autocentres management are working 
collaboratively to respond to opportunities and threats.
4. Compliance
The Group operates in an 
environment governed by 
legislation and codes in areas 
including, but not limited to, 
Listing Rules, trading standards, 
advertising, product quality, health 
and safety, hazardous substances, 
Bribery Act and data protection.
The Group recognises that failure 
to comply with ethical standards 
could expose the business to 
reputational risk and loss of 
goodwill.
Regulatory requirements are closely monitored by our Company 
Secretarial team which includes colleagues with relevant 
professional qualifications and experience. The Group has 
Quality Assurance and Compliance teams working in both 
the Retail and Autocentres businesses. Specialist Health and 
Safety teams ensure that the Group has adequate policies and 
risk assessments. Retail margin erosions are minimised by a 
dedicated profit protection team.
Colleagues and management are trained to identify and handle 
in-shop regulatory issues using Gears training modules on our 
online Learning Management System. We have a Whistleblowing 
hotline that allows colleagues to raise concerns in confidence.
We operate a Code of Conduct that clearly sets out our 
expectations of suppliers. We have a corporate delegated 
authorities framework (How We Do Business) setting out key 
authorisation levels. Anti-bribery and corruption training, and 
training on anti-competitive behaviours have been delivered 
through face-to-face and online training sessions.
The Group has a dedicated Investor Relations T eam which 
ensures that there is frequent and appropriate communication 
with investors and the wider financial community.
The Group has a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility 
Committee, which calls upon cross-functional support as 
required. The Group has a comprehensive record of community 
engagement through events such as children’s bike workshops, 
and support of the Re~Cycle charity.  Our training programme 
at HMP Onley was judged ‘CSR Initiative of the Year’ at the 2017 
Retail Week awards.

5. Supply Chain Disruption
Halfords sources a significant 
proportion of the merchandise it 
sells in its shops from outside of 
the UK, either directly or via third-
party suppliers. Consequently, 
the Group is subject to the risks 
associated with international 
trade (particularly those which 
are common in the import of 
goods from developing countries) 
including, but not limited to, 
inflation, currency fluctuation, 
the imposition of taxes or other 
charges on imports, the exposure 
to different legal standards, the 
burden of complying with a variety 
of foreign laws and changing 
foreign government policies and 
natural disasters.  UK withdrawal 
from the EU is likely to impact 
on our supply chain, although 
it is currently very difficult to 
predict how, pending ongoing 
government negotiations.
The Group could also be impacted 
in the event of disruption to 
domestic logistic arrangements; 
for example, unavailability of 
distribution centres or road 
transport problems.
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics before 
the Group procures products from any new country or supplier. 
The Group’s strong management team in the Far East blends 
expatriate and local colleagues. It understands the local culture, 
market regulations and risks and we maintain very close 
relationships with both our suppliers and shippers to ensure that 
disruption to production and supply are managed appropriately.
We work with suppliers in a number of territories to reduce 
the risks of disruption, and we monitor sourcing opportunities 
nearer to the UK.
We maintain firm security and protection measures at our 
distribution centres. We have business continuity plans 
to manage any incidents that may occur. Our logistics are 
overseen by an experienced, dedicated warehouse and 
logistics team who maintain contacts with a range of logistics 
businesses who could be utilised if necessary.  We are closely 
monitoring Brexit developments and preparing contingency 
plans for any changes in the nature of the border between the 
UK and the Republic of Ireland.

6. Product and Service Quality and Brand Reputation
The Board recognises that the 
quality and safety of both our 
products and services in our 
shops and Autocentres are of 
critical importance and that any 
major failure will affect consumer 
confidence and our reputation. 
Failure to protect the Group’s 
reputation and brand could lead 
to a loss of trust and confidence. 
This could result in a decline in 
the customer base and affect the 
ability to recruit and retain good 
people. There is also the risk that 
our service proposition fails due 
to inconsistent levels of service 
at individual shops and individual 
centres.
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its position as the shop 
or centre of first choice in each of the markets that it serves.
Our 3-Gears training programme uses online modules to 
ensure that colleagues are consistently knowledgeable about 
our products and able to deliver quality services to customers. 
This online training is reinforced by face-to-face learning and 
assessments. Shops use an accreditation matrix to ensure that 
all building and fitting is undertaken by competent colleagues. 
Product knowledge among colleagues is promoted through 
specialist conferences for selected staff (e.g. BikeHut managers). 
We have also implemented measures to ensure that we attract 
and retain the best colleagues; for example, engagement surveys 
aim to identify opportunities to reduce colleague turnover, which 
is at its lowest for several years.  We have again been recognised 
as one of the Sunday Times “30 Best Big Companies to Work 
For”. Our recruitment processes are now centralised to improve 
efficiency and consistency.
Our products are risk assessed and rigorously tested for quality 
and safety by qualified engineers in our dedicated quality team. 
We monitor customer comments and complaints and, when 
necessary, we have established recall processes.  We work 
closely with suppliers and frequently visit factories to ensure 
manufacturing standards are maintained.
Our Autocentres utilise a comprehensive quality assurance 
process with checks by centre managers. T echnicians are 
regularly checked to ensure quality of workmanship, and the 
priority status allocated to individual jobs is reviewed to ensure 
safety and prevent overselling. There is a dedicated Operations 
Quality team. We utilise mystery shoppers. We have recently 
adopted extended opening hours and implemented a new 
technician pay grading scheme to drive quality.

7. Information T echnology (“IT”) Systems and Infrastructure
In common with most businesses, 
Halfords is dependent on the 
reliability and suitability of a 
number of important IT systems 
where any sustained performance 
problems (including those caused 
by cyberattack) could potentially 
compromise our operational 
capability for a period of time, 
impacting on shops, centres 
or warehouse, multi-channel 
and distribution systems. With 
ambitious growth plans for our 
multi-channel offer, our trading 
capacity could be affected by 
internal and external systems’ 
resilience and interdependencies.
Commercial data could be lost 
or stolen through cyberattack, 
sabotage, or other security 
breaches.  Press reports and 
professional advisors indicate that 
cyberattacks are becoming more 
sophisticated and common.
Extensive controls are in place to maintain the integrity of our 
systems and to ensure that systems changes are implemented 
in a controlled manner. Halfords’ key trading systems are 
hosted within a secure data centre operated by a specialist 
company remote from our support centre. These systems are 
also supported by a number of disaster recovery arrangements 
including a comprehensive backup and patching strategy, and 
a hotlink secure data centre hosted in a different location. IT 
recovery processes are tested regularly.
We review our IT security processes and risk assessments on 
an ongoing basis and our IT team has dedicated IT security and 
continuity experts. We utilise appropriate firewalls, and physical 
and logical system access controls. We have undertaken 
network penetration testing.
The Audit Committee is briefed by the Chief Information Officer 
on the business’ IT security framework and continues to closely 
monitor this area.
8. Dependence on Key Management Personnel
The success of the Group’s 
business depends upon its senior 
management closely supervising 
all aspects of its business, in 
particular, the operation of the 
shops and Autocentres, including 
the appropriate training of in-
shop and centre colleagues, and 
the design, procurement and 
allocation of merchandise.
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on pages 78 to 88  details 
the strategies in place to ensure that high calibre executives 
are attracted and retained. The Group looks to improve its 
senior manager cadre through operating a talent management 
process to help individuals achieve their full potential within 
Halfords and to ensure that appropriate succession plans are 
in place to meet the future needs of the business. On 3 May 
2017 the Chief Executive Officer, Jill McDonald, tendered her
resignation. She will continue to work her 6 month contractual 
notice period. The search for her successor is underway. 
Crucially, we have a talented group of engaged colleagues 
and a strong executive team who remain fully focused on the 
implementation of the Group’s strategy. At a junior level, the 
Group continues to invest in graduate and apprenticeship 
programmes and shop and Autocentre colleague training and 
development.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   53 07/06/2017   16:37:43 slugline
Principal Activities
The principal activities of the Group are: the retailing of motoring, 
cycling and leisure products and services from its Halfords, Cycle 
Republic and Tredz and Wheelies branded retail stores, websites 
(including the new website for Boardman Bikes); and car servicing 
and repair from its Halfords Autocentres outlets. The principal 
activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The Company’s 
registrar is Capita Asset Services, which is situated at The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU.
Profits and Dividends
The Group’s results for the year are set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 108. The profit before tax on ordinary activities was 
£75.4m (2016: £81.5m) and the profit after tax amounted to £59.5m 
(2016: £64.9m). The Board proposes that a final dividend of 11.68 
pence per ordinary share be paid on 25 August 2017 to shareholders 
whose names are on the register of members at the close of business 
on 4 August 2017. This payment, together with the interim dividend 
of 5.83 pence per ordinary share paid on 20 January 2017 and the 
special interim dividend of 10 pence per ordinary share paid on 17 
February 2017, makes a total for the year of 27.51 pence per ordinary 
share. The total final dividend payable to shareholders for the year is 
estimated to be £22.9m. On 19 January 2017, it was announced that, 
having expanded the Group’s capabilities in both motoring and cycling, 
through the T redz, Wheelies and TyresOnTheDrive.com investments, 
the Board does not expect to undertake further acquisitions in the 
near future. Accordingly, the Board approved the special dividend 
totalling £20m, as part of our progress towards our previously stated 
net debt target of 1 times EBITDA. 
Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, trustee of the Halfords 
Employees’ Share Trust, has waived its entitlement to dividends.
Performance Monitoring 
The delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives is monitored by the 
Board through KPIs and periodic review of various aspects of the 
Group’s operations. The Group considers that the KPIs listed on 
pages 18 to 19 are appropriate measures to assess the delivery of 
the strategy of the Group.
Directors
The following were Directors of the Company during the period 
ended 31 March 2017 and, at the date of this Annual Report:
Dennis Millard 
Jill McDonald 
Jonny Mason 
David Adams 
Claudia Arney 
Helen Jones
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code guidelines, all those persons holding 
office as a Director of the Company on 31 March 2017 will retire and 
offer themselves for re-election at the 2017 Annual General Meeting. 
Appointment and Removal of a Director
A Director may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of shareholders 
in a general meeting following recommendation by the Nomination 
Committee in accordance with its T erms of Reference as approved 
by the Board or by a member (or members) entitled to vote at such a 
meeting, or following retirement by rotation if the Director chooses 
to seek re-election at a general meeting. In addition, the Directors 
may appoint a Director to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director, 
provided that the individual retires at the next Annual General Meeting, 
if they are to continue they offer themselves for election. A Director 
may be removed by the Company in certain circumstances set out in 
the Company’s Articles of Association or by a special resolution of the 
Company.
Powers of the Directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given 
by the Company by special resolution and any relevant statutes and 
regulations, the business of the Company will be managed by the 
Board who may exercise all the powers of the Company. Specific 
powers relating to the allotment and issuance of ordinary shares and 
the ability of the Company to purchase its own securities are also 
included within the Articles and such authorities are submitted for 
approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting each 
year. The authorities conferred on the Directors at the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting, held on 26 July 2016 will expire on the date of the 
2017 Annual General Meeting. Since the date of the 2016 Annual 
General Meeting, the Directors have not exercised any of their 
powers to issue, or purchase, ordinary shares in the share capital of 
the Company.
Directors’ Interests
The Directors’ interests in and options over, ordinary shares in the 
Company are shown in the Annual Remuneration Report on page 94. 
Since the end of the financial year and the date of this report, there 
have been no changes to such interests.
In line with the requirements of the Companies Act, Directors have 
a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, or may have, 
interests that conflict with those of the Company unless that conflict 
is first authorised by the Board. 
The Company has in place procedures for managing conflicts of 
interest. The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions 
to allow the Directors to authorise potential conflicts of interest, so 
that if approved, a Director will not be in breach of his/her duty under 
company law. In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006, each Director has notified the Company of any situation in 
which he or she has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts or possibly may conflict with the interests of the Company 
(a situational conflict). Directors have a continuing duty to update any 
changes to their conflicts of interest.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   54 07/06/2017   16:37:43 slugline
Directors’ Indemnities
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover has been established for 
all Directors and Officers to provide cover against their reasonable 
actions on behalf of the Company. The Directors of the Company 
and the Company’s subsidiaries have the benefit of a third-party 
indemnity provision, as defined by section 236 of the Companies Act 
2006, pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association.
Colleagues
The Group strives to meet its business objectives by motivating 
and encouraging all colleagues to be responsive to the needs of our 
customers and continually improve operational performance. This 
is delivered through a range of structured training and development 
programmes, such as ‘Gears in Retail’, where Retail colleagues 
progress through a structured series of e-learning, face-to-face and 
shop floor experience modules and are then recognised for their 
success through certification, career progression and increased pay 
awards. In addition, Cycle Republic also undertakes store supplier 
training by brands.
Halfords Autocentres runs, in conjunction with the Institute of 
Motor Industry (“IMI”), a number of T echnical Training Courses that 
are designed to develop colleagues’ skills. Similar to Retail, it has 
its own version of the ‘Gears in Retail’ programme which supports 
colleagues’ development and rewards via a pay matrix. Autocentres 
has become the first organisation in 50 years to be authorised by 
the DVSA to train MOT T esters in-house. Autocentres has embarked 
on training its technicians in the latest Hybrid technology and has 
worked with the IMI to train 150 technicians in the IMI Hybrid Level 2 
in Servicing. Our ambition next year is to have at least one technician 
per Autocentre to extend our Hybrid servicing offer across the 
country.
In addition, we run a Leadership Development programme, called 
Aspire, to identify, nurture and develop colleagues across the Group, 
with potential to be our leaders of the future. This continues our drive 
to develop and therefore, possibly promote from within.
The Group continues to invest in our apprenticeship programme. In our 
Retail business, we continue to invest our apprenticeship programme 
and will be launching the new apprenticeship standards this academic 
year. In addition, our traineeship programme for NEETS (not in education, 
employment or training) has resulted in the placing of 159 trainees to 
date. At Halfords Autocentres we have one of the largest apprenticeship 
schemes in light vehicle maintenance in the UK, with 213 apprentices 
currently at differing stages of our three-year programme. 
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
colleagues and potential colleagues. This applies to recruitment, 
training, career development and promotion for all colleagues, 
regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age 
or ethnic origin. Full and fair consideration is given to employment 
applications by disabled persons wherever suitable opportunities exist, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Diversity policies 
are in place around the Group and training and career development 
support is provided where appropriate. Should a colleague become 
disabled, efforts are made to ensure their continued employment with 
the Group, with retraining being provided if necessary.
The Group has an established framework of colleague 
communications, to provide colleagues with information on 
matters of concern to them and business performance as well as 
to encourage the engagement of every colleague in the Board’s 
commitment to high standards of customer care and service 
provision. This includes a programme of regular conferences to share 
progress, strategy and direction, a monthly magazine for all Group 
colleagues, team meetings known as ‘huddles’, a weekly blog from 
the CEO, as well as channels to share operational information.
A Whistleblowing Policy and procedure enables colleagues to report 
concerns on matters affecting the Group or their employment, 
without fear of recrimination. In addition, the Group takes a zero-
tolerance approach to matters of discrimination, harassment and 
bullying in all aspects of its business operations, including in relation 
to gender, race, national origin, disability, age, religion or sexual 
orientation. Appropriate policies and procedures are in place for 
reporting and dealing with such matters.
Share Capital and Shareholder Voting Rights
Details of the Company’s share capital and details of the rights 
attaching to the Company’s ordinary shares are set out in note 22 
on page 136. All ordinary shares, including those acquired through 
Company share schemes and plans, rank equally with no special rights. 
All shareholders are entitled to attend and speak at the general 
meetings of the Company, appoint proxies, receive any dividends, 
exercise voting rights and transfer shares without restriction. On a 
show of hands at a general meeting every member present in person 
shall have one vote, and on a poll, every member present in person or 
by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held. There are 
no known arrangements that may restrict the transfer of shares or 
voting rights.
The Company has revolving credit facilities that require the Company 
in the event of a change of control to notify the facility agent and, if 
required by the majority lenders, these facilities may be cancelled. 
The Company does not have agreements with any Director or 
colleague that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and Deferred Bonus Plan may cause 
options and awards granted to Directors and colleagues under such 
schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.
Details of employee share schemes are provided in note 23 on  
pages 136 to 138.

Authority to Purchase Shares
At the 2016 Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved a 
special resolution authorising the Company to purchase a maximum 
of 19,911,663 shares, representing not greater than 10% of the 
Company’s issued share capital at 13 June 2016, such authority 
expiring at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 
2017 or, if earlier, on 30 September 2017.
Transactions with Related Parties
During the period, the Company did not enter into any material 
transactions with any related parties.
Articles of Association
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Articles of 
Association may only be amended by a special resolution of the 
Company’s shareholders in a general meeting.
Political Donations
The Group made no political donations and incurred no political 
expenditure during the year (FY16: nil). It remains the Company’s 
policy not to make political donations or to incur political expenditure, 
however the application of the relevant provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006 is potentially very broad in nature and, as last year, the 
Board is seeking shareholder authority to ensure that the Group does 
not inadvertently breach these provisions as a result of the breadth 
of its business activities, although the Board has no intention of

Going Concern
The Group has a £170m five-year revolving credit facility, ending in 
November 2019. At the year end, the Group had undrawn borrowing 
facilities of £97m (2016: £143m). The Group’s current committed 
borrowing facilities contain certain financial covenants, which 
have been met throughout the period. The Group’s forecasts and 
projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within 
the level of its borrowing facilities and covenants for the foreseeable 
future. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, hence 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the Financial Statements.
Viability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Company over a 
three-year period to 1 April 2020. The Directors believe this period to 
be appropriate as the Company’s strategic planning encompasses this 
period, and because it is a reasonable period over which the impact of 
key risks can be assessed within a fast-moving retail business.
The Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
at least until 1 April 2020. As is customary when dealing with longer 
term debt facilities, we would expect these to be renewed well in 
advance of their next term.
In making this statement, the Directors have reviewed the overall 
resilience of the Group and have specifically considered:
• a robust assessment of the impact, likelihood and management of 
principal risks facing the Group, including consideration of those 
risks that could threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity or sustainability. The assessment of 
viability has specifically considered risks that could threaten the 
Group’s day-to-day operations and existence. The assessment 
considered how risks could affect the business now, and how they 
may develop over three years; and
• financial analysis and forecasts showing current financial position 
and performance, cash flow projections, dividend strategy, 
funding requirements and funding facilities.
More details of our key risks, mitigations and assessment processes 
are set out on pages 42 to 47.

Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
Halfords Group plc operates retail stores across the UK and Ireland 
and garages throughout the UK. The products Halfords sells are 
sourced from a broad range of national and international suppliers. 
Many of those international supplier relationships are sourced and 
managed by our dedicated team based in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
We have a Code of Conduct on Ethical T rading, which sets out our 
policy on legislation, child labour, conditions of employment, wages and 
benefits, health and safety and the environment. The Code of Conduct 
has recently been updated to include our policy on human trafficking.
We undertake all reasonable and practical steps, including factory, 
warehouse and tied accommodation inspections and audits, to 
ensure that our standards are being implemented throughout the 
businesses of our suppliers and that local legislation and regulations 
are complied with. We will assess any instances of non-compliance 
on a case-by-case basis and will then tailor remedial action 
appropriately. We will only trade with those who fully comply with this 
policy or those who are taking verifiable steps towards compliance.
The Halfords Group plc Board of Directors reviewed and approved 
this statement on 28 September 2016.
Creditor Payment Policy
The Group does not follow any formal code of practice on payment, 
instead it agrees terms and conditions for transactions when orders 
for goods or services are placed, and includes relevant terms in 
contracts, as appropriate. These arrangements are adhered to when 
making payments, subject to the terms and conditions being met 
by suppliers. The number of trade creditor days outstanding as 
at 31 March 2017 for the Group was 59 days (2016: 63 days). The 
Company is a holding company and has no trade creditors. 
Branches
The Company and its subsidiaries have established branches in the 
different countries in which they operate.
Auditor
The Company’s Auditor is KPMG LLP. A resolution proposing the 
reappointment of KPMG LLP is expected to be in the Notice of 
the Annual General Meeting and will be put to shareholders at the 
meeting.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
In accordance with Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006,

Board Committees 
The Board’s principal Committees are the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee, as detailed 
in the chart on page 61. In December 2015, the Board established 
a Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Committee, comprising 
Directors and senior management and chaired by a Non-Executive 
Director. Each Committee has its T erms of Reference approved 
and regularly reviewed by the Board. The T erms of Reference for 
the Committees are available on www.halfordscompany.com/
investors/governance. On the following pages each Committee 
Chairman reports how the Committee he/she chairs discharged 
its responsibilities in FY17 and the material matters that were 
considered. 
Following each meeting of a Committee, the Committee Chairman 
reports to the Board. Whilst not entitled to attend, other Directors, 
professional advisors and members of senior management attend 
when invited to do so. The Auditor attends Audit Committee meetings 
by invitation. No person is present at Nomination Committee or 
Remuneration Committee during discussions pertinent to them. The 
Company Secretary acts as the secretary to each Committee.
A Disclosure Committee, made up of a minimum of two Directors, 
approves the final wording of market announcements prior to release. 
There were six Disclosure Committee meetings during the period.
The day-to-day investment decisions of the Group are approved 
by an Investment Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. 
Similarly, the treasury needs of the Group are managed by the 
Treasury Committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer; the other 
members are senior members of the Finance and Treasury teams.
The Board may establish other ad hoc committees of the Board to 
consider specific issues from time to time. No such committees were 
formed during the year. 
Concerns
The Chairman seeks to resolve any concerns raised by the Board, 
whether raised in a Board meeting or in another forum. Where raised 
and unresolved in a Board meeting, the unresolved business can 
be recorded on behalf of a Director in the minutes of the relevant 
meeting. A resigning Non-Executive Director would also be able to 
raise any concerns in a written letter to the Chairman, who would 
bring such concerns to the attention of the Board. No such concerns 
have been raised throughout the period.
Independence and Effectiveness
Following a rigorous review, the Board considers David Adams, 
Claudia Arney and Helen Jones to be independent in character 
and judgement in accordance with the requirements of the Code. 
The Chairman, Dennis Millard, was considered independent on his 
appointment. 
In compliance with the requirements of the Code, at least half of 
the Board, excluding the Chairman, are deemed to be independent. 
During the period, of the five Directors other than the Chairman, three 
(i.e. 60% of the Board) were independent.

Corporate Governance Report
Diversity 
During the year, the Board renewed the Group’s Diversity Policy (the 
“Policy”) which sets out our commitment to eliminating unlawful 
discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity. The Policy is 
applied to the Board and it is considered that the background and 
experience brought to the Board by each individual demonstrates the 
Board’s diversity and commitment to its Diversity Policy. The principle 
that candidates are considered “on merit and against objective 
criteria, and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, 
including gender” is established in the T erms of Reference of the 
Nomination Committee. 
No fixed quota is applied to decisions regarding recruitment, rather 
the Nomination Committee considers capability and capacity to 
commit the necessary time to the role in its recommendations to 
the Board. The intention is to ensure the appointment of the most 
suitably qualified candidate to complement and balance the current 
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. Those appointed 
are deemed to be the best able to help lead the Company in its 
long-term strategy. At Halfords half of the Board is female. The chart 
below demonstrates the gender split at Board level, within senior 
management and across the workforce as a whole.

The Board is well placed by the mixture of skills, experience and 
knowledge of its Directors to act in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
Appointments to the Board
There were no appointments to the Board during the year.
Directors’ Induction 
When new Directors are appointed they receive a personalised 
induction programme, tailored to their individual requirements, 
to include briefings on the activities of the Group and visits to 
operational sites. They also meet all of the Company’s other 
Directors and senior executives. This facilitates their understanding 
of the Group and the key drivers of the business’ performance. 
Training and Development
All current Directors have various opportunities for ongoing 
development and support via:
• a programme of Support Centre, distribution centre, Halfords, 
Cycle Republic and Tredz and Wheelies retail stores and 
Autocentres outlet visits;
• reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and 
development needs;
• advice on governance, relevant legislative changes affecting the 
business or their duties as Directors from the Company Secretary; 
• access to independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense; and 
• membership of the Deloitte Academy, a training and guidance 
resource for boards and directors.
Evaluation
The Code recommends that an evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the Board and its Committees is conducted annually and that this 
process is facilitated externally at least every third year. This year the 
evaluation process was carried out internally for the second year.  
The last external review was undertaken by Linstock in 2015.
The evaluation was internally facilitated by the Company Secretary 
where each Director was required to respond to a questionnaire 
devised by the Company Secretary and agreed with the Chairman. 
The evaluation was based on a number of key areas:
• Board composition, role, skills, diversity, balance, experience and 
effectiveness;
• Board leadership and culture;
• developing the Company’s strategy and its implementation;
• Board and Committee agendas, papers and resource;
• monitoring of Company performance;
• risk management;
• governance, regulatory compliance and support;
• committee performance;
• individual Director effectiveness; and
• succession planning and training issues.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   66 07/06/2017   16:38:01 slugline
The Directors’ individual responses were collated and evaluated. 
The Chairman considered the results of the performance evaluation 
report which were discussed with the Board.
Overall, the Board is considered strong, bringing a good balance 
and mix of experience and diversity. Board Committees were 
all considered to work well and to be effective in meeting the 
requirements of the T erms of Reference.
Following the review, the most significant actions to be taken as a 
result of the assessment are set out below:
• improved succession planning;
• more corporate governance updates;
• improved focus on Board Strategy Day; and
• ensuring continuation of the NED programme.
It is expected that the Board evaluation for FY18 will be facilitated 
externally.
Re-election
In compliance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors on the Board as at 24 May 2017, will seek 
re-election at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 
Directors and their Other Interests
Each Director is required to notify the Company of any situation in 
which he or she has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company 
(a situational conflict). None was notified during the period. 
All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the Company 
Secretary should any possible situational conflict arise, so that prior 
consideration can be given by the Board as to whether or not such 
conflict will be approved.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests 
of the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of 
the Company and options to subscribe for shares in the Company are 
shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 89 to 97.
Internal Control and Risk Management
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control and reviewing 
its effectiveness rests with the Board. This involves ensuring that 
there is a process to identify, evaluate and manage any significant 
risks that may affect the achievement of the Group’s strategic 
objectives. 
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of 
the systems of internal control during the year, under the auspices 
of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee provides the Board 
with an independent assessment of the Group’s financial position, 
accounting affairs and control systems. In addition, the Board 
receives regular reports on how specific risks that are assessed as 
material to the Group are being managed. For further information on 
the Company’s compliance with the Code provisions relating to the 
Audit Committee and Auditor please refer to pages 74 to 77. 
The risk management and internal control system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Board’s policy 
on internal control is implemented by management through a clearly 
defined operating structure with lines of responsibility and delegated 
authority. 
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group and assessing the effectiveness 
of related controls has been established by the Board to ensure 
an acceptable risk/reward profile across the Group. The Group’s 
corporate risk register is maintained by the Head of Internal Audit and 
Risk. It records key risks, with impact and likelihood assessments, 
mitigations and ongoing developments. It is updated regularly, 
following structured interviews with managers and executives across 
the Group. The accuracy of the register is validated through a rolling 
programme of independent internal audits. The register is scrutinised 
in detail annually by the Audit Committee. Any material change in the 
register is flagged to the Audit Committee by the Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk within his regular internal audit progress report.  
The process has been in place throughout the period ended  
31 March 2017, and up to the date of approving the Annual Report 
and Financial Statements. 
Our process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group and assessing the effectiveness of related 
controls routinely identifies areas for improvement, but the Board has 
neither identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses that 
it has determined to be material or significant.
The Board considered its appetite in relation to the Group’s top risks, 
determining that the risks and mitigating actions were appropriate to 
the level of risk that was both acceptable to, and incumbent within, 
a listed business. More information on the Company’s key risks and 
uncertainties, and its risk assessment methodology, is shown on 
pages 42 to 47.

Corporate Governance Report
Shareholder Engagement
The Board is committed to effective communications with its 
shareholders and, accordingly, has a strong Investor Relations (“IR”) 
programme that seeks to actively engage with shareholders. 
This programme includes formal presentations of full year and 
interim results. These presentations, along with the Annual Report 
and Accounts, are the primary means of communication during the 
year with all of the Company’s shareholders. Additionally, the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and IR Director have met 
with analysts and institutional shareholders during the period to 
keep them informed of significant developments and help maintain a 
balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. The IR Director 
and Company Secretary bring to the attention of the Board any 
material matters of concern raised by the Company’s shareholders, 
including private investors.
• Progress in the execution of the Moving Up A Gear strategy; 
• The dynamics of the Motoring and Cycling markets, including 
the growth prospects, competitive environment and future 
trends; 
• The impact of foreign exchange volatility following the EU 
referendum; 
• Gross and operating margin performance; 
• Discussion and formulation of the new Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy; and
• Capital allocation priorities. In particular, the trends and 
preferences surrounding internal investment, M&A and returns 
to shareholders.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
channels of communication are established between Directors 
and shareholders and that all Directors are aware of any issues or 
concerns that major shareholders may have. Regular engagement 
provides investors with an opportunity to discuss any areas of 
interest and raise concerns. The Group is eager to make sure that 
it understands shareholders’ views and that it is able to effectively 
communicate its strategy. The Group engages effectively through 
its regular communications, the Annual General Meeting and 
other IR activity. In addition, the Board commissions independent 
investor perception studies from time to time. The last such 
survey was undertaken in June and July 2016, with the results fed 
back to the Board in September 2016.
The Group has a comprehensive IR programme through which 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and IR Director 
regularly engage with the Company’s largest shareholders 
on a one-to-one basis, to discuss strategic issues and give 
presentations on the Group’s results. Further communication is 
achieved through the Annual Report and Accounts, corporate 
website and investor days. 
• Annual Report and Accounts – this is the most significant 
communication tool, ensuring that investors are kept fully 
informed regarding Group developments. Management 
continually strives to produce a clear and transparent Annual 
Report and Accounts, which provides a complete picture; 
• The corporate website – provides investors with timely 
information on the Group’s performance as well as details of 
corporate social responsibility activities; 
• Management roadshow – allows key investors to access 
management, usually attended by the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and IR Director;
• Attending broker conferences – Management regularly attend 
and present at various conferences hosted by a variety of 
brokers to ensure a wide variety of shareholders, including 
those from different geographies, also have access to 
management; and
• Responding promptly – the Group is committed to responding 
to any investor-related queries within a short time frame.

Nomination Committee Report
Committee Composition
During the year, the Committee comprised:
Dennis Millard (Chairman)
David Adams 
Claudia Arney
Helen Jones 
Jill McDonald 
There were two Committee meetings held during the 
year, attended by all members and after each Committee 
meeting I reported to the Board on the key issues that 
we had discussed. A number of informal discussions 
were also held between Committee members and me 
throughout the year as the need arose. 
Activities During the Y ear
During the year, the Committee:
• reviewed the composition of the Board and its 
succession plan;
• carried out an annual review of the Committee’s T erms 
of Reference; 
• recommended re-election of the Board at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting; and
• reviewed the results of the Board performance 
evaluation process.
The Company . . . has created a 
more balanced and diverse Board 
and Senior Management Team 
and continues to work to ensure 
this is replicated across the entire 
business . . .
Chairman’s Letter
The Committee’s role is to:
• review the size, structure and composition of 
the Board;
• consider succession planning; and
• identify and make recommendations to the 
Board on potential candidates for the Board.
Its key objective is to ensure that the Board 
comprises individuals with the necessary skill, 
knowledge, experience and diversity to ensure 
that the Board is effective in discharging its 
responsibilities. The Committee is also tasked with 
ensuring that succession plans are in place for the 
Senior Management T eam.

Diversity
During the year, the Board also renewed the Group’s Diversity Policy 
(“Diversity Policy”) which sets out our commitment to eliminating 
unlawful discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity. This 
applies to all our activities, including our role as an employer and as a 
provider of services, ensuring that no colleague, potential colleague, 
customer, visitor or contractor will receive less favourable treatment 
on the grounds of: age; disability; gender reassignment; race; religion 
or belief; gender; sexual orientation; marital or civil partnership 
status; pregnancy or maternity; or disability.
The Company does not currently publish specific diversity targets 
but in practice, it has created a more balanced and diverse Board 
and Senior Management T eam. We continue to work to ensure this 
is replicated across the entire business, in particular in relation to 
gender diversity. 
Further information regarding Board diversity can be found on page 
66 and gender diversity in the Group as a whole on page 31.
Looking Ahead
In the year ahead, as I intend to step down from the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting in July 2018, having by then served nine 
years as Chairman, the Committee will begin the process in the 
second half of the financial year ahead to identify suitable candidates 
and recommend an appointment to the Board. On 3 May 2017, it 
was announced that the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Jill 
McDonald, has resigned from the business to take up another role. 
Jill will remain as Chief Executive Officer until the expiry of her notice 
period in October 2017. The process is underway by the Committee 
to find her replacement.
The Committee will also continue to assess the Board and Senior 
Management T eam composition and how they both may be 
enhanced.

Audit Committee Report
Membership and Remit of the  
Audit Committee
a. Membership
All the members of the Audit Committee are 
independent Non-Executive Directors. Having been 
the Deputy Chief Executive and Finance Director of 
House of Fraser Plc, and currently chairing three other 
listed companies’ Audit Committees, David Adams is 
considered by the Board to have recent and relevant 
financial experience and so the requisite experience 
to chair the Committee. Each of the other independent 
Non-Executive Directors has, through their other 
business activities, significant experience in financial 
matters. The Audit Committee as a whole is considered 
to have competence relevant to the sector in which 
the Company operates. The effectiveness of the 
Audit Committee is reviewed at least annually through 
discussions at the Board and Audit Committee.
The Chairman of the Company’s Board, Executive 
Directors, senior managers and key advisors are invited 
to attend meetings as appropriate in order to ensure 
that the Committee maintains a current and well-
informed view of events within the business, and to 
reinforce a strong risk management culture. The Audit 
Committee meets according to the requirements of 
the Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the 
The Audit Committee has 
continued its work of reviewing the 
effectiveness of Halfords’ corporate 
governance framework with 
particular emphasis on the quality 
of financial reporting, internal 
control, and risk management 
systems.
Chairman’s Introduction 
I am pleased to present the report of 
the Audit Committee for the financial 
year ended 31 March 2017.
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee has 
continued its work of reviewing the effectiveness 
of Halfords’ corporate governance framework 
with particular emphasis on the quality of financial 
reporting, internal control, and risk management 
systems. The Committee monitors risk and internal 
control through engagement with external auditors, 
internal auditors and executive management 
who regularly present management briefings to 
the Committee, explaining in detail how selected 
key areas of business risk are managed. During 
the year, the Committee reviewed presentations 
on Supplier Rebates and Contributions, Cyber 
Security and Global Sourcing issues.
This report explains in detail how the Committee 
undertook its duties.

and nothing of note was reported.
b.  Remit
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
• making recommendations to the Board on the appointment 
of the external Auditor, including on effectiveness, 
independence, non-audit work undertaken (against a formal 
policy) and remuneration;
• reviewing the accounting principles, policies and practices 
adopted throughout the period;
• reviewing and approving external financial reporting for 
adoption by the Board;
• assisting the Board in achieving its obligations under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in areas of risk management and 
internal control, focusing particularly on compliance with legal 
requirements, accounting standards and the Listing Rules;
• review of corporate risk register and regular Internal Audit 
reports on developments in the internal control framework to 
ensure that an effective system of internal financial and non-
financial controls is maintained on an ongoing basis;
• approving a formal Whistleblowing Policy whereby staff may, 
in confidence, disclose issues of concern about possible 
malpractice or wrongdoings by any of the Group’s businesses 
or any of its employees without fear of reprisal, and includes 
arrangements to investigate and respond to any issues raised;
• approving the Company’s systems and controls for the 
prevention of bribery and corruption, including the receipt of 
any reports on non-compliance; and
• approving the Group’s Treasury Policy, including foreign 
currency and interest rate exposure.

Audit Committee Report
Significant Issues in Relation to the Financial 
Statements
In order to discharge its responsibility to consider accounting 
integrity, the Committee carefully considers key judgements applied 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which 
are set out on pages 108 to 113. The Committee’s review included 
consideration of the following key accounting judgements:
• Impairment of Goodwill associated with Autocentres;
 — Following the acquisition of Nationwide in 2010, the Group 
holds significant goodwill in the Halfords Autocentres business. 
There are a number of factors that could impact on the future 
profitability of the business (e.g. loss of key customers, change in 
market behaviour) and there is therefore a risk that the business 
may not meet the growth projections necessary to support the 
carrying value of the intangible asset (see note 11 on page 128 of 
the Financial Statements); and
 — The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from 
Halfords’ Finance team and External Auditor addressing this 
issue. The Finance team has undertaken detailed work to 
consider the impairment of goodwill associated with Autocentres. 
Consideration has been given to ensuring that cash flow models, 
discount rates, sensitivity analysis and centre profitability are all 
reasonable. The Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the 
accounting treatment of impairment of goodwill.
• Valuation of inventory within the retail division;
 — With the business holding a wide range of stock, it is likely that 
changing consumer demands will mean that some lines cannot be 
sold, or will be sold at below the carrying value. Provisions are made 
to reflect this. Given the difficulties in forecasting market trends, 
there is a risk that inventory provisions made will be inappropriate or 
incomplete (see note 14 on page 130 of the Financial Statements). 
Management has an established methodology for assessing 
inventory provisions. Range reviews are regularly undertaken to 
ensure that all discontinued inventory is identified; and
 — The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from Halfords’ 
Finance team and External Auditor addressing this issue. The 
Finance team has undertaken detailed work around the valuation 
of inventory within the Retail division. After consideration of 
the accuracy of the provisioning model, the completeness and 
accuracy of range reviews, and the reflection of these reviews 
within the provisions, the Committee concluded that it is satisfied 
with the accounting treatment of the valuation of inventory.
External Auditor
a. Effectiveness of external audit
The effectiveness of the External Audit is considered throughout 
the year through, amongst other factors: assessment of the 
degree of the audit firm’s challenge of key estimates and 
judgements made by the business; feedback from any external 
or internal quality reviews on the audit; and the wider quality of 
communication with the Committee.
In addition, at its meeting in March 2017, the Committee 
performed a specific evaluation of the performance of the 
External Auditor considering the areas set out above and 
feedback from management. Following this, the Committee 
concluded that:
• the overall audit approach, materiality, threshold, and areas  
of audit focus were appropriate to the business; and
• the audit team possessed the necessary quality, expertise 
and experience to provide an independent and objective 
audit.
b  Approach to appointment or reappointment
KPMG LLP (formerly KPMG Audit plc) was appointed as External 
Auditor to the Group in 2009 following a formal tender process. 
Since that time, KPMG LLP has complied with the partner rotation 
requirement set out in Ethical Standards for Auditors, with the 
most recent rotation taking place in 2014. This rotation saw Peter 
Meehan becoming our audit partner.
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the 
Auditor is working well and is satisfied with its independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness and has not considered it 
necessary to require KPMG LLP to re-tender for external audit 
work this year. The Audit Committee has recommended to 
the Board, for approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 26 July 2017, the reappointment of KPMG LLP as 
External Auditor. The Audit Committee monitors, and will continue 
to comply with best practice and external guidance in respect of 
the frequency of audit tenders. 
c  Approach to safeguarding objectivity and 
independence if non-audit services are provided
The Audit Committee has established a policy to ensure that 
any non-audit services delivered by the External Auditor will not 
jeopardise objectivity and independence. The policy is consistent 
with Ethical Standards for Auditors.
The policy specifies:
‘The External Auditor can be used to provide non-audit services 
subject to any non-audit engagement proposal provided by the 
External Auditor being formally approved by the Audit Committee 
before contractual arrangements are entered into, except for 
activities set out in the list of prohibited activities included in the 
Regulation as follows:
• T ax services relating to:
 — Preparation of tax forms;
 — Payroll tax;
 — Customers duties;
 — Identification of public subsidies and tax incentives unless 
support from the audit firm in respect of such services is 
required by law;
 — Support regarding tax inspection by tax authorities unless 
support from the audit firm in respect of such inspections is 
required by law;
 — Calculation of direct and indirect tax and deferred tax; and
 — Provision of tax advice;
• Services that involve paying any part in the management or 
decision-making of the audited entity;
• Bookkeeping and preparing accounting records and financial 
statements;
• Payroll services;

• Designing and implementing internal control or risk management 
procedures related to the preparation and/or control of financial 
information or designing and implementing financial information 
technology systems;
• Valuation services, including valuations performed in connection 
with actuarial services or litigation support services;
• Legal services, with respect to:  
 — The provision of general counsel;
 — Negotiating on behalf of the audited entity; and
 — Acting in an advocacy role in the resolution of litigation;
• Services related to the audit entity’s internal audit function;
• Services linked to the financing, capital structure and 
allocation, and investment strategy of the audited entity, 
except providing assurance services in relation to the 
financial statements, such as the issuing of comfort letters in 
connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity;
• Promoting, dealing in, or underwriting shares in the audited 
entity; and
• Human resources services, with respect to:
 — Management in a position to exert significant influence 
over the preparation of the accounting records or financial 
statement which are the subject of the statutory audit, where 
such services involve:
–  searching for or seeking out candidates for such position; or 
–    undertaking reference checks of candidates for such 
positions; 
 — structuring the organisation design; and 
 — cost control.
Other than for the above, for each separate service proposed to 
be provided by the Auditor, the Group Chief Financial Officer will 
prepare a note either to be tabled and minuted at an Audit Committee 
meeting or to be circulated via email to the Audit Committee 
members and the CEO giving a description of the work to be 
undertaken, the reasons why the Auditor is involved in the proposal 
and how objectivity and independence has, and is seen to be, 
safeguarded.
In addition, the fees for any proposal for non-audit services will not 
exceed 70% of the three year average statutory audit fees when 
taken into consideration with total fees for non-audit services already 
committed in the financial year.
Consent is required from the Audit Committee Chair on behalf of the 
Audit Committee before the Auditor can be engaged for non-audit 
services.’
In addition, the External Auditor follows its own ethical guidelines and 
continually reviews its audit team to ensure that its independence is 
not compromised.
An analysis of the fees earned by the External Auditor is disclosed in 
note 2 on page 143 to the Financial Statements.
Role and Effectiveness of Internal Audit
The Company has a dedicated in-house Internal Audit team, which is 
able to obtain advice from external specialists if necessary . The team 
principally reviews the effectiveness of the controls operating within the 
business by undertaking an agreed schedule of independent audits each 
year. The Audit Committee determines the nature and scope of the annual 
audit programme and revises it from time to time according to changing 
business circumstances and requirements. The Audit Committee also 
confirms that Internal Audit has appropriate resources available to it. The 
annual audit programme is derived from an audit universe.
Our Internal Audit plan for the forthcoming year features 30 reviews 
covering financial and commercial processes, governance issues 
and key risk safeguards. The executive summaries of all Internal Audit 
reports are circulated to Audit Committee members and discussed at 
meetings where appropriate.
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Internal Audit team has the 
quality, experience and expertise appropriate for the business.
Internal Audit reports on a day-to-day basis to the Group’s Chief 
Financial Officer, but is independent in action and reporting of issues, 
with direct line of communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. 
The findings of the independent audits are reported initially to 
executive management and any necessary corrective actions are 
agreed. Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed 
with, the Audit Committee along with details of progress against 
action plans as appropriate.
Whistleblowing
A Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure enables colleagues to report 
concerns on matters affecting the Group or their employment, 
without fear of recrimination. Posters publicising whistleblowing 
channels are distributed to all stores, Autocentres, distribution 
centres and the Support Centre.
The Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure was reviewed and approved 
by the Audit Committee and was subject to an Internal Audit review 
during the year. The Company Secretary provides the Audit Committee 
with a regular summary of whistleblowing contacts and resolutions.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy
The Group’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy statement reinforces 
that the Halfords’ Board is committed to conducting its business 
affairs so as to ensure that it does not engage in or facilitate any form 
of corruption. It is Halfords’ policy to prohibit all forms of corruption 
amongst our employees, suppliers and any associated parties acting on 
our behalf. The Group has a detailed Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy 
and maintains Gifts and Hospitality Registers. Anti-Bribery expectations 
are set out in standard purchasing terms and conditions. Face-to-face 
and online training has been provided to colleagues to raise awareness 
of Anti-Bribery and corruption legislation.
The Audit Committee has requested that Anti-Bribery and corruption 
safeguards are periodically reviewed by Internal Audit.
Internal Control and Risk Management
Details of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework are set out on pages 42 to 47.
‘The external Auditor can be used to provide non-audit services 
subject to any non-audit engagement proposal provided by the 
external Auditor being formally approved by the Audit Committee 
before contractual arrangements are entered into, except for 
activities set out in the list of prohibited activities included in the 
Regulation as follows:

Remuneration Committee Report
Remuneration Policy
The Committee undertook a review of the Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) 
in consultation with shareholders and shareholder advisory bodies. In general, 
shareholders were supportive of the changes proposed and we adapted the 
proposals in certain areas to reflect the feedback received. The key changes to 
the Policy are as follows:
• simplification of the long term incentive (PSP) and a reduction in the overall 
maximum opportunity from 225% to 200%;
• extension of the retention period for the PSP to enhance long-term alignment 
with shareholders (the whole award is transitioning to a two-year holding 
period);
• reduction in the PSP ‘start to earn’ quantum from 30% to 25%;
• changes to PSP metrics to ensure alignment with the strategy (EPS has 
replaced EBITDA);
• increase in shareholding guidelines to 200%, with 75% of any vesting under 
PSP or the Deferred Bonus Plan being retained until guidelines are met; and
• reduction in the pension salary cap from 20% to 15%.
Overall, the Committee is confident that the proposed approach will support the 
Company’s strategy over the next three years, and that it is fair and balanced. A 
copy of the revised Policy is available at www.halfordscompany.com/investors.
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Remuneration 
Committee, I am pleased to present 
the Remuneration Report for the 
financial period ended 31 March 
2017.
The Report consists of three sections:
• this Annual Statement;
• our Remuneration Policy Report, which sets 
out a summary of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy for all Directors of Halfords; and
• our Annual Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
which sets out the details of how the 
Company’s Directors were paid during FY17 
and how our policy will be implemented in FY18. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is subject to 
a binding shareholder vote at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report is subject to an advisory shareholder vote.
Claudia Arney 
Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
Our remuneration philosophy 
is aimed at providing Executive 
Directors with incentive 
opportunities strongly aligned 
to growth, profitability and 
shareholder returns.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   78 07/06/2017   16:38:36 slugline
Policy Implementation
The implementation of Remuneration Policy in FY17 is summarised 
as follows:
Performance Share Plan
T o ensure the interests of the Executive Directors continue to align 
with the delivery of the strategy, the Committee again determined 
that the performance measures for the FY17 PSP would be based on 
75% Group EBITDA growth and 25% Group Revenue growth.
Annual Bonus
Profit before tax (“PBT”) was £75.4m in 2016/17 and therefore 20.4% 
of this element of the bonus was achieved (80% of the total bonus 
being based on PBT). There has been strong progress against our 
strategic priorities during the year, particularly in relation to matching 
sales to specific customers, Cycle Republic like-for-like growth, 
service related sales growth and colleague engagement. Therefore, 
12.7% of this element should be paid. This resulted in an overall 
bonus of 33.1% of maximum.
Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)
The Committee has introduced a new share plan to promote further 
the alignment of more colleagues’ interests with shareholders and 
to support engagement and commitment. Executive Directors are 
excluded from the RSP. The scheme will facilitate the granting of 
shares to colleagues (as opposed to share options) based on them 
staying with the Company for a period of three years. This new plan 
builds on the existing Save As You Earn Scheme (“SAYE”) which 
continues to be open to all colleagues.
Remuneration Review
The Committee approved a salary increase for the Executive 
Directors of 2% in October 2016 which mirrored the award for 
Support Centre colleagues and was below the average for all 
colleagues.
Jill McDonald resigned on 3 May 2017 from her role as Chief 
Executive Officer and will continue to work her six-month contractual 
notice period. Jill will not receive a bonus in respect of 2016/17. 
All of Jill’s unvested share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
and the PSP will lapse in full when she leaves the Company. On her 
appointment it was agreed that Jill would be made Halfords share 
awards with a total value of £529,819 to replace awards made by her 
previous employer that lapsed on resignation. These awards were to 
be delivered in four annual tranches from 2016 to 2019. Two tranches 
have already been delivered. Jill will forfeit the outstanding two 
tranches which were intended to be delivered in 2018 and 2019.
Concluding Remarks
I hope that you find the Report clear, transparent and informative. 
The Committee has sought to promote a remuneration environment 
that strongly aligns the commercial direction of the Group with 
the interests of shareholders, whilst reflecting best practice 
developments and market trends. I look forward to your support at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Yours faithfully
Claudia Arney 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Policy Report
Executive Remuneration Policy
The Policy report set out on pages 80 to 88 sets out the 
Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) that the Company intends to apply, 
subject to shareholder approval, with effect from 26 July 2017 (the 
date of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)). This Policy will replace in 
full the Directors’ Remuneration Policy set out in the 2013/14 Annual 
Report, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 29 July 
2014. It is intended that this Policy will apply until the 2020 AGM, 
unless the Company seeks shareholder approval for a revised policy 
which comes into force before this date.
The Committee seeks to support the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
through establishing appropriate remuneration arrangements. 
Our goal is to build a strong long-term sustainable business by 
delivering ongoing sales growth and sustainable shareholder returns 
through the delivery of authoritative ranges of products, colleague 
and service excellence, digital participation and helpful store and 
Autocentre environments.
Consequently, the overall Remuneration Policy of the Committee, 
and of the Board, is to provide remuneration packages for Executive 
Directors and other senior managers in the Group which:
• Attract and retain – Enable the Group to attract and retain 
management of a high calibre with the necessary retail, 
customer service, financial, digital and service-industry skills and 
credentials required to deliver a sustainable business model and 
drive shareholder returns. Remuneration arrangements are set at 
levels appropriate to achieving this goal without paying more than 
is considered necessary. The Committee considers market data at 
appropriate intervals to inform the positioning of executives’ pay 
relative to the companies of a similar size and in similar sectors, 
without seeking to ‘match the median’, to identify and mitigate the 
risk of losing strong performers.
• Link variable pay to performance and the delivery of the 
agreed strategy – Provide management with the opportunity to 
earn competitive remuneration through annual and long-term 
variable pay arrangements that are designed to support delivery 
against key strategic objectives. Performance measures are 
aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration arrangements 
are transparent to executives, shareholders and other 
stakeholders. Different elements of executive pay are delivered 
over the short and longer term and are designed to ensure that a 
substantial proportion of the executives’ remuneration is variable 
and performance-related.
• Align executives with shareholders – Ensure management’s 
interests are aligned with those of shareholders by incentivising 
management to deliver the Group’s long-term strategy of a 
sustainable, growing business and thus enhance shareholder 
value. A significant portion of reward is delivered in shares to 
create alignment of interests. 
• Drive sustainable performance – Remuneration arrangements 
are designed to support the sustainable delivery of performance 
and to prevent excessive risk-taking.
Key changes under the updated Policy
T o ensure that the Remuneration Policy continues to support the 
Company’s strategy for the next three-year cycle and reflects market 
best practice, the following key changes have been made:
• Simplify the long-term incentive (PSP) and reduce overall 
maximum opportunity – Under the Policy approved in 2014, 
the PSP was structured so that a ‘core’ award is granted and 
participants have the opportunity to earn above this level (the 
‘multiplier’) for exceptional performance. The overall maximum 
award under the PSP is 225% of salary. The operation of the 
PSP under the new Policy has been simplified by removing the 
multiplier and the overall maximum limit has been reduced to 
200% of salary. 
• Extension of the retention period for the PSP – Under the 2014 
Policy, the two-year retention period only applied to any portion of 
the award earned above the core award i.e. that part related to the 
multiplier. T o reflect the simplified PSP structure and to make our 
approach more consistent with market practice going forward, a 
two-year retention period will apply to all amounts earned under 
the PSP. Transitional arrangements are in place to move to this 
position from FY19.
• Reduce the cap on pension contributions – Under the new Policy 
the pension cap of 20% of salary has been reduced to 15% of 
salary to reflect current operating levels.
• Increase shareholding guidelines – The shareholding guideline 
under the 2014 Policy for the Executive Directors was 100% of 
base salary. T o further align executives’ interests with those of 
shareholders, the shareholding guideline has been increased to 
200% of salary. Executives will be required to retain 75% of any 
post-tax shares that vest under share incentive plans until this 
shareholding is reached. The requirement to meet the guideline 
over a period of time has been removed. 
In addition to the above, other minor changes have been made, 
intended to align the new Policy to evolving market and best practice 
and to simplify its operation.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   80 07/06/2017   16:38:42 slugline
Key elements of Executive Remuneration Policy
Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy
Base salary, which is payable in cash, is set at an appropriate level to attract and retain management of a high calibre with the necessary 
retail, customer service, financial, digital and service-industry skills and credentials required to deliver a sustainable business model and 
drive shareholder returns.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Generally, salaries are reviewed annually with increases effective 
from 1 October but may be reviewed at other times if the 
Committee considers this appropriate. 
In determining base salary levels consideration is given to:
• the individual’s experience and the performance of the Group 
and the individual; 
• salary levels at other companies of a similar size and 
complexity and at other UK listed retailers (without seeking to 
‘match the median’); and
• the pay increases for other employees in the Group.
While there is no maximum salary level, salary increases will 
generally be in line with increases awarded to other employees in the 
Group.
However, larger increases may be made at the discretion of the 
Committee to take into account circumstances such as:
• changes in an individual’s role or responsibility;
• to reflect an individual’s progression and increase in experience in 
the role; and
• where a salary is significantly behind market practice.
Performance Measures
The payment of salary is not subject to performance conditions. 
However, when determining salary levels the performance of 
Executive Directors is taken into account, in advance of any 
increases being awarded.
Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy
T o provide Executive Directors with market competitive benefits consistent with the role.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
The Committee’s policy is to set benefits at an appropriate level 
taking into account the individual’s circumstances and market 
practice.
Executive Directors currently receive a car plus fuel or a cash 
allowance, private health insurance and life assurance as standard 
benefits.
However, the Committee may determine that additional benefits 
may be provided based on individual circumstances (e.g. the use 
of a chauffeur) when it is considered appropriate.
In the event that an executive is required to relocate to perform 
their role then additional one-off or ongoing benefits may be 
provided such as relocation expenses, a housing allowance and 
school fees.
The Company reimburses reasonable business expenses and may 
pay any tax incurred in relation to these.
Executives are also eligible to participate in any all-employee 
share plans operated by the Company on the same basis as other 
employees.
The overall level of benefits will depend on the cost of providing 
individual items and the individual’s circumstances and therefore 
there is no maximum level of benefit.
The maximum participation levels for all employee share plans is 
the same as any maximum applicable to other employees (and 
consistent with any relevant HMRC limits).
Performance Measures
None

Remuneration Policy Report
Pensions
Purpose and link to strategy
T o enable the Company to offer market competitive remuneration through the provision of additional retirement benefits.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Executives are eligible for a defined employer contribution funding 
to the Halfords Pension Plan, payments into a personal fund and/or 
a cash allowance in lieu of pension. The Committee may determine 
that alternative arrangements should apply (including for new 
hires). When determining such arrangements the Committee will 
consider cost and market practice (subject to the overall limit set 
out in the maximum column).
The aggregate value of any annual pension contributions and cash 
allowance for each individual will not exceed 15% of base salary.
Performance Measures
None
Annual Bonus
Purpose and link to strategy
T o incentivise executives to achieve annual financial targets and performance against key strategic objectives. Deferral of bonus under 
the Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”) further incentivises Executive Directors to manage risk and align their long-term interests with those of 
shareholders.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
The annual bonus is normally based on performance over a 
financial year.
After the year-end the Committee determines the extent to 
which targets have been met. In certain circumstances the 
Committee may review the annual bonus payout in the context of 
the performance of the business during the year and the delivery 
against strategy and may amend the level of bonus payout 
(upwards or downwards) to reflect overall business and individual 
performance.
Normally up to two-thirds of the total bonus is paid in cash. The 
remaining one-third of the bonus is deferred as shares for three 
years. The Committee may determine that a different portion of 
the bonus will be paid in shares or that the bonus may be paid in 
cash. 
Deferred awards normally vest three years from award (or after 
such other period as the Committee determines) and have no 
additional performance conditions. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply to the cash bonus payments 
and deferred share awards for a period of three years from award. 
During this period, the Committee may determine that payments 
may be scaled back in the event of a material misstatement of the 
Company’s results, or where the Company has suffered serious 
loss or reputational damage in respect of the period for which the 
Executive had responsibilities for the running of the business.
Bonuses are non-pensionable.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base salary.
Performance Measures
The annual bonus measures are based on a mix of financial and 
strategic measures. Measures are selected each year by the 
Committee to ensure continued focus on the Company’s strategy. At 
least 50% of the bonus will be based on financial measures.
Performance measures are set annually to ensure they are 
appropriately stretching for the delivery of threshold, target and 
maximum performance.
For 2017/18, the bonus will be based on performance against PBT 
and strategic objectives consistent with the Moving Up A Gear 
strategy.
Further details are provided on page 96 of the Annual Remuneration 
Report.
No bonus will be paid for below threshold performance, typically 
around 50% of the bonus will be paid for achieving ‘target’ levels 
of performance and 100% of bonus will be paid for achieving a 
stretching performance target. Performance targets are set by the 
Remuneration Committee with reference to prior year performance 
and the Group’s business plan.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   82 07/06/2017   16:38:43 slugline
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Purpose and link to strategy
T o attract and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre. T o align Executive Directors’ interests with those of our shareholders by 
incentivising them to deliver the Company strategy and to create a sustainable business and maximise returns to shareholders.
Operation Maximum Opportunity
Annual awards of shares with vesting based on performance over 
a three-year period (or such other period as the Committee shall 
determine). The vesting of awards to Executive Directors is subject 
to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
A post-vesting retention period will apply to awards granted 
under the PSP.  Shares that vest will not normally be released 
to executives (and nil-cost options will not normally become 
exercisable) for a further two-year period (unless the Committee 
determines otherwise) from the point at which the Committee 
determined that the performance conditions have been met. In 
FY18, transitional arrangements are in place, see page 96.
The Committee can apply malus provisions to an unvested award if 
there has been a material misstatement of the Company’s results 
or misconduct by the Executive, or if the Committee considers 
there are other similar circumstances which mean that the malus 
provisions should apply.
The Committee can also apply clawback provisions to an award 
for a period of two years following its vesting if there has been 
a material misstatement of the Company’s results, a calculation 
error in respect of the number of shares over which the award 
was granted or vested, or misconduct, actions or omissions 
by the Executive which have caused or contributed to serious 
reputational damage to the Company.
Maximum award under the PSP is 200% of base salary.
Performance Measures
For 2017 awards will vest subject to the achievement of stretching 
Revenue and EPS growth targets.
The vesting of 25% of the awards will be determined by the growth 
in the Group’s revenue and the vesting of 75% of the award will be 
determined by the growth in the Group’s underlying EPS over a 
three-year performance period.
25% of the award vests for entry level performance.
Any vesting of the PSP will be subject to an underpin whereby the net 
debt to EBITDA ratio remains below 1.5 times on average for the 3 
years of the plan.
For future awards the Committee may determine that different 
financial, operational / strategic or share price related performance 
measures may apply to awards or that a different weighting between 
performance measures may apply to ensure continued alignment 
with our evolving strategy. The majority of the award will be subject 
to meeting a financial performance target.
Other information
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors’ 
interests are aligned with those of our shareholders to incentivise 
them to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all 
shareholders. Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire and 
retain shares with a value equal to 200% of their annual base salary.  
Executives are expected to retain 75% of any post-tax shares 
that vest under any share incentive plans until this shareholding is 
reached.  Current Executive Director shareholdings are disclosed on 
page 94.
Legacy awards
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising 
any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) 
notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 29 July 2014 
(the date the Company’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the policy set out in 
this 2016/17 Annual Report came into effect, provided that the terms 
of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; 
or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the 
Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was 
not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the 
Company.  For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Committee 
satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an 
award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time 
the award is granted.

Plan rules
Awards under any of the Company’s DBP and PSP may:
a. be granted as conditional share awards or nil-cost options or in such other form that the Committee determines has the same  
economic effect; 
b. have any performance conditions applicable to them amended by the Committee if an event occurs which causes the Committee to 
consider that the existing performance condition should be amended to ensure that the objective criteria against which performance 
will be measured will be a fairer measure of such performance and that the amended performance condition will afford a more effective 
incentive to the Executive;
c. when assessing the level of vesting under the PSP, the Committee will consider the underlying financial performance of the Company 
and the value generated for shareholders and may adjust the level of vesting if it considers that the outcome based on the assessment of 
performance against targets does not reflect this; 
d. incorporate the right to receive an amount (in cash or additional shares) equal to the value of dividends which would have been paid on the 
shares under an award that vests up to the time such shares are delivered). This amount may be calculated assuming that the dividends 
have been reinvested in the Company’s shares on a cumulative basis;
e. in respect of the PSP, be settled in cash or with the grant of a vested option at the Committee’s discretion; and 
f. be adjusted in the event of any alteration of the Company’s share capital by way of capitalisation or rights issue, sub-division, consolidation 
or reduction, the payment of a special dividend, a demerger or any other variation of the share capital of the Company. 
Remuneration arrangements in different performance scenarios
As outlined above, the Remuneration Policy is designed to ensure that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors’ remuneration is 
variable and performance-related. By linking the remuneration of the individual Executive Director to the performance of the Company, the 
Committee seeks, as far as possible, to motivate that individual towards superior business performance and shareholder value creation, 
and to only pay rewards when these goals have been realised. Performance measures are aligned with strategic goals so that remuneration 
arrangements are transparent to Directors, shareholders and other stakeholders.
The charts below illustrate remuneration arrangements in different performance scenarios. The assumptions for each scenario are outlined 
below:
Fixed Pay • Fixed pay (base salary, benefits and pension) only
Expected • Fixed pay
• On target PSP award
• 50% of PSP award 
Maximum • Fixed pay
• 100% of maximum annual bonus opportunity

Performance conditions
Annual bonus: The bonus is subject to a mix of financial and strategic 
measures. These measures are selected to provide an appropriate 
balance between profitability and strategic objectives and to 
incentivise individual Directors to meet corporate targets and drive 
individual performance. Targets are set on an annual basis taking into 
account internal and external expectations of performance.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”): The performance measures for 
2017 awards are Group Revenue and underlying EPS growth. 
Revenue growth is strongly aligned with our Moving Up A Gear 
strategy and is easily identified by both management and 
shareholders. However, in order to add value for shareholders, 
revenue improvements need to lead through to improved profitability. 
The majority of the PSP award is therefore subject to improved 
bottom line profit performance measuring the overall success of the 
implementation of our strategy. Targets are set taking into account 
internal and external expectations of performance.
The Committee may determine that different performance measures 
will apply to future PSP awards.
Recruitment remuneration policy 
When hiring a new Executive Director, it would be expected that the 
structure and quantum of the variable pay elements would reflect 
those set out in the Policy table above. However, at recruitment, the 
Committee would retain the discretion to flex the balance between 
annual and long-term incentives and the measures used to assess 
performance for these elements, with the intention that a significant 
proportion would be delivered in shares and that variable pay 
would be subject to performance conditions. In all cases the value 
of any variable pay that will be granted in respect of an executive’s 
recruitment (excluding any buyout compensation for the ‘loss’ of 
existing variable remuneration benefits) will be a maximum of 350% 
of annual salary.
The Committee may also make arrangements to compensate the 
new Executive Director for ‘loss’ of existing remuneration when 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee may take 
account of the form in which they were granted; any relevant 
performance conditions; the length of time that any relevant 
performance periods have to run; and the organisation which 
previously employed the Executive Director. The Committee will seek 
to deliver buy-out arrangements on a broadly like-for-like basis to 
those forfeited.
When determining salary levels for a new Executive Director, the 
Committee may set the initial salary level towards the lower end of 
market practice and may award higher salary increases in the first 
few years as the individual gains in experience to move them towards 
a more market normal level.
T o facilitate buy-out awards outlined above, in the event of 
recruitment, the Committee may grant awards to a new Executive 
Director under the Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the granting 
of awards to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of 
an Executive Director without seeking prior shareholder approval or 
under other relevant Company incentive plans.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation expenses as 
appropriate. In addition, the Committee may agree to provide tax 
equalisation for any new appointment. 
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director, 
the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy in force at that time.
In the event that an internal candidate was promoted to the Board 
legacy terms and conditions would normally be honoured, including 
pension entitlements and any outstanding incentive awards.
Remuneration arrangements elsewhere in the Group
Whilst our Remuneration Policy follows the same principles across 
the Group, remuneration packages for colleagues reflect their 
different roles and experiences, and market practice for similar roles. 
The remuneration policy for senior executives in the Group is similar 
to the policy for Executive Directors as set out in this report – a 
substantial proportion of remuneration is performance-related in 
order to encourage and reward superior business performance and 
shareholder returns and remuneration is linked to both individual 
and Company performance. Basic salary is targeted at normal 
commercial rates for comparable roles and is benchmarked on a 
regular basis. Bonuses can be earned on the same basis as the 
Executive Directors. Senior executives immediately below Board level 
also benefit from participation in the PSP.
Increases to executive managers’ base salaries are considered at the 
same time as all other colleagues across the Group and increases are 
generally in line with all colleagues. 
All of the Group’s circa 10,000 colleagues are eligible to join the 
Halfords Sharesave Plan (“SAYE”) after they have served one 
complete month’s service. Where appropriate, some groups of 
colleagues are eligible for a quarterly or full year bonus, although the 
type, limits and performance conditions vary according to job level. 
Senior managers and other key management individuals are invited 
to join the Company Share Option Scheme or the Restricted Share 
Plan.
In 2016/17 all newly appointed colleagues and other existing 
colleagues who had experienced a ‘joining-trigger’ event were 
eligible to join the Halfords Pension Plan 2009. All members of the 
Pension Plan are required to make a minimum contribution of 1% 
and the Company also contributes a minimum of 1%, dependent on 
length of service and seniority. During the year the Company has met 
its obligations under the pensions auto enrolment legislation, auto 
enrolling all other colleagues as appropriate.
Executive Directors’ service agreements 
T erm and notice periods
The Company’s policy in relation to contractual terms on termination, 
and any payments made, is that they should be fair to the individual, 
the Company and shareholders. Failure should not be rewarded and 
the departing Executive Director’s duty to mitigate any loss he or 
she suffers should be recognised. The notice period for the current 
Executive Directors is six months on either side.  The Committee 
policy is that notice period for new Executive Directors will be no 
more than 12 months. The Committee will continue to review this 
policy, to ensure that it remains in line with the Company’s overall 
Remuneration Policy.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   85 07/06/2017   16:38:43 slugline
T ermination of contract
No compensation would be payable if a service contract were to 
be terminated by notice from an Executive Director or for lawful 
termination by the Company (other than as set out below). The 
Company may terminate service agreements in accordance with 
the appropriate notice periods. In the event of termination for any 
reason (other than for a reason justifying summary termination in 
accordance with the terms of the service agreement) the Company 
may (but is not obliged to) pay to the Executive Director, in lieu of 
notice, a sum equal to the Executive Director’s then salary, benefits 
and pension contributions, which he or she would have received 
during the contractual notice period (six months), the sum of which 
shall normally be payable in monthly instalments.
Executive Directors who are considered to be good leavers may, 
if the Committee determines, receive a bonus for the financial 
year in which they leave employment. Such bonus will normally be 
calculated on a pro rata basis by reference to their period of service 
in the financial period in which their employment is terminated and 
performance against targets. 
The Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in 
connection with a Director’s cessation of office or employment 
where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an 
existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an 
obligation) or by way of settlement of any claim arising in connection 
with the cessation of a Director’s office or employment. In addition, 
the Committee reserves the right, acting in good faith, to pay fees 
for outplacement assistance and/or the Director’s legal and/or 
professional advice fees in connection with his or her cessation of 
office or employment.
Mitigation on termination
Where a contract has been terminated early the Executive Director 
shall use their best endeavours to secure an alternative source of 
remuneration, thus mitigating any loss to the Company, and shall 
provide the Board with evidence of such endeavours upon their 
reasonable request. If the Executive Director fails to provide such 
evidence the Board may cease all further payments of compensation. 
T o the extent that the Executive Director receives any sums as a 
result of alternative employment or provision of services while he or 
she is receiving such payments from the Company, the payments 
may be reduced by the amount of such sums. In good leaver 
circumstances the Executive Director might be offered a lump sum 
termination payment paid at the time they cease employment which 
would normally be less than he or she would receive if he or she were 
to be paid his or her annual salary and benefits over six months.
Change of control
The service agreements of Executive Directors do not provide for 
any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the 
Company.
The Executive Directors’ services contracts are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered office.
Share plans – leaver treatment 
The treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an 
Executive Director ceases to hold office or employment with the 
Group of the Company’s associated companies is governed by the 
relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises leaver 
provisions under the executive share plans. 
‘Good leavers’ as determined
by the Committee
Leavers in other circumstances
(other than gross misconduct)
Halfords Performance Share Plan
Under the PSP ‘Good Leavers’ include: 
death, injury, ill-health disability, redundancy, 
retirement, sale of the individual’s employing 
business or company out of the Group or to 
a company which is not associated with the 
Company or in any other circumstances the 
Committee determines.
Awards will vest at the end of the 
performance period and be released 
at the end of the retention period. The 
Committee will determine the level of 
vesting having due regard to the extent 
to which the performance conditions 
have been met and unless the Committee 
determines otherwise the proportion of the 
performance period that had elapsed at 
leaving. The Executive has 12 months from 
the end of the retention period to exercise 
options if awards are structured as nil-cost 
options.
Alternatively the Committee may determine 
that awards should vest and be released 
at the time of leaving on the basis set 
out above. In these circumstances the 
Executive has 12 months from his or her 
date of leaving to exercise options if awards 
are structured as nil-cost options.
Unvested awards lapse on leaving.
Awards for which the performance 
condition has been met at the time of 
leaving but which were subject to a 
retention period will continue to be released 
at the end of the retention period.
The Executive has 12 months from leaving, 
or if later, the end of the retention period to 
exercise vested but unexercised options 
(if applicable) unless the Committee 
determines otherwise.

‘Good leavers’ as determined
by the Committee
Leavers in other circumstances
(other than gross misconduct)
Deferred Bonus Plan (“DBP”)
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan ‘Good 
Leavers’ include: death, injury, ill-health 
disability, redundancy, retirement, sale 
of the individual’s employing business 
or company out of the Group or to a 
company which is not associated with the 
Company or in any other circumstances the 
Committee determines.
Outstanding awards vest on leaving.
The Executive has six months from leaving 
to exercise options (12 months in the case 
of death).
Awards will lapse on leaving.
The leavers’ treatment under the Halfords Sharesave Scheme is determined in accordance with HMRC provisions. 
In the event of an individual’s misconduct all outstanding share awards would generally be forfeited.
Change of control
In the event of a change of control of the Company, PSP awards may vest and be released (pro-rated for time elapsed in the performance 
period unless the Committee determines otherwise) to the extent that the Committee determines the performance condition should be 
deemed satisfied having regarding to the Company’s progress towards that condition. The Committee may allow awards to vest on the same 
basis in the event of a voluntary winding up or reconstruction of the Company or a demerger except that in the event of a demerger the 
Committee may determine the extent to which awards shall be time pro-rated. 
DBP awards may vest on a change of control, reconstruction, winding up or demerger of the Company.
Alternatively, awards may be rolled over into equivalent awards in a different company.

Appointment
None of the Non-Executive Directors has an employment contract with the Company. However, each has entered into a letter of appointment 
with the Company confirming their appointment for a period of three years, unless terminated by either party giving the other not less than 
three months’ notice or by the Company on payment of fees in lieu of notice.
The remuneration package for a newly appointed Non-Executive Director would normally be in line with the structure set out in the policy table 
for Non-Executive Directors above. 
The appointment period for each Non-Executive Director is set out below:
Director Date of Appointment
Date of Current 
Appointment Date of resignation Expiry Date
Unexpired term at the

Helen Jones 1 March 2014 1 March 2017 — 29 February 2020 33 months
Their appointments are subject to the provisions of the Companies 
Act 1985 and 2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association, and in 
particular, the need for re-election. Continuation of an individual Non-
Executive Director’s appointment is also contingent on that Non-
Executive Director’s satisfactory performance, which is evaluated 
annually by the Chairman. The Chairman is evaluated by the Senior 
Independent Director.
The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for 
inspection by shareholders at the Company’s registered offices.
T ermination of Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment
No compensation would be payable to a Non-Executive Director 
if his or her engagement were terminated as a result of him or her 
retiring by rotation at an Annual General Meeting, not being elected 
or re-elected at an Annual General Meeting or otherwise ceasing to 
hold office under the provisions of the Articles of Association of the 
Company. There are no provisions for compensation being payable 
upon early termination of the appointment of a Non-Executive 
Director. 
Dialogue with shareholders
The views of our shareholders are very important to the Committee 
and it is our policy to consult with our largest shareholders 
in advance of making any material changes to the executive 
remuneration arrangements. 
The Committee actively considers feedback received from 
shareholders prior to and following each annual general meeting.  
It also actively monitors guidance and directional themes emerging 
from institutional shareholder bodies on the subject of executive 
remuneration. This feedback, plus any emerging relevant guidance, 
is considered as part of the Company’s annual review of 
remuneration policy.
Dialogue with employees
The Committee generally considers pay and employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Group when considering pay for Executive Directors 
and senior management. When considering base salary increases, 
the Committee reviews overall levels of base pay increases offered to 
other employees in the Group.
The Committee does not consult directly with employees regarding 
Executive Directors’ remuneration. However, at regular intervals the 
Company conducts a survey of the views of employees in respect of 
their experience of working at Halfords including their own reward.

Structure and content of the Remuneration Report
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports)
(Amendment) Regulations 2013. This Report meets the requirements 
of the Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rules. 
The information set out below represents auditable disclosures 
referred to in the Auditor’s Report on pages 102 to 106, as specified 
by the UK Listing Authority and the Regulations.
Committee Composition
During the year, the Committee comprised:
Claudia Arney (Chair)
Dennis Millard
David Adams
Helen Jones
There were five Committee meetings held during the year, attended 
by all members; details are shown in the table on page 63. The 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee reported to the Board 
on the key issues discussed. A number of informal discussions 
were also held between the Committee Chairman and Committee 
members throughout the year as the need arose. 
All members are considered to be independent for the purposes of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Company Secretary acts  
as secretary to the Committee. 
Activities During the Y ear
During the year, the Committee has 
• discussed and approved both financial and strategic annual 
bonus metrics and targets;
• discussed and reviewed Directors’ and Senior Management 
salaries;
• discussed and reviewed attainment against the performance 
conditions for the Performance Share Plan and Company Share 
Option Scheme due to vest during the period;
• approved grants under the Performance Share Plan, Company 
Share Option Scheme (to senior managers below Board) and the 
Sharesave Scheme;
• reviewed the mechanics and assets of the Employee Benefit 
Trust;
• reviewed the Executive Remuneration Policy; and
• reviewed the T erms of Reference of the Committee.
Advisors 
During the year, the Committee has been supported by Jonathan 
Crookall, People Director and Tim O’Gorman, Company Secretary. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also attend 
Committee meetings on occasion, at the request of the Committee; 
they are never present when their own remuneration is discussed. 
The Committee also engaged with Deloitte LLP, which advised on 
performance measures for the PSP, remuneration reporting and 
other remuneration matters. Fees paid to Deloitte for this advice 
were £10,016, their fees are charged on a time and materials basis. 
Deloitte has also provided advice to management, to enable their 
support of the Committee, primarily in relation to remuneration 
reporting. Deloitte also provided unrelated tax advice during the year. 
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of 
Conduct when dealing with the Committee. We consider Deloitte’s 
advice to be independent and impartial. We are also satisfied that the 
Deloitte Engagement Partner and team, who provided remuneration 
advice to the Committee, do not have connections with the Company 
that might impair their independence. The Committee considered 
the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were 
appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Willis T owers Watson also provided the Committee with executive 
salary market data. Willis T owers Watson is also a signatory of the 
Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct. Fees paid to Willis 
T owers Watson for this advice were £3,500. Willis T owers Watson 
also provides insurance broking services to the Group.
Shareholder Dialogue
The voting outcome from the 2016 Annual General Meeting reflected 
very strong individual and institutional shareholder support. We 
continue to be mindful of the concerns of our shareholders and 
other stakeholders and welcome shareholder feedback on any 
issue related to executive remuneration. In the event of a substantial 
vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ remuneration, we 
would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote, determine 
appropriate actions and detail any such actions in response to it in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
During the year we consulted with our major shareholders and 
shareholder advisory bodies on the changes proposed to our 
remuneration which are outlined in the Chairman’s letter on page 78.  
In general shareholders were supportive of the changes proposed 
and we adapted the proposals in certain areas to reflect the feedback 
received.

previous employer equivalent to the amount he would have received based on performance. In addition, in December 2015 Jonny was awarded a Save As You 
Earn grant amounting to £4,500, based on the discount at grant. These awards were not included in last year’s disclosure. 
2016/17 Annual Bonus 
Annual bonuses for FY17 for Executive Directors were based 20.4% on Group PBT and 12.7% on the delivery of key strategic initiatives crucial

The PBT targets for the FY16/17 bonus were as follows:
15% payable at £73.0m (90% of budget)
50% payable at £81.1m (budget)
100% payable at £89.2m (110% of budget)
Annual bonuses reported in the table on page 90 and payable in June 2017 for the FY17 financial period were calculated as follows:

Jonny Mason £108,171 £67,292 £175,463
In accordance with the Deferred Bonus Plan, Jonny Mason’s bonus will be paid two-thirds in cash with one-third being deferred into shares 
for a period of three years. As set out on page 79 it was announced on 3 May 2017 that Jill McDonald has resigned from her role of CEO 
and therefore will not receive a bonus in respect of FY17. We are committed to providing the greatest possible transparency in relation to 
retrospective achievement against the objectives that form part of the strategic bonus measures.
2015/16 Annual Bonus – PBT Targets 
Last year the Company committed to disclose PBT targets for the bonus paid in respect of 2015/16. These were as follows:
15% payable at £81.5m
40% payable at £86.3m
100% payable at £91.8m
2014 Performance Share Plan Award
Awards granted in 2014 under the PSP were subject to the following performance conditions:
Group Revenue  
Growth – CAGR 
(25% of the award)
Group EBITDA  
Growth 
(75% of the award)
Award ‘Multiplier’ 
(up to 1.5× initial award) i.e. 225% of salary
1.5× initial award vesting 7.5% or more 9.0% or more
Straight-line vesting Between 6.5% and 7.5% Between 7.5% and 9.0%
Core Award
(150% of salary)
100% vesting 6.5% 7.5%
Straight-line vesting Between 5.0% and 6.5% Between 5.0% and 7.5%
30% vesting 5.0% 5.0%
0% vesting Below 5.0% Below 5.0%
The performance conditions for 2014 awards are based on Group revenue performance and Group EBITDA growth. The CAGR and EBITDA 
performance are assessed on an independent basis. However, to ensure that the PSP continues to support sustainable performance, the 
performance levels are set on a stepped basis, where vesting on the revenue measure is dependent upon the EBITDA threshold being met, 
and in addition the revenue measure can only be one step above the EBITDA measure. Given that EBITDA growth was 2.4% the scheme did 
not vest, even though the revenue growth was 5.2%. 
The following table shows the history of PSP award vesting over the last five years.
FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17
PSP vestings (% of maximum) 0% 0% 15% 102.5% 0%
Jill McDonald was appointed to the Board on 11 May 2015 and Jonny Mason was appointed to the Board on 12 October 2015. Neither 
therefore received a PSP award in 2014.
Benefits
Benefits include payments made in relation to life assurance, private health insurance and the provision of a fully expensed company car or 
equivalent cash allowance and fuel card.
Pension
Pension payments represent contributions made either to defined contribution pension schemes or as a cash allowance. The CEO and CFO 
both received a contribution of 15% of base salary.
Leaving Arrangements for Jill McDonald
On 3 May 2017 it was announced that Jill McDonald has resigned from her role of CEO. Jill will continue to work her six month contractual 
notice period. Jill McDonald will not receive a bonus in respect of 2016/17. All of Jill’s unvested share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan 
and the Performance Share Plan will lapse in full when she leaves the Company. On her appointment it was agreed that Jill would be made 
awards with a total value £529,819 to replace awards made by her previous employer that lapsed on resignation. These awards were to be 
delivered in four annual tranches from 2016 to 2019. Two tranches have already been delivered, one in February 2016 and one in February 
2017. Jill will forfeit the outstanding two tranches of this award, originally intended to be delivered in 2018 and 2019.

Performance Conditions
Awards granted in FY17 are subject to the following performance conditions:
Group Revenue  
Growth – CAGR 
(25% of the award)
Group EBITDA  
Growth  – CAGR
(75% of the award)
Award ‘Multiplier’ 
(up to 1.5× initial award) i.e. 225% of salary.

0% vesting Below 4.0% Below 4.0%
In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to meeting an underpin of net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater 
than 1.5x throughout the three-year performance period. This will ensure that net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not 
incentivised to increase net debt levels to meet targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments. The Core Award shares 
that vest will become exercisable in August 2019. T o the extent that awards vest in line with the performance multiplier outlined above, these 
shares will only become exercisable in August 2021, following a retention period of two years. 
CEO Share Award 
The Board agreed that upon joining the Company, Jill McDonald would be given an award of shares to compensate her for awards made by her 
previous employer that lapsed on resignation. The value of these shares was £529,819. Two tranches have been delivered, one in February 
2016 and one in February 2017. As set out on page 79 it was announced on 3 May 2017 that Jill McDonald has resigned from her role of CEO 
and therefore will forfeit the outstanding two tranches of this award.

Shareholding Guidelines (Audited)
The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. Executive Directors 
are encouraged to acquire and retain shares with a value equal to 100% of their annual base salary. Executive Directors have a five-year period 
to build this shareholding following their appointment. As set out on page 83 from 2017/18 the shareholding guideline for Executive Directors 
has been increased to 200% of salary. Executives will be required to retain 75% of their vested shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan and PSP 
until this guideline is met.

Outside Appointments
Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies. Such non-executive 
duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords. Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed 
to accept non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of 
interest. Jill McDonald received fees of £81,000 as a non-executive director of Inter Continental Hotels Group plc in the period.

Base salaries were reviewed with effect from 1 October 2016 and increases were made as per the details on page 79. Current salaries for the 
Executive Directors are as follows:
Chief Executive Officer £520,200
Chief Financial Officer £357,000
Salaries will next be reviewed with effect from 1 October 2017.

Annual Bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for 2017/18 will be as follows:
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary
2/3 paid in cash
1/3 paid in Halfords shares deferred for three years
The annual bonus will continue to be based 80% on Profit Before Tax (“PBT”) performance and 20% based on performance against strategic 
objectives. PBT targets range from 90% of budget, where payment is 15% to 110% of budget for maximum payment. The Committee reviews 
the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that they remain appropriate. These objectives include metrics in 
relation to customer service and colleague engagement.
In determining whether any bonuses are payable, the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to 
ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the context of performance. Bonus targets are released retrospectively as they are 
considered by the Board to be commercially sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords’ business plan and budgeting process 
to competitors which could be damaging to Halfords’ business interests and therefore to shareholders.
Performance Share Plan
As noted in the Chairman’s introduction, during the year the Committee undertook a review of remuneration arrangements and made 
a number of changes to the structure and operation of the performance share plan to reflect market best practice and shareholder 
expectations.
We have simplified the PSP for 2017/18 awards to remove the ‘multiplier’ award for exceptional performance and the maximum award level 
has been reduced to 200% of salary. The level of vesting for threshold performance has been reduced to 25% of maximum.
The vesting of awards will be subject to meeting the following performance conditions:
Group Revenue  
Growth – CAGR 
(25% of the award)
Underlying EPS  
Growth - CAGR 
(75% of the award)
Award
(200% of salary)
100% vesting 7.0% 6.0%
straight-line vesting Between 3.5% and 7.0% Between 1.5% and 6.0%
25% vesting 3.5% 1.5%
0% vesting Below 3.5% Below 1.5%
2017 awards are based on underlying EPS growth and Group Revenue. EPS growth has replaced EBITDA growth to focus management on 
driving returns for shareholder through improved bottom line profit performance measuring the overall success of the implementation of our 
strategy. Group Revenue continues to be an important PSP measure which focuses the management team on driving volume in the business 
and are not proposing to change this element. The two metrics will operate independently of each other.
The Committee believes that these targets are appropriately stretching in the context of the current retail environment, in particular the 
substantial cost headwinds expected over the next few years.
When assessing the level of vesting under the PSP, the Committee will consider the underlying financial performance of the Company 
and the value generated for shareholders and may adjust the level of vesting if it considers that the outcome based on the assessment of 
performance does not reflect this. Any vesting of the PSP will be subject to an underpin whereby the net debt to EBITDA ratio remains below 
1.5 times on average for the 3 years of the plan. In particular the Committee will consider the net debt to EBITDA ratio over the three-year 
performance period to ensure net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not incentivised to increase net debt levels to meet 
targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments.
For 2017 PSP awards, 50% of the shares that vest will be subject to a one-year holding period with the remaining 50% subject to a two-year 
holding period. For 2018 awards and onwards a two-year holding period will apply to the full award. While committed to the use of equity-
based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Executive Directors’ interests with those of shareholders, we are aware 
of shareholders’ concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. Therefore, when reviewing remuneration 
arrangements, we take into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. Halfords intends to comply with the Investment 
Association guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans.

Executive Directors was last increased with effect from 1 April 2016 this was the first increase in these fees since April 2013. Current fees for 
Non-Executive Directors are as follows:

Directors’ Responsibilities
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect 
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and applicable 
law and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
Company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and  
to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Halfords Group plc for the period ended 31 March 2017 set out on pages 108 to 145. In our 
opinion:
 — the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2017 and of 
the Group’s profit for the period then ended;
 — the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union;
 — the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
 — the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements, the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, 
in decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows:
The risk Our response
Carrying amount of  
Autocentres Goodwill 
(£69.7 million; FY16: £69.7 million)
Refer to page 74 to 77 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 116 (accounting policy) and 
page 128 (financial disclosures).
Forecast-based valuation
Following the acquisition of Nationwide 
Autocentres in 2010, the Group holds 
significant goodwill in the Autocentres 
division.
As set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement 
on page 6, the results of the Autocentres 
division were not in line with management’s 
expectations, and, as such, the risk of 
impairment to the associated goodwill has 
increased.
The business operates in a competitive 
market, and commercial factors, such as loss 
of a significant customer, changes to market 
share or changes to the frequency with which 
customers replace their cars, may lead to a  
risk that the business does not meet the 
growth projections necessary to support  
the carrying value of the goodwill.
The estimated recoverable amount is 
subjective due to the inherent uncertainty 
involved in forecasting these cash flows and 
therefore, this is considered to be one of 
the key judgemental areas that our audit is 
concentrated on. 
Our procedures included:
 — Benchmarking assumptions: Comparing 
the Group’s assumptions, in particular 
those relating to forecast long term growth 
rates and discount rates, to externally 
derived data;
 — Historical comparisons: Assessing the 
Group’s performance against budget in 
the current and prior periods to evaluate 
the historical  accuracy of the Group’s 
forecasts;
 — Sensitivity analysis:  Performing 
sensitivity analysis on the assumptions 
noted above, including assumed EBITDA 
growth of 10% and 0% over the next 5 
periods;
 — Comparing valuations: Comparing the 
sum of the discounted cash flows to the 
Group’s market capitalisation to assess the 
reasonableness of those cash flows; and
 — Assessing transparency: Assessing 
whether the group’s disclosures about 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the 
impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions reflected the risks inherent in 
the valuation of goodwill.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Halfords Group plc only
The risk Our response
Carrying value of Retail  
division inventory
(£181.4 million; FY16: £153.3 million) 
Refer to pages 74 to 77 (Audit Committee 
Report), page 117 (accounting policy) and 
page 130 (financial disclosures).
Subjective estimate
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The estimated net 
realisable value of inventory and associated 
provisions are subjective due to the inherent 
uncertainty in predicting consumer demand. 
Further, changes in the Group’s provisioning 
methodology could lead to inappropriate 
releases to the income statement.
The obsolete stock provision is based on a 
model which includes consideration of each 
inventory line, recent sales of those lines and 
the product’s position in its lifecycle. The 
Group further overlays specific provisions to 
account for other matters not captured in the 
model, such as known stock losses and faulty 
goods.
There is a risk that the Group’s assessment of 
the level of these provisions is insufficient or 
inaccurate.
Our procedures included:
 — Assessing methodology: Assessing 
the adequacy of the Group’s inventory 
provision methodology based on our 
knowledge of the industry and factors 
specific to the Group.
 — Our sector experience: Assessing and 
challenging the directors assumptions 
behind the changes to the provision 
methodology against our own knowledge 
of the industry and factors specific to the 
Group;
 — T ests of detail: T esting the key inputs to 
the provisioning model, including recent 
sales data and inventory costing. Obtaining 
a report of sales made subsequent to 
the period end at a negative margin to 
ascertain whether those items should have 
been provided for at the period end;
 — Historical comparisons: Assessing 
the accuracy of inventory provisioning 
by checking the historical accuracy of 
the level of inventory provisions in prior 
periods; and
 — Assessing transparency: Assessing 
the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures 
about the degree of estimation involved in 
arriving at the provision.

3. Our application of materiality and an overview of 
the scope of our audit
Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set 
at £3.3 million (FY16: £4.0 million), determined with reference to a 
benchmark of group profit before tax, of which it represents 4.7% 
(FY16: 5.0%).
We reported to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected 
identified misstatements exceeding £0.17 million (FY16: £0.20 
million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 5 (FY16: 4) components, we subjected 5 (FY16: 4) to 
full scope audits for group purposes. All components are located in 
the UK.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the 
percentages illustrated opposite. 
The Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged 
from £0.1 million to £3.0 million (FY16: £0.1 million to £4.0 million), 
having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across 
the components. The work on 5 of the 5 components (FY16: 4 of the 
4 components) was performed by the Group team.

4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified

the audit of the financial statements and from reading the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report:

and
 — in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.

principal risks

nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing 
in operation over the three periods to 3 April 2020; or

6. We have nothing to report in respect of the 
matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the Annual Report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to report to you if:
 — we have identified material inconsistencies between the 
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy; or
 — the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address 
matters communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 — the parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 — certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
 — the directors’ statements, set out on page 56, in relation to going 
concern and longer-term viability; and
 — the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 58 
relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven provisions 
of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our 
review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement 
set out on page 98, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit 
of financial statements is provided on the Financial Reporting 
Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This

Accounting Policies
General Information
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the 
period ended 31 March 2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
Statement of Compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by  
the EU (“adopted IFRSs”).
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going 
concern basis for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report on page 56, and under the historical cost convention, except where adopted 
IFRSs require an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement”) and share-based payments (IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”). 
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements 
for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016. 
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiary Undertakings 
A subsidiary investment is an entity controlled by Halfords. Control is achieved when Halfords is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from 
its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power, directly or indirectly, over the investee.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. All subsidiary undertakings 
have been consolidated.
The subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 31 March 2017 are detailed in note 4 to the Company balance sheet on page 143.
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange 
for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of these elements exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue Recognition
Retail 
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions 
and returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the 
buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery 
and on services when those services have been rendered.
Car Servicing
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered. 
Promotions and Returns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail 
price. Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on 
goods sold during the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced 
by the value of sales returns provided for during the year.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   114 07/06/2017   16:38:58 slugline
Finance income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest 
rate method.
Non-recurring Items
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management consider that these 
items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Earnings Per Share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or 
loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, 
adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise share options granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation 
of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency and are rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial 
statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the 
functional currency).
Transactions and Balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are 
subject to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate 
at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for 
differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and 
expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is 
transferred to profit or loss.
Employee Benefits
i) Pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract-based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor 
independently. The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of 
contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
ii) Share-based Payment Transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and incorporate an assessment of relevant market performance conditions.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that 
meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted, at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   115 07/06/2017   16:38:58 slugline
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an 
entity when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its 
carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future 
periods. In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the 
revenue that will not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is 
realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Intangible Assets
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment charge is recognised in profit or loss for any amount by which the carrying value of 
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when 
calculating goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each 
reporting date until the consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of ‘Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)’. For these acquisitions transaction 
costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration 
payable will be recognised in profit or loss.
ii) Computer Software
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic 
benefits beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Software is amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life.
iii) Acquired Intangible Assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, provided they are 
identifiable and capable of reliable measurement. 
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, 
from the date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Brand names and trademarks 2 years in respect of Autocentres, 10 years in respect of Boardman and 15 years in respect of Tredz  
and Wheelies;
• Supplier relationships 10 to 15 years;
• Customer relationships 5 to 15 years; and
• Favourable leases over the term of the lease.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end and adjusted if appropriate.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   116 07/06/2017   16:38:59 slugline
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
• Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
• Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
• Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
• Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
• Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
• Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
Impairment of Assets
Tangible and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units). For goodwill, an annual impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date.
Leases
Finance Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the 
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element 
of the rental is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. 
Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit 
of incentives from lessors are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Landlord Surrender Premiums
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group that do not represent 
an incentive for future rental commitments are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further 
substantial acts to complete.
Sublease Income
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised 
by offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle 
and includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 19.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement  
is certain.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   117 07/06/2017   16:38:59 slugline
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the quantum and/or timing of the 
amounts payable, and the time value of money has been incorporated into the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for onerous contracts in loss-making stores and Autocentres which management do not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there is expected to be additional obligations as a result of rent reviews where the review date 
has passed and the review has not yet concluded. This forms part of the Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease 
contracts. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the rent payable after the review. Key uncertainties are the estimate of 
the rent payable after the review has occurred.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is future obligation relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties. The provision is 
based on management’s best estimate of the obligation which forms part of the Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the 
lease contracts. Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.
Provisions for employer and product liability claims are recognised when an incident occurs or when a claim made against the Group is 
received that could lead to there being an outflow of benefits from the Group. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of 
the settlement assisted by an external third party. The main uncertainty is the likelihood of success of the claimant and hence the pay-out; 
however, a provision is only recognised where there is considered to be reasonable grounds for the claim.
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are 
recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
i) T rade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses. 
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank 
overdrafts in addition to the definition above.
iii) Investments
Investments are recognised and carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) Bank borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. 
ii) T rade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Halfords Annual Report 2017.indd   118 07/06/2017   16:38:59 slugline
iii) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. Own shares consist of 
shares held within an employee benefit trust and are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration 
received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being 
taken to revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on transactions in own shares held.
iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase 
of overseas sourced products. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group uses the 
derivatives to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The 
effective element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. Any element of the 
remeasurement of the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group 
Income Statement within finance income or costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction 
is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that 
was reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more 
than 12 months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from the estimates.
The judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements 
are detailed below:
Allowances Against the Carrying Value of Inventories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to 
future demand requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to 
the timing and success of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall 
allowances.
Intangible Asset Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set 
out in IAS 38, the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual 
intangible assets. The useful lives of intangibles assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates 
applicable. 
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that 
their recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, 
which includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of 
goodwill and other assets are explained in note 11.
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 121 to 145.

Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards and interpretations were adopted in the current period as they were mandatory for the year ended 31 March 2017, 
but either had no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or were not applicable.
• IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ - amendments relating to the Disclosure Initiative.
• IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ - amendments relating to clarification of acceptable methods of 
depreciation and amortisation.
• IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’ - amendments relating to Equity method in separate financial statements.
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ - amendments relating to acquisitions of interests in joint operations.
• Annual improvements to IFRS 2012–2014 Cycle.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet 
been applied by the Group in these financial statements. The Group does not believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would 
have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ – finalised version, incorporating requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, general 
hedge accounting and derecognition.
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ – new standard and amendments.
The following standards and interpretations have been published but not yet endorsed by the EU. The Group does not believe the adoption of 
these standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
• IAS 7 ’Statement of cash flows’ – amendments relating to the Disclosure Initiative.
• IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ – amendments relating to recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
• IAS 40 ‘Investment property’ - amendment relating to transfers of investment property.
• IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’ - amendment relating to classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions.
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ - amendments relating to sale or 
contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture.
• IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ - new standard requiring insurance liabilities to be measured at a current fulfilment value and providing a 
more uniform measurement and presentation approach for all insurance contracts.
• IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign currency transactions and advance consideration’.
• Annual improvements to IFRS 2014–2016 Cycle.
In addition the above, IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ has been published but not yet endorsed by the EU. Given that all operating leases with a contract 
life over 12 months will be treated in much the same way as a finance lease on balance sheet, the Group is currently undertaking an impact 
assessment of the likely effect on the consolidated results and financial position of the Group, as it is not yet practicable to quantify the effect 
of IFRS 16 on these consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Operating Segments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units 
offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing 
strategies. 
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from Autocentres. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believe 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions. 
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements. 
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

(a) Acquisition costs relate to the costs associated with purchase of the share capital of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited during the 
period, and the investment in Tyres on the Drive. 
(b) Organisational restructuring was undertaken across Autocentres and Retail during the current and prior years, to better align resource to 
the requirements of the business. This resulted in a non-recurring redundancy expense of £0.6m (2016: £1.7m). These restructure costs 
relate to changes in operating structures which are not expected to be repeated.
(c) The operating lease obligation relates to rectification work  to one of the Group’s retail stores, which was required to make good an area of 
land upon which the store is located. The rectification work required was unique to the specific site and similar expense is not expected in 
the future.
(d) During the year the Group settled a court case which related to activities during FY12. The size and historic nature of the settlement was 
outside the normal experience of the Group. 
(e) The acquisition related interest charge reflects the unwinding of the discounting applied to the contingent consideration due on the 
acquisition of Tredz Limited.  
(f) The tax credit of £0.9m represents a tax rate of 20% applied to non-recurring items. The prior period represents a tax credit at 20% applied 
to non-recurring items.

T otal tax charge for the period 15.0 16.3
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% (effective 1 April 2015) and will be further reduced to 19% (effective from 1 April 
2017) and 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) following changes substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. This will reduce the Company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 31 March 2017 has been calculated based on the rate of 17% substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
In the Chancellor’s March 2016 budget he announced plans to further reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020: however, 
during this financial period, the UK corporation tax rate was 20% (2016: 20%).
The effective tax rate of 21.0% (2016: 20.5%) is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure and non-deductible amortisation of intangible assets.
The tax charge for the period was £14.9m (2016: £16.3m), including a £0.9m credit (2016: £0.3m credit) in respect of tax on non-recurring 
items.
An income tax credit of £0.5m (2016: £0.4m credit) on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair valuing forward currency 
contracts outstanding at the year end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact. 
In addition to the above, a £0.6m current tax debit (2016: £0.7m credit) and a £0.6m deferred tax credit (2016: £1.4m debit) is recognised in 
reserves in relation to employee share options.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and 
is considered low risk by HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”). The Company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and 
reporting obligations. 
In this period, the Group’s contribution from both taxes paid and collected exceeded £160m (2016: £150m) with the main taxes including 
corporation tax £15.3m (2016: £17.2m), net VAT £59.0m (2016: £50.2m), Employment taxes of £48.3m (2016: £45.3m) and business rates 
£37.3m (2016: £36.9m).

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 31 March 2017 of 11.68p per share (2016: 
11.34p per share), which will absorb an estimated £22.9m (2016: £22.3m) of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 25 August 2017 to 
shareholders who are on the register of members on 4 August 2017.
9. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see 
note 23) and has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017. 
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, underlying earnings per share, with profit adjusted for non-
recurring items because it better reflects the Group’s underlying performance. This measure is defined on page 18.

10. Acquisition of Subsidiaries
On 23 May 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited for initial cash 
consideration of £19.2m (excluding transaction costs). The acquired business comprises an online retailer of premium bikes and cycling parts, 
accessories and clothing, which trades UK-wide under the brand Tredz, and the UK’s largest provider of bicycle replacement for insurance 
companies which trades under the brand Wheelies. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Contingent Consideration
In addition to the initial consideration, a liability of £5.5m was recognised at fair value in respect of contingent consideration due to the 
previous shareholders. The contingent consideration is dependent upon the performance of Tredz for the year ended 28 February 2017. The 
range of possible payments under the contingent arrangement is £nil to £12.5m.

Computer Software 0.5
Deferred tax liability (2.5)
Goodwill 9.5
None of the goodwill acquired is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill relates to the assembled workforce of Tredz 
and Wheelies and future expansion and growth opportunities.
The Tredz and Wheelies businesses contributed £36.7m revenue and a profit of £1.8m to the Group’s profit before tax for the period between 
the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of the Tredz and Wheelies businesses had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the 
period would have been £6.7m higher and Group profit before tax of the parent would have been £0.5m higher (before amortisation of 
intangible assets arising on consolidation).

Goodwill of £253.1m (2016: £253.1m) arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is 
allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as 
a group of cash-generating units being Retail. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 
and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an 
overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing. Goodwill of £10.7m arose on the acquisition of Boardman Bikes Limited 
and Boardman International Limited on 4 June 2014 and is allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to the two Boardman entities 
which management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit. Goodwill of £9.5m arose on the acquisition of Tredz 
Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited on 23 May 2016 and is allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to the two entities which 
management monitors on an overall basis as part of the Retail cash-generating unit.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships, b) the workforce, c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets, and d) operating synergies. 
The goodwill on acquisition of the Boardman Bikes is attributable to a) operating synergies and increased control of operations, b) the value 
of immaterial other intangible assets, and c) future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships. The 
goodwill on acquisition of Tredz and Wheelies is attributable to a) assembled workforce and b) future expansion and growth opportunities.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, 
being Retail and Car Servicing. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, 
which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments as reported in note 1. 
The value-in-use of the goodwill held at 31 March 2017 and 1 April 2016 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying 
the recoverable amounts of the Group cash-generating units, which are the discount rate and growth rate.
Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three to five-year period and after consideration 
of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment. The growth rates used beyond the range of the budgets 
are shown on the next page. Given the maturity of the Retail business, no growth rate has been assumed beyond the budget period.
The discount rate is a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-
generating units. The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use are derived from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of 
capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each cash-generating unit. The discount rates used are shown on the next page.

Notes:

2. Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period.
Sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions in the value-in-use calculations has been undertaken, which found that there is a more than 
adequate amount of headroom before an impairment would be triggered. The directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the 
key assumptions, including a +/- 1.0% change in the discount rate, would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.
Overall, the directors have concluded that the recoverable amount of the Group’s CGUs exceeded their carrying amount.

The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
Based on historic default rates and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings, the Group believes that no impairment 
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Financial assets in the scope of 
IAS 39 include all trade receivables and £1.3m (2016: £3.3m) of other receivables.

The Group’s current debt facility came into effect from 14 November 2014 and is a five-year £170m revolving credit facility starting from 
that date. The facility carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin which is variable based on the gearing measures as set out in the facility 
covenant certificate and which is currently 125 basis points. Both utilisation and non-utilisation fees are also applicable being charged when 
utilisation rises above a set percentage with non-utilisation based on a set percentage of the applicable margin. These charges are based on 
market rates as are the commitment fees as mentioned below.

21. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures
Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
• Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
• Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
• Invest surplus cash; 
• Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group, and
• Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). The CFO controls policy and performance through the 
line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to 
monitor the performance of the Treasury function. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at 
a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are 
contained in note 17.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Market Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The 
Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products 
produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market. 
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to 
change by + or – 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease/increase of £0.4m (2016: £0.4m).
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do 
not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group manages capital by operating within a debt ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of net debt to Underlying EBITDA. This was 0.8:1 in 
2017 (2016: 0.4:1).

21. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures continued
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and finance lease obligations, 
short-term deposits and borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short 
maturity of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term 
finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying 
value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where 
payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting 
date and the outright contract rate.
Fair Value Hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
2017
£m
2016
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 16.5 11.9
Loans and receivables 20.9 20.7
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging (assets) 3.7 4.2

Trade and other payables – held at amortised cost (178.4) (154.2)
Borrowings at amortised cost (73.1) (27.0)
Unsecured bank overdraft (18.4) (22.7)
Finance leases (12.0) (11.7)
T otal financial liabilities (281.9) (215.6)
Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and £46.0m (2016: £44.4m) of accruals and 
deferred income.
Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £41.1m (2016: £36.8m) as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial
During the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% 
and 80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 24-month basis. Hedging is performed through the use of foreign 
currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts.

A strengthening/weakening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 31 March 2017 would have (decreased)/ increased equity and profit 
or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be 
reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. 
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Group’s forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases. 
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined-benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in 
respect of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is 
sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity 
level is currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be £140m of the £170m available facility, to 
include the Overdraft Facility of £20m.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers 
of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A-’ credit rating at the time of amend and 
extend agreement (November 2014). At the year-end the banks within the banking group maintained a credit rating of A- or above, in line 
with Treasury policy. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the 
Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities 
to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would 
lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Group banking agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 12. All trade and other payables are due within one year.

The Trust has waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of its holding of the Company’s ordinary shares. The market value 
of these shares at 31 March 2017 was £7.4m (2016: £11.7m). In the current period nil (2016: nil) were repurchased and transferred into the 
Trust, with 886,426 (2016: 1,761,344) reissued on exercise of share options.
Other Reserves
Capital Redemption Reserve
The capital redemption reserve has arisen following the purchase by the Company of its own shares and comprises the amount by which the 
distributable profits were reduced on these transactions in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related 
to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
23. Share-based Payments
The Group has three share award plans, all of which are equity–settled schemes. The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect 
of share-based payments for the current period is £1.0m (2016: £3.0m).
1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal 
to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted before August 2013 will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a 
three-year performance condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per 
share (“EPS”) over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3.5% per year. In the case of grants in excess 
of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year. Exercise of an option is 
subject to continued employment. 
Changes to the performance criteria of the CSOS scheme in relation to the awards granted from August 2013 onwards were made by the 
Remuneration Committee. These changes were made in order to create better alignment with Group’s three-year strategic priorities following 
the Moving Up A Gear programme. The awards are dependent on EBITDA performance and are only exercisable if EBITDA growth exceeds a 
compound annual growth rate of 2.5% over the three-year performance period, or a total growth rate of 8.4%. Exercise of an option is subject 
to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the 
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.

2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder 
completes their saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early 
exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder 
is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. 
3. Performance Share Plan
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three-year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of 
the other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 
350 general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted. 
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model uses 
the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche 
rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a 
Monte Carlo model. 
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest 
in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Performance Share Plan earned final 
dividends of 9.1p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.82 per share. Shares awarded in 2012, 2013 and 2014 under the PSP 
earned interim dividends of 5.5p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.59 per share.
Changes to the performance criteria of the PSP in relation to the awards granted during 2015 were made by the Remuneration Committee. 
These changes were made in order to create better alignment with the Company’s three-year strategic priorities following the Getting Into 
Gear programme. The awards are weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards Group EBITDA growth targets. The 
core award remains at 150% of base salary with a multiplier being introduced of 1.55 the core award if exceptional levels of performance are 
achieved. The shares vesting as part of this multiplier calculation will attract a retention period of two years. In order to focus management 
the awards will be underpinned by a minimum Group EBITDA, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.55 throughout the three-year 
performance period. 
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) for all share award 
plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.

Accounting Policies
Accounting Convention
The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial 
statements for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 31 March 2017, whilst the comparative period covered the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016. 
The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards requires an alternative treatment 
in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. The 
principal variation to the historical cost convention relates to share-based payments. 
Basis of Preparation
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100). In the prior year the Company 
adopted FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ and has ceased to apply all UK Accounting Standards issued prior to FRS 100. Therefore, 
the recognition and measurement requirements of EU-adopted IFRS have been applied, with amendments where necessary in order to comply 
with Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share-
based payments, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are 
given in the Group financial statements.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit or loss account is presented for this company. The profit for the year is 
disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements. Additionally, no cash flow statement is presented as permitted by FRS 101.8 (h).
Employee Benefit Trusts (‘EBT s’) are accounted for under IFRS 10 and are consolidated on the basis that the parent has control, thus the 
assets and liabilities of the EBT are included on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a 
deduction from equity.
Share-based Payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s 
subsidiary undertakings.
In accordance with FRS 101 ‘Group and treasury share transactions’, the fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is 
recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertaking’s financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. The Company has 
recognised the fair value of the share-based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards 
for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an 
expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of 
the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the 
remaining vesting period. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion 
of the Directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. 
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
