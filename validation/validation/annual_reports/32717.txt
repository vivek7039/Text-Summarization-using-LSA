Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am delighted to introduce the maiden Annual Report and 
Accounts for GBGI for the year ending 30 June 2017. It has 
been a landmark year for the Company, having achieved 
a successful AIM listing in February 2017. This report covers 
the performance of the Group’s pre listing parent Saxton 
Lane from 1 July 2016 to 21 February 2017 and GBGI 
Limited from 22 February 2017 to 30 June 2017. Building 
on our proven growth track record, the Group grew gross 
written premiums to in excess of $183.5 million for the 
first time in its history, with revenue for the year growing 
over 23 percent. 
This performance has been achieved against the 
demanding backdrop of preparing the business for its 
admission to AIM and the consequent transition of the 
business to comply with the high-governance and ethical 
standards of the QCA Corporate Governance Code for 
Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies. 
Over the past year we have delivered a strong financial 
performance, further strengthening our balance sheet 
and declaring a maiden dividend.
Progressive change
Reflecting on 2017 I am pleased with the significant strides 
made by GBGI. We have delivered on our business plans 
and have continued to distribute and underwrite medical, 
life and disability, and travel insurance across over 
120 jurisdictions worldwide. The completion of our 
AIM listing earlier this year was a landmark event for the 
business. The funds raised have improved an already 
robust capital position, with our solvency coverage ratio 
standing at 150.4 percent at 30 June 2017 and A.M. Best, 
the ratings agency, upgrading its outlook on GBGI’s 
Financial Strength rating in July 2017. The positive 
reputational benefits from the listing have already 
been felt in terms of commercial momentum.

Non-Executive Chairman GBGI Annual Report 2017 03
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Strategic and operational evolution
During the year we further diversified our business by risk, 
product, distribution partner and geography. We expanded 
our business into the Georgia region, via an investment 
with a local operator, whilst strengthening origination 
relationships worldwide. Our strategic reinsurance 
agreement with AXA, concluded in March 2017, offers 
both a fundamentally strong risk partner and a commercial 
arrangement, which will allow us to open up material 
new growth avenues. Good progress has already been 
made on this front. 
Operationally we have been focused on adapting our 
business for current and future growth, investing in 
decentralising operations and augmenting our IT 
infrastructure to enable operational effectiveness.
Our aim is quite simply to offer the best possible levels of 
customer service, enabling high retention levels and future 
referrals from our distribution partners. Controlling our 
value chain via integrated operations is key and we support 
our policyholders via a global network of offices providing 
medically trained 24/7 support.
The Board and governance
The corporate governance environment of the business 
has undergone significant change during the year, in 
keeping with the requirements of being public and 
recognising the size and scope of the business today. 
In addition to my appointment as Non-Executive Chairman 
the Group welcomed Anne Gunther, Murray Wood and 
David Gibson as Non-Executive Directors effective from 
admission to AIM in February 2017. In July 2017 the Board 
welcomed Doug Trussler as a new Non-Executive Director 
and representative of our long term shareholder, Bison 
Capital.
To better align with our business model, we also have 
changed the Company’s year-end date to 31 December 
from 30 June. That means our next Annual Report will be 
due out early in the second quarter of calendar year 2018.
Dividend
The profitability of our business combined with the 
strength of our solvency position have allowed us to 
declare a maiden dividend, in line with our stated policy. 
We have proposed a final dividend of $0.06 for the year 
to 30 June 2017 and looking forward we intend to adopt 
a progressive dividend policy.
Outlook
As I close my first financial year as Chairman we are 
pleased with the significant progress we have made. 
We are well positioned to build on our momentum as we 
look forward into 2018. We have a proven business model, 
strong financial profile and a drive to deliver sustainable 
growth that is underpinned by prudent underwriting –
which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver enhanced 
shareholder returns for the future.
I would like to thank my fellow board members, the senior 
leadership team and all colleagues across the business 
for their contribution to a year of strategic evolution. It is 
their knowledge, skills and professionalism that delivers 
for customers and shareholders and it is my privilege as 
Chairman to work alongside them.

Strategic Report
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
The year to 30 June 2017 was transformative for GBGI, with 
the strategic progress made by the business over the years 
reflected in a successful listing on AIM in February 2017.
The Group has successfully carved out a differentiated 
niche in the global benefits market, offering the global 
reach of the multinational insurers combined with the 
flexibility and customer responsiveness of local brokers 
and managing agents. This differentiated proposition, 
underpinned by our international network of distribution 
partners, has propelled the ongoing growth of the 
business. We are careful to ensure that the levels of 
customer service exceed expectations and by operating 
across the value chain we seek to maintain close control 
over the service.
Over the past year we have benefitted from our focus 
on niche markets underserved by our competitors, 
and remain the only insurer quoted on the London 
Stock Exchange that derives all of its revenues from 
the international medical, life, disability and travel 
insurance markets.
Strong financial performance
Gross written premiums (“GWP”) grew 19.4 percent to  
$183.5 million, driven by moderate rate increases and 
growth in policy count. An increase in the business we 
retain on balance sheet, underpinned by our consistent 
loss ratio track record, drove higher net earned premiums, 
up 29.3 percent to $91.4 million. Overall net revenues grew 
24.2 percent to $134.3 million.
Our commitment to delivering underwriting profit to our 
reinsurers enabled by the quality of our underwriting 
operations and data history, led to continued strong 
insurance profits for the year. With the business growing 
rapidly we are focused on ensuring the appropriate level 
of investment in the operational infrastructure of the 
business. Investment in operations, including in staffing 
levels and training, led to the expense ratio increasing to 
29.6 percent (FY 2016: 28.6 percent). This investment in 
growth will enable our growth plans to be undertaken 
from a position of platform strength. EBITDA in the year 
was $13.6 million, a growth of 10.6 percent during the year. 
Profit before tax increased 29.8 percent to $13.9 million 
(FY 2016: $10.7 million). Profit attributable to the Group 
after tax increased 29.8 percent to $13.5 million (FY 2016: 
$10.4 million).

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our underlying basic EPS was $0.18. This is a strong 
performance achieved against a backdrop of the 
successful IPO project. It is pleasing to deliver good returns 
for our shareholders whilst allowing for future investment 
and growth.
A more detailed commentary can be found in the 
Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 07 to 09.
A landmark year
The year to 30 June 2017 marked a number of important 
strategic milestones for the business. The Group was 
admitted to trading on AIM in February 2017. We increased 
our global reach by adding territories and deepening 
our operations in existing territories. We built out our 
managed service offering, a new revenue stream for us, 
and underpinned our risk profile via our strategic 
reinsurance agreement with AXA.
Admission to AIM
Our admission to AIM was an important milestone for 
the business. GBGI was originally founded in 1981. The 
Group has evolved in this time, growing in a controlled 
manner and establishing an international footprint 
without incurring a global fixed cost base. 
Obtaining a public listing was important for us on a 
number of different levels, not least via the £32 million of 
capital raised to support expansion opportunities, but 
more fundamentally, as recognition that GBGI is a leader 
of standing and substance in the international benefits 
market. The listing has improved our corporate governance 
procedures and transparency of performance and 
position, factors welcomed by our regulator, ratings 
agency and commercial partners. Finally we were able 
to welcome new shareholders onto the register and 
I look forward to maintaining a close dialogue with our 
shareholders going forward.
Maximising our reach
In April 2017 we announced a new strategic partnership 
with a new Georgia-based insurance company. This new 
business, JSC Risk Management and Insurance Company, 
will target corporate insurance sectors both in Georgia and 
across Central and Eastern Europe. Whilst GBGI is already 
active in over 120 jurisdictions, we continually assess 
and conduct due diligence in territories where we are 
not currently active to determine if it’s appropriate for 
shareholders to allocate resources and capital. I’m pleased 
with the progress made in Georgia and it is a market 
demonstrating real potential.
In addition to entering new regions we also seek, where 
appropriate, to maximise opportunities in existing 
markets. The Group reaffirmed its position in Latin 
America and the Caribbean as a leader in the IPMI 
(International Private Medical Insurance) market. In 2017, 
the Group experienced solid revenue growth and 
profitability in the region, its largest geographical market. 
Building upon our established brand and track record, 
GBGI has expanded its product footprint, targeting the 
corporate market in particular. We can clearly see the 
opportunities for further product and territory penetration 
in Latin America and we will seek to deliver on these 
opportunities whilst delivering a consistently high level 
of service to customers. 
New income streams
Extending the product offering also presents a strategic 
growth opportunity and the Group acquired Quality 
Health Management (QHM), a Florida-based third party 
administration (TPA) firm in January 2017, as a complement 
to its GBG Assist business. The latter was launched in July 
2016, providing worldwide customer support with access 
to assistance on a wide range of medical services, from 
basic enquiries to emergency medical situations, 24 hours 
a day and in over 180 different languages. Whilst GBG 
Assist services Group customers, it also offers its services 
to third parties under the QHM brand. The business has 
performed very well in its first year of operation and offers 
tangible growth opportunities, with low capital input.
Strategic partnership with AXA
In Q4 2016 the business signed a strategic partnership 
agreement with the global insurer, AXA. AXA is now the 
sole quota share reinsurance provider for the business. 
In addition to a fundamentally sound balance sheet 
position, AXA also presents GBGI with a number of new 
business opportunities notably by providing access to 
fronting arrangements, broadening the Group’s footprint. 
I’m pleased to report that the partnership has started to 
yield positive results and is testament to GBGI’s standing 
in the market.
The listing on AIM has improved our corporate 
governance procedures and transparency of 
performance and position, factors welcomed by our 
regulator, ratings agency and commercial partners. GBGI Annual Report 2017 06
Strategic Report
TieCare International
The Group’s educational division continued to perform 
well, cementing its positioning as a market leader in its 
segment. In the fiscal year, TieCare hit a new high in annual 
premium ($27.1 million) after completing its largest 
international school account sale. The division currently 
works with more than 150 international educational 
groups, a record for the Group. TieCare works primarily 
with U.S.-centric international schools, and is planning 
to redeploy marketing resources to move into additional 
educational segments and offer a broader product 
portfolio in 2018.
Benefitting from underwriting excellence
Over recent periods the business has sought to leverage 
its underwriting approach, agility and proven track record 
by retaining more of the risk it writes on balance sheet. 
In the year to 30 June 2017 we retained c. 84 percent 
of the medical, life and disability business we wrote. 
Our underwriting performance is such that this has been 
a significant driver of profit growth, with our underwriting 
result contributing significantly to our operating profit. 
We are careful to maintain the diversified nature of the 
book by both distributor and geography and we envisage 
a stable retention level of 84 percent looking forward.
Commitment to our customers
The foundations of our business have been built on 
ensuring we always deliver the highest levels of customer 
service. Our claims services are often needed at times of 
stress and hardship, and we remain committed to ensuring 
our customers are supported and cared for wherever 
in the world they may be. The growth of our in-house 
GBG Assist operations and our acquisition of QHM are 
testament to our investment in and commitment to 
ensuring the best possible outcomes for our customers. 
Regulation and compliance
Our view is that the regulatory oversight across all our 
markets will continue to evolve. We monitor and evolve 
our risk and compliance activities to ensure we operate 
effectively and correctly.
Our people
As GBGI has expanded we have welcomed many new 
colleagues. Our aim is to attract and retain the best talent. 
We now have some 302 colleagues and a culture that 
prioritises diligent, results-driven and collegial working 
practices. I would like to thank all our colleagues for their 
efforts during the year and subsequently.
Outlook
As increased globalisation and migration foster the 
long-term growth of the international benefits insurance 
sector, we have a number of strategic initiatives in place 
to build on our position. We see the opportunity to expand 
our Life and Disability business, and have recently hired 
a new vertical leader for this product. We continue our 
expansion plans in the student, travel and short-term 
medical markets which demonstrate strong demand 
characteristics. We are very well placed to leverage our 
flexible international operating base and strong funding 
position to continue to write profitable business. We 
approach 2018 and beyond with confidence in our ability 
to continue to deliver for our shareholders.
Summary
We will continue to enhance our position as a leading 
provider of global benefits insurance, globally. We start 
FY 2018 from a position of strength. We have a proprietary 
network of multi-year relationships with distributors 
worldwide, proven underwriting capability and 
performance and the balance sheet strength to grow 
the business whilst maintaining our dividend policy. 
We are continuing to invest in the operations of the 
business to ensure we can deliver on our growth 
aspirations in an efficient, compliant manner. Our 
profitable, cash generative model continues to deliver, 
giving us confidence in our ability to deliver on our targets.

Chief Financial Officer’s review
Delivering financial performance
This is GBGI’s maiden set of annual results since listing 
on AIM in February this year, and I am delighted to report 
a strong financial performance and robust financial 
position from which to grow the business in 2018 and 
beyond. These results once again demonstrate the 
excellent progress we have made in developing our 
business over the years from an agency model through 
to a full service, integrated insurer writing profitable 
insurance business across 120 jurisdictions.
Gross written premiums (“GWP”) increased 19.4 percent 
from $153.6 million to $183.5 million, net revenues 
increased 24.2 percent from $108.2 million to  
$134.3 million, and our profit after tax was $13.7 million  
(FY 2016: $10.4 million). We further strengthened our 
balance sheet in the period, via ongoing profitability and 
the equity capital raised at the time of our IPO. This further 
strengthening was recognized by A.M. Best as it upgraded 
its outlook on our Financial Strength rating to B++ (Good) 
in July 2017. Our solvency position at 30 June 2017 stands 
at c. 150.4 percent

Gross written premiums (“GWP”)
We delivered strong growth in GWP during the year. 
GWP for the fiscal year to 30 June 2017 was $183.5 million, 
growth of 19.4 percent over the prior year period. 
Medical remains the primary product line for the business, 
representing some 86 percent of GWP in the year (Inclusive 
of Travel). Performance in Travel, up 143.4 percent to 
$24.1 million was very encouraging whilst our high return

increasing to $24.4 million.

Life and disability 24.4 23.4
Travel 24.1 9.9
Specialty 0.6 0.3
Total GWP 183.5 153.6
Medical
Our medical insurance products include a variety of group 
and individual plans with a range of benefits and levels of 
cover including emergency evacuation, maternity cover, 
dental cover, wellness programmes and pre-existing 
conditions. 
Total Medical GWP grew 12 percent in the year ended 
30 June 2017 to $134.4 million (FY 2016: $120.0 million) as a 
result of premium growth across nearly all our geographic 
regions. 
Life and disability
Our life insurance products are typically annually 
renewable term life policies, although a small number of 
policies with slightly longer terms (up to 18 months) may 
be written. Term life benefits are set at either a fixed sum 
or as a multiple of the insured’s salary. We also write both 
long-term and short-term disability products with benefits 
typically set as a proportion of the insured’s salary.
Total Life and Disability GWP grew 4 percent in the year 
ended 30 June 2017 to $24.4 million (FY 2016: $23.4 million). 
Travel
We continued to experience strong growth in Travel, with 
growth in the core business supplemented by the addition 
of student based travel insurance products. Travel GWP 
was $24.1 million, a 143.4 percent increase over the prior 
year (FY 2016 $9.9 million). 
Net written premiums (“NWP”)
NWP grew 36.0 percent in the year ended 30 June 2017 
to $105.7 million (FY 2016: $77.7 million). The growth 
in NWP reflects both growth in GWP and higher risk 
retention. Higher retention levels has been a contributing 
factor behind the growth in our profitability and reflects 
the consistency of our underwriting performance over 
a sustained period, the quality of our underwriting process 
and our rich data histories. Looking forward we expect 
retention levels to stabilise broadly around 60 percent 
for the next two policy years.
Total revenue
Total revenues grew 24.1 percent to $134.3 million in the 
year 2017, reflecting the overall growth of GWP across the 
medical products platform and the increased levels of 
retention of that premium. Commission and Fees income 
grew 14.4 percent to $42.9 million, marginally lower than 
GWP growth, but in line with expectations.
Expenses

 $ million
2017 2016
Net claims 47.3 37.5
Administrative expenses 39.8 31.0
Commission expense 34.2 27.7
Net claims were $47.3 million, a 26.0 percent increase over 
the prior year but within the relevant range when compared 
against the Group’s increased level of retained risk premium. 
In general, the Company’s overall medical risk underwriting 
results for policy year 2016 (the major policy year that 
impacts the FY 2017 financial results) are producing 
profitability that is in line with our expectations. Although 
still early in the measurement period, the policy year 2017 
medical underwriting results show an improving trend 
compared with the previous policy year. The underwriting 
results for life and disability continue to deliver excellent 
profitability, in line with the results from prior years. 
Administrative expenses were $39.8 million, increasing 
28.4 percent from $31.0 million in FY 2016. The increase 
in administrative expenses was driven by the continued 
investment in GBGI’s operational platform and associated 
infrastructure, certain one-off expenses and IPO related 
expenses. The expense increases were offset to some 
degree by improved operational cost management 
processes that were implemented in the first half of 
the fiscal year. 
Chief Financial Officer’s review continued GBGI Annual Report 2017 09
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Commission expenses increased 23.5 percent from 
$27.7 million to $34.2 million, broadly in line with the growth 
in retained risk premium, and in line with our expectations.
Profitability
Group operating income increased by 8.4 percent to 
$13.0 million (FY 2016: $12.0 million), driven by growth 
in our insurance book, increased risk retention levels, 
the excellent underwriting results and the impact of the 
implementation of enhanced internal cost management 
processes. Profit before tax increased 29.8 percent 
to $13.9 million (FY 2016: $10.7 million). Profit attributable 
to the Group increased 29.8 percent to $13.5 million 
(FY 2016; $10.4 million). 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) was $0.18, calculated with 
reference to post tax profit of $13.5 million and weighted 
average number of shares in issue of 73,643,652. 
Dividend
In line with our stated policy, we have proposed a maiden 
final dividend at 30 June 2017 of $0.06 per share. 
Our stated dividend policy is that the annual dividend will 
be a certain percentage of the distributable profit with one 
third paid as an interim dividend and two thirds as a final 
dividend. Given the timing of our listing in February 2017 
GBGI did not pay an interim dividend but instead will be 
paying a final dividend of two thirds of 60 percent of the 
distributable profits for the financial year ending 30 June 2017.
Balance sheet 
Net assets and working capital
Net assets at 30 June 2017 were $58.4 million (30 June 2016: 
$28.2 million), with growth driven by the combined effect 
of growth in GWP, cash generation, IPO related restructuring 
and equity raise.
Net cash
The Group’s operating activities continue to be highly cash 
generative and during FY 2017 cash inflow from operating 
activities was $14.0 million. The business is prudently 
financed, in keeping with the commercial demands of 
our business. Net cash at 30 June 2017 was $76.2 million 
reflecting the operating performance in addition to the 
impact of the IPO proceeds.
Insurance liabilities and reserves
Total gross insurance liabilities as at 30 June 2017 of  
$118.9 million comprises $79.0 million of unearned 
premiums, which are deferred to be recognised in 
subsequent periods (30 June 2016: $65.1 million), and 
outstanding claims liabilities of $39.8 million (30 June 2016: 
$40.7 million). Unearned premiums increased 21.4 percent 
from the prior period due to timing of booked premium 
and the overall increase in GWP. Outstanding claim liabilities 
was approximately even to the prior period reflecting timing 
and overall improvements in the underwriting result. 
The provisioning for outstanding claims liabilities is an area 
of significant judgment as it estimates the cost required 
to settle all unpaid claims, both reported and incurred but 
not reported (IBNR), at the balance sheet date. The Group 
manages this risk by applying a consistent reserving 
methodology to each of its product areas and measuring 
actual loss amounts against the reserves quarterly. 
In addition, the Group engages an independent third party 
to review the reserves and reserve methodologies annually. 
Reinsurance contracts
The Group uses excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
arrangements to prudently manage its risk exposure, 
therefore protecting its solvency and underwriting 
capability. Excess of loss reinsurance is designed to prevent 
large claims from having a material impact on performance 
whilst our quota share arrangements allow us to benefit 
from our underwriting excellence without having to fully 
allocate capital to back the policy underwritten.
In recent periods, we have actively sought to increase 
our risk retention levels as our consistent underwriting 
performance gives us confidence that we are able to 
generate excellent underwriting returns. Overall, our 
proven approach to risk structuring is to maximise return 
whilst reducing volatility risk caused by the accumulation 
of losses and large individual claims.
Reinsurance assets, comprising reinsurers’ share of 
outstanding claims liabilities, decreased 5.4 percent year 
on year to $22.7 million at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016:  
$24.0 million) due to the Group’s increased risk retention 
levels. Reinsurance assets have been impacted by our 
strategic decision to retain more of the risk across all of our 
product areas. However, we anticipate that we will maintain 
our current risk retention levels into the near future.
Solvency
The solvency position of the Group at 30 June 2017 
was strong, with solvency coverage of approximately  
150.4 percent at 30 June 2017. This provides a strong 
capital position for the business going forward and gives us 
confidence in our ability to meet our stated dividend policy.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
GBGI Annual Report 2017
Corporate governance statement
The Company was incorporated in Guernsey under the 
Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008 as a non-cellular company 
limited by shares and has been listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”) 
since 22 February 2017.
The Board is committed to achieving high standards of 
corporate governance, integrity and business ethics. The 
Board has taken into consideration the QCA Corporate 
Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted 
Companies produced by the Quoted Companies Alliance 
(the “QCA Code”) and has taken steps to apply the 
principles of the QCA Code in so far as it can be applied 
practically, given the size of the Group, its stage of 
development and the nature of its operations.
The QCA Code adopts key elements of the U.K. Corporate 
Governance Code, as well as other relevant guidelines and 
applies these to the needs and particular circumstances of 
small and mid-size quoted companies on a public market.
The Board of Directors
The Board comprises eight Directors; an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman, two independent Non-Executive 
Directors, two non-independent Non-Executive Directors 
and three Executive Directors; the Chief Executive Officer; 
Chief Financial Officer; and Director of Strategic Planning. 
All Director biographies can be found on pages 10 to 11.
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
Director of Strategic Planning were in office during the 
whole of the year ended 30 June 2017 as were Murray 
Wood and David Gibson. William (Bill) Ward and Anne 
Gunther have been in office since the Company’s 
admission to AIM on 22 February 2017.
Subsequent to the year end, Bison Capital Equity Partners 
III-B L.P. (“Bison Capital”) exercised its right under the 
Relationship Agreement dated 20 February 2017 to appoint 
a Non-Executive Director to the Board. Douglas Trussler 
was appointed on 24 July 2017.
The Board is collectively responsible for the effective and 
long-term success of the Company. It agrees the strategic 
direction and governance structure to achieve the long-
term success of the Company and deliver shareholder 
value. The Board’s full responsibilities are set out in 
a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board.
Chairman and Senior Independent Director
The Chairman, William (Bill) Ward, is deemed by his fellow 
Directors to be independent and to have no conflicting 
relationships with the Company.
Anne Gunther has been appointed by the Board as the 
Senior Independent Director of the Company. She provides 
a channel for any shareholder concerns regarding the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.
Chairman’s duties
The Chairman is responsible for providing leadership 
for the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects 
of its role, and ensuring Directors have sufficient resources 
available to them to fulfil their statutory duties. The 
Chairman is responsible for running Board meetings, 
ensuring there is sufficient challenge from Non-Executive 
Directors and maintaining a particular focus on strategic 
issues. The Chairman promotes a culture of openness 
and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of 
Non-Executive Directors in particular, and by encouraging 
a constructive relationship between Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. Board members are encouraged 
to openly and constructively challenge proposals made 
by executive management. Board agendas are reviewed 
and agreed to in advance to ensure that each Board 
meeting utilises the Board’s time most efficiently. 
Robert (Bob) Dubrish, Chief Executive Officer, is charged 
with leading the day-to-day management of the Group. 
The role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are 
separate with a distinct division of responsibilities to 
protect the independence of the Chairman and his role 
leading the Board. 14

Board operation
The Directors meet at regular, scheduled Board meetings, 
held at least six times a year. Additional meetings are 
arranged as necessary. During the year ended 30 June 2017 
and since the Company’s admission to AIM, the number of 
Board meetings attended by each Director was as follows:
Director Attended
William (Bill) Ward (Non-Executive Chairman) 6/6
Robert (Bob) Dubrish (Chief Executive Officer)* 3/6
Eric Dickelman (Chief Financial Officer) 6/6
Andrew (Andy) Thorburn (Director of Strategic 
Planning) 5/6
Anne Gunther (Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director) 6/6
David Gibson (Non-Executive Director) 5/6
Murray Wood (Non-Executive Director) 5/6
Douglas Trussler** 3/3
*  As announced to the market on 24 February 2017, Mr. Dubrish was absent 
from the Company earlier in the year due to illness and therefore was 
unable to attend all Board meetings in 2017.
** Appointed with effect from 24 July 2017.
The Board is aware of the other commitments and 
interests of its Directors and effective procedures are in 
place to deal with any conflicts of interest which may arise. 
Any changes to these commitments and interests are 
reported to the Board at the earliest opportunity.
The Board receives information prior to each meeting. 
A formal agenda and Board papers are produced for each 
meeting and Board members are given a sufficient period 
of time to review these prior to meetings taking place. 
The Board delegates authority to its Committees to carry 
out certain tasks on its behalf, so that it can operate 
efficiently and give an appropriate level of attention and 
consideration to relevant matters. The composition and 
role of each Committee is summarised on pages 15 to 16.
Independence of Directors
The Board has reviewed the independent status of each 
individual Director and the Board as a whole.
William (Bill) Ward provided compliance and governance 
advice relating to the Company’s IPO process. The Board 
did not feel that his independence was compromised. 
David Gibson and Douglas Trussler have material 
relationships with the Company’s shareholders, FINBAR 
GBG Holdings Limited and Bison Capital respectively. 
They are therefore deemed by the Company to be  
non-independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The Non-Executive Directors, both independent and 
non-independent, contribute a wide range of skills and 
experience to the Board. Each Non-Executive Director 
brings individual character and judgment to bear on 
strategic matters and the performance of the Company.
Board evaluation
An evaluation of the effectiveness and performance of the 
Board and its Committees will be conducted on an annual 
basis.
Election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of 
Incorporation, each Director shall retire from office at each 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company and offer 
him/herself for re-appointment by Shareholders. 
Accordingly all Directors shall stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Board is satisfied that it maintains an effective and 
appropriate balance of skills to reflect the Company’s 
business, its AIM listing and its stage of development. 
The Board is also satisfied that it has suitable levels of 
experience and independence to allow the Directors to 
discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively. The 
Board believes that all Directors continue to make effective 
and important contributions to the Company’s success and 
that Shareholders should support their re-election. 15

Nomination Committee 
Chairman: William (Bill) Ward
Members: Anne Gunther and Murray Wood
The objective of the Nomination Committee is to review 
the structure, size and composition (including the skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity) of the Board, taking 
into account the Company’s current requirements and 
future development, and to make recommendations to 
the Board with regard to any changes. The Nomination 
Committee will also give consideration to succession 
planning for the Board, and will be responsible for 
identifying and nominating, for the approval of the Board, 
candidates to fill board vacancies as and when they arise.
Following review, the Nomination Committee was satisfied 
that the composition of the Board remained appropriate. 
Whilst the Company does not have a specific diversity 
policy in place, diversity is one of the factors that will be 
taken in consideration when appointing new Directors.
An evaluation of the effectiveness and performance of the 
Board and its Committees will be carried out on an annual 
basis via leadership from the Nomination Committee.
Regulatory and Compliance Committee
Chairman: Murray Wood
Members: Eric Dickelman, Robert (Bob) Dubrish 
and Andrew (Andy) Thorburn
The Regulatory and Compliance Committee has 
responsibility for implementing the regulatory and 
compliance enhancement programme and to monitor 
any and all of the Group’s compliance issues, and where 
required, will report their findings to the GBGI Board.
Internal controls
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
This system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can 
provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement, loss, and the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Group’s system of internal controls includes an 
ongoing process of identifying, monitoring and managing 
risks by Management, who ensure that adequate systems, 
processes and controls are in place. In addition, the Board 
carries out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing 
the Company.
Shareholder engagement
The Company is committed to ensuring there is effective 
communication with Shareholders on matters such as 
governance and strategy so that the Board understands 
the views of Shareholders on these issues, and so that 
Shareholders receive a balanced and consistent view of 
the Company’s performance. Communication will primarily 
be through the AGM, which provides an opportunity for 
Shareholders to meet and ask questions of Directors and 
Management. The Board works closely with the Company’s 
Nominated Advisor, Canaccord Genuity Limited to ensure 
appropriate and effective ongoing dialogue with investors 
and to co-ordinate and deliver investor roadshows as 
appropriate.
A range of corporate information is also available to 
Shareholders, investors and the public on the Company’s 
website: www.gbg.com/AboutGBG/Investors. 
Major shareholder agreements
As disclosed within the Company’s Initial Public Offering 
document, the Company entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with Bison Capital on 20 February 2017. The 
principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying 
on its business independently of Bison Capital and its 
associates. Detail of this agreement can be found within 
the Company’s admission document dated 22 February 
2017 and no changes have been made to this agreement 
since that date.
Related parties transactions
Upon admission to the AIM market of the London Stock 
Exchange on 22 February 2017, the Company published 
within its Listing document details of the related party 
transactions in existence up to and including the date of 
admission, being 22 February 2017. There are no additional

AIM Rules) that are required to be disclosed under the

Audit Committee report 
The Board has delegated responsibility to the Audit 
Committee to oversee the financial reporting of the Group, 
including the finance function, internal control and risk

Governance
GBGI Annual Report 2017
The Audit Committee has reviewed, analysed and 
challenged the significant assumptions within the audited 
financial statements with an independent mindset. It has 
considered the application of materiality, the Auditor’s 
assessment of risks of material misstatements (if any), 
and how management has responded to the audit. 
No significant accounting issues have been identified 
during the period.
In relation to going concern, the Audit Committee has 
considered the financial forecasts prepared for the period 
of more than one year subsequent to the date of signing 
of the financial statements. The Group must operate 
within its available cash resources to meet its liabilities 
as they fall due. 
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the 
effectiveness of the external audit process, it undertakes 
a review of the audit plan and the audit results report. 
It also has the opportunity to meet with the external 
auditor without management present. The Audit 
Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the 
re-appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement 
of the Auditor. Any concerns with the effectiveness of the 
external audit process would be reported to the Board. 
The Audit Committee assessed the performance of the 
Auditor in respect of the Annual Report. No concerns 
were raised in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017.
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself that safeguards 
were in place to protect the objectivity and independence 
of the Auditor. Generally it is the approach of the Audit 
Committee not to use the Auditor for non-audit work.
Following the consideration of the above matters, and its 
detailed review, the Audit Committee was of the opinion 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy.
Terms of reference
The Audit Committee keeps its terms of reference under 
review and makes recommendations for changes to the 
Board. The full terms of reference are available on the

Independent auditor’s report
Board of Directors
GBGI Limited
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial 
statements of GBGI Limited and its subsidiaries, which 
comprise the consolidated statements of financial position 
as of 30 June 2017, and the related consolidated statements 
of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash 
flows for the year then ended, and the related notes 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
Management’s responsibility for the 
financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair 
presentation of these consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation 
of consolidated financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the consolidated financial statements are free 
from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit 
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements. The procedures 
selected depend on the Auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the Auditor considers 
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and 
fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit 
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated 
financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of GBGI Limited and its subsidiaries 
as of 30 June 2017, and the results of their operations and 
their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
GBGI Annual Report 2017
Notes to the consolidated  
financial statements
1. Accounting policies
a) General information
GBGI Limited (‘GBGI’ or the “Group”) was incorporated as Saxton Lane Company Limited in Guernsey in 2008 and is 
a multiple line insurance group writing substantially all lines of expatriate medical insurance products and long term 
liability insurance products.
GBGI is a Guernsey corporation located at Level 5, Mill Court La Charroterie, St. Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 1EJ. 
Its registration number is 48728.
b) Basis of preparation
The financial statements represents the consolidated financial statements for the Group for each of the full two years 
ended 30 June 2017 and 2016. The consolidated financial statements has been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and IFRC Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as 
adopted by the European Union. 
The financial statements has been prepared using the historical cost convention. Outstanding claims liability and 
reinsurance and other recoveries are carried at Management’s best estimate of the amounts at which these will be 
settled based on the information currently available to them. These policies have been consistently applied to all periods 
presented.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. The 
areas involving a higher degree of judgment of complexity, or areas where assumptions or estimates are significant are 
disclosed in note 2 below.
The presentation currency of the financial statements is U.S. Dollars, rounded to the nearest thousands ($’000) unless 
otherwise indicated. The Group’s functional currency is U.S. Dollars. The presentation and functional currency of the 
Group and its subsidiaries is deemed to be U.S. Dollars.
c) Going concern
The Directors have prepared a cash flow forecast covering a period extending beyond 18 months from the financial 
statements presented as at 30 June 2017.
The Directors have taken into account the historical positive cash flows, growth in business and the inherent risks and 
uncertainties facing the business, and have derived forecast assumptions that are the Directors’ best estimate of the 
future development of the business. For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments 
that would result from the going concern basis of preparation being inappropriate.
d) New accounting standards and amendments
The new International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and International Standards (‘IAS’) and amendments 
detailed below are not mandatory until the effective dates stated. Early adoption is permitted where the standards 
has been endorsed by the EU. 
Title Effective date
IFRS9 Financial instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS16 Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS17 Insurance Contracts 1 January 2021
The Group will apply the standards detailed above for the reporting periods beginning on the effective dates set out above.  28

1. Accounting policies continued
New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are not yet effective and have not been adopted 
early in this financial statements, will or may have an effect on the Group’s future financial statements:
 > IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, endorsed by the EU. IFRS 9 
is a replacement for IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments’ and covers three distinct areas. Phase 1 contains new requirements 
for the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities. Phase 2 relates to the impairment of financial 
assets and requires the calculation of impairment on an expected loss basis rather than the current incurred loss basis. 
Phase 3 relates to less stringent requirements for general hedge accounting.
  The Group performed a high-level impact assessment of all three aspects of IFRS 9. This preliminary assessment is 
based on currently available information and may be subject to changes arising from further detailed analyses or 
additional reasonable and supportable information being made available to the Group in the future. Overall, the Group 
expects no significant impact on its balance sheet and equity, except for the effect of applying the impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9. The group plans to defer the application of IFRS 9 until the earlier of the effective date of the 
new insurance contracts standard of 1 January 2021, applying the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 as 
introduced by the amendments.
Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts
In September 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 4 to address issues arising from the different effective dates 
of IFRS 9 and the upcoming new insurance contracts standard. The amendments introduce two alternative options 
for entities issuing contracts within the scope of IFRS 4, notably a temporary exemption and an overlay approach. The 
temporary exemption enables eligible entities to defer the implementation date of IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning 
before 1 January 2021 at the latest. An entity may apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 if: (i) it has not previously 
applied any version of IFRS 9 before and (ii) its activities are predominantly connected with insurance on its annual 
reporting date that immediately precedes 1 April 2016. The overlay approach allows an entity applying IFRS 9 to reclassify 
between profit or loss and other comprehensive income an amount that results in the profit or loss at the end of the 
reporting period for the designated financial assets being the same as if an entity had applied IAS 39 to these designated 
financial assets. An entity can apply the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018. An entity may start applying the overlay approach when it applies IFRS 9 for the first time. The Group 
performed an assessment of the amendments and reached the conclusion that its activities are predominantly 
connected with insurance as at 30 June 2017 . The Group intends to apply the temporary exemption in its reporting 
period starting on 1 July 2018.
 > IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, 
endorsed by the EU, sets out to clarify the principles of revenue recognition and establish a single framework for 
revenue recognition. This standard replaces the previous standard IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS18 Revenue 
and revenue related IFRICs. 
  The Group expects to apply IFRS 15 fully retrospective. Given insurance contracts are scoped out of IFRS 15, the Group 
expects the main impact of the new standard to be on the accounting for income from investments. The Group does 
not expect the impact to be significant.
 > IFRS 16 Leases, effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, endorsed by the EU, sets out the 
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, 
i.e. the customer (‘lessee’) and the supplier (‘lessor’). IFRS 16 completes the IASB’s project to improve the financial 
reporting of leases and replaces the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related Interpretations.
The impact of this new standard on the Group is still being considered. 29

1. Accounting policies continued
Amendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts continued
 > IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, effective annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 sets out the requirements 
that a company should apply in reporting information about insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it 
holds. IFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4. IFRS 17 will provide comprehensive guidance on accounting for insurance contracts 
and investment contracts with discretionary participation features. For general insurance contracts, IFRS 17 will 
introduce mandatory discounting of loss reserves expected to be paid in more than one year as well as risk adjustment, 
for which confidence level equivalent disclosure will be required. Further, IFRS 17 is expected to have a significant 
impact on accounting for life insurance contracts as well as on the presentation of insurance contract revenue in the 
financial statements.
The impact of this new standard on the Group is still being considered.
e) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporates the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by the Group as 
at 30 June 2017 and 2016 and the results of all controlled entities for the financial years then ended. Control is the power 
over the investee, exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to use its 
power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. The effects of all transactions between controlled 
entities are eliminated in full. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of the controlled entities are shown 
separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method when control of an entity of business is obtained. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed 
in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent 
of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net 
assets of the controlled entity acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss. 
Non-controlling interests in an acquiree are recognised at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s net identifiable assets. 
f) Insurance contracts
A contract is recognised as an insurance contract if it transfers significant insurance risk. Such contracts may also transfer 
financial risk. Insurance risk is transferred to the Group where it agrees to compensate a policyholder if a specified 
uncertain event, other than those caused by changes in a financial variable such as interest and foreign exchange rates, 
adversely affects the policyholder. All of the Group’s insurance products are classified as insurance contracts. 
The results are determined on an annual basis whereby the incurred cost of claims, commission and related expenses 
are charged against the earned proportion of premiums, net of reinsurance as follows:
i) Premiums written
Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any additional premiums arising on 
insurance contracts recognised in prior years. Written premiums include estimates of premiums due but not yet 
receivable or notified to the Group, less allowance for cancellations. Premiums are stated net of taxes collected on 
behalf of third parties. 
ii) Unearned premiums
Unearned premiums represent the proportion of premiums written that relate to periods of insurance coverage to be 
provided in periods subsequent to the reporting date. Unearned premiums are earned as revenue over the period of 
the contract on a time apportionment basis, unless there is a marked unevenness in the incidence of risk over the period 
covered by the insurance. In these cases, premiums are recognised based on the assessed incidence of risk. 30

iii) Acquisition costs
Acquisition costs, which represent commissions due to internal employees and third party brokers for the sale of 
insurance policies are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
iv) Claims incurred
Claims incurred comprise claims and related expenses paid in the year and changes in the provisions for outstanding 
claims, including provision for claims incurred but not reported and related expenses, together with any adjustments 
to claims outstanding from previous years.
v) Claims provisions and related reinsurance recoveries
Provision is made at the reporting date for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date, 
including the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to the Group. Although the Group takes all reasonable steps 
to ensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claim exposures, given the uncertainty in establishing claims 
provisions, it is likely that the final outcome will be different from the original liability established and may result in 
significant adjustments to the amounts provided. Adjustments to the amounts provided are reflected in the consolidated 
financial statements in the accounting period in which the adjustments are made. 
The Group does not discount liabilities for unpaid claims.
The estimation of claims incurred but not recorded (‘IBNR’) is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than 
the estimation of the cost of settling claims already notified to the Group, where more information about the claim event 
is generally available. The in-house underwriting team conducts the IBNR review using standard actuarial methodologies 
to evaluate and determine the IBNR reserves for of the Group.
vi) Reinsurance
The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits set for each line of business. The 
contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers, under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more 
contracts issued by the Group and that meet the classification requirements for insurance contracts, are classified as 
reinsurance contracts. Outward reinsurance premiums are recognised in the same accounting period as the related 
premium income. Reinsurance claims recoveries are recognised in the same accounting period as the related insurance 
claims are accounted for. 
The amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated based upon the gross provisions, having due regard to their 
collectability and the terms of the related reinsurance contract. The reinsurance recoveries in respect of estimated claims 
incurred but not reported are assumed to be consistent with the historical pattern of such recoveries, adjusted to reflect 
changes in the nature and extent of the reinsurance program over time. The recoverability of reinsurance recoveries 
is assessed having regard to market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurers.
Gains and losses on buying reinsurance are recognised immediately at the point of purchase and not amortised.
The reinsurers’ share of claims incurred, in the profit or loss, reflects the amounts received or receivable from reinsurers 
in respect of those claims incurred during the period. The reinsurance premiums due are primarily premiums payable 
for reinsurance contracts and are recognised in the profit or loss as outward reinsurance premiums when due.
g) Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rate 
of exchange at the reporting date. 
Non-monetary items are measured at historical cost and are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction and non-monetary items measured at fair value are measured using the exchange rate when fair value 
was determined. 
The Group is exposed to gains and losses that result from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on 
foreign currency denomination transactions. Gains and losses which result from transactions denominated in foreign 
currency are reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 31

h) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost (or deemed cost) less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values over their useful lives. Depreciation is calculated 
on the straight line method to reduce their carrying value to the residual amount as follows:
 Equipment   5 years
 Furniture and fixtures  5–7 years
 Leasehold improvements 7 years
The residual values, length of the economic lives and depreciation method applied are reviewed on a regular basis, and 
at least at every reporting date, and adjusted as appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than 
its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal 
of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount.
i) Intangible assets
Costs of implementing new software systems are capitalised as incurred. Amortisation of software does not commence 
until the system is fully installed and operational. Intangible assets acquired are measured on initial recognition at cost. 
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated 
impairment losses. The amortisable intangible assets represent computer software and development costs and are 
reported net of accumulated amortisation. 
Costs of implementing new software systems are capitalised as incurred. Amortisation of software does not commence 
until the system is fully installed and operational.
The amortisable intangible assets are amortised on a straight-lined basis over its estimated useful life of 3-5 years and is 
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation of 
intangible assets is carried out only when the implementation is complete and the asset is in use.
j) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity 
acquired and the fair value of non-controlling interest in the acquiree.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, 
or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the recoverable amount of the 
cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount 
of any goodwill allocated to that unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses so recognised are not 
subsequently reversed.
k) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short term highly liquid 
investments which are not subject to significant changes in value and have original maturities of less than three months.  32

l) Tax
The charge for tax is based on the results for the year determined in accordance with the relevant tax laws and 
regulations that are enacted, or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in each jurisdiction.
Deferred tax is provided in full on all temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated based on the tax rates that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and which are expected to be in force 
when the relevant deferred tax asset is realised or the relevant deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax balances 
are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority within the Group.
m) Employee benefits
Share-based payments
A transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment where the Group receives services from employees and pays 
for these in shares. 
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based schemes 
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant, measured 
by use of an appropriate valuation model. The expected life used in the model is based upon the vesting period and 
contractual term for each vesting-tranche for awards with grade vesting. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line 
basis over the period services are received, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. 
Share options are forfeited when an employee ceases to be employed by the Group.
Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits, including compensated absences, are benefits to be paid within one year after the 
end of the reporting period in which the related services are rendered. A liability and expense are recognised for the 
undiscounted amount expected to be paid for short-term employee benefits in the period in which the employee renders 
services in exchange for the benefits.
Other long-term employee benefits
The Group and its subsidiaries make payments to defined contribution benefit arrangements on behalf of employees. 
The charge to the profit or loss represents the amounts payable by the Group for the year. The assets relating to these 
arrangements are held separately to those of the Group.
n) Operating segments
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer.
The Board considers that the Group’s insurance activities constitute only one operating and reporting segment, as 
defined under IFRS 8. Management reviews the performance of the Group by reference to total results. 
The total profit measures are operating profit and profit for the year, both disclosed on the face of the consolidated profit 
or loss. No differences exist between the basis of preparation of the performance measures used by management and 
the figures in the Group financial statements. 33

o) Financial assets 
The Group’s financial assets are loans and receivables. Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party 
to the provisions of the contract.
Loans and receivables
These investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid for the acquisition of the 
investment. All transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are also included in the cost of the investment. 
After initial measurement, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less allowance for impairment. Loans 
and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. The Group’s loans and receivables financial assets comprise all short-term trade and other receivables (excluding 
prepayments) and cash and cash equivalents included in the Statement of Financial Position.
Short term receivables are measured at cost, less any impairment. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or less.
Impairment of financial assets
All financial assets are assessed at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is any objective evidence 
of impairment as a result of one or more events having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. 
An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables financial assets is recognised in the profit or loss and is measured 
as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is an 
approximation of the amount that the Group would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.
In a subsequent period, if the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to 
an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through 
profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed 
what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
p) Financial liabilities
The Group’s financial liabilities are all categorised as loans and payables. Financial liabilities are recognised when, and 
only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. 
Loans and payables
The Group’s loans and payables comprise all trade and other payables (excluding other taxes and social security costs 
and deferred income), insurance liabilities, redeemable preferred shares and Class D shares. Short term payables are 
measured at cost. They represent balances where the Group is not able to avoid settlement in cash or another financial 
asset.
Shares issued by the Group are classified as a financial liability to the extent that they meet the definition of a financial 
liability. Both the redeemable preferred stock and Class D shares are classified as a financial liability as the Group has 
contractual obligation to deliver cash and, in this case, payment of dividends which are accrued and paid annually.
The redeemable preferred stocks and Class D shares, are measured initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and 
are measured subsequently at amortised cost and interest is recognised in profit or loss.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same party on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the profit or loss. 34

1. Accounting policies continued
q) Commission and fees 
The Group earns a managing general underwriter and agency commission income for underwriting, marketing, and 
administration. Commission income is recognised as one unit of account on a pro-rata basis over the policy period. 
The Group also earns a fronting fee on the policies it writes. Fees vary from 3% to 5.5% of premiums written. Income 
is recognised on a pro-rata basis over the contract period and is included in commission and fees on the consolidated 
statements of income. The Group also charges a policy administrative fee, which is invoiced in addition to the insurance 
premium. Such fees are recognised as revenue over the policy term, which matches with the period the services 
are rendered.
Profit commission is a commission paid by the insurance and reinsurance carriers based on overall profit of business 
placed with the carriers during a particular contractual year. Profit commission is recorded at the earlier date of when 
the amounts are received from the reinsurance carriers or when the commission can be reasonably estimated and 
earned by the Group.
r) Share capital
Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition 
of a financial liability or financial asset.
Apart from redeemable preferred stocks and Class D shares, the Group’s common shares are classified as equity 
instruments. Any dividends paid for the redeemable preferred stocks and class D shares are classified as finance costs. 
Any dividends on the equity instruments are reported against the accumulated retained earnings in the statement 
of changes in equity.
s) Investment income
Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as it accrues and is calculated by using the effective 
interest rate method.
t) Deferred acquisition cost
Those direct and indirect costs incurred during the financial period arising from acquiring or renewing of insurance 
contracts and/or investment contracts are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums 
from insurance contract. All other acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, this Deferred acquisition cost (“DAC”) asset for life insurance is amortised over the 
expected life of the contracts as a constant percentage of expected premiums. DAC for general insurance and health 
products are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned. The deferred acquisition costs for 
reinsurers are amortised in the same manner as the underlying asset amortisation and is recorded in the statement 
of profit or loss.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method and are treated as a change in an accounting 
estimate.
An impairment review is performed at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment arises. 
When the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss. 
DACs are derecognised when the related contracts are either settled or disposed of. 35

GBGI Annual Report 2017
2. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments
The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and based on historical experience and other factors, 
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas in which critical estimates and assumptions are applied are described below:
a) Liability for unpaid claims and loss adjustment expenses
The estimation of the ultimate liability arising from claims made under insurance contracts is the Group’s most critical 
accounting estimate. There are several sources of uncertainty that need to be considered in the estimate of the liability 
that the Group will ultimately pay for such claims. 
Provision is made at the reporting date for the estimated cost of claims incurred but not settled at the reporting date. 
The liability for outstanding claims includes the cost of claims reported but yet to be paid, claims incurred but not 
reported, and the estimated expenses to be incurred in settling claims. There is the potential that the amounts at 
which claims are settled could differ to the amounts at which they are currently provided.
The estimation of insurance liabilities is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates 
and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional 
experience becomes available or as regulations change. The Group takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has 
appropriate information regarding its claims exposures. 
In arriving at booked claims provisions, management also took into consideration changes or uncertainties which may 
create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce 
when compared with the cost of previously settled claims including:
 > changes in patterns of claim incidence, reporting and payment;
 > the impact of inflation (both economic/wage and superimposed);
 > changes in the mix of business;
 > the impact of large losses;
 > medical and technological developments;
 > changes in policyholder behaviour.
There is the potential that the amounts at which claims are settled and, the related reinsurance recoveries, could differ 
materially from the amounts at which they are disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The methods used to analyse past claim experience and to project future claim experience are largely determined by 
the available data and the nature of the portfolio. The projections given by the different methodologies assist in setting 
the range of possible outcomes. The most appropriate estimation technique is selected taking into account the 
characteristics of the business class and the extent of the development of each accident year.
b) Estimate of reinsurance recoveries
The Group’s reinsurance premiums, loss expense and reserves related to reinsurance business are accounted for on 
a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and terms of the reinsurance contracts. 
Loss expenses related to ceded premiums have been netted against the total loss expenses which are included in 
expenses on the consolidated statements of income. 
The Group also enters into a personal accident excess of loss reinsurance agreement where minimum deposit premiums 
are paid by the Group. The Group’s gross loss reserve is ultimately based on management’s reasonable expectations of 
future events as is the estimate of future recoveries from reinsurers. It is reasonably possible that the expectations 
associated with these amounts could change in the next year and that the effects of such changes could be material to 
the consolidated financial statements.  36

2. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments continued
c) Intangible assets
Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount may be impaired. This requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU to which 
goodwill is allocated. Details of the key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amounts are contained in 
Note 17. 
The key area in which critical judgments are applied are described below:
a) GBG Philippines
The Group’s Directors have considered the power they exert over the Groups participation in GBG Philippines. 
Notwithstanding the fact the Group holds 28% of the shares it is their opinion that they have the power over the investee 
to affect the investor’s returns and that GBGI controls GBG Philippines. As such GBG Philippines has been consolidated 
as if it were a subsidiary (see Note 19).
3. Management of insurance and financial risk
The management of risk is a fundamental concern of the Group’s management. This note summarises the key risks to the 
Group and the policies and procedures put in place by management to manage them. The components of insurance, 
market, credit, liquidity and operational risk are considered below:
a) Insurance risk 
Insurance risk refers to fluctuations in the timing, frequency, and severity of insured events relative to the expectations at 
the time of underwriting. Insurance risk can also refer to fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements and 
reserves. 
Insurance risk is historically the single most significant risk area within the Group. It is split between four principal key 
risks, which are all managed through the application of controls as well as the use of reinsurance to offset exposures 
through the transfer of risk. These four key risks are as follows: 
Failure of pricing: The Group faces the risk of incorrect pricing of products resulting in financial losses or reduced profit, 
through being set too high (therefore losing market share) or too low (therefore resulting in an unacceptable profit 
contribution for that product). The Group seeks to manage this through the setting and review of pricing guidelines 
relevant to each business line and the application of a strict hierarchy of underwriting authorities is in place to ensure 
that policies are underwritten with management oversight. 
Ineffective strategy/failure of product: When an inappropriate strategy or product is introduced for a specific business 
line or the Group as whole, there is an increased risk that material financial and reputational losses will occur. The Group 
seeks to manage this through the use of processes and procedures in place over the production, review and analysis of 
annual business.
Failure to manage risk aggregation/accumulation: The Group may be exposed to an increased likelihood of 
disproportionate losses for specific perils if insured risks are overly focused on a specific geographical area or type of 
policy cover. The Group seeks to manage this through the use of pre-bind rules and authorities to manage significant 
within line and cross-line exposures. 
Adverse reserve development: The Group may be exposed to reserve shortfalls or distortions through failing to set 
sufficient case reserves or through failing to adopt a robust and consistent reserve strategy across products offered 
to insured and countries. The Group seeks to manage this through monitoring adherence to established policies and 
procedures in place governing claims reserving practices.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding claims provisions 
and are in accordance with the reinsurance contracts. The Group purchases excess of loss insurance, as part of its risks 
mitigation programme to limit the maximum net loss. 37

Concentration of insurance risk 
The Group monitors its operations to consider and manage any potential risk concentrations and manage any potential 
risk concentrations by reference to such analysis.
Impairment of insurance receivables 
No material amount is past due and impaired, hence, no material impairment is required to be made in the opinion of 
the Directors.
Claims development
The loss development tables presented below show the cumulative provisions for insurance claims, whether reported or 
not, and related loss adjustment expenses arising for each accident year from 2012 onwards. The historical net insurance 
claims provision for all outstanding claims arising for accident years prior to 2012 are shown cumulatively as one figure in 
the left hand column. All amounts shown in the tables have been stated at constant exchange rates based on the rates 
prevailing at 30 June 2017.

The estimates of claim cost are presented at the end of 6 months because the policy year is different from the financial year.
Sensitivity analysis
Key assumptions
The Group develops these estimates for the claims liability on the assumption of the information which is currently 
available, including potential claims which have been reported to the Company, experience of the development of similar 
claims and case law. This includes assumptions made on the average claim costs, number of claims for each accident year, 
legislative changes, and changes in inflation rates, changes in patterns of claim incidence, reporting and payment. 
The key assumptions selected are average claim costs or number of claims for each incident year as these factors can 
be quantified whereas other assumptions like legislative changes or change in patterns of claim incidence are not easily 
quantifiable. It is assumed that the increase or lower of one of these key assumptions by 5% will result in 2 possible 
scenarios: 
(i) Scenario 1: the gross written premium increase or decrease by 5% but the loss reserve ratio remains the same; and
(ii)  Scenario 2: The gross written premium increase or decrease by 5% but with no change to claims recoverable 
from reinsurers.
The 5% is the sensitivity rate that represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in the average 
claim cost or number of claims for each accident year in the next 12 months. 41

b) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group is adversely affected by movements in the value of its financial assets or liability 
arising from market movements such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates or other price risk. A description of 
the Group’s principal risk relating to market risk is shown below, along with a summary description of controls the Group 
applies in seeking to mitigate this risk:
Currency risk
The Group sells less than 12 percent of its insurance policies to foreign customers in foreign currency denominations. 
At each period end, foreign currency monetary items are translated using the closing rate. Currency risk arises where 
assets and liabilities are settled in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group. Currency risk is the risk 
that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange 
rates. The Group has no significant concentration of currency risk.

Fair value hierarchy
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are classified as loans and receivables. Therefore, a fair value hierarchy is not 
separately disclosed. In the opinion of the Directors the amounts at which the financial assets and liabilities are disclosed 
in the consolidated financial statements is a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
c) Financial risk
A description of each of the Group’s principal risks attached to financial risk is shown below; along with a summary 
description of controls the Group applies in seeking to mitigate these risks:
Credit risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the 
other party to incur a financial loss. The Group has exposure to credit risk principally through its holdings of reinsurance 
assets. No material insurance premium receivables are past due, hence no material impairment risk has been identified 
by the Directors. There has been no change in the Group’s processes in respect of credit risk over the period. 
The Group faces a risk of material losses if their main reinsurers fail or are unable to pay their contractual share of claims 
payable. The Group seeks to manage this through annual review of the financial strength and creditworthiness of 
reinsurance counterparties as well as tracking overall exposures to individual reinsurers. In addition, a list of approved 
reinsurers is maintained, and an established process is in place to ensure that approval is obtained before reinsurance 
cover is taken out with a reinsurer not on the approved list (this may include requiring collateralisation).
The Group faces a risk of material losses and cash flow issues if third party obligors are unable to pay amounts due. The 
Group seeks to manage this risk through the utilisation of processes and procedures in place to ensure that the Group 
only utilises approved bank operating accounts. In addition, the Group has controls in place to ensure that brokers used 
are subject to credit checks prior to and during the period where they provide services to the Group, where it is possible 
to do so. 43

d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its 
financial liabilities, primarily insurance claims, as they fall due. This risk is mitigated by holding funds predominately in 
liquid financial assets i.e. cash and cash equivalents and constant monitoring of expected asset and liability maturities. 
The Group further manages this risk through monthly reviews of the Group cash accounts as well as review and approval 
of forward looking reviews of cash requirements into the next quarter. The Group’s Treasury department is also 
operationally responsible to ensure that sufficient funding required for future expected cash requirements are available 
and that the sources of funding are appropriately diversified. There has been no change in the Group’s processes in 
respect of liquidity risk over the period.

e) Operational risk
Operational risk is defined by the Group as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people 
and systems, or from external events. It is intrinsic to the Group’s operations but is actively mitigated and managed. A 
description of each of the Group’s three principal risks attached to operational risk is shown below; along with a summary 
description of the controls the Group applies in seeking to mitigate these risks. There has been no change in the Group’s 
processes in respect of operational risk over the period. 
IT systems failure: The Group potentially faces a risk of business interruptions and inefficiencies if IT systems fail. Such 
business interruptions would impact on the profitability of the Group and has the potential to cause reputational 
damage. The Group seeks to manage this risk through having procedures in place to back-up data together with other 
controls designed to minimise external threats/unauthorised access. 
Non-IT systems failure: The Group also potentially faces a risk of business interruptions and inefficiencies from a wide 
range of potential issues, such as insufficient or inadequately skilled staff, accounting errors, errors in processing such as 
mis-matching reinsurance contracts, poor customer service, badly executed projects and extreme events such as fires or 
natural disasters that affect the Group’s offices and staff. The Group seeks to manage these risks through the claims 
audits, implementation of training, development of policies and appropriate procedures and continued system 
enhancements. 
Legal, regulatory or compliance breach: The Group operates in a highly regulated insurance environment, whereby 
breaches of the regulations the Group works within may lead to significant financial penalties and reputational damage. 
The Group seeks to manage this risk through a number of policies and procedures in place covering regulatory 
requirements. These policies are reviewed periodically by key senior management and the Group’s legal department to 
ensure that they provide a basic framework within which the Group is compliant with local and regional regulatory 
requirements. The Group also has a Regulatory and Compliance Working Group that meets regularly to review key 
metrics that pertain to regulatory and compliance and discuss any open issues that fall within the purview of regulatory 
and compliance.
f) Capital risk management
The Group’s capital management objectives are:
 > to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders; and
 > to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk.
To meet these objectives, the Group reviews its budgets and forecasts on a regular basis to ensure there is sufficient 
capital to meet the needs of the Group through to profitability and positive cash flow.
The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity as set out in the Group’s Statement of Changes in 
Equity. All working capital requirements are financed from existing cash resources and borrowings.
In accordance with the Insurance Business (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2002, the minimum capital requirement of GBG 
Insurance Limited (“GIL”), being a licensed insurer writing general insurance business, is £100,000 (equivalent to $134,000) 
as at 30 June 2017 and 2016.
Similarly, in accordance with the Insurance Business (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2002, the minimum capital requirement 
of Global Security Life Insurance Ltd (“GSLIL”), being a licensed insurer writing general insurance business, is £250,000 
(equivalent to $334,000) as at 30 June 2017 and 2016. This company ceased writing business on October 1, 2016 and is 
currently in run off. 46

4. Segment Information
For management purposes, the Group has categorised all its revenue and profit in one reportable segment – provision of 
specific and customised medical, disability, life and travel insurance products to meet the needs of expatriates, third 
country local nationals, and high net worth local nationals worldwide. 
In the normal course of business, the Group engages in reinsurance ceded transactions as part of its overall underwriting 
strategy. Reinsurance includes quota share, excess of loss, and facultative treaties on all policies written. Reinsurance 
ceded does not discharge the Group from its liabilities to the original policyholders in respect of the risk being reinsured.

Equity securities – designated as at fair value 249 – 
In January 2017, Global Benefits Group (GBG) entered into a strategic partnership with a new Georgia-based insurance 
company. JSC Risk Management and Insurance Company, known as Global Benefits Georgia. The Group invested 
$248,551 into Global Benefits Georgia for 15% ownership of the authorized shares. The Group is a minority shareholder 
and does not control the investee, therefore the Group did not include Global Benefits Georgia in the consolidated 
financial statements.
The Group has not disclosed fair values for investment in Global Benefits Georgia as fair values or fair value ranges for 
the investment cannot be reliably estimated. There is no active market for this investment.
11. Share-based payment arrangements
a) Description of share-based payment arrangements
On 22 February 2017, as part of the initial public offering, the Group established share option programmes that entitle 
employees to purchase shares in the Group. Under this programmes, holders of vested options are entitled to purchase 
shares at the market price of the shares at grant date. The key terms and conditions related to the grants under these 
programmes are as follows; all options are to be settled by the physical delivery of shares.
Grant date Number of instruments Vesting conditions Contractual life of options 
22 February 2017 2,328,900 3 years service 
from grant date
10 years
The options will vest at 33.33% per year for a three year period from the grant date. 49
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
GBGI Annual Report 2017
11. Share-based payment arrangements continued
b) Measurement of fair values
The fair value of the employee share options has been measured using the Black-Scholes formula. The inputs used in the 
measurement of the fair values at grant date of the share-based payment plans were as follows:
Fair value at grant date £1.50
Share price at grant date £1.50
Exercise price £1.50
Expected volatility (weighted-average) 22.0%
Expected life (weighted-average) six years
Expected annual dividend yield 5.0%
Risk-free interest rate (based upon government bonds) 2.4%
Expected volatility was based upon peer group volatility using a six year historical average. Expected life was estimated 
using the simplified method, based on the mid-point between the vesting period and the contractual term for the grants.
For the year ended 30 June 2017 the total expense for the share-based payments was $130,395 and is included 
in Administrative Expenses. Below an overview is provided of shares provided in the employee stock option plan.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share 
options during the year:

15. Income tax (credit)/expense
GBGI and GIL are assessed at the Company standard rate of 0% due to the change to the Guernsey corporate income tax 
regime. 
The Group does not file a consolidated return with its foreign subsidiaries. The Group files U.S. federal and state returns 
and its foreign subsidiaries file returns in their respective jurisdictions. GBG files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax 
return with its subsidiaries ICS, GBGH, GBG US, GAS, GIS and GBGC (Note 19 for company’s full name). Income taxes 
currently payable are based on the taxable income for the period. 
Income tax expense for the years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016 are shown below:

The Group has U.S. federal and U.S. state carried forward losses and accelerated temporary differences excluding the 
tax amortisation of goodwill amounting to $26,899,000 and $25,135,000 as at 30 June 2017 (2016: $14,744,000 and 
$16,344,000). The losses are available to offset future taxable income which expires in varying amounts beginning in 2033 
for U.S. federal and state tax purposes. Any foreign net operating losses do not expire. As the timing and extent of 
taxable profits are uncertain, the deferred tax asset of $9,703,000 (2016: $6,458,000) arising on these losses and 
accelerated temporary differences has not been recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 53

16. Earnings per share – Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding Ordinary shares purchased by the Group and 
held as treasury shares, and share-based payments for employees. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on 
the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of Ordinary shares outstanding after 
adjustments for the effects of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
Basic and diluted earnings per share 2017 2016
Profit attributable to the equity holders ($000s) 13,459 10,370 
Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue (in numbers) 73,643,652 66,418,950
Basic and diluted earnings per share ($) 0.18 0.16
As at 30 June 2017, the total number of potentially dilutive shares related to outstanding stock options was 2,328,900 
(30 June 2016: zero). The outstanding stock options were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as 
the impact of including the stock options would have an anti-dilutive effect. 
On 20 February 2017, the Company effectively performed a 1-for-1950 share split. Each common share, issued and 
outstanding as of such effective date, were effectively exchanged and converted into 1,950 ordinary shares. All share 
and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the share spilt for all periods presented. 54

The balance of goodwill as at 30 June 2017 and 2016 was $4,618,817 and $3,820,461. The goodwill balance relates to 
the acquisition of the business assets of TieCare International, Inc. and GBG Holdings, Inc. in November 2005 and the 
acquisition of Quality Health Management, LLC in January 2017. The amortisation on software has been charged to the 
profit or loss as indicated in Note 12.
Goodwill and impairment review
The Group has goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations but does not hold any intangible assets 
that have indefinite lives.
The approach of the Group is to test impairment at the cash generating unit (‘CGU’) level. This is the lowest level of unit at 
which the Group is effectively able to manage and monitor performance, cash flow and goodwill. The Group has one CGU, 
namely the insurance business.
The goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to this cash generating unit. The valuation is performed 
on a value-in-use basis.
In order to evaluate the recoverable amounts relating to the CGU based on value in use, the following key information 
should be noted.
 > The recoverable amounts have been determined using the cash flow forecast from its most recent financial plans 
projected for a five-year period and then extrapolated into perpetuity, with a discount rate applied.
 > The financial plans have been prepared at the cash generating unit level based on historical trends adjusted for 
expected events. These individual plans have been aggregated as the basis for the cash flow forecast. 
 > The discount rate has been calculated as the weighted average cost of capital. The post-tax discount rates calculated 
was 14.0 percent. 
 > The perpetual growth rate of 3 percent reflects the maturity, penetration and profile of the cash generating unit. 
This rate is not higher than the average long term industry growth rate. 55

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
With regard to the assessment of value in use for the insurance cash generating unit, management does not believe 
a reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the units to exceed 
the recoverable amount, as the recoverable amount well exceeded the carrying value.
Management performed their annual review of goodwill and determined no impairment existed for the years ended 
30 June 2017 and 2016.

In its capacity as a managing general agent, the Group collects premiums from its customers. The Group deducts its 
administrative fees and the authorised commissions associated with the sale of the policies and claims administration 
from these premiums. The net premium not reserved for claims payment is then remitted to the respective carriers. 
Unremitted insurance premiums are held in a fiduciary capacity until the Group disburses them and is classified as 
restricted cash. The Group invests these unremitted funds only in cash and money market accounts. 
22. Dividends
The Group did not declare any ordinary dividends for the years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016. The Group has paid

Class D Shares – 5,500
Redeemable preferred stock Series A
The redeemable preferred stock represents 250 non-voting Series A preferred shares of GIL issued for cash with a par 
value of $1,000 per share issued under the terms of a Preferred Share Agreement dated 27 June 2011. Such shares 
represent all of the authorised shares of Series A Preferred Shares.
The preferred shares accrue dividends (‘Investor’s Distribution’) at 50 percent of the difference between the underwriting 
profit and 10 percent of the net risk premium of insurance premiums received by the Group as a result of the direct 
marketing efforts of the holder of the redeemable preferred shares.
If at the end of any policy year there is an underwriting loss, this loss is carried forward to subsequent policy years and 
no dividend will be paid until such time that the loss carry forward is applied to underwriting profit of subsequent policy 
years such that the loss ratio for policy years in aggregate is less than one. The maximum investor premium is equal to 
eight times the par value of the outstanding preferred shares.
The par value and therefore the maximum investor premium the Group will accept can be increased by mutual 
agreement of the parties.
At the option of the investor, and if the investor chooses not to receive its dividend at the end of any policy year in which 
there are no loss carry forwards, then the investor shall be entitled to apply its distribution to subscribe for and receive 
additional preferred shares. As there were no related policies in force for the years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016, no 
dividends were earned. 60

26. Redeemable preferred stock and Class D shares continued
The shares are redeemable by the Group at the earlier of twenty years from the date of issuance and the expiration of 
any run-off period after termination of a Co-operation Agreement between GIL and the investor or as otherwise agreed 
between the Group and the investor. The redemption price shall be the par value of the preferred shares or as may be 
agreed between the Group and the Preferred Shareholder. 
In the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Group, the investor as a holder of 
the Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive only the amount as shall be equal to the investor’s distribution it 
would have received in accordance with the foregoing. The holder of the Series A preferred stocks shall not be required to 
make additional capital contributions to the Group other than contributions in an amount equal to the underwriting loss 
without the express prior approval of the Group.
Class D shares
On 26 June 2013, the Group entered into an Exchange Agreement and Amendment to the Securities and Exchange 
Agreement dated 22 September 2010, where 3,000,000 Class D Common, shares were issued to an independent third 
party and 2,500,000 Class D Common Shares were issued to a shareholder. The agreement requires the Group to comply 
with certain covenants. As at 30 June 2017 and 2016, the Group was in compliance with its covenants. 
The consideration for the issue of the 3,000,000 Class D Common Shares was the cancellation of a Promissory Note 
issued to the independent third party by the Group on 22 September 2010 which had a maturity date of 22 September 
2015. The Group cancelled the note in exchange for the issuance of such shares. In the opinion of the Group, the 
reasonable present cash value of the shares issued was determined as $3,000,000, which was the amount outstanding 
on the Promissory Note and that in its opinion, the present cash value of the consideration for the issue of such shares 
was not less than the amount credited for the issue of the shares.
The consideration for the issue of the 2,500,000 Class D Common Shares was the cancellation of a Promissory Note 
issued to the independent third party by the Group on 22 September 2010 which had a maturity date of 22 September 
2015. The Group cancelled the note in exchange for the issuance of such shares. In the opinion of the Group, the 
reasonable present cash value of the shares issued was determined as $2,500,000, which was the amount outstanding 
on the Promissory Note and that in its opinion, the present cash value of the consideration for the issue of such shares 
was not less than the amount credited for the issue of the shares.
Class D Non-Voting Common Shares accrue dividends at the rate per annum of $0.12 per share, payable quarterly in 
arrears. Dividends paid on the Class D Non-Voting Common Shares were $427,000 and $660,000 in the years ended 
30 June 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As part of an initial public offering on 22 February 2017, 5,500,000 Class D Shares were exchanged for 2,933,333 of 
Ordinary Shares. No gain or loss was recorded on the retirement of Class D Shares. 61

Dividend and capital requirements
Payment of dividends to the Group by its insurance subsidiary (GIL) is limited by insurance regulations. The maximum 
amount of ordinary dividends that GIL may pay to shareholders in a 12-month period is limited to the amount that 
would not preclude GIL from meeting the margin of solvency or approved asset requirements. GIL has not declared

30. Contingent liabilities
In the normal course of business, the Group engages in reinsurance ceded transactions as part of its overall underwriting 
strategy. Reinsurance includes quota share, excess of loss and facultative treaties on all policies written. Reinsurance 
ceded does not discharge the Group from its liabilities to the original policyholders in respect of the risk being reinsured. 
The Group believes its reinsurance companies are financially stable.
The Group is also involved in certain claims and legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. 
Management does not believe that the outcome of any current pending claims or legal proceedings in which the Group is 
currently involved will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s consolidated financial position, results of operations 
or cash flows.
