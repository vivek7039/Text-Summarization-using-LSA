About us 
Hurricane is new generation of oil company 
that exists to discover, appraise and develop 
oil from fractured basement reservoirs. 
Fractured basements are a global 
phenomenon which have been produced 
successfully for extended periods in multiple 
locations around the world. However, in 
the UK they represent a new play type 
for a sector of the oil industry which has 
historically focused on sandstone reservoirs. 
Hurricane is the first oil company to target 
fractured basements in the region.
Unlike sandstone reservoirs, which hold oil 
in pores in the rock, fractured basement 
reservoirs are composed of very hard rocks 
such as granite, with the oil held in the 
fractures that have formed over the past  
2.5 billion years. 
Where we operate 
Hurricane has a portfolio of contiguous 
offshore licences on the UK Continental 
Shelf, to the west of Shetland. 
The area is a proven petroleum basin with 
a number of large producing oil fields 
including Clair, Foinaven and Schiehallion. 
Hurricane’s licences are focussed on the 
Rona Ridge, a major NE-SW trending 
basement feature. The water depth in the 
area is around 150 metres. All licences are 
owned 100%.
Extensive exploration and appraisal work 
programmes have led to a number of 
significant discoveries in the Company’s 
acreage, including Lancaster, Whirlwind, 
Lincoln, and Halifax. 
What we do 
Technically led and driven, we use our 
expertise to find oil where others have 
looked but not seen. We make and exploit 
discoveries, working towards realising the 
value of those discoveries. 
Hurricane has drilled eight wells on its 
acreage since 2009 including five on the 
Lancaster field.
Hurricane is now working towards the 
first phase of development of its Rona 
Ridge assets, the Lancaster EPS. Extended 
production will provide data to improve 
understanding of the reservoir to be applied 
across the Company’s portfolio in further 
appraisal activity. 
The first phase of development of Lancaster 
is an Early Production System (EPS). This 
involves tying two existing wells back to the 
Aoka Mizu Floating Production Storage and 
Offloading (FPSO) vessel. The Bluewater-
owned Aoka Mizu previously operated on 
the Blackbird and Ettrick fields in the North 
Sea and requires only limited upgrades and 
life extension to be used on Lancaster.
The EPS is key to delivering the reservoir 
information required to move to full field 
development. 
It’s objectives are to:
•  Provide long-term production data to 
enhance understanding of reservoir 
characteristics and associated full field 
development scenarios
•  Commence development of resources in 
phased manner with regard to managing 
uncertainties over reservoir characteristics 
and associated development risks
• Deliver an acceptable return on investment

Hurricane has focussed on implementing its strategy in the West of 
Shetland region of the UKCS. As fractured basement reservoirs have 
not previously been exploited in the UK, Hurricane has determined 
that it will need to maintain ownership of its assets for longer, and 
at greater levels, than is typical in more common reservoir types in 
the region. The Company believes that this approach will allow it to 
optimise the value it obtains for its discovered resources. 
Implementation of Hurricane’s strategy has led to a focus on the 
Company’s Lancaster field, which is now the best understood asset in 
its portfolio, following five wells drilled by Hurricane. The Company 
plans to bring the Lancaster field to commercial production, in 
an initial development phase, the EPS. This allows uncertainties 
associated with the reservoir to be removed whilst commencing a 
phased development and generating cash flow. 
The Company believes that it will achieve the best value for its asset 
base by progressing the portfolio as a whole. It will therefore explore 
and appraise its other assets in the surrounding vicinity, alongside 
the EPS development, to allow a read-across in reservoir properties 
and to demonstrate the size of the overall resource base.
Hurricane’s strategy is to 
create shareholder value 
through monetising the 
significant reserves and 
resources associated 
with naturally fractured 
basement reservoirs  
through exploration, 
appraisal and development.

Overview
Strategic Report

Financial Statements
Welcome to Hurricane’s 2017 Annual 
Report. This has been a transformative 
year for the Company.
Following first oil, with data from the EPS 
being generated and no imminent funding 
hurdles, we will be in a strong position to 
move towards establishing the value that can 
be ascribed to our overall acreage holdings. 
The positive working relationship between 
Hurricane and its Tier 1 contractors is a 
reflection of the Company’s contracting 
strategy. We chose our Tier 1 contractors 
on the basis of demonstrable industry 
reputation, technical expertise, health, 
safety and environmental track record, 
and supportive contractual structures. 
We believe that they are best placed, 
and appropriately incentivised, to take 
us through engineering and installation, 
to first oil and into the operations phase. 
The progress on the upgrade to the Aoka 
Mizu in Dubai and the excellent working 
relationship with the Bluewater Energy 
Services (Bluewater) team, is the most 
visible reflection of that strategy. We are 
aligned in wanting to see the vessel sail 
away on schedule and remain on track to do 
so. As for the well completion and subsea 
installation aspects of the development; 
with both Xmas trees delivered and 
flowlines, umbilical and manifold in the 
final stages of fabrication, we now look 
forward to the start of offshore operations. 
We secured our major contracts at an 
opportune moment in the industry cycle, 
and will continue to strive to minimise 
finding and development costs as we further 
explore, appraise and develop our Rona 
Ridge assets.
Successful delivery of the EPS is a core 
component of the Group’s remuneration 
strategy, including the Value Creation Plan 
(VCP). 2017 was the first full year of this 
five-year long-term scheme introduced in 
late 2016, concurrent with the November 
Interim Chairman’s Statement
shareholders. Management are fully aligned 
with our shareholders as the Company 
transitions to becoming cash generative, 
and in ultimately monetising the Company’s 
assets. The details of the VCP are set out in 
the Remuneration Report. 
At the beginning of 2016, Hurricane was an 
exploration and appraisal company, with 
processes and procedures that were fit 
for purpose at that time. The completion 
of our 2016/17 drilling campaign and 
obtaining FDP approval for the EPS means 
that Hurricane has evolved as a company. 
Our focus has extended beyond drilling 
additional exploration and appraisal wells, 
when funding allows, to transitioning towards 
organic cash generation. This evolution has 
required an upgrade to our organisational 
structure, processes and procedures. Initial 
work on gap analysis commenced following 
the July 2017 fund raise and the Listing and 
Governance Committee (LGC) of the board 
was formed to coordinate the work streams 
that will prepare the Company for the next 
phase of its development. The appointment 
of a new Chairman, following Dr Robert 
Arnott’s resignation, and subsequently one 
or more additional non-executive directors, 
will ensure that the composition of the board 
of directors of the Company (Board) and 
its committees are fully compliant with the 
Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), a standard 
not required of AIM-quoted companies. 
The newly constituted Board will evaluate 
the appropriateness and timing of an 
application for admission of the Company’s 
ordinary shares to a premium segment of a 
recognised stock exchange (Premium Listing). 
Notwithstanding those decisions, it is the 
Board’s view that the Company should act  
as if it were Premium Listed. 
As John van der Welle sets out in his report as 
Chairman of the LGC, we have taken a number 
of those steps already and will continue to 
ensure that your Company becomes and 
thereafter remains Code compliant.
2017 was indeed a fabulous year for 
progressing Hurricane’s operations and my 
thanks go to all those who helped make 
it happen, regulators who supported our 
drilling and early development activities, 
our contractors, who have been working 
collaboratively with us, and of course all 
the Hurricane staff, who have worked 
tirelessly throughout. 
I expect to be able to pass on the role of 
Chairman very shortly and then return 
to my non-executive role as Senior 
Independent director.
Following the successful $530 million fund 
raise required to take the Final Investment 
Decision (FID) on the Lancaster Early 
Production System (EPS), we were given 
approval by the Oil & Gas Authority (OGA) of 
the Field Development Plan (FDP), such that 
we could then proceed with the execution 
of the project. Given the challenging oil 
price environment in mid-2017, this was a 
great achievement by management. The 
data generated by the EPS will allow us to 
progressively evaluate the performance of 
the Lancaster reservoir system and gain 
increasing confidence in the volume of oil 
that we can expect to recover from our 
Rona Ridge assets. At the time of writing, I 
am delighted to report that first oil remains 
on schedule for H1 2019.
Throughout 2017 we continued to engage 
with industry in line with our stated aim 
of achieving a farm-out or sale in advance 
of a full field development. As we have 
progressed our asset base, we have seen 
interest build in the West of Shetland region 
and also in basement reservoirs in northwest 
“ At the time of writing,  
I am delighted to report 
that first oil remains on  
schedule for H1 2019”
It has been an honour to be your Interim 
Chairman. My interest in the Rona Ridge and 
its basement reservoirs started many years 
ago. Hurricane is now poised to demonstrate 
the potential of the Lancaster reservoir, a 
key step to providing the understanding 
which will underpin the development and 
monetisation of its assets.

Europe. The rapidity with which Hurricane 
has advanced Lancaster, from the drilling 
and testing of the -7 and -7Z wells in late 
2016, to a funded and approved FDP with 
target first oil approaching, is unusual in the 
industry. Moving at this pace has allowed 
us to remain at 100% in our licences, as we 
approach first cash generation.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Overview
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
The year was marked by the significant 
progress made on the EPS, the first stage 
of development of our Rona Ridge assets. 
The purpose of the EPS is to provide the 
necessary reservoir understanding to progress 
to a phased development of our Rona Ridge 
assets, whilst generating significant cash flow 
to commence the next phase of appraisal and 
development. At the time of writing, the EPS 
remains on track and on budget. 
FID and FDP approval bisected the year. 
Prior to these events, the Company was 
focused on the numerous work streams 
that culminated in being able to pass these 
milestones; exploration, appraisal and 
development drilling, front end engineering 
and design (FEED) studies, detailed 
engineering, contracting and funding. 
Following FID and FDP approval, Hurricane 
is now very much in project execution 
mode. This mode includes upgrade and life 
extension work on the Floating, Production, 
Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO), the 
Aoka Mizu, which commenced in earnest 
in Dubai, following the vessel’s arrival in 
September. TechnipFMC’s fabrication 
facilities have been equally busy fabricating 
the Xmas trees and the subsea umbilical, 
risers, and flexibles (SURF). I have been able 
to witness personally the excellent progress 
of the construction phase of the EPS by 
visiting these facilities, and look forward to 
well completion and installation activities 
commencing shortly.
Our extensive exploration, appraisal and 
development drilling campaign in 2016/2017 
resulted in two Competent Persons Reports 
(CPRs) being published during the year in 
review. The Lancaster field CPR, published 
in May 2017, assigned the Company proved 
plus probable (2P) reserves of 37.3 million 
stock tank barrels of oil, based on just a 
six-year EPS duration (this would increase to 
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
The 2016/17 wells on Lincoln and Halifax 
were a very successful first step. As clarity 
around the timing of first oil becomes 
apparent in H2 2018, and we complete the 
necessary studies on the data obtained from 
our drilling campaign, we will set-out plans 
for further appraisal and future development 
phases utilising projected organic cash 
flow. Efficient development of a resource 
base as large as ours will necessarily involve 
significantly greater surface infrastructure 
than included for the EPS, and associated 
investment that exceeds the funding 
capacity currently available to Hurricane on 
a sole basis. Whilst plans for such broader 
development phases are being formulated, 
we will be working towards getting the most 
out of our existing facility, the Aoka Mizu. 
To make use of the full throughput capacity 
of 30,000 barrels of oil per day, and vessel 
life of 10 years, a key next step is FPSO 
debottlenecking and implementing a gas 
export or disposal solution.
Whilst the focus of the Company during the 
year has been on the EPS, the success of the 
Halifax exploration well in Q1 delivered another 
leg of our Rona Ridge exploration, appraisal and 
development strategy. The Halifax well was the 
last of the four wells drilled through 2016/201 7 
with the Transocean Spitsbergen drilling rig. As 
with our other exploration wells, the Halifax 
well was drilled in close proximity to a previous 
well which had indicated the presence of 
hydrocarbons in the basement, in this case, a 
well drilled by Arco in 1998. For this reason, its 
success was not a surprise but this does not 
reduce its significance. The well encountered 
an oil column of approximately 1,000m true 
vertical thickness (TVT) with a similar oil-down-
to (ODT) to Lancaster, indicating that the Rona 
Ridge between the Brynhild and Westray 
fault zones could be a single hydrocarbon 
We completed the required financing, took 
FID, and received FDP approval. The scale 
of this achievement cannot be overstated, 
Lancaster is the first standalone FDP approval 
in the UK sector since Culzean in 2015 and 
involved the largest ever AIM capital raise 
for an oil exploration and production (E&P) 
company. These achievements were made 
against a back-drop of volatile and low oil 
prices, and a resultant low level of investor 
interest in the E&P sector.
The Group’s loss after tax for the year was 
$7.0 million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 
million). This loss was driven by increased 
operating expenses, predominantly related 
to increased corporate activity, and write-
offs/impairments connected with our non-
core assets (the relinquished Typhoon and 
Tempest assets and the Strathmore asset). 
The loss was offset by a fair value gain on 
derivative financial instruments related to 
the Convertible Bond issued during the year 
and foreign exchange gains. The Group 
ended the year with cash, cash equivalents 
and liquid investments of $360.0 million, 
on a firm footing for the remaining costs 
expected in the run up to first oil on the EPS.

accumulation (a distance of approximately  
35km). In aggregate, 2C Contingent Resources 
across Lancaster and Halifax are in excess of 
1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent; a world-class 
prize. As we describe in the Operations Report, 
our inability to bring hydrocarbons to surface 
was a result of formation damage caused by 
drilling operations. This occurred because of a 
combination of over-pressured drilling mud and 
chemical additives in the mud. As we learn from 
the Halifax data and focus on the next phase 
of exploration, appraisal and development we 
will determine the most appropriate method of 
revisiting the Halifax well.
Fractured basements are a global 
phenomenon which have been produced 
successfully for extended periods in multiple 
locations around the world. However, in 
the UK they represent a new play type 
for a sector of the oil industry which has 
historically focused on sandstone reservoirs. 
Accordingly, Hurricane has maintained 
licence and field operatorship and ownership 
for longer, and at greater levels, than would 
be typical with more traditional reservoir 
types. We believe that this strategy has 
preserved shareholder value. As we move 
into subsequent phases of appraisal and 
development, Hurricane expects to bring 
in a partner to share in future appraisal and 
development campaigns, and the funding 
of these.
62.1 million stock tank barrels of oil in the 
event Hurricane extended the EPS duration 
to 10 years, the maximum duration of the 
Aoka Mizu contract). In addition, a further 
486.1 million stock tank barrels of oil were 
assigned as 2C Contingent Resources. 
In December 2017, we published a further 
CPR, incorporating the results of our Lincoln 
and Halifax exploration wells. This attributed 
2C Contingent Resources of 604 million 
barrels of oil equivalent to Lincoln and 1,235 
million barrels of oil equivalent to Halifax. 
The sum of our Rona Ridge 2C Contingent 
Resources is in excess of 2.5 billion barrels 
of oil equivalent. The challenge to the 
Company is clear; demonstrate that the 
reservoir information obtained during the 
EPS, and any additional appraisal drilling, 
de-risks the Company’s significant resources 
such that they are appropriately valued.

Bluewater’s delivery performance has been 
excellent to date, as has the performance of 
their selected yard, Dubai Drydocks World. We 
have long flagged the arrival of the buoy and 
mooring as being a key deliverable to allow 
TechnipFMC to complete the installation of 
the SURF and buoy and mooring installation in 
Q3 2018. Following a successful ‘dry’ trial of the 
buoy in February 2018, Bluewater is on track 
to deliver the buoy to TechnipFMC in Lerwick, 
Shetland Isles, to allow installation activities to 
commence on schedule.
Furthermore, the Xmas tree systems are 
ready for loading onto the rig for the EPS 
well completions. The Group has contracted 
Transocean’s Paul B. Loyd Jr., a harsh 
environment semi-submersible rig for this 
work. Loading of the rig, transit to field 
and commencement of well completion 
operations is expected to take place in Q2 
2018. We committed to the Xmas trees in 
December 2016, the longest of our long 
lead items; their timely delivery marks a step 
towards the start of 2018 SURF and mooring 
installation operations, allowing TechnipFMC 
to continue to work to the schedule of 
completing these operations in Q3 2018.
Much has been written on the new price and 
value discipline within the industry. Suffice 
to say that Hurricane’s view on future prices 
does not assume that things will be different 
this time. The first indications of price 
inflation are visible, for example in the harsh 
environment rig market where forecast rates 
are double that which Hurricane achieved in 
its 2016/2017 drilling campaign. As we look 
beyond the EPS, our challenge is to ensure 
that appraisal and development costs reflect 
ongoing oil price uncertainty and strive to 
deliver value throughout the cycle as either 
sellers or holders of our Rona Ridge assets. 
The low oil price environment since 2014, 
and its effect on a cyclical industry, proved 
to be a blessing which allowed us to 
complete 265 days of consecutive drilling 
operations in 2016/2017 and to progress 
the EPS with engineering ‘A teams’, at prices 
which would have been unachievable only 
a few years previously. Leasing an FPSO 
to operate West of Shetland was, until 
this recent oil price reversal, restricted 
to the majors. Hurricane has shown that, 
using appropriate contract structures, a 
sufficiently attractive project can take 
advantage of these conditions and proceed 
to development on an independent basis. 
Whilst the Halifax well was being drilled 
and logged in Q1 201 7 , the EPS project and 
commercial teams were being resourced and 
the key contracts for the EPS negotiated. At its 
core, the EPS is a straightforward development 
comprising two previously drilled and tested 
wells, tied back to an existing FPSO whose 
processing facilities require little in the way 
of changes to be able to accommodate 
Lancaster’s crude. The Company’s strategy 
was to lock-in the costs of the engineering, 
procurement, construction, installation and 
commissioning (EPCIC) phase via lump sum 
contracts with our Tier 1 contractors wherever 
possible; 75% of pre-first oil capital expenditure 
is locked-in in this way. With the installation 
phase of the EPS contract to come we are 
comfortable that the EPS is both on time 
and on budget for first oil in H1 2019. Our 
contracts with Bluewater reflects the need for 
risk sharing between the service sector and 
producers. We are delighted with the working 
relationship with them – they make money 
when we make money. There is no better 
incentive to be on time and on budget. We 
are not surprised to see this approach being 
replicated elsewhere.
The Company implemented a new long-term 
incentive scheme in November 2016, the 
VCP . This scheme incentivises management 
to monetise the Company’s reserves and 
resources against clearly defined milestones 
of financing, exploration, appraisal, 
development, production and potential sale. 
Management has delivered on a number 
of these milestones, including drilling the 
Lancaster -7 and -7Z wells, and raising funding 
for the EPS. Timely first oil and successful 
and safe operations should position the 
Company well to begin to monetise its assets, 
and management are incentivised to bring 
this about. Further details are provided in the 
Remuneration Report.
We are very aware that the environment 
West of Shetland is precious. Hurricane 
is dedicated to safe, environmentally 
responsible and sound operations. As 
CEO, I take personal responsibility for all 
environmental matters. Neil Platt, COO, takes 
the lead on all operational safety issues. We 
do not need to be financially incentivised to 
focus on these issues, however, any failures 
would have a significant negative impact on 
our annual and long-term remuneration.
Hurricane went through a step change 
in 2017; we booked our first reserves, 
increased our 2C Contingent Resources by 
450% and obtained FDP approval on the 
first phase of development of our assets. 
We also added to our team, by filling in 
gaps across the Company as we move 
rapidly towards first oil and upgrading our 
systems and procedures to reflect our size 
and stage of development. The decision 
whether to move to a Premium Listing 
and the timing of such a move has yet to 
be made. As this Annual Report reflects, 
the Board decided, following the mid-year 
capital raise, that the Company needed to 
adopt the standards required of a Premium 
Listed business. We are on our way, and 
once our Chairman and non-executive 
director recruitment has been completed, 
the Company will be Code compliant. 
From a day-to-day business point of view, 
we have spent the time since the capital 
raise updating our systems and procedures 
across the Company. We are now ready for 
the next stage in our development.
Finally, my thanks go to the Hurricane team, 
both employees and contractors. 2017 was 
another extraordinary year – everyone was 
pushed hard and I am delighted to say that 
all stepped up to the mark and delivered. 
I look forward to first oil.

Financial Statements Key Performance Indicators 
The Board monitors the Group’s performance in delivery of strategy by measuring progress against Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These 
KPIs comprise a number of operational, financial and non-financial metrics, categorised as either ‘Milestones’ or ‘Performance Measures’:
i.  Milestones are long-term development goals linked to successful delivery of the EPS and monetisation of the Group’s assets over a  
five-year period; and
ii.  Performance Measures are inter-year progress measures, ensuring continued progress towards delivery of the Company’s strategy on  
an annual basis.
Underpinning all of the KPIs is the Group’s commitment to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. 
Milestones
The purpose of Milestones is to ensure that the EPS delivers the long-term reservoir data needed to plan for further stages of development 
and allow the Company to monetise its Rona Ridge assets. They are the core assessment criteria under the Value Creation Plan, a five-year 
long-term incentive plan implemented in November 2016. As described more fully in the Remuneration Report, the Milestones determine the 
eventual awards under the Value Creation Plan at maturity of the scheme, provided a share price hurdle is met at that time, and subject to 
adjustment for Total Shareholder Return and health, safety, security, environmental and quality (HSSEQ) performance.

Performance Measures
Performance Measures are used for inter-year assessment of the Group’s performance towards implementing the strategy and to ensure 
continual assessment and accountability of the executive directors to the rest of the Board. Performance targets are separate and distinct 
from VCP Milestones, which represent longer term hurdles in delivering the Group’s strategy. The measures include health, safety and 
environmental performance. 
A scorecard is agreed amongst the executive directors and the Remuneration Committee at the start of the year and the Remuneration 
Committee then determines the degree to which the measures have been achieved after year-end. The maximum payable to executive 
directors for full achievement of Performance Measures is 50% of salary. The same cap applies to all employees.

and Long-Term Viability Statement

during the period
Substantial capital requirements
The Group’s business plan to exploit and commercialise its assets requires significant capital 
expenditure. Future plans may be curtailed if the Group is unable to generate sufficient funds 
from operational cashflow and/or raise further funds.
During the year in review, Hurricane raised a total of $547 million in two fund raises (before 
expenses) which is expected to be sufficient to reach first organic cash generation. These cash 
flows will fund some of the Group’s ongoing capital requirements, reducing the impact of risks 
associated with the availability of external capital.
The Group continually monitors its funding requirements to progress its asset portfolio. The Group actively engages 
with many providers of finance including current and potential shareholders, brokers, banks, other financial institutions 
and potential farm-in partners to understand the range of options available to the Group. The start of production from 
the Group’s EPS is also expected to generate significant positive cashflow over the coming years.
Exploration, appraisal and 
development operational risks
There are a range of operational risks during offshore operations whether for exploration, 
appraisal or development. These include, but are not limited to, failure of offshore vessels/rigs  
or other crucial equipment, unforeseen problems occurring during drilling or completion  
works, and delays to offshore operations due to unfavourable weather.
The Group invests significant time and resources to plan all of its exploration, appraisal and development operations 
and focuses on minimising the various operational risks. The Group uses a range of third party experts to co-ordinate, 
plan and deliver exploration, appraisal and development projects. Contractors are selected based on  
their demonstrable industry track record and care is taken in nominating an approved well operator to manage  
well operations. Contingency is built into all project plans to allow for unexpected delays and cost overruns.
Production operational risks
  
There are many production related operational risks. These mainly relate to, but are not limited 
to, the risk of unplanned downtime of production facilities. This may be the result of mechanical 
issues, unfavourable weather leading to delays in operations, and/or other issues.
The Group invests significant time and resources to plan all of its operations and focuses on minimising the various 
operational risks. The Group uses a range of third party service providers and experts to co-ordinate, plan and deliver 
its production operations. Contractors are selected based on their demonstrable industry track record and care is 
taken in nominating an approved installation and pipeline operator to manage the host facilities. Contingency is built 
into operational budgets to allow for unexpected delays and operating cost overruns.
Geological and reservoir risk
  
The geology of the Group’s licence areas and the behaviour of the associated reservoirs rely 
on various assumptions and interpretation techniques. There is a risk that the reservoirs do not 
behave as expected, such as earlier water production than predicted, reserves/resources being 
less than expected, or oil having different properties than expected. 
All appraisal programmes are designed to de-risk the assets in the most cost-effective manner while gaining the 
maximum understanding of the geology and reservoir as possible.
Hurricane uses data obtained from drilling and well testing to populate numeric reservoir models. The recent and 
planned updates of these models enable Hurricane to better understand the reservoirs and build predictive cases 
that address the uncertainty envelope and thereby mitigate risk in future well planning or production strategy.
Once oil production begins, production data will be closely monitored. Modifications will be made to the production 
strategy (e.g. varying flow rates) in order to maximize the overall production from the reservoir. As production data is 
gathered the reservoir models will be updated to better reflect the actual reservoir characteristics.
Regulatory
There is a risk that the Group and/or its primary contractors are in breach of their regulatory 
obligations with one of their principal regulators in connection with the Group’s activities. This 
could restrict the Group and/or its primary contractors’ capacity to obtain permits and to carry 
out the Group’s activities on the UK Continental Shelf. There is also a risk that a change in the 
regulatory environment affects the returns expected to be achieved from the Group’s assets.
As the Group transitions towards first oil, the number of regulatory obligations that apply to its 
operations has increased, thereby increasing the risk of a breach.
The Group actively monitors the regulatory environment in the UK and seeks to anticipate and impact potential 
changes through engagement with regulatory authorities, both directly and via industry groups. The Group 
maintains active engagement with its primary contractors, and with relevant stakeholders, governmental and 
regulatory authorities. The Group regularly monitors its and its primary contractors’ obligations in connection 
with Group activities and ensures that there are sufficient resources and competent personnel in place to satisfy 
such obligations.
All companies carry with them certain risks and Hurricane is no exception. The future outlook for the Group and therefore 
opportunities for growth in shareholder value should be understood in the context of the associated risks. There are a wide variety of 
risks associated with the oil and gas exploration and production industry which may impact Hurricane’s business. According to the risk, 
Hurricane may elect to take or tolerate risk, treat risk with controls and mitigating actions, transfer the risk to third parties or terminate 
risk by ceasing particular activities or operations. Listed in the following table are the principal risks facing the Group and the actions 
taken to minimise the likelihood and mitigate the impact. The directors confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

How it has changed  
during the period
Oil price fluctuations
  
Oil prices can be volatile and subject to fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in 
the supply of, and demand for, oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that 
are beyond the control of the Group such as the impact of a greater market shift to renewable 
energy sources. It is impossible to predict accurately future oil price movements. Accordingly, 
oil prices may not remain at their current levels. Declines in oil prices may adversely affect the 
cashflows generated from the EPS and may also affect market sentiment and consequently, the 
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares and the ability of the Group to raise finance.
The viability of the Group’s assets is assessed on a regular basis. Economic models of development cases are stress tested 
using varying oil price forecasts. Investments have and will only be made if development cases are robust to downside 
price sensitivity scenarios. For Hurricane’s producing assets the Group will consider the use of oil price hedging to manage 
any potential exposure.
Third party infrastructure
Any field development, including gas export, is likely to be dependent upon the availability of 
third party infrastructure. If this fails, or is not available on reasonable commercial terms, it may 
result in delays to field development, production and cash generation. This would have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business, prospects, financial condition and operations.
In planning the development scenarios for the Group’s assets, the use of third party infrastructure is assessed. 
Consideration is given to the extent, nature and commercial arrangements of potential use of third party infrastructure. 
The Group minimises the use of third party infrastructure where appropriate. Where third party infrastructure is used the 
Group seeks to align the third party with the Group’s success on the project via its commercial agreements. 
Development project delivery
  
Development projects are subject to various risks including availability of third party services and 
manufacturing slots, solvency of major contractors, correct fabrication of key components to 
specification, incident-free installation operations, installation windows, permits, consents and 
weather. Problems with any of the above can cause project delays that would impact both the 
timing for completion of the project, as well as the cost. This can have a material impact on the 
projected cashflow from the project and the funding required. Delays to target first oil or cost 
overruns in the case of the EPS could have a particularly significant impact on the Group given 
that it currently has no alternative source of revenue.
As the Group gets closer to first oil on the EPS, the importance of successful development 
delivery has increased.
The Group invests significant time and resources to plan its development projects and focuses on minimising the various 
development risks. The Group uses a range of third party service providers and experts to co-ordinate, plan and deliver 
development projects. Contingency is built into all project plans to allow for unexpected delays and cost overruns. A large 
portion of capital expenditure for the EPS was fixed under lump sum contracts which has reduced the Group’s exposure 
to cost overruns. 
Health, Safety and 
Environmental (HSE)
In performing offshore exploration, development or production activities and onshore 
fabrication activities there is a risk of harm to the workforce, to the environment (e.g. from 
fabrication processes, hydrocarbon releases and/or oil spills, damage to seabed ecosystems 
or disturbance to marine mammal populations from noise pollution), to the assets during 
construction or in use, and to the Company’s reputation as a result of some or all of the above.
The Group adopts its procedures in relation to HSE to assess, manage and control the risk faced by the workforce and 
mitigate against accidental damage to the environment and its assets and in doing so seeks to protect its reputation. 
HSE risks are minimised by the Group’s corporate processes which ensure the employment of competent individuals, the 
procurement of appropriate equipment and the selection and monitoring of operational activities. In addition, the Group 
uses external consultants and specialists to plan and prepare for various emergency scenarios, including but not limited 
to oil spills. As part of its preparedness, the Group undertakes training and exercises to assess the effectiveness of its 
procedures, processes and specialist service providers. The Group also carries various insurances.
Compliance
There is a risk of a major breach of the Group’s business or ethical conduct standards due to 
unethical behaviour or breaches of anti-corruption laws, resulting in investigations, fines, loss of 
reputation and loss of assets. 
Top-down leadership of the Group’s values supported by Group-wide corporate compliance training, including 
implementation of the Group’s anti-corruption and bribery procedures across the Group’s organisation and  
contracting arrangements.

Financial Statements
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in this Strategic Report. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows and liquidity position are described 
in the Financial Review. Further details of 
the Group’s commitments are set out in 
notes 25 and 26 of the Group Financial 
Statements. In addition, note 24 to the 
Group Financial Statements includes the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments; and its exposures  
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has no source of operating 
revenue prior to first oil from the EPS 
(currently anticipated to occur in H1 2019) 
and currently obtains working capital 
primarily through equity and debt financing. 
During the year, the Group raised gross 
funds of $547 million (before expenses), 
split between $317 million from the issue of 
ordinary shares in the Company of £0.001 
each (Ordinary Shares) and $230 million 
from the issue of Convertible Bonds. 
The directors have performed a robust 
assessment, including a review of the budget 
for the year ending December 2019 and 
longer-term strategic forecasts and plans, 
including consideration of the Principal 
Risks faced by the Company, as detailed on 
pages 18 to 21. In particular, the directors 
considered a number of scenarios which 
included the impact of a delay in first oil 
from the EPS, cost and schedule overruns 
during the installation period and, following 
first oil, downside sensitivities in relation 
to production rates, operational uptime, 
oil price, opex and foreign exchange rates. 
Following this review, the directors are 
satisfied that, taking into consideration 
reasonably foreseeable downside 
sensitivities, the Company and the Group 
have adequate resources to continue to 
operate and meet their liabilities as they 
fall due for the foreseeable future, a period 
considered to be at least twelve months 
from the date of signing these Financial 
Statements. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the Going Concern Basis for 
preparing the Financial Statements.
Principal Risks, Going Concern  
and Long-Term Viability Statement continued
Long-term viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2. of the Code, the Board confirms that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for the three-year period ended 31 December 2020 (the Lookout Period).
The  Lookout Period: 
The directors have determined that the 
appropriate period to assess the long-term 
viability of the business is three years. 
This period incorporates the engineering, 
procurement, construction, installation and 
commissioning of the EPS and between 
approximately 18 months and two 
subsequent years of production. At the 
end of the second year of production the 
Company has to elect whether to extend its 
contract on the Aoka Mizu; a decision which 
will be informed by the first two years of 
production. During the three-year period over 
which the directors have reviewed the long-
term viability of the business there are two 
distinct phases.
•  Phase 1 includes the period to first oil. 
The risks and analysis for this period are 
included within the going concern analysis 
outlined above. 
•  Phase 2 is a period of two years of 
production until the directors must 
decide whether to extend the contract 
on the Aoka Mizu. During this phase the 
Company will also seek to undertake 
further development, exploration and 
appraisal activity from its own cash-flow 
and, potentially, from farminees across its 
Rona Ridge licences.
• During Phase 1, the directors principally 
reviewed the development project 
delivery risk for the EPS.
•  During Phase 2, the directors reviewed 
each of the principal risks related to 
the EPS, with particular reference to 
geological and reservoir risk, production 
operational performance risk and oil price 
fluctuations risk.
 A n a l y s i s P e r fo r m e d: 
Whilst each of the risks outlined on 
pages 18 to 21 has a potential impact 
on the business, in Phase 2 the directors 
focussed on geological and reservoir risk, 
production operational performance risks, 
and the impact of oil price on the business, 
by running sensitivities including lower 
production rates and different oil price 
scenarios. The risks have been assessed 
for their potential impact on the Group’s 
business model, future trading and funding 
structure. The range of downside scenarios 
tested was carefully considered by the 
directors, factoring in the potential impact, 
probability of occurrence and effectiveness 
of the mitigating actions, where appropriate. 
A combined sensitivity containing an 
aggregation of all scenarios considered was 
performed and, whilst considered unlikely 
to occur, it demonstrated the Group’s 
ability to take mitigating actions, within 
management’s control, to maintain liquidity.
•  The review was conducted with 
sensitivities including a scenario delivering 
production in line with the 1P production 
case in the Lancaster CPR.
• The review assumed that further 
development, exploration and appraisal 
activity would only be undertaken 
if fully-funded and therefore such 
incremental activity was not included 
in either scenario planning or sensitivity 
analysis. The Group’s ability to develop its 
assets beyond the EPS is dependent on 
performance of the EPS being sufficient 
to provide cash flow that is surplus to the 
Group’s other requirements, or on future 
fundraising activity.
 
Risks explicitly considered 
in the LTV analysis are 
highlighted on the Principal 
Risks table on pages 18 to 21.

Overview

The Lincoln well was completed at the end 
of 2016, with results being analysed as the 
rig relocated to Halifax to drill the fourth and 
final well in a campaign that lasted 265 days. 
In parallel, the development and operations 
teams were focused on delivering the EPS. 
Transitioning this project from a planning and 
contracting phase, to project execution is a 
landmark achievement for Hurricane. At the 
same time, the Company’s organisation was 
supplemented by a number of new positions 
as we move from being an exploration 
and appraisal (E&A) company to being an 
exploration and production (E&P) company.
The achievements below represent some 
of the highlights for the year. Of particular 
importance from Hurricane’s perspective, 
is that these were achieved with no major 
HSE incidents, despite expending more 
than half a million man-hours between 
Hurricane and its primary contractors both 
on and offshore.
Review of Operations 
The year in review commenced with 
both offshore drilling operations, West of 
Shetland, and front-end engineering and 
design (FEED) studies for the EPS ongoing.
Subsurface
Lincoln well
Hurricane’s exploration model was that 
Lincoln represented a similar reservoir 
to Lancaster and would contain a 
hydrocarbon column height of at least 
455m, based on the ODT from offset well 
data. To evaluate Lincoln’s potential, an 
exploration well was planned to drill to 
a depth of 2,135m true vertical depth 
subsea (TVDSS) and detect the presence 
of hydrocarbons through a detailed 
mudlogging and wireline programme. 
The well was drilled to the target depth of 
2,135m TVDSS. On evaluating the available 
data, it was concluded that the wellbore 
had not encountered a water leg and so 
the well was deepened to 2,325m TVDSS. 
Drilling was terminated before an oil 
water contact had been identified due to 
time constraints and the requirement to 
undertake Halifax operations.
A hydrocarbon column has been detected 
in the range of 2,109 to 2,325m TVDSS, 
indicating a minimum hydrocarbon column 
height of between 444m and 660m TVT. 
The depth of the penetrated hydrocarbon 
column is indicative that Lancaster and 
Lincoln are not in pressure communication 
and therefore the two assets exist as 
separate hydrocarbon accumulations.
Analysis of gas isotope data indicated that 
the encountered hydrocarbon is sourced 
from the same ‘kitchen’ area as Lancaster 
and is therefore most likely to be a light 
oil of a similar API gravity to Lancaster. 
“ Transitioning this project 
from a planning and 
contracting phase to 
project execution is a 
landmark achievement”
– Neil Platt
This interpretation is corroborated by gas 
chromatography, wireline and core data, 
all of which indicate that the encountered 
hydrocarbon is a light oil.
Lincoln has the potential to be similar to 
Lancaster in productivity. The first step in 
realising this potential is for an appraisal well 
to be drilled to confirm hydrocarbon type 
and the ability for the reservoir to deliver a 
flow rate commensurate with commercial 
productivity. Depending on distance from the 
FPSO, an appraisal well has the potential to be 
tied back to the EPS infrastructure.
Halifax well 
Hurricane’s exploration model was that 
Halifax and Lancaster form part of the 
same accumulation, the Greater Lancaster 
Area (GLA) and that the Halifax well would 
encounter a hydrocarbon column with 
a height of at least 980m TVT (based on 
the Lancaster maximum ODT). To evaluate 
the Halifax potential, an exploration well 
was planned to drill to a depth of 1,800m 
TVDSS and the presence of hydrocarbons 
detected by drill stem testing and a detailed 
mudlogging and wireline programme. The 
specific objectives of the well were to: 
i.  Demonstrate the presence of mobile oil 
and an oil water contact below structural 
closure as mapped
ii. Bring an oil sample to surface
The reservoir section was drilled to  
1,801m TVDSS and then tested, after which 
additional drilling deepened the well to 
2,004m TVDSS. The well was a discovery, 
encountering a hydrocarbon column of 
approximately 1 kilometre TVT. Testing was 
unable to acquire a representative reservoir 
fluid sample to surface and consequently 
the oil type cannot be verified. Despite the 
challenges in testing the formation, the 
analysis of gas chromatography, wireline and 
core data indicated that the encountered 
hydrocarbon is most likely a light oil. 
The inability to flow the well during testing 
was due to near-wellbore formation damage 
caused by the use of over-weighted drilling 
mud and chemical additives in the drilling 
brine during well operations. The near-
wellbore formation damage was further 
compounded by a bullheading operation 
(forcibly pumping fluids into the well bore) 
applied during testing in an attempt to clean 
up the formation. In fact, the bullheading 
forced drill cutting material (a combination 
of rock cuttings, rock flour, and chemically 
enhanced drilling brine) further into the 
formation, thus drastically reducing near-
wellbore permeability. 
The well has been suspended and therefore 
has the potential to be re-entered for the 
purpose of further drill stem testing and/or 
deepening. A decision to re-enter the well will 
be based on ongoing technical work and the 
Group’s Rona Ridge asset appraisal strategy.
The Halifax discovery has the potential to be 
similar to Lancaster in productivity potential. 
The first step in realising this potential is for 
an appraisal well to be drilled to confirm 
hydrocarbon type and the ability for the 
reservoir to deliver a flow rate commensurate 
with commercial productivity. Further 
appraisal work will also be required to test 
the Company’s exploration model that 
Halifax and Lancaster are part of a single 
hydrocarbon accumulation.
Lancaster CPR findings
A CPR was issued for Lancaster in 2017 as an 
update to the previous CPR released in 2013. 
The 2017 CPR supports the Company’s view 
of an extensive oil column on Lancaster and 
the basement reservoir being productive. 
The range of oil water contacts has 
narrowed on Lancaster since 2013 as a result 
of the 2016 Lancaster drilling campaign. 
The previous 2C depth of 1,597m TVDSS 
has become the new 1C depth, and the 3C 
contact is now 103m shallower compared to 
2013 at 1,678m TVDSS. 
RPS assigns 2P Reserves of 37.3 million 
stock tank barrels of oil attributed to the 
initial six-year period of the planned EPS. 
An additional 486 million stock tank barrels 
of 2C Contingent Resources are based on a 
recovery factor of 22.5%. Combined, this is 
an increase of 162% compared to the 2013 
estimate of 200 million stock tank barrels 
of oil. Should Hurricane extend the EPS to 
10 years, 2P Reserves volume would rise to 
62.1 million barrels. The expectation is that 
within the six-year base case duration of 
the EPS, full field planning and development 
will be undertaken. However, should it be 
commercially attractive, the Company has 
the ability to extend the contract duration 
with Bluewater for the Aoka Mizu for a 
further four years.

Halifax CPR findings
A second CPR was issued by RPS in 2017 
covering the Halifax and Lincoln discoveries, 
as well as including the Whirlwind and 
Strathmore discoveries as reported in 2013. 
RPS has agreed with Hurricane’s view that 
Halifax has comparable reservoir properties 
to Lancaster. RPS states that the drill 
stem test carried out on the Halifax well 
was compromised by induced formation 
damage, as discussed above, rather than 
limited flow being a function of reservoir 
quality. RPS is supportive of the observation 
that no data so far acquired indicates that 
there are any significant differences in oil 
type between Lancaster and Halifax. Halifax 
water properties are also comparable to 
Lancaster, indicating the potential for a 
common aquifer. RPS also recognise that 
the difference in oil water contact depths 
between Lancaster and Halifax does not 
preclude them from being part of the 
same structure. However, as an alternative 
model to a single accumulation at Lancaster 
and Halifax, a major fault that bisects 
the Rona Ridge to the east of Lancaster 
and southwest of Halifax could act as a 
boundary between the two accumulations. 
Halifax has been assigned 2C Contingent 
Resources of 1,235 million barrels of oil 
equivalent. 
Lincoln CPR findings
As with Halifax, RPS is supportive of 
Hurricane’s interpretation of basement 
reservoir properties at Lincoln being 
comparable with Lancaster. Oil properties 
are also recognised as being likely to be the 
same as Lancaster. Due to the presence 
of deep oil on the Lincoln structure, RPS 
recognises that a seal must exist between 
Lancaster and Lincoln and agree that 
Hurricane’s interpretation that the Brynhild 
Fault Zone is the most likely candidate for the 
seal is robust. Although RPS believes there 
is the potential for Warwick and Lincoln to 
be part of the same accumulation, it has 
conservatively assigned them as two separate 
accumulations constrained by regional 
faulting. A successful exploration well on 
Warwick followed up by appraisal drilling will 
ultimately be required to determine if Lincoln 
and Warwick are connected. 
Lincoln has been assigned 2C Contingent 
Resources of 604 mmboe, and Warwick 
has been assigned Prospective Resources 
of 935 mmboe. 
Project Development 
FEED and long lead items
During 2017, the Group completed Front 
End Engineering and Design (FEED) work 
in relation to the key elements of the EPS 
development. This included FEED work in 
relation to:
a)  upgrade and life extension of the  
Aoka Mizu FPSO, and fabrication of  
a new turret mooring system buoy,  
with Bluewater;
b)  SURF, and Subsea Production System 
(SPS) with TechnipFMC; and
c)  well completions with Petrofac Facilities 
Management Limited (PFML). 
The results of these studies allowed detailed 
budgeting to take place, which informed 
our mid-year capital raise and formed the 
basis for the Board to be able to take FID in 
mid-2017.
To maintain the target first oil date of 
H1 2019, whilst taking advantage of the 
market conditions at the time, Hurricane 
had identified and placed orders for certain 
schedule-critical long lead items using the 
results of initial FEED work in 2016. During 
2017 , in parallel with ongoing FEED studies, 
the Group continued to place orders, carry 
out surveys and make milestone payments 
on these pre-sanction items. In particular, we 
placed orders for the TechnipFMC Xmas trees 
and subsea control modules in late 2016. This 
enabled both Xmas trees and their respective 
control modules to be delivered ex-works in 
time for the commencement of the planned 
completion campaign in Q2 2018. 
Contracting
The Group had chosen three Tier 1 
contractors for the EPS, with each having 
primary responsibility for a specific key area 
of operations. 
Bluewater is responsible for provision of 
the project’s FPSO upgrade scope of work 
and associated turret mooring system 
under an engineering, procurement and 
construction (EPC) Contract. Under the 
agreement, Bluewater Energy Services is 
contracted to fabricate and deliver a new 
mooring system and buoy and the upgrade, 
hook up and testing of the FPSO. Following 
first oil, the Bluewater group entities will be 
responsible for the operation, maintenance 
and decommissioning of the FPSO, and 
the operation and maintenance of the 
subsea pipeline, pursuant to the terms of a 
Production Operating Services Agreement 
(POSA). A Bluewater group entity, Bluewater 
Lancaster Production (U.K.) Limited, has also 
been approved as installation operator and 
pipeline operator.
In another example of innovative 
contracting, Bluewater is incentivised to 
reach first oil and deliver stable production 
through an incentive tariff. This is based 
on a percentage of the sale price of each 
barrel of oil, after deducting certain 
costs and is higher for the first two years 
(in exchange for a reduced day rate), 
encouraging prompt commissioning.
In addition to external contracting, 
Hurricane has also expanded its internal 
organisation structure to suit its role 
as licence operator and expanded the 
operations team to satisfy the roles 
required by the EPS development. These 
enhancements have been made in a 
targeted manner, to avoid potential 
inefficiency from overlapping with our Tier 
1 contractors, whilst also enabling Hurricane 
to effectively coordinate the development.
Regulatory approval
The Group’s regulatory approvals passed 
a critical juncture with the approval 
of the Group’s FDP in September 2017. 
This was the culmination of a period of 
extensive engagement both directly with 
regulators and with other stakeholders, 
including via a public consultation on the 
Environmental Statement.
Review of Operations continued
The FDP approval for the EPS was the first 
approval for a standalone development 
in the UKCS since Culzean in 2015. It is 
also the first ever approval of a basement 
development in the UK. The ability of the 
project to reach sanction whilst so few 
other developments are doing so illustrates 
the attractiveness of the Lancaster field 
and of fractured basement on the Rona 
Ridge as a whole. 
We would like to extend our thanks to the 
Oil and Gas Authority, the Department 
for Business, Energy, Industrial Strategy, 
and the Health and Safety Executive and 
all other consultees for their support in 
Hurricane progressing to this stage. 
Development progress
Hurricane’s progress towards first oil on 
the EPS is unmistakeably evident at Dubai 
Drydocks World, the yard selected by 
Bluewater for the upgrade and life extension 
of the Aoka Mizu and the fabrication of 
the buoy for the turret mooring system. 
The Aoka Mizu FPSO arrived at the facility 
on 30 September 2017 and has already 
undergone its two planned drydock phases 
and a significant portion of additional work. 
The buoy has been fabricated in parallel and 
following the success of trial fit operations 
in February, is expected to depart Dubai for 
Lerwick on the Shetland Isles in order to 
arrive by the end of H1 2018.
Hurricane has permanent representatives 
onsite in Dubai and has been pleased with 
the standard of safety and operations at the 
facility. Together with Bluewater, Hurricane 
has operated an HSSEQ incentive programme 
and is pleased with the number of awards and 
overall HSSEQ performance to date. Further 
details on this programme are outlined in the 
Sustainability Report section on pages 31 to 
33. The vessel remains on track for sail away 
to the field by the end of Q3 2018.
Progress towards subsea installation by 
TechnipFMC and its subcontractors has 
also been substantial. The second of the 
two horizontal Xmas trees and associated 
structures were delivered ex-works in March 
2018 and fabrication of the umbilical, risers 
and flowlines remains on schedule. Following 
a programme of boulder relocation during 
2017, ahead of schedule, everything remains 
on track for summer 2018 installation.
Hurricane has shown that it has an effective 
working relationship with Petrofac Facilities 
Management Limited and Transocean on 
previous drilling campaigns, and is looking 
forward to using the Paul B. Loyd Jr. rig for 
well completions later this year.
Future operations
In parallel with the focus on delivering 
first oil from the EPS, Hurricane’s well 
operations teams continue to work closely 
with Hurricane’s subsurface team to study 
future well opportunities, whilst the facilities 
engineering team are engaged in looking 
at future gas export and tie-back options, 
FPSO debottlenecking opportunities and 
performance improvements from the 
existing EPS design. 
Neil Platt
Chief Operations Officer
“ We chose our Tier 1 
contractors on the basis 
of demonstrable industry 
reputation, technical 
expertise, health safety 
and environmental track 
record, and supportive 
contractual structures”
“ Hu r r ic a n e b e l iev e s  
that its approach to 
contracting has helped 
to reduce schedule and 
budget risk to the project, 
thereby maximising 
chance of success”
TechnipFMC is responsible for the 
fabrication, installation, testing and 
commissioning of the subsea equipment, 
including the SURF and SPS under the terms 
of the TechnipFMC Integrated engineering, 
procurement, construction and installation 
(EPCI) Contract and the installation of the 
mooring system and buoy.
Responsibility for Hurricane’s well integrity, 
future drilling activities and EPS well 
completions and a number of well control 
packages, including variable speed drives, 
subsea control modules lies with PFML. The 
Group has a longstanding relationship with 
PFML, which in this role has been nominated 
as Hurricane’s well operator and well 
management services provider in relation to 
the EPS, as well as our broader appraisal and 
exploration programme.
Hurricane believes that its approach to 
contracting has helped to reduce schedule 
and budget risk to the project, thereby 
maximising chance of success. The Group 
focussed on a small number of highly 
competent contractors, reducing interfaces 
and giving each a meaningful stake in 
the project. In the case of Bluewater and 
TechnipFMC, large lump sum components 
were included, thereby passing back a large 
portion of the cost risk and meaning that 
Hurricane’s contingency within the budget 
is applicable to only the remaining costs, 
which represent less than 25% of the total.

Overview
Strategic Report
Governance
Financial Statements
In 2017, Hurricane transitioned from 
being a pure exploration and appraisal 
company to one that is undertaking a 
significant development project and fast 
approaching first oil. 
Therefore, the Group purchased the required 
USD at the time of the July capital raise in 
order to match our currency exposures and 
thereby mitigate the foreign currency risk on 
the project.
The Group’s loss after tax for the year 
was $7.0 million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 
million). This loss was driven by increased 
operating expenses, predominantly related to 
increased corporate activity, and write-offs/
impairments connected with our non-core 
assets. These charges were partially offset 
by a fair value gain on derivative financial 
instruments related to the Convertible Bond 
and foreign exchange gains.
At the beginning of 2017 , the functional 
currency for each entity and the presentation 
currency for the Group as a whole was 
reviewed. Due to the increase in the 
Group’s level of expenditure in USD and the 
upcoming start of production on the EPS, 
the revenues for which will be denominated 
in USD, the functional currency of many of 
the entities within the Group was changed 
to be USD. The presentation currency for 
the consolidated accounts has also been 
changed to USD which will also improve the 
ability to compare the Group’s financial results 
with other companies within the oil and gas 
industry. This has led to a restatement of prior 
period comparatives and a $(92.7) million 
foreign exchange reserve being recognised 
within equity on the Balance Sheet. 
Our principal financial goals are to manage the 
existing funds held by the Group to deliver 
the EPS on schedule and on budget. This will 
bring us to the point where the EPS begins to 
generate free cash which can be directed to 
deliver the Group’s long-term strategy.
Financial Review
– Alistair Stobie
Having raised the required funding and taken 
FID on the EPS, the Group is now looking 
forward to organic cash generation. 
The first half of the year was focussed on 
positioning the Group to be able to take FID. 
To this end the Group raised a total of $547 
million in two fund raises (before expenses). 
The first of which, occurring in May 2017, 
raised $17 million enabling the Group to 
maintain the existing schedule for the EPS 
and continue to drive towards FID. The more 
significant raise, in July 2017, raised a total 
of $530 million, split between $300 million 
of equity and $230 million of convertible 
bonds. This was one of the key requirements 
allowing the Group to take FID in the 
second half of the year. The raise was an 
outstanding achievement for a company of 
Hurricane’s size, particularly in the prevailing 
oil price environment.
As the Group worked through the EPS 
contracting strategy in 2017, we were able 
to agree lump sum prices for the majority 
of the capital expenditure. Over 75% of the 
total EPS capital costs are fixed, with the risk 
of overruns lying with the contractor. This 
has enabled Hurricane to manage the risk 
of cost overruns, limiting it mainly to the 
subsea and mooring installation phase of the 
project. The project remains on budget and 
on schedule with first oil, and the related 
cash inflows, expected in H1 2019.
Throughout the year, and into early 2018, 
the foreign exchange rate between the 
Pound Sterling (GBP) and the US Dollar 
(USD) has fluctuated significantly. The 
contracting strategy adopted for the EPS 
has allowed us to reliably forecast the 
project expenditure in both GBP and USD. 
“ We were able to  
agree lump sum prices  
for the majority of our 
capital expenditure”
Use of funds
In 2017 the Group’s primary use of 
funds were:
i.  Halifax exploration well, $30.9 million – 
drilled in Q1, discovering oil in the  
Halifax prospect;
ii.  Development expenditure on the EPS, 
$234.8 million – this includes the pre-  
and post-FID expenditure incurred in  
the year;
iii.  Operating cash outflow, $8.1 million 
(2016: $5.6 million) – this increase on the 
prior year reflects the increase in the level 
of activity through the year, including the 
preparation for the fund raising and the 
additional work undertaken as the Group 
evolves into a larger entity; and 
iv.  Convertible Bond coupon payments,  
$4.3 million.
Income Statement
The Group’s loss after tax for the year is $7.0 
million (2016: profit after tax $0.9 million). 
The loss for the year was partly driven by 
increased operating expenses, but also 
impacted by foreign exchange gains of $8.0 
million due to the strengthening of Sterling 
against the US Dollar, a fair value gain on 
derivative financial instruments related to 
the Convertible Bond and the write-off of 
the relinquished Typhoon and Tempest 
exploration and evaluation assets and the  
full impairment of the Strathmore asset.
The increase in other operating expenses 
from $8.9 million in 2016 to $14.6 million in 
201 7 reflects the increased level of corporate 
activity in the year and the work done in 
preparation for the fund raising. Whilst the 
average headcount has increased from 15 to 
21 since the prior year, the overall cash staff 
cost (excluding share based payment expense) 
is largely unchanged (201 7: $5.2 million, 2016 
$5.6 million, both before amounts capitalised).
The accounting for the Convertible Bond 
(issued in July 2017) required the recognition 
of an embedded derivative related to the 
deemed equity conversion option. The 
fair value of this embedded derivative was 
calculated on the date of issue of the bonds 
and at the 31 December 2017. The movement 
of $10.4 million in this fair value has been 
recognised as a gain in the Income Statement 
in the year. Transaction costs relating to the 
Convertible Bond have been apportioned 
between the host debt contract and the 
embedded derivative. Those transactions 
costs apportioned to the embedded 
derivative have been recognised in the 
Income Statement ($1.2 million). Interest 
costs of $10.4 million for the Convertible 
Bond during the year have been capitalised.
In December 2017 , the Group took the 
decision to relinquish the Typhoon and 
Tempest licences to focus both time and 
funds on its Rona Ridge assets. As a direct 
consequence the related capitalised assets 
(within intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets) have been written off. In addition to 
this, the Group has also fully impaired the 
carrying value of its Strathmore asset as there 
are no plans to undertake any significant 
activity on this prospect in the near future. 
The $10.4 million write off / impairment is not 
a cash cost in the year but is included as an 
expense in the Income Statement.
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, 
it has accumulated significant tax losses 
since incorporation. Upon receipt of 
FDP approval in September 2017 , for tax 
purposes, the Group is considered to have 
commenced trading. This has crystallised 
the pre-trading revenue expenses of $21.6 
million (2016: $23.9 million), covering the 
period from 2011 onwards, and pre-trading 
capital expenditure of $191.1 million (2016: 
$257.1 million) which was available for tax 
relief on commencement of trade for UK 
tax purposes. Additional pre-trading capital 
expenditure of $83.5 million is carried forward 
at 31 December 2017 and tax relief will be 
available once the FDP approval is received on 
the remaining licences. The Group has trading 
losses of $393.6 million at 31 December 2017 , 
which would be available for offset against 
future trading profits. A potential Ring Fence 
Expenditure Supplement claim could also be 
made which would result in additional trading 
losses of $65.0 million.

No asset has been recognised in the 
Financial Statements for a potential deferred 
tax asset, at the UK ring-fence tax rate of 
40%, of $16.1 million (2016: $12.4 million) 
resulting from the effect of carried forward 
trading losses, after offsetting $141.2 million 
(2016: $11.2 million) against a deferred tax 
liability. The directors have concluded it 
is not appropriate to recognise any of the 
potential deferred tax asset until the EPS has 
begun production and hence demonstrated 
an ability to generate taxable profits. The 
directors have concluded it not appropriate 
to recognise any of the potential deferred

production and hence demonstrated an 
ability to generate taxable profits.
Exploration and evaluation assets  
and property, plant and equipment
In September 2017 the Group obtained FDP 
approval from the Oil and Gas Authority 
and as such reclassified $335.9 million, being 
all intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets that related to the Lancaster Field, to 
property, plant and equipment. Following 
this reclassification, a further $109.4 
million was included in property, plant and 
equipment relating to the EPS.
In total, additional expenditure of $169.1 
million was included in intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets in the year relating to 
the drilling of the Halifax well and pre-FDP 
expenditure on the EPS. Taking into account 
the reclassification of Lancaster assets to 
property, plant and equipment and the 
write off / impairment of Typhoon/Tempest 
and Strathmore has resulted in an overall 
decrease in the Group’s intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets of $176.1 million.
Our approach to sustainability
Our work in sustainability is integral to 
successful execution of our business 
strategy and is underpinned by  
our commitment to work in accordance  
with the Hurricane values.
Our Values are:
• Straightforward – we keep it simple
• Ingenious – we see what others miss
• Tenacious – we never give up
• Collaborative – the whole is greater than 
the sum of parts
• Logical – it all adds up
As an oil and gas company, our most 
important issues are long-term and we 
consider these on an annual basis, at a 
minimum. We recognise the importance 
of health and safety, environmental 
stewardship, our employees, ethical 
conduct, stakeholder relations and leaving 
a positive legacy in the communities where 
we operate. Our daily operations prioritise 
protecting the environment and health  
and safety.
Working effectively with others is essential 
to us. Our main stakeholders include: 
investors; governments; employees; 
contractors; suppliers and regulators. We 
aim to work in a transparent and accessible 
way and tailor our engagement processes 
to suit each group. Feedback and open 
dialogue allows us to consider a wide 
perspective of views, which inform our 
work on our sustainability issues.
Cash and debt
The Group finished the year with a closing 
cash position of $326.6 million in usable funds 
(including cash and cash equivalents and liquid 
investments, but excluding cash held in escrow 
accounts). The mid-year capital raise included 
the issue of $230 million in convertible bonds 
with a coupon of 7 .5% per annum. Under the 
terms of the Convertible Bond, the first two 
years of coupon payments have been placed 
in escrow, of which $4.3 million was paid out 
by the year-end. The maturity date of the 
Convertible Bond is July 2022, although bond 
holders have the option to convert the bonds 
to Ordinary Shares before that time. The 
initial conversion price on the bonds was set 
at $0.52, representing a 25% premium to the 
share price fixed at the time of issue (being 
£0.32 converted into USD at a rate of $1.30).
The Convertible Bond is recorded on the 
Balance Sheet, and is split between the host 
debt contract and the embedded derivative 
related to the equity conversion option. At 
the Balance Sheet date the fair value of the 
embedded derivative was $28.6 million and 
the carrying value of the host debt contract at 
amortised cost was $191. 1 million. The Group 
recognised a $10.4 million gain on derivative 
financial instruments from the Convertible 
Bond’s issue to the Balance Sheet date.
Cash flow
Net cash outflow from operating activities of 
$8. 1 million is an increase from $5.6 million in 
2016, largely due to the increase in the level 
of activity through the year. This included 
the preparation for the fund raising and the 
additional work undertaken as the Group 
evolves into a larger entity. The combined 
expenditure on intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets and property, plant and 
Oversight and accountability  
at Hurricane
The Board has significant experience in the 
sustainability issues that face the oil industry 
and our business in particular. Our board 
members bring with them high standards and 
clear vision across sustainability related areas. 
The directors take a close interest in the 
management of issues across the cycle, from 
impact assessments and feasibility studies 
through early stage drilling campaigns, to final 
stages of project development. 
The Board assesses and monitors 
sustainability related risks within its 
oversight of principal risks. Ethical 
conduct and anti-fraud practices are also 
monitored in this forum, in accordance 
with the whistleblowing policy and other 
business standards. The Health and Safety 
Environmental Management (HSEM) 
Committee is responsible for recommending 
polices on health and safety, and 
environmental issues to the Board, chaired 
by the Chief Executive Officer. The Technical 
Advisory Committee is chaired by a non-
executive director. The committee has no 
formal decision-making powers but makes 
recommendations and provides assistance 
to the Board with respect to technical and 
operating matters.
Working in partnership
Engagement and collaboration with others 
is essential to how we work to identify 
and reduce the impacts of our activities. 
Our employees are selected, trained and 
developed to carry out their duties safely, 
competently and with due care. We provide 
a clear feedback structure, establish 
appropriate operating practices and 
implement training programmes to ensure 
effective delivery on our policies.
Suppliers and contractors, relevant third 
parties and other companies are also aware 
of our policies, standards and commitment 
to good practices. We continually work with 
them, sharing best practice and seeking out 
synergies to improve performance. 
Sharing ideas is important to us. Hurricane 
is a member of many international, national 
and industry associations and groups. Our 
work in collaboration with others gives us a 
wide perspective and the opportunity to be 
both a contributor and learner in addressing 
sustainability challenges. Finding workable 
solutions both for our business, and the oil 
industry as a whole, is important to us. 
Ethical conduct
Our commitment to acting with integrity, 
fairness and transparency is the cornerstone 
to the way we do business. Our anti-
corruption and bribery policy and our work 
to impart our values and standards on all 
who work with us is testimony to that. 
We believe this approach is essential for 
delivering our business strategy.
Bribery and corruption risk is considered in 
our overall approach to risk management at 
Hurricane. We have policies and procedures 
in place to manage ethical conduct risks. We 
also work on the detection and prevention 
of fraud and monitor and report any findings. 
Our framework covers our work with third 
parties as well as our own workforce. Ethical 
conduct standards give guidance in many 
areas including the procurement of goods 
and services and everyday production and 
operational activities.
Financial Review continued Sustainability Report 
equipment in the year of $265.7 million (2016: 
$63.5 million) was primarily the expenditure on 
the EPS and the Halifax well.
The net cash provided by financing activities 
was $524.4 million. This was from the capital 
raises in May and July and the Convertible 
Bond issue in July. This was partly offset by 
the first quarterly coupon payment on the 
Convertible Bond of $4.3 million.
The net increase in cash, cash equivalents, 
and liquid investments in the year was $258.5 
million (including the effects of foreign 
exchange rate changes).
Going concern and long-term 
viability
The directors have considered both 
the going concern of the Group and its 
long-term viability (LTV). Based on their 
assessment (see details of going concern 
and the LTV on page 23), the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group will 
be able to continue and meet its liabilities as 
they fall due for the periods shown.

Oversight and accountability 
framework 
The Health, Safety and Environmental 
Management (HSEM) Committee, reporting 
to the Board, is responsible for formulating 
and recommending polices on health, safety 
and environmental issues to the Board. The 
constituents of this committee are the Chief 
Executive Officer (committee Chairman), the 
Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operations 
Officer and the Group HSSEQ Manager. The 
HSEM Committee ensures that an effective 
system of standards, policies, procedures 
and practices are in place. In addition, the 
committee evaluates the effectiveness of the 
Group’s policies and meets formally at least 
twice a year. The committee engages external 
and internal specialists with the appropriate 
technical expertise to advise on new 
situations as they occur. It is also responsible 
for reviewing management’s investigation 
of incidents and accidents on behalf of the 
Board. Health, safety and environmental 
performance across the business is measured 
against a range of internal targets which are 
continually monitored and revised. The Chief 
Executive Officer is responsible for ensuring 
that continual improvement to the Company’s 
health, safety and environmental performance 
is always sought.
Stewardship of resources
In managing our use of resources, we are 
always looking for opportunities to be more 
efficient. We aim to minimise resource 
usage, as well as aiming to reduce the 
volume and hazardous nature of any waste. 
Ethical conduct continued
Hurricane provides training on the 
management of ethical conduct risks and 
encourages everyone to be alert to the 
nature of fraud, bribery and corruption 
and the situations in which they can arise. 
Training is mandatory for all employees and 
independent contractors.
We operate a whistleblowing policy which 
encourages all employees and contractors 
to report any situation where they have 
reasonable belief that there has been a 
breach, or potential breach, in Hurricane’s 
policies or standards.
Hurricane respects human rights, 
information management, local values  
and the rights of our local communities.
Our people
Our people are the heart of Hurricane, 
without whom we would not have been 
able to achieve anything. We aim to attract 
the best people and Hurricane employs and 
engages people who are competent, have the 
skills, experience and attitude necessary to 
fulfil the responsibilities associated with their 
position and capacity to grow as individuals.
We aim to create an inclusive culture where 
employees of any background can be 
themselves and fulfil their potential. It is our 
policy to ensure there is no discrimination 
in employment, including in relation to 
gender, race, age, disability, marital status, 
sexual orientation or religious belief. As at 
31 December 2017 , throughout the Group, 
women represented 48% of our workforce.  
We do not currently have any female directors.
Learning and self-development are 
encouraged at Hurricane. We invest in our 
people’s progression so that together we  
can build a strong and effective business 
able to deliver for our stakeholders. We 
prioritise employee engagement. We 
want Hurricane to be a rewarding place to 
work where employees feel included and 
supported. We provide opportunities both 
formally and informally for people to share 
their views with senior management.
Biodiversity
Recognising that Hurricane’s assets are 
located offshore West of Shetland, a 
recognised environmentally sensitive area, 
which is designated a ‘Special Protection 
Area’. We aim to reduce disturbance to 
sensitive seabed communities and limit 
any adverse effects of our operations to 
protected biological communities, such as 
cetaceans (whales and dolphins), as far as 
reasonably practicable. 
Hurricane participates in the SERPENT 
(Scientific and Environmental ROV Partnership) 
project along with other oil industry 
participants and the National Oceanography 
Centre in Southampton. This aims to gain an 
industry wide understanding of the effects of 
drilling on seabed communities, using existing 
industrial technology, observations of the 
seabed, and the recording of the associated 
biological communities. SERPENT gathers 
imagery of the seabed environment and 
monitors any disturbance to local habitats. 
See the website for more information  
www.serpentproject.com.
As part of our preparedness for major hazard 
situations, Hurricane is involved in ongoing oil 
spill prevention and response programmes in 
conjunction with external parties. In response 
to the impact of any uncontrolled oil spills, 
we are one of the core participants in the 
ownership of, the Oil Spill Prevention and 
Response Advisory Group (OSPRAG) capping 
device, an emergency system designed  
for rapid deployment and deep water.  
See the website for more information  
www.oilspillresponse.com.
Health and safety
At Hurricane, our approach to health and 
safety is based on leadership and culture, 
risk management, capacity and capability 
building, training and learning. We encourage 
open and honest dialogue and work to foster 
a safe and healthy working environment 
for the people and communities within the 
areas in which we work. We safeguard our 
activities to ensure that we never knowingly 
compromise our health and safety obligations 
and recognised standards in pursuit of 
improving our business results.
In our approach, we consider:
• the occupational health and safety of our 
workforce and our local communities; and
• the safety and integrity of our asset base.
Leadership, culture and people
At Hurricane, we are committed to building 
a solid safety culture from the grassroots 
level. We believe leadership is fundamental 
to good safety performance. 
Hurricane encourages a workplace where:
• we plan and prepare for the unexpected;
• we work on a “lessons learned” basis, 
investigating events where our safeguards 
may have failed; and
• we will stop work rather than conduct 
activities that are in conflict with our 
policy and business standards.
Our focus is on making accountabilities and 
responsibilities clear so that everyone can 
contribute positively to the safety culture 
we are building at Hurricane.
Health and safety management
Our approach is to promote a healthy 
environment and prevent injury and ill 
health. Health and safety risks are assessed 
and managed through the health and safety 
framework which is based on a continual 
cycle of improvement. Risks are monitored 
through a hierarchy of control where safety 
performance is reviewed in accordance with 
the Incident Reporting Procedure. 
Policies
Hurricane’s comprehensive Business 
Management System, is supported by:
• Environmental Policy
• Health and Safety Policy
• People Policy
• Assurance Policy
• Ethics Policy
These can be found on the website 
www.hurricaneenergy.com.
Safety performance across the business 
is measured against a range of internal 
targets which are continually monitored 
and revised. Hurricane’s Group HSSEQ 
Manager is responsible for monitoring 
progress and ensuring continual 
improvement is always sought.
Hurricane’s emergency response 
procedures are in place and are repeatedly 
tested to minimise the impact of any 
potential incidents and emergencies. 
Hurricane takes account of compliance 
with the relevant laws, regulations and 
other obligations as a minimum standard, 
and goes beyond this where possible. We 
consider the context of the Company and 
relevant interested parties to ensure our 
obligations and other management issues 
are comprehensively identified.
The environment
Hurricane recognises its responsibility to 
the environment and will take positive 
steps to address the environmental impacts 
associated with all our operations.
We are committed to achieving continual 
improvement in our Environmental 
Management System to enhance 
environmental performance, and regard 
compliance with the relevant laws, 
regulations and other obligations as a 
minimum standard. We will consider 
the context of the Group and relevant 
interested parties to ensure our obligations 
and other management issues are 
comprehensively identified.
Environmental management
We continually review all our business 
operations to identify and minimise 
environmental impacts and risks. 
Environmental impact assessments are 
regularly conducted and mitigation 
measures are taken, to protect the 
environment and prevent pollution  
where reasonably practicable.
Hurricane requires that our offshore 
contractors’ operations (well, pipeline 
and installation operators) are fully 
certified under ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management System or equivalent. As part 
of our processes, Hurricane undertakes 
audits of our well and installation operators’ 
environmental management systems.

Introduction from the Interim 
Chairman on the Governance Report
– Dr David Jenkins
The Board has achieved a number of key 
milestones this year, as outlined in the Strategic 
Report, not least taking FID for the EPS and 
receiving regulatory approval, having secured 
the US$530 million of capital needed to 
proceed with the project. We now have a larger 
institutional shareholder base. As the size and 
scale of the Company’s operations increase 
as we move towards target first oil, the Board 
has, throughout the year, given consideration 
to a range of governance options to take the 
Company forward. In the second half of the 
year, the Board began its work of exploring 
a potential move to a Premium Listing, 
carried out an evaluation of the Company’s 
organisational and governance protocols 
commensurate with such a listing and also 
reviewed its board composition, balance of 
skills, independence, size and structure. 
On 9 November 2017, the Company 
announced the resignation, with immediate 
effect, of its non-executive chairman, Dr 
Robert Arnott. As the Senior Independent 
director, I assumed the role of Interim 
Chairman and also took the chair of the 
Nominations Committee until a suitable 
candidate for Chairman could be appointed. 
To help move these key governance issues 
forward, a committee of the Board was 
established, the Listing and Governance 
Committee (LGC), chaired by John van der 
Welle. Further information on the work of 
this committee is outlined on page 39. 
I believe the Company has made significant 
progress in transitioning its governance 
towards best practice and Hurricane is 
presenting the 2017 Annual Report and 
Accounts, reporting in line with the key 
principles and provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), a higher 
standard that is not required of companies 
quoted on AIM. 
As our institutional shareholder base 
increased, the Company’s engagement and 
consultation with its shareholders have both 
been strengthened. More recently, John 
van der Welle and I undertook an investor 
roadshow aimed at updating the Company’s 
shareholders, Convertible Bond holders and 
proxy advisers on the governance changes 
we have made and our progress as we 
transition the business. Furthermore, the 
achievements this year could not have been 
made without the invaluable contribution of 
all of our stakeholders, not least our team of 
dedicated employees, the work of our Tier 1 
contractors and all of our shareholders and 
Convertible Bond holders. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to keep 
our governance framework under review 
to ensure it enhances the board’s ability to 
exercise proper oversight. I am confident 
that the new Chairman will inherit a board 
and procedures well placed for the future.
Corporate governance statement
The Board continues to be committed to 
applying standards of corporate governance 
commensurate with its size, stage of growth 
and the nature of its activities and recognises 
its responsibility to serve the interests of 
its shareholders in managing the Company. 
Previously Hurricane, as a member of the 
Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA, the 
membership organisation which represents 
the interests of small and mid-size quoted 
companies), published its annual reports in line 
with the Corporate Governance Code for Small 
and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (QCA Code). 
For 201 7 , the Board has enhanced its corporate 
reporting and made a significant number 
of corporate governance improvements so 
as to align the Company with best practice 
and report on a voluntary basis against the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2016, commensurate with the standards 
expected by stakeholders of Premium Listed 
companies. The Code and associated guidance 
are available on the Financial Reporting Council 
website at www.frc.org.uk.
This Governance Report incorporates the 
reports from the Audit and Risk Committee on 
page 45, the Nominations Committee on page 
49, the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 
50 and the Directors’ Report on page 66. These 
reports together describe how the Company 
has applied the relevant principles of the Code 
and we provide details in each section of any 
current exceptions to compliance with the 
provisions of the Code. The Board therefore 
concludes that, during the 201 7 reporting year, 
the Company has complied with the provisions 
of the Code with the following exceptions, 
(relevant Code provisions shown in brackets) 
the majority of which are inter-related, due to 
the holding of share options by two non-
executive directors – Dr David Jenkins and  
John van der Welle:
• The Company has an Interim non-
executive chairman who on appointment 
to that temporary role was not deemed  
to be fully independent (A.3.1.) (B.1.1.). 
• The Senior Independent director for part 
of the year was not deemed to be fully 
independent (A.4.1.). 
• The independent non-executive directors 
were not deemed to be fully independent 
until 18 December (B.1.1.). 
• Board Balance/Independence Code 
provisions were not met, whereby at least 
half the board should be independent, 
or for smaller companies being those 
below the FTSE 350 size threshold there 
should be at least two independent non-
executive directors (B.1.2.). 
• Composition of the Board committees 
did not meet Code provisions (B.2.1., 
C.3.1. and D.2.1.) as there are insufficient 
independent director members. 
These exceptions are all inter-linked being 
due to the participation by the non-executive 
directors in a company share option scheme, 
in 2013 before the Company’s IPO, which under 
the Code results in them being deemed not 
independent. The Board has always considered 
its non-executive directors independent in 
judgement and character by their actions. 
However, in order to rectify this Code non-
compliance, on 18 December 201 7 the two 
non-executive directors concerned forfeited 
their share options for nil consideration, so as 
to be deemed fully independent under the 
Code. Furthermore, the appointment of a 
new Chairman (who will be independent on 
appointment), allowing the Interim Chairman 
to return to his role of Senior Independent 
director, together with the subsequent 
appointment of additional independent non-
executive directors, will see the independent 
board composition required for Code 
compliance achieved. It is anticipated that full 
compliance with these Code provisions will be 
attained later in the 2018 financial year. 
In addition, the Company does not yet 
comply with Code Provision B.7.1. – the 
re-election by shareholders of directors 
under an annual re-election process – as 
the Company offers its directors for re-
election by rotation in accordance with its 
Articles of Association every three years, 
on the basis of one third being re-elected 
every year. The Board believes that this is 
in the best interests of the Company and 
shareholders at this critical stage of the 
Company’s strategy to provide an element of 
stability and continuity. Going forward this 
re-election process will be kept under review 
and should the Company move to a Premium 
Listing it will be reviewed again in light of the 
Company’s new obligations.
Corporate governance framework
The Listing and Governance 
Committee
In light of the Company’s increased 
institutional shareholder base since the 
recent US$530 million capital raise, and the 
increased size and complexity of its business, 
the Company announced the formation 
of the Listing and Governance Committee 
to bring together a number of options and 
workstreams that it had been exploring, 
including an application for a Premium 
Listing. As part of that decision, the Board 
recognised the increased size and scale of the 
Company’s operations as it moves towards 
target first oil. Given these considerations, the 
Board believed it timely to review its current 
organisational and governance structure, 
and accordingly established the LGC as a 
committee of the Board. 
The purpose of the LGC includes evaluating 
the merits of a Premium Listing, and making 
recommendations on the Company’s 
organisational structure and processes, for 
changes that will better suit the ongoing 
requirements of a company of Hurricane’s 
scale and growth profile. The LGC is chaired 
by John van der Welle (independent non-
executive director). Other committee 
members are Alistair Stobie (CFO), Leonard 
Tao (Alternate director) and Daniel Jankes 
(Company Secretary). David Jenkins (Interim 
Chairman) also attends LGC meetings. 
Evercore Partners were appointed to provide 
independent advice to the committee 
and attend its meetings; in addition, the 
Company’s Nominated Adviser and broker 
Stifel, is invited when appropriate to attend 
meetings of the committee. The committee 
also appointed Boudicca Proxy Ltd which 
is a specialist shareholder engagement and 
corporate governance adviser. 
The LGC’s scope includes: evaluation of the 
merits of a potential move to a Premium 
Listing; recommendations on board size, 
composition and structure including 
governance protocols and the formation of 
additional sub-committees; recommendations 
on any changes to organisational structure, 
and internal processes and procedures; 
recommendations on enhanced reporting and 
disclosure associated with a Premium Listing; 
assessment of regulatory or other changes 
that may impact on the Company’s activities. 
The committee’s terms of reference are 
available on the Company’s website:  
www.hurricaneenergy.com.
The work and recommendations of the 
LGC have been released via the Regulatory 
News Service (RNS), copies of which can also 
be found on the Company website. More 
recently, following the progress on these 
transitional workstreams recommended by 
the committee, a Corporate Governance 
Roadshow was held with major shareholders, 
Convertible Bond holders and proxy advisers 
to update them on the corporate reporting, 
disclosure and governance enhancements 
being established. This roadshow provided 
a welcome opportunity to consult with 
our stakeholders on the developments 
taking place. Further details of the LGC 
recommendations and development work are 
provided in each of the relevant sections of 
the Governance Report, including each of the 
committee reports.

Role of the Board 
Overall, the Board is collectively responsible 
for the long-term success of the Company. 
The Board provides leadership as it sets the 
Group’s strategic objectives and ensures that 
they are properly pursued and that major 
business risks are actively monitored and 
managed, which goes beyond regulatory 
compliance and puts the interests of 
Hurricane’s shareholders at the centre of 
the Board’s decision making so as to be 
accountable to the Company’s stakeholders.
Specifically, the Board’s responsibilities 
include: the development of strategy 
including exploration, appraisal and 
development activity; acquisition and 
divestment policy; the approval of major 
capital expenditure; the Group’s capital 
structure; and consideration of significant 
financing matters. The Board has always had 
an adopted set of Matters Reserved for the 
Board, however it has recently undertaken 
a review of these to ensure that they 
were enhanced to reflect the growth and 
development of the Company in the last year 
and so remain fit for purpose to deal with 
future growth in line with its aspirations.
Board composition
Currently, the Board is comprised of three 
executive directors (the CEO, COO and 
CFO) and has three non-executive directors 
(the Interim Chairman (not independent), 
an independent non-executive and a 
Shareholder Nominee non-executive 
director (not independent)). As outlined 
earlier in this Annual Report, 2017 has been 
a year of change. On 8 November 2017, 
the Chairman Dr Robert Arnott resigned 
with immediate effect and the Senior 
Independent director, Dr David Jenkins, 
assumed the role of Interim Chairman. This 
is a temporary situation but a necessary 
step believed by the Board to be in the best 
interests of the Company until the search 
and selection process for a new Chairman 
concludes with the appointment of a new 
Chairman (Further detail on this process is 
outlined in the Nominations Committee 
Report on page 49. On appointment as 
Interim Chairman, Dr David Jenkins was not 
deemed under the Code to be independent 
due to his holding of share options awarded 
to him before the Company’s IPO on AIM 
under the Hurricane 2013 Performance 
Share Plan (NED Plan). However, the Board 
has always considered its non-executive 
directors independent in judgement and 
character by their actions. On 18 December 
2017, after his appointment as Interim 
Chairman, Dr David Jenkins relinquished 
these options for nil consideration. Upon the 
appointment of a new Chairman, Dr David 
Jenkins will step down from being Interim 
Chairman and will be deemed independent 
under the provisions of the Code, reverting 
to his role of Senior Independent director.
In late 2017, following discussions with its 
shareholders, the Company undertook a 
review of its Board, structure, size, balance 
of skills and composition and has made a 
number of enhancements since then. This 
work was carried out by the Company’s new 
committee, the Listing and Governance 
Committee. The table on page 41 outlines 
the composition of the Board during the 
year and shows each director’s length of 
service and independence together with a 
statement on Code compliance.
Hurricane’s Chairman’s role is to: lead 
the Board and create a culture of openness 
characterised by debate and appropriate 
challenge; ensure that the Board determines 
the nature and extent of the significant risks 
the Company is willing to take to implement 
its strategy; make sure that the Board receives 
accurate, timely and clear information, and 
is consulted on all relevant matters and in so 
doing promote the appropriate standards 
of corporate governance; monitor the 
contribution and performance of Board 
members; make sure that the Company 
communicates clearly with shareholders, 
and discusses their views and concerns with 
the Board; and acts as a key contact for all 
significant stakeholders, as well as working 
with the CEO and Senior Independent director 
to represent the Company in key strategic and 
stakeholder relationships.
Hurricane’s Chief Executive Officer’s 
role is to: lead the Group’s performance, 
executive directors and senior management, 
whilst maintaining a dialogue with the 
Chairman on the important and strategic 
issues facing the Company; propose 
strategies, business plans and policies to 
the Board; implement Board decisions, 
policies and strategies; lead in the day-to-
day running of every part of the business; 
lead, motivate and monitor the performance 
of the Company’s executive and senior 
management team, as well as overseeing 
succession planning for roles of the 
executives; and ensure effective leadership 
of all communication with shareholders and 
all key stakeholders.
Hurricane’s independent non-
executive directors bring experience 
and independent judgement to the Board 
and develop and constructively challenge 
strategy proposals. Each non-executive 
director is appointed for an initial three-
year term and is presently subject to 
re-election by rotation by shareholders 
in Annual General Meeting (AGM). As 
mentioned previously, the Company upon 
the appointment of a new Chairman will 
be looking to increase the number of 
independent non-executive directors.
Hurricane’s Senior Independent 
director is a non-executive director whose 
role is to: meet with major institutional 
shareholders and shareholder representative 
bodies, to discuss matters that would not 
be appropriate for discussion with the 
Chairman or Chief Executive Officer; act as 
a sounding board for the Chairman and as 
an intermediary between the Chairman and 
other directors; and review the Chairman’s 
performance during the year, taking account 
of feedback from other Board members. Dr 
David Jenkins will return to this role once a 
new Chairman is appointed.
Shareholder Nominee director After the 
fundraising campaign in 2016, the Company 
appointed a shareholder nominated director, 
Roy Kelly, to the Board. Roy owes the 
same fiduciary duty and responsibilities to 
the Company as the other directors. Any 
potential or actual conflicted matters are 
identified and acted upon accordingly, via 
a conflict of interest policy. In accordance 
with the Kerogen Relationship Agreement, 
Roy Kelly appointed Jason Cheng or in 
his absence Leonard Tao, as his Alternate 
director (further details of these Alternate 
directors can be found in the Directors’ 
Report on page 66).

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Board process and activities 
during the year 
The Board is responsible for deciding the 
strategy and overseeing its performance, 
while passing the responsibility for day-to-
day operations to its executive directors 
and senior management team. The Board 
is directly involved in approving all major 
decisions, providing oversight and control, 
growing shareholder value and promoting 
corporate governance. The Board’s annual 
programme ensures that key strategic areas 
are addressed. 
During the early part of 2017, the Board’s 
main focus was on the fundraising campaign 
required to take FID for the Lancaster Early 
Production System. Before the project 
could proceed, we also needed regulatory 
approval from the Oil & Gas Authority for 
the FDP which we secured in September. 
Having secured our funding for the project 
as outlined in the Strategic Report, the Board 
then embarked upon a transformation of the 
business in preparation for future growth. 
We continued to scrutinise performance 
against agreed objectives and progressed 
our business operations plan to secure 
delivery of the EPS so as to achieve an 
acceptable return on capital invested. 
The Board’s routine programme included: 
receiving reports from the CEO, COO and 
CFO, monitoring financial reports and 
operating budgets, approving corporate 
reporting, monitoring risk management, 
receiving reports on health and safety, 
succession planning, investor relations, 
regulatory affairs, governance and 
compliance. The Board also received regular 
updates from the respective chairs on key 
matters discussed at the Board committees. 
The Company Secretary ensures that all 
Board papers and presentation materials are 
circulated in advance of each Board meeting 
and that the minutes of meetings and 
Board resolutions are circulated to all Board 
members following each meeting. 
Meetings attendance
The Board held nine formal meetings in 2017. 
In addition, 16 further meetings were called 
at short notice in order to consider specific 
items of business relating to the EPS. The 
table below shows the attendance by all 
directors who served during the year at all  
of the meetings in 2017.
In addition to the formal meetings outlined 
in the table, the non-executive directors met 
without the executive directors present, and 
the non-executive directors also met without 
the Chairman present, led by the Senior 
Independent director at that time. 
Board evaluation
As part of the governance enhancements 
recommended by the LGC and agreed by the 
Board, the Interim Chairman undertook an 
internal board evaluation process, facilitated 
by an external consultant Company 
Secretary. The Chairman has presented 
and discussed the resulting report with the 
Board. The process has identified some 
key areas that the Board will address and 
focus on going forward in 2018. This is the 
first time the Board has carried out such an 
exercise in line with the provisions of the 
Code, whereby it is recommended that an 
external evaluation be carried out at least 
every three years, and it is recognised that 
board evaluation is a procedure for the new 
Chairman to develop further. The process 
was questionnaire based and covered an 
assessment of the Board, completed by 
all directors, and an assessment of the 
Chairman and Interim Chairman by fellow 
directors together with an assessment of 
the principal Board committees completed 
by relevant committee members as 
appropriate. The External Auditor completed 
a questionnaire on the Audit and Risk 
Committee. The focus for 2018 includes: 
Succession Planning (to appoint and induct 
a new Chairman and further non-executive 
directors); continue to enhance internal 
governance and board procedures to 
transition to a potential Premium Listing; 
broaden and deepen strategic debate 
amongst the Board to deliver the next phase 
of the strategy; and continue to focus on 
increased shareholder engagement..
Board induction and training
The Board had in place policies for induction 
and on-going training commensurate with 
the Company’s size and development as 
an AIM-quoted company, however in line 
with its aspirations to become a potential 
Premium Listed company and following 
its governance enhancements (including 
the board evaluation exercise), the Board 
wishes to enhance its induction and training 
programme for the non-executive directors 
who felt that they could benefit from 
additional structured third-party briefings on 
external factors that impact the work of the 
Board committees and the business. We plan 
to incorporate training sessions into the 2018 
board and committee corporate calendar. 
All members of the Board have access to 
appropriate professional development 
courses to support them in meeting their 
obligations and duties. They also receive 
ongoing briefings on current developments, 
including updates on governance and 
regulatory issues.
Independent advice
The Board has adopted a policy whereby 
directors have access to independent advice 
as well as the services of the General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. The procedure 
allows any director to take independent 
professional advice at the Company’s 
expense on any matter in the furtherance  
of their duties.
Directors’ and officers’  
liability insurance 
The Company provides its directors and 
officers with the benefit of appropriate 
insurance, which is reviewed annually. In 
addition, directors and officers have received 
an indemnity from the Company against 
(a) any liability incurred by or attaching to 
the director or officer in connection with 
any negligence, default, breach of duty, or 
breach of trust by them in relation to the 
Company or any associated company; and 
(b) any other liability incurred by or attaching 
to the director or officer in the actual or 
purported execution and/or discharge of 
their duties and/or the exercise or purported 
exercise of their powers and/or otherwise in 
relation to/or in connection with their duties, 
powers or office; other than certain excluded 
liabilities including to the extent that such an 
indemnity is not permitted by law.
The Company Secretary
The General Counsel and Company Secretary 
is Daniel Jankes. He is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with all board procedures 
and company secretarial matters and for 
providing advice to directors when required. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to 
the Board, Audit and Risk Committee, and 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees 
when required and has direct access to the 
Chairman and to the committee Chairs. 
Conflict of interests
Every director has a duty to avoid a conflict 
between their personal interests and those 
of the Company. The provisions of Section 
175 of the Companies Act 2006 and the 
Company’s Articles of Association permit 
the Board to authorise situations identified 
by a director in which he or she has, or 
may have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or may conflict, with the interests 
of the Company. Each director is aware of 
their duty to notify the Board should there 
be any material change to their positions or 
interests during the year. Directors do not 
participate in board discussions or decisions 
which relate to any matter in which they 
have or may have a conflict of interest.
Re-election of directors
The Company does not yet comply with 
Code provision B.7.1. – the re-election by 
shareholders of directors under an annual 
re-election process – as the Company offers 
its directors for re-election by rotation in 
accordance with its Articles of Association 
every three years, on the basis of one 
third being re-elected every year. In 2018, 
the Board believes that this is in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders 
at this critical stage of the Company’s 
strategy to provide an element of stability 
and continuity. Going forward this re-
election process will be kept under review 
and should the Company move to a Premium 
Listing it will be reviewed again in light of the 
Company’s new compliance obligations.
At each AGM, at least one-third of the 
directors eligible for rotation must 
retire from office and be subject to re-
appointment by shareholders. Each director 
must retire at the third AGM following their 
last appointment or re-appointment in a 
general meeting. The directors due to retire 
by rotation, pursuant to Article 62 of the 
Articles of Association, at the AGM in 2018 
are Roy Kelly and Dr David Jenkins. 
Election of directors 
In accordance with the Articles of 
Association, each director appointed by the 
Board during the year shall retire at the next 
AGM following their appointment and offer 
themselves for election.
Other external directorships 
In line with the directors’ Service Contracts, 
executive directors must seek permission to 
take on any external directorships. Likewise, 
in order to ensure that the time constraints 
are not over stretched and to avoid 
“overboarding”, the non-executive directors 
raise with the Board any matters relating to 
them taking up other external appointments 
before committing to such appointments.
Political donations 
Our policy is that neither Hurricane Energy 
plc nor any company in the Group will make 
contributions in cash or kind to any political 
party, whether by gift or loan.
Communication with shareholders
The Board as a whole has responsibility for 
ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue with 
shareholders takes place. It believes that 
shareholder dialogue is key to developing an 
understanding of the views of shareholders 
and encourages two-way communication, 
providing prompt responses to queries 
received orally or in writing. The Board also 
remains informed by monitoring the main 
movements in shareholdings and reviewing 
brokers’ reports.
In the normal course of business, the CEO 
and CFO are available to shareholders in 
investor meetings and at public events. 
The Chairman and Senior Independent 
director are also available to shareholders, 
if communication through the normal 
channels fails to resolve a matter, or if it 
is felt inappropriate to discuss the matter 
involved with the CEO and/or CFO. Currently 
the Interim Chairman, who was previously 
Senior Independent director, takes the lead 
on these matters and ensures that the views 
of shareholders are communicated to the 
Board as a whole.

Audit and Risk Committee Chairman’s Report
Introduction by the Audit and  
Risk Committee Chairman 
– John van der Welle
I am pleased to present the report of the 
Audit and Risk Committee for the year 
ended 31 December 2017, including the 
committee’s activities since that date. As 
outlined earlier in the Annual Report, this 
has been a year of change for Hurricane, 
with processes commenced in the year 
continuing to progress into 2018. In late 2017, 
we began work on reviewing and revising the 
terms of reference of the committee. The 
Listing and Governance Committee led the 
review process for this work. In mid-January 
2018, the Board agreed the new terms of 
reference, a copy of which can be found on 
Hurricane’s website www.hurricaneenergy.
com. The Audit Committee was also 
renamed the Audit and Risk Committee, 
to reflect one of the committee’s key 
roles in monitoring the Company’s risk 
management systems. Whilst Hurricane 
currently remains an AIM-quoted company, 
my report this year has been enhanced with 
reporting and disclosures commensurate 
with those expected of a Premium Listed 
company, as Hurricane transitions its 
corporate governance towards best practice 
including compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
Committee composition 
The Audit and Risk Committee has been 
chaired by John van der Welle since March 
2013, who has recent and relevant financial 
experience (as a FTSE and AIM E&P company 
director) as required by the Code. Other 
committee members in the 2017 reporting 
year, all of whom possess the required 
competence relevant to the sector in which 
Hurricane operates, were Dr David Jenkins, 
and Dr Robert Arnott until his resignation on 
8 November 2017. During the year, Roy Kelly 
(Kerogen Shareholder Nominee director) was 
also a committee member, in line with the 
Kerogen Relationship Deed, dated 18 April 
2016. (Kerogen being the Company’s largest 
shareholder). As the Company prepares for 
a possible future transition to a Premium 
Listing, and as part of the governance 
enhancements, Kerogen agreed to amend 
its Relationship Deed and Roy Kelly stepped 
down as a member of the Audit and Risk 
Committee on 17 December 2017. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary of 
the committee. 
Director Independence Relevant and recent financial experience
John van der Welle Yes (from 18 December 2017) Yes
Chartered Accountant (ACA), Member of the 
Institute of Taxation and Chartered Taxation 
Adviser (CTA) and Fellow of the Association of 
Corporate Treasurers (FCT).
Dr David Jenkins No (will revert to being independent upon 
appointment of new Chairman)
Dr Robert Arnott* Independent on appointment
Roy Kelly** No
*  Resigned 8 November 2017.
** On 17 December 2017 stepped down as a member but will be invited to attend meetings as per the amended Kerogen Relationship Deed.
For a company outside the FTSE 350, the committee should consist of at least two independent directors. Currently the composition of the 
committee does not conform to the provisions of the Code. Dr David Jenkins stepped up to be Interim Chairman on 8 November 2017 and 
was not considered independent following appointment to this temporary role, therefore leaving at present only one independent director 
on the committee in John van der Welle. As announced on 17 January 2018, this situation will be resolved as soon as practicable in 2018 upon 
the appointment of a new independent Company Chairman, and the subsequent appointment of new independent non-executive directors, 
some or all of whom will join the committee as appropriate. Upon the appointment of the new Chairman Dr David Jenkins will revert to being 
an independent non-executive director and the committee at that point will be made up of two fully independent directors (compliant with the 
Code for a company outside the FTSE 350.) Furthermore it is intended that the committee will become Code compliant for a FTSE 350 company 
comprising of at least three independent non-executive directors with the appointment of new independent non-executive directors as soon 
as practicable in 2018. 
Governance Report continued
Communication with shareholders 
continued
Meetings with shareholders took place 
throughout the 2017 reporting year. These 
included forums such as the Capital Markets 
Day in April and the AGM in June. There 
were also a large number of direct meetings 
with major shareholders leading up to the 
fundraising announced in June, and towards 
the end of the year, following the departure 
of the Chairman. Another key event was a 
site visit to Dubai Drydocks World for a group 
of analysts, shareholders, and Convertible 
Bond holders in December 2017, to provide 
the investor community with transparency 
on these EPS-critical operations. As part of 
the corporate governance enhancement 
programme, a governance roadshow was 
undertaken in January and February 2018. 
Shareholders are kept informed of 
the progress and performance of the 
Group through its corporate reporting. 
This information and other significant 
announcements of the Group are released 
to the London Stock Exchange and are also 
made available on the Company website. 
The Group is conscious of the need to 
ensure that smaller shareholders are not 
disadvantaged, so video webcasts or speaker 
notes are made available after key events 
for those shareholders not present. Links to 
publicly available broker research are also 
provided on the website. Shareholders also 
have the opportunity to engage with the 
Board at its AGM.
Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
The AGM will take place on 6 June 2018 at 
11:00am in The Science Suite, Royal Society 
of Chemistry, Burlington House, Piccadilly, 
London, W1J 0BA.
The Notice of the AGM is sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before 
the meeting. The Chairmen of the Audit 
and Risk, Remuneration and Nominations 
Committees will be available at the AGM to 
answer any queries. In addition, all directors 
are encouraged to attend the AGM so 
that shareholders will have an opportunity 
to meet them. Voting on resolutions will 
generally be conducted by polls at general 
meetings and the voting results will be 
announced through the London Stock 
Exchange and are also available on the 
Company’s website. In line with Companies 
Act 2006 and best practice, the Company 
now supplies information such as notices 
of meetings, forms of proxy and the Annual 
Report and Accounts via its website. 
Registered shareholders are notified by email 
or post when new information is available 
on the website. The Company will continue 
to send hard copy communications to those 
shareholders who request it. Shareholders 
may at any time revoke a previous instruction 
to receive hard copies or electronic copies of 
shareholder information.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Meetings
The committee met three times during the 
year under review, and once to date in 2018. 
Attendance of the committee members is 
shown below. Only members of the committee 
have the right to attend the meetings of the 
committee. However, the committee has the 
right to request other executive directors, 
senior management and the external auditors 
to attend its meetings. The external auditor 
has direct access to the Chairman of the 
committee and has met and conversed with 
the Chairman on a number of occasions during 
the year without the presence of the executive 
directors. Following each meeting the 
Chairman of the committee, reports formally 
to the Board on the main issues discussed by 
the committee.
Role
The revised terms of reference of the 
committee reflect best practice and the 
requirements of the Code, as well as the FRC 
2016 Guidance on Audit Committees, the 
FRC 2014 Guidance on Risk Management 
and Internal Control, the FRC 2016 Ethical 
Standards. The principal responsibilities of 
the committee are as follows: 
• Monitor the integrity of the Financial 
Statements of the Company including 
results and other announcements of 
financial performance; review significant 
financial reporting issues and judgements.
• Review and, where necessary, challenge 
the consistency of accounting policies and 
whether appropriate accounting standards 
have been used.
• Review the contents of the Annual 
Report and Accounts and advise the 
Board on whether it is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s position, 
performance, business model and 
strategy.
• Review the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems.
• Consider the need for an internal audit 
function and make a recommendation to 
the Board.
• Review the Company’s “whistle-blowing” 
system, and procedures for detecting fraud.
• Review the Company’s procedures for the 
prevention of bribery and receive reports 
on non-compliance.
• Oversee the relationship with the 
external auditor, including assessing their 
independence and objectivity, and approval 
of auditor remuneration including the level 
of audit and non-audit fees.
• Review and approve the annual audit plan, 
and review the effectiveness and findings 
of the audit.
• Report to the Board on the proceedings 
of the committee and make 
recommendations to the Board on any 
area within the committee’s remit.
Key matters considered by the 
committee
During the reporting year, and the period 
to date in 2018, the committee has 
discharged its responsibilities and the 
following describes the main aspects of work 
completed by the committee:
Annual Report and financial 
reporting
The committee has considered the 
significant issues in relation to the 
preparation of the 2016 and 2017 Annual 
Reports and Group Financial Statements, 
along with the 2017 Interim Report. The 
areas of focus for the committee included 
consistency of application of accounting 
policies; compliance with financial reporting 
standards, AIM and legal requirements; 
the appropriateness of assumptions and 
Audit and Risk Committee Chairman’s Report continued
judgements for items subject to estimates 
and the clarity and completeness of 
disclosures in the Financial Statements. 
Overall, the committee focuses on whether, 
taken as a whole, the Annual Report and 
Group Financial Statements, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance, business 
model and strategy. The committee and the 
Board believe this to be the case.
The committee considered in particular 
the following major Financial Statement 
items that require significant judgement and 
estimation in the preparation of the 2017 
Financial Statements. A number of these 
have also been identified by Deloitte as key 
audit matters in their 2017 year-end audit: 
Recoverability of exploration and 
evaluation (E&E) Assets 
The Group follows the successful efforts 
method of accounting for E&E expenditure 
in accordance with IFRS 6. There is a 
recurring risk that the balance at period end 
will not be recovered if such activities do 
not ultimately lead to commercially viable 
production. Accordingly, impairment reviews 
are undertaken bi-annually by management 
and reviewed by the committee and the 
external auditors. As part of this process, 
a report is prepared by management for 
committee and auditor review and challenge 
on the status of each E&E asset, including 
future plans for drilling and other technical 
work, and the availability of funding for these 
activities, so that indicators of impairment 
can be identified, and the impairments are 
recognised as appropriate. The committee 
satisfied itself with the carrying values of E&E 
assets, the write-off at 2017 year-end of the 
Typhoon and Tempest assets and the full 
impairment of the Strathmore asset.
Full recoverability of Lancaster assets 
Following FDP approval for the EPS, the 
Lancaster field element of E&E has been 
reclassified in the year-end 2017 Financial 
Statements from E&E expenditure to 
Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E). Prior 
to the reclassification, management was 
required to carry out an impairment test 
relating to the assets being reclassified to 
support their carrying value. The committee 
has reviewed and challenged the report 
prepared by management detailing the 
basis for the amount of expenditure 
transferred to PP&E, and also the impairment 
test undertaken immediately prior to the 
reclassification. 
Convertible bond accounting
The funding of the EPS includes the issuance 
of $230 million in 7 .5% convertible bonds 
repayable at par in mid-2022. The committee 
reviewed the basis of accounting for this new 
liability and the associated conversion rights 
in the 201 7 Financial Statements, and satisfied 
itself that it has been recorded in accordance 
with IFRS.
Change in functional and presentation 
currencies
During 201 7 the Group reviewed its functional 
and presentational currencies, and concluded 
that a change from Pounds Sterling to 
US Dollars was appropriate for both with 
effect from 1 January 201 7 . The change in 
presentational currency represents a change 
in accounting policy. As part of considering 
the 201 7 Interim Report, the committee 
and auditors reviewed the basis of this 
change, noting the majority of EPS costs 
are denominated in US Dollars, the EPS is 
part funded by the US Dollar denominated 
Convertible Bond issued in the year, and that 
revenues from the sale of oil production will 
be received in US Dollars, and accordingly 
concurred with the change.
Going Concern and Long-term Viability 
The assessment of whether the Group can 
continue as a going concern is a recurring 
matter which forms the basis of preparation 
of the Group’s Financial Statements. 
Management prepare a detailed report 
for consideration and challenge by the 
committee and auditors, including forecast 
cashflows for the business, including a variety 
of potential scenarios alongside a range 
of sensitivity assumptions. Of particular 
importance to the 2017 year-end cashflow 
forecasts supporting the going concern 
basis are the cost and timing of completion 
of the EPS development leading to first oil, 
and subsequent production performance. 
The committee also reviewed longer-term 
forecasts and their basis, prepared by 
management in support of the Long-term 
Viability Statement in the 2017 Annual 
Report. The committee was satisfied with 
the forecast financial position of the Group 
and the underlying assumptions made, with 
appropriateness of the going concern basis 
of preparation of the Financial Statements, 
and with the long-term viability of the Group.
Internal control and risk 
management
The Board (through its delegation to the 
committee) recognises that it has ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s system of 
internal control and ensures that it maintains a 
sound system of internal control to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s 
assets. No system of internal control can 
provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. Instead, the Company 
operates a system which is designed to 
manage rather than to eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and to 
provide the Board with reasonable assurance 
that problems are identified on a timely basis 
and dealt with appropriately.
The Company follows a process of identifying, 
assessing and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group as a whole. The key aspects 
of this process are summarised as follows:
The Board and management
The Company carries out a comprehensive 
budgeting and planning process whereby 
detailed operating budgets for the following 
financial year are prepared by management 
for approval by the Board. The day-to-day 
management is undertaken by the senior 
management of the Group who have the 
responsibility for providing visible leadership 
and ensuring that risk management is 
integrated into all operations and functions.
Organisational structure and 
authorisation procedure
The Company has an established 
organisation structure with clearly stated 
delegated responsibility and reporting. 
Authorisation procedures in respect of 
matters such as capital expenditure, 
acquisitions, investments and treasury 
transactions are clearly defined and 
communicated.
Risk assessment
In reviewing the effectiveness of the 
system of internal control, the Board first 
considers the risk management system and 
all aspects of risks which include strategic, 
financial, operational and compliance risks. 
It then considers whether the key controls 
designed to mitigate these risks are working 
as intended.
 The Corporate Risk Register (the “Register”) 
provides a consistent method for managing 
and reporting risks across the Group and 
ensures that significant risks are understood 
and visible to senior management, as well as 
to the Board. The Register sets out the top 
risks as defined by management. The Board 
prioritises the top risks against the likelihood 
of occurrence and impact on achievement 
of the Group’s objectives. The Register, which 
also sets out mitigating controls and actions, 
has been reviewed and assessed by the 
committee and the Board. A summary of the 
Principal Risks and uncertainties facing the 
Group is provided on pages 18 to 21.
 The process put in place by the Group 
to address financial and liquidity risk are 
described in the Principal Risks, Going Concern 
and Long-Term Viability Statement section of 
the Strategic Report. In line with best practice, 
the process for identifying, monitoring and 
reporting risks is reviewed regularly by the 
Board based on the recommendations of the 
committee. The process described has been in 
place for the year under review and up to the 
date of the approval of this Annual Report and 
Financial Statements.
Financial and management reporting
The financial results of the business are 
reported to the Board on a regular basis 
and monitored against budget and latest 
forecasts. The controls that support the 
Group’s financial reporting procedures are 
considered as part of the Group’s on-going 
risk assessment process and are reviewed for 
effectiveness by the committee.
Reviewing and monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal controls
The internal control framework is based 
on the Board’s assessment of risk. The 
effectiveness of the internal control system 
is monitored by executive management.  
All exceptions are reported and reviewed  
by the committee.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
Nominations Committee Chairman’s Report 
Internal audit
Due to the relative simplicity of the 
Company’s business to date – as a pre-
revenue, single country, pure exploration/
appraisal business – it has not historically 
been considered necessary to have a 
separate internal audit function in order to 
provide the Board with assurance on controls 
and risks. The committee has recently 
considered the need for an internal audit 
function taking into account the increased 
scale and complexity of the Company’s 
operations with the EPS development 
currently underway, and plans to review the 
issue again later in 2018 as revenue from first 
oil approaches.
External auditors 
The committee regularly monitors and 
approves the services provided to the 
Group by its external auditors (Deloitte 
LLP). During the year, the fees for non-audit 
related services were $82,000. These services 
related to the interim half year review and 
the preparation of certain reports to assist 
the Company as it prepares for a potential 
Premium Listing. Regarding the latter, the 
committee believed that it was in the best 
interests of the Company and shareholders 
for Deloitte LLP to undertake this work due to 
their extensive knowledge of the Company 
and the fact that the work was closely linked 
to the audit. Further details of the fees for 
audit and non-audit services provided by the 
external auditors are disclosed in note 6 to 
the consolidated Financial Statements.
The committee recognises that, for smaller 
companies, it is cost effective to procure 
certain non-audit services from the external 
auditor but there is a need to ensure that 
provision of such services does not impair, or 
appear to impair, the auditor’s independence 
or objectivity. The committee must be 
consulted before the assignment of any non-
audit work can be awarded to the external 
auditor. The committee was satisfied 
throughout the year that Deloitte LLP’s 
objectivity and independence were in no 
way impaired by the nature of the non-audit 
work undertaken or other factors including 
the level of non-audit fees charged.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
external audit process was carried out for each 
of the financial years ended 31 December 2016 
and 31 December 201 7 , taking into account 
the views of the relevant senior management 
and the committee members. The conclusion 
of the evaluations was that the process was 
effective and areas for improvement were 
discussed with the external auditors to 
continually enhance the effectiveness of 
the audit process in future years. 
The committee maintains an on-going 
oversight of the external audit appointment. 
At the AGM shareholders are requested to 
authorise the directors to appoint and agree 
the remuneration of the external auditors. 
Deloitte LLP was first appointed as external 
auditor to the Group for the year ended 31 
August 2010 and the audit has not been put 
to tender since that date. The original audit 
partner was Bevan Whitehead, and in 2015 
David Paterson assumed this role. A formal 
tender process should be considered at 
least every five years and the committee will 
keep this under review. To date, due to the 
size and scope of Hurricane, the committee 
has not considered it to be appropriate for 
the Company nor in the best interests of 
shareholders to have undertaken a formal 
tender process. Going forward, as the 
Company transitions to a potential Premium 
Listing and approaches first oil in 2019, the 
committee will at this time agree the timing 
of any formal tender process. In accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, a resolution 
to re-appoint Deloitte LLP will be proposed at 
the next AGM. The committee believes the 
independence and objectivity of the external 
auditor and the effectiveness of the audit 
process remain strong. 
Whistle-blowing and anti-bribery
The Company operates a whistle-blowing 
procedure to allow staff to raise in confidence 
any concerns about business practices. This 
procedure complements established internal 
reporting processes. The whistle-blowing 
policy is included in the Employee Handbook 
which is available to all staff in electronic 
form. The committee considers the whistle-
blowing procedures to be appropriate for the 
size and scale of the Group.
It is the Company’s policy to conduct all 
of our business in an honest and ethical 
manner, and we adopt a zero-tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption. 
The Company is committed to acting 
professionally, fairly and with integrity in 
all our business dealings and relationships 
wherever we operate and implementing 
and enforcing effective systems to counter 
bribery and corruption. The Group’s 
anti-bribery and corruption procedures 
incorporate appropriate provisions to 
meet our obligations under the UK Bribery 
Act 2010. A training and communication 
programme for all employees is in place 
to ensure that employees understand the 
requirements of the Act and the reporting 
procedures. Arrangements with contractors 
and suppliers have been and will continue 
to be reviewed and updated to reflect the 
requirements of the UK Bribery Act 2010.
Effectiveness
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
committee for the review year of 2017 was 
recently conducted via an internal evaluation 
process, with the results reported to the 
Board. This process concluded that the 
committee was effective in terms of its 
expertise and use of time and that it had 
been provided with sufficient resources to 
carry out its duties.

Introduction by the Nominations 
Committee Chairman 
– Dr David Jenkins
I am pleased to present the Report of the 
Nominations Committee for the year ended 
31 December 2017. This year has been a 
significant year of change for Hurricane. 
The focus for the committee towards the 
end of 2017 has been the search for a new 
non-executive chairman to steer Hurricane 
forward, assisted by Spencer Stuart, a leading 
executive search and selection firm. The terms 
of reference of the committee were also 
reviewed, this work being led by the Listing 
and Governance Committee, chaired by John 
van der Welle. In early January 2018, the Board 
agreed the new terms of reference, a copy of 
which can be found on Hurricane’s website  
www.hurricaneenergy.com. In line with the 
Company’s ambitions to transition Hurricane 
to a potential Premium Listing, my report 
this year has been enhanced with reporting 
and disclosures commensurate with those 
expected of a Premium Listed company.
Committee composition 
During the year the Nominations Committee 
was chaired by Dr Robert Arnott until his 
resignation as Chairman on 8 November 
201 7 . Dr David Jenkins, having assumed the 
role of Interim Chairman, has chaired the 
committee since then. Additional members 
during the year included John van der Welle 
(Independent director) and Roy Kelly (Kerogen 
Shareholder Nominee director, who was 
appointed to the committee in line with the 
Kerogen Relationship Deed, dated 18 April 
2016 (Kerogen being the Company’s largest 
shareholder)). The committee has full access to 
the General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
Under provisions (B.2. 1.) of the Code the 
committee should consist of a majority 
of independent directors. Currently the 
composition of the committee does not 
fully conform to this provision. Dr David 
Jenkins assumed the role of Interim 
Chairman on 8 November 2017 and was not 
considered independent on appointment, 
therefore leaving at present only one 
independent director on the committee 
(John van der Welle). As announced on 
17 January 2018, this situation will be 
resolved upon the appointment of a new 
independent Company Chairman and 
the subsequent appointment of new 
independent non-executive directors  
who will join the Nominations Committee  
as appropriate.

Role
The Nominations Committee’s role is to keep 
under review the structure and composition 
of the Board and its committees, consider 
Board member succession and identify and 
make recommendations for any changes 
to the Board. All decisions relating to the 
appointment of directors are made by the 
entire Board based on the recommendations 
of the committee who take into account the 
merits of the candidates and the relevance 
of their background and experience, 
measured against objective criteria. 
Hurricane is committed to appointing, 
retaining and developing an expert team 
which can effectively manage the Company’s 
objectives and deliver its strategy. The Board 
recognises the benefits of diversity and the 
Nominations Committee has regard to this 
when considering succession planning. 
Activities during the year 
The committee’s primary focus from late 
2017, upon the resignation of the Chairman, 
was to commence a full and rigorous 
selection process of a new independent 
non-executive chairman. A formal tender 
process was undertaken to appoint a search 
and selection specialist, following which 
Spencer Stuart was appointed (Spencer 
Stuart is a leading search firm which has 
no connection with the Company other 
than its appointment for this process). The 
committee, having discussed the process 
used to compile the candidate list, then 
agreed that the methodology and rationale 
adopted by Spencer Stuart were appropriate. 
As part of the agreed selection process, 
Spencer Stuart provided a thorough profile 
on each candidate and an opportunity for 
all other Board members to meet with any 
potential candidates. The committee believe 
that following such a thorough and rigorous 
process is critical to being able to make a 
clear recommendation with which the Board 
can agree. 
The selection process is now well advanced 
and it is anticipated that a new Chairman 
will be appointed in Q2 2018. In addition, 
as part of the work of the committee and 
the enhancements recommended by the 
LGC, further non-executive directors will 
be sought to strengthen the Company 
and ensure Code compliance. These 
appointments will be made with input from 
the new Chairman, therefore it is anticipated 
that these will be in place by the end of the 
2018 financial year. 
The Board and the work of the Nominations 
Committee supports the principles of 
diversity in its widest sense and in relation to 
the aspirations set out in the Davies Report, 
“Women on Boards”. As Hurricane develops 
in scope and size, the committee will 
continue to monitor and review its diversity 
in relation to its leadership team.

Financial Statements Hurricane Energy plc Annual Report and Group Financial Statements
Year Ended 31 December 2017
I am pleased to present Hurricane’s 
Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 
December 2017. As an AIM-quoted company, 
Hurricane is not required to produce a formal 
remuneration report. This year, however, 
in line with our enhanced disclosure and 
corporate reporting, we have prepared this 
report on a voluntary basis in accordance 
with the main reporting requirements of a 
Premium Listed company. The sections of 
the Annual Report on Remuneration that are 
subject to audit are indicated accordingly. 
The Chairman’s Annual Statement 
on Remuneration and the directors’ 
Remuneration Policy are not subject to audit. 
The Board is committed to transparency and 
this new style report is designed to provide 
more information to shareholders about the 
details of Hurricane’s remuneration policies 
and how they underpin the Group’s strategy. 
This Annual Statement gives an outline 
of our Remuneration Policy, how it was 
implemented in the year under review (2017), 
how we plan to implement our Remuneration 
Policy in 2018 and a summary of the key 
activities of the Remuneration Committee 
during the reporting year.
Remuneration policy underpinning 
Group strategy in 2017
Hurricane’s Remuneration Policy is closely 
linked to delivery of its strategy. In addition 
to offering competitive base levels of 
salary and benefits to attract and retain 
employees, all employees participate in an 
annual bonus scheme, to drive delivery of 
inter-year performance, and in longer term 
share based incentive plans connected to 
our strategy of progressing and monetising 
our Rona Ridge assets. 
The year under review was the first full 
year of performance under the Group’s 
new long-term incentive plan, the Value 
Creation Plan (VCP), a one-off five-year 
scheme implemented by the Board in 
late 2016, concurrent with the November 
2016 capital raise. The VCP was introduced 
as a replacement to the original 2013 
Performance Share Plan (PSP), following 
advice from specialist remuneration 
consultant, Kepler. The plan incentivises 
management to achieve the Company’s 
strategy of de-risking and monetising its 
resource base. As operational hurdles are 
achieved, management is increasingly 
incentivised to ensure that this progress is 
translated into returns for shareholders. 
The introduction of the VCP was 
accompanied by the introduction of an 
annual bonus cap at 50% of base salary for 
all employees, including executive directors. 
The previous cap was 100%. This change 
increases emphasis on overall delivery of 
strategy and shareholder-return linked 
remuneration. In 2017, a new Performance 
Share Plan was introduced to award 
long-term share incentives to certain key 
employees (below Board level) joining the 
Company since the introduction of the 
VCP. As a new plan designed to operate in 
parallel with the VCP, it has performance 
conditions in line with those of the VCP. 
Its aim being to attract and incentivise key 
senior personnel as Hurricane moves closer 
to first oil, ensuring that executive directors 
and other employees are aligned. Full details 
of the VCP and PSPs are set out on pages 54 
and 55 respectively .
Performance in 2017 
2017 was a transformative year for Hurricane, 
with significant progress made towards 
our long-term strategy of progressing and 
monetising our Rona Ridge assets. The 
Group made progress towards first oil on 
the EPS including financing, FID and FDP 
approval, whilst delivering a number of other 
corporate objectives including a good health 
and safety record. Based on the committee’s 
assessment of achievement against the 
Performance Measures in the 2017 Annual 
bonus scorecard (outlined on page 60), cash 
bonus payments of 41.25% of base salary 
were awarded to each executive director 
(against the maximum of 50%).
There was no increase in base salaries for 
executive directors in 2017 (base salaries 
having been held at the same level since 2013). 
There were also no share based awards under 
share schemes (other than the Share Incentive 
Plan) granted to any executive director during 
the year, nor were any due to vest. 
The Company operated the Share Incentive 
Plan (SIP) in January 2017 and made annual 
awards under this HMRC approved scheme 
to all of its participants, including executive 
directors. Further details are outlined on 
page 55.
Committee focus during the year
The committee’s main focus in 2017 was the 
annual review of the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy, including the review of directors’ 
salaries, approval of the annual bonus 
awards for the previous year and the setting 
of the annual bonus scheme Performance 
Measure scorecard metrics for the year 
ahead. In addition, the committee reviewed 
and approved certain Milestones of the 
VCP. Towards the end of the year, the 
committee also recommended to the Board 
implementation of the new 2017 PSP for 
new employees not participating in the VCP, 
which was duly approved.
Implementation of our 
Remuneration Policy in 2018
The committee has determined that the 
Remuneration Policy (as outlined on pages 
51 and 52) will remain unchanged for 2018. 
The committee has therefore determined: 
that executive directors’ base salaries will 
remain unchanged; that there will be no 
change to their benefits packages or pension 
arrangements; that the annual bonus for 
each executive director will remain capped 
at a maximum of 50% of base salary; and 
that any events which trigger achievement 
of the Milestones of the VCP will be assessed 
by the committee thereafter to determine 
the appropriate vesting percentage to be 
applied in line with this category at maturity 
of the scheme. 
Shareholder engagement
The Board has always sought to ensure that 
incentive structures help deliver shareholder 
objectives and has been committed to open 
and constructive dialogue with shareholders 
on appropriate mechanisms to achieve this. In 
particular, the introduction of the VCP came 
alongside the November 2016 equity placing, 
with major participating shareholders consulted 
on the structure during the marketing phase. 
The Board and committee remains committed 
to dialogue with its new broader shareholder 
base on all matters, including remuneration, 
and will continue to engage in appropriate 
dialogue going forward.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual statement on remuneration Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy framework.
Following industry practice, Hurricane’s executive directors’ Remuneration Policy is comprised of fixed and variable annual compensation to 
drive delivery of near-term targets, with an additional overarching long-term incentive plan to maintain a longer-term focus on generating 
value for shareholders. A significant proportion of each director’s total remuneration package is structured to link rewards to the attainment of 
performance targets, both short-term (Performance Measures) and long-term (Milestones). The current Remuneration Policy last underwent a 
significant revision in 2016, with the replacement of the original 2013 PSP with the VCP. 
As an AIM-quoted company, Hurricane’s Remuneration Policy does not require formal shareholder approval. However, the Company has 
voluntarily opted to prepare a Remuneration Policy which follows the requirements applicable to UK Premium Listed companies.
The components of the policy are described in more detail in our policy framework below.
Element Link to strategy Operation Maximum limit Performance assessment
Base 
Salary
Supports recruitment, 
retention and motivation of key 
executives.
Intended to provide market 
competitive levels of reward for 
the respective role. 
Reviewed annually or upon 
changes in role. A review may not 
necessarily result in an increase. 
Salaries are paid monthly in cash.
Elements considered include:
• Salaries for similar roles 
in relevant comparator 
companies.
• Individual specifics (e.g. 
personal performance, 
experience and the individual’s 
role within the Group).
• Enhanced/reduced scope of 
responsibility compared with 
the norm for a given role.
• Pay and conditions for all 
employees.
No formal limit on annual 
increases, though the committee 
would be unlikely to make 
significant changes except in 
cases where an individual’s 
responsibility or role had 
changed, or if it became evident 
that a realignment with market 
rates was required.
No formal process.
The committee is of the view that 
base salary levels for executive 
directors reflect the competitive 
market level for the individual’s skill 
set and contribution. 
Annual 
bonus
Incentivises and rewards 
executives for the achievement of 
annual performance targets linked 
to delivery of the Group’s strategy. 
Ensures continual assessment and 
accountability of executives to the 
rest of the Board.
Performance Measures are 
separate and distinct from VCP 
Milestones which represent longer 
term hurdles in delivering the 
Group’s strategy.
Includes link to health, safety and 
environmental performance. 
At the start of the year, Executives 
and the committee agree on a 
set of performance measures 
which are relevant to the Group’s 
progress towards its strategy over 
the forthcoming period.
Following incorporation of the 
2016 VCP, the maximum annual 
cash bonus for all employees was 
limited to 50% of base salary.
The Performance Measures are 
set by the committee, who also 
determine the level of achievement 
against these targets.
The Performance Measures are 
ambitious and not expected 
to be fully achieved in every 
year. No specific on-target level 
of performance is formally 
communicated below the maximum 
amounts for full achievement.

A long-term scheme, only 
paying out after five years 
or earlier upon a maturity 
event (successful disposal or

Certain operational Milestones, linked to 
long-term strategy, determine the level of 
vesting of portions of a pool of Growth 
Shares at maturity of the scheme (see 
tables of Milestones on page 55).
Upon a vesting, the vested portion of 
Growth Shares may be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares, provided the share price 
is above a hurdle price of £0.55.
A maturity event in the case of a 
successful sale or disposal would be 
subject to a higher hurdle price of £0.65.

Directors’ service contracts
The executive directors have rolling-term Service Agreements with the Group. The notice period for Dr Robert Trice and Neil Platt is 12 months 
if given by the Group and six months if given by the individual. Alistair Stobie’s notice period has been set at six months in either case. The 
Group’s policy is to set notice periods of up to 12 months. 
The executive directors’ Service Agreements each include the ability for the Group, at its discretion, to pay basic salary only in lieu of any 
unexpired period of notice. Payments may be made as either a lump sum or in equal monthly installments until the end of the notice period 
at the discretion of the Group. The executive director’s entitlement to pay in lieu ceases immediately on the date on which the executive 
director accepts an offer of alternative employment or engagement. 
The Service Agreements contain provisions enabling the Group to place the executive director on gardening leave during the period of notice. 
Where an executive director’s appointment is terminated by reason of the executive’s death, redundancy, injury, ill health or disability, the 
executive director shall be entitled to a pro-rated bonus based on 50% of his/her base salary in respect of the period of service (including any 
period for which the executive is paid in lieu of service) in the relevant financial year.
The executive directors have agreed to become employee shareholders in accordance with the provisions of section 205A(1) of the 
Employment Rights Act 1996 and have relinquished certain statutory rights in relation to statutory redundancy, unfair dismissal, flexible 
working, and the right to return to work on eight weeks’ notice during adoption leave. The Service Agreements incorporate provisions 
reinstating such rights by way of contract.

Copies of the Service Agreements for current executive directors are available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered office. 
Non-executive directors’ fees and letters of appointment 
The fees payable to the non-executive directors are determined by the Board, taking into account the time commitment required, the 
responsibilities assumed and comparative market rates. No director plays a part in any discussion about their own remuneration. At the end of 
2017, as part of the governance enhancements work commenced by the Listing and Governance Committee, the Company updated its Letters 
of Appointment to non-executive directors in line with best practice. The fee arrangements were also reviewed at this time. Details of these 
fees are outlined on page 60. 
Each non-executive director is appointed for a term of three years. This term may be extended by the Board upon recommendation of 
the Nominations Committee, and the appointment can be terminated by either party on three months’ notice. non-executive directors 
are typically expected to serve two three-year terms, however the Board may invite the individual to serve an additional period. The non-
executive directors are subject to re-election by rotation by shareholders at least once every three years. 
Copies of the Letters of Appointment for current non-executive directors are available for inspection during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. 
External appointments
The executive directors are restricted under the terms of their Service Agreements from assuming any responsibilities or duties in any person 
without the written Board consent. The Board may agree to such external appointments at its discretion, provided that any such external 
appointments do not and are unlikely to interfere with the executive director’s duties to the Group. 
Malus/clawback provisions
In line with best practice, the committee has the discretion to apply malus/clawback provisions to unvested awards under the VCP and PSP in 
the event an employee is at fault for material misstatement of the financial accounts or is guilty of gross misconduct.

Financial Statements Hurricane Energy plc Annual Report and Group Financial Statements
Year Ended 31 December 2017
Long-term share-based incentives, like the 
VCP adopted by the Company in 2016, are 
designed to incentivise, retain, reward and 
align the interests of executive directors and 
employees with the longer-term interests of 
the Company’s shareholders. The long-term 
incentive plan arrangements for Hurricane 
were reviewed in 2016 using the specialist 
remuneration adviser, Kepler. The Group had 
previously used the 2013 PSP, whereby the 
award of Ordinary Shares to directors and 
staff was conditional on achieving certain 
performance targets linked to the long-term 
success of the business. Following Kepler’s 
advice, in late 2016 the Group introduced 
the VCP, an all employee one-off five-year 
performance period scheme aiming to 
align the interests of all employees with the 
delivery of value to shareholders. The year in 
review was the first full year of the plan.
Value Creation Plan
VCP awards are dependent on share price 
growth, along with the Group achieving 
Milestones, being various key non-market 
based performance conditions consistent 
with the Group’s strategy of progression and 
development of the EPS, each of which has 
a percentage weighting, as set out below. 
The Milestones are one element of the Key 
Performance Indicators used to incentivise 
management and are distinct from within-
year Performance Measures, linked to annual 
bonuses (as explained in the Strategic Report 
on pages 16 and 17).
The scheme only has value to participants 
if the price of Ordinary Shares in Hurricane 
Energy plc exceeds a hurdle price of at least 
£0.55 per share. Furthermore, performance of 
the Group in relation to health, safety and the 
environment, satisfactory total shareholder 
return with reference to the FTSE AIM Oil and 
Gas index, and reputational considerations, 
can modify amounts vesting. The operation 
of the plan is a one-off. It was implemented in 
November 2016 when the Group awarded 840 
Growth Shares in Hurricane Group Limited (a 
Group subsidiary) to executive directors and 
certain employees.
On the completion of each Milestone, the 
committee confirms the degree to which the 
relevant Milestone has been achieved and 
the relevant percentage weighting will be 
banked (but not released), until vesting of the 
scheme. Subject to the conditions outlined 
below, which include achievement of certain 
hurdle prices, vesting will occur at the fifth 
anniversary of the grant (Expiry) or earlier, 
under certain maturity event scenarios. These 
are where there is a change of control of 
Hurricane Energy plc or some other significant 
sale/disposal (Transaction Maturity), or 
achievement of a production target which 
would require additional infrastructure 
beyond the EPS (Production Maturity). 
At the end of the vesting period, the value 
of the Growth Shares will be driven by the 
amount by which the price of Ordinary 
Shares has increased above £0.34 per share 
(the price on date of issue of the Growth 
Shares), as adjusted (Threshold Value). The 
Threshold Value is adjusted for capital raises 
that have occurred during the vesting period. 
The adjustment calculation is based on the 
weighted average price of Ordinary Shares 
issued and is subject always to a floor of 
£0.34 per Ordinary Share. The adjustment 
does not protect participants in the VCP 
from dilution. 
The Growth Shares cannot vest at Expiry or 
upon achievement of Production Maturity 
unless the price of the Ordinary Shares 
exceeds a hurdle of £0.55 per share average 
price for a three-month period beforehand. 
This hurdle was determined by the price that 
would equate to a 10% compound annual 
growth rate in the price of Ordinary Shares 
over the five years of the scheme. In the 
case of a Transaction Maturity event, vesting 
would be subject to a higher hurdle price of 
£0.65 per share.
If the hurdle is met and a vesting occurs, 
the portion of Growth Shares that relate to 
achieved Milestones may be exchanged for 
Ordinary Shares of an amount linked to the 
growth in the price of the issued Ordinary 
Shares above the Threshold Value, multiplied 
by the number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
at the time. The maximum total number 
of Ordinary Shares that could be issued 
in exchange for the 840 Growth Shares 
awarded in 2016 would be broadly equivalent 
to 8.4% of the growth in Hurricane Energy 
plc’s market capitalisation above the market 
capitalisation calculated at the Threshold 
Value. The proportion of Growth Shares 
that vest to participants is dependent on 
the committee certifying, at its discretion, 
the Group having met the Milestones. 
Regardless of Milestone certifications made 
during the term of the VCP, the committee 
has discretion to reduce the value of awards 
made having regard to an assessment of 
satisfactory performance of the Group 
in relation to health, safety, and the 
environment, satisfactory total shareholder 
return performance of the Group with 
reference to the FTSE AIM Oil and Gas index, 
and any other reputational considerations. 
This discretion could be used to reduce the 
awards made down to zero. 
The participants in the scheme had to 
invest into the scheme to participate, risking 
personal funds. If the Milestones and share 
price hurdles are not met, the funds invested 
will be lost in their entirety. 420 VCP Growth 
Shares were granted to executive directors 
of Hurricane, 140 to each of Dr Robert Trice, 
Alistair Stobie and Neil Platt. Further details 
of directors’ awards and share options at the 
beginning and end of the year are outlined in 
the table on page 62.

Performance Share Plan 2017  
(2017 PSP)
In December 2017, the Company introduced 
a new 2017 PSP to award share incentives 
in the form of conditional share awards to 
certain employees (not to those executive 
directors currently participating in the VCP). 
The plan’s purpose is to incentivise, attract 
and retain key new employees crucial to the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy. The PSP has 
performance conditions in line with those of 
the VCP so as to align the interests of these 
new employees to the delivery of value to 
shareholders. The performance conditions 
are linked to key strategic Milestones 
and each has a percentage weighting. 
The committee has discretion to deem 
that performance conditions have been 
achieved, fully or in part, and apply a reduced 
percentage success figure, as with the VCP. 
The number of conditional share awards 
granted to an employee under the new PSP 
is based on the employee’s salary and the 
date of commencement of employment. 
The level of awards granted are calibrated 
to ensure participants do not benefit 
from milestones achieved prior to their 
commencement of employment.
The plan is subject to leaver and malus/
clawback provisions.
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
The Company operates an HMRC-approved 
Share Incentive Plan to encourage and 
deepen share ownership in the Company. 
The plan operates on an annual basis (usually 
in January) whereby it purchases partnership 
shares and grants matching and free 
shares to employees. Global Shares Trustee 
Company Limited are the trustee of the 
Hurricane Energy plc Share Incentive Plan. 
SIP awards are partly satisfied by the issue 
of new Ordinary Shares to the SIP Trustee 
at a subscription price of £0.001 per share, 
being the nominal value of the shares. Each 
participating employee receives an allocation 
of Partnership Shares (being shares acquired 
at market value using contributions deducted 
from employees’ pre-tax salaries), together 
with Matching Shares (being Ordinary Shares 
of twice the number of Partnership Shares 
acquired by an employee which are paid for 
by the Company;) and Free Shares (being 
Ordinary Shares to a value not exceeding 
£3,600 in the tax year, which are paid for 
by the Company). Matching Shares and 
Free Shares awarded within the preceding 
three years will be forfeited by employees 
upon termination of their employment with 
Hurricane, unless the employee is a good 
leaver. Details of SIP share awards to directors 
can be found in the table on page 62.
Performance Share Plan 2013 
(2013 PSP)
In April 2013, all awards under a previous legacy 
long-term incentive plan were surrendered and 
replaced with awards under a new PSP , entitled 
the 2013 PSP . When the Company introduced 
the VCP in 2016 all employees and directors 
who entered into the VCP were required to 
forfeit any 2013 PSP awards. Lapsed awards 
of directors are shown in the directors share 
awards table on page 62. 
A mirror image plan (the Hurricane Energy 
2013 Nominal Cost Option Plan, referred 
to as the “NED Plan”) was also introduced 
at the same time as the 2013 PSP for the 
purpose of enabling conditional awards 
of nil cost options to the Group’s non-
executive directors. This NED Plan operated 
on materially the same terms and conditions 
as the 2013 PSP. However, as the Company 
transitions to a potential Premium Listing 
and is preparing its governance processes 
for such an event, it was believed that these 
awards might hinder the independence of 
the current non-executive directors. On 18 
December both Dr David Jenkins and John 
van der Welle forfeited their awards for nil 
consideration, in order that they could be 
deemed independent under the Code.
The plan is subject to leaver and malus/
clawback provisions.

Financial Statements Hurricane Energy plc Annual Report and Group Financial Statements
Year Ended 31 December 2017
Notes to executive director remuneration charts:
1. Minimum Performance includes only base salary, benefits and cash in lieu of pension.
2.  Bonus cap of 50% is paid under the case where all of the Performance Measures are achieved. Although Performance Measures are set at an ambitious level as a whole, there is no 
level of performance deemed to be on-target for individual measures below the maximum, and there is therefore no ‘on-target’ performance target below the maximum case.
3.  No long-term incentive plan schemes are expected to vest based on performance criteria achievable in 2018. The VCP requires a maturity event, in the form of a Production 
Maturity, Transaction Maturity or Expiry (as described on pages 54 and 55) in order to vest. As at the date of this report the price of Ordinary Shares is also below the hurdle price 
for any vesting to take place. Therefore, the value that would have been included in the chart would be zero. Instead of including a portion of the potential value of the scheme to 
each executive director on this chart, two potential VCP vesting scenarios are laid out below.
Share Option Plan 2011
There remains one legacy share option plan from the pre-IPO period of the Company which was a scheme implemented in 2011. There are no 
intentions to operate this scheme further. Dr Robert Trice participated in this plan and has 225,000 options outstanding at an exercise price 
of £1.00. These options are exercisable from 25 January 2014 to 31 December 2020 although currently they have no intrinsic value. Details of 
these share awards are shown in the directors’ share awards table on page 62.
Amounts executive directors could earn under the Remuneration Policy 
The charts above outline how much the CEO, COO and CFO could earn under the Company’s Remuneration Policy based on their salaries as at 
1 January 2018. 
Example share based payments 
under the Group’s Remuneration 
Policy 
The Group’s VCP and PSP (2013 and 2017) 
schemes are all subject to the same 
share price hurdles and have no value to 
employees below a hurdle price of £0.55 per 
share (or £0.65 per share in the case of an 
early vesting from a Transaction Maturity 
Event). The maximum value to executive 
directors and employees is therefore zero 
at current share prices or using any recent 
average, as required under Companies Act 
illustrations. To demonstrate the potential 
impact to investors of these schemes under 
a scenario where the VCP does have value, 
the directors have chosen to consider two 
hypothetical scenarios where the hurdle 
price is achieved and a vesting therefore 
takes place. 
The first hypothetical scenario assumes 
that the scheme reaches the end of its 
vesting period (in November 2021) with the 
hurdle price of £0.55 per share having been 
achieved for the required period (Expiry). 
Assuming prior exercise of in-the-money 
options and outstanding warrants but no 
exercise of the 2017 Convertible Bond 
(since it matures in July 2022), the total 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding in 
issue would be 1,990,015,948. At £0.55 per 
share, the Company’s market capitalisation 
would be £1,095 million, or £418 million 
over the market capitalisation calculated 
at the Threshold Value for the VCP (which 
is linked to £0.34 per share). Without a 
Maturity Event, the maximum vesting based 
on Milestone scoring to date would be 
65%. Subject to committee discretion on 
Total Shareholder Return, health, safety and 
environment performance, and reputational 
considerations, in this scenario a maximum 
of 41 million Ordinary Shares would be 
issuable under the VCP and 17 million would 
be issuable under the PSPs. This would result 
in total Ordinary Shares outstanding being 
2,048,964,926. Total shares issued under the 
VCP and PSP would represent around 2.9% 
of the total Ordinary Shares outstanding 
in issue. The value of the Ordinary Shares 
issued to each executive director in this 
hypothetical scenario would be £4 million.
The second hypothetical scenario assumes a 
Transaction Maturity event, such as a change 
of control transaction, were to take place 
on 10 April 2018 (the date of release of our 
annual results), at precisely the hurdle price 
of 65p. To demonstrate a maximum possible 
pay-out in this scenario, we have assumed 
prior exercise of all in-the-money options, 
outstanding warrants, and have assumed 
conversion of the Convertible Bond at the 
adjusted change of control conversion 
price. Under these circumstances, the total 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding in 
issue would be 2,527,155,766. A transaction 
as described above at £0.65 per share would 
therefore value the Company’s ordinary 
shares at £1,643 million, or £783 million over 
the threshold value for the VCP. Subject to 
Remuneration Committee discretion on 
Total Shareholder Return, health, safety 
and environmental performance, and 
reputational considerations, in this scenario 
a maximum of 101 million Ordinary Shares 
would be issuable under the VCP and 30 
million would be issuable under the PSPs. 
This would result in total Ordinary Shares 
outstanding being 2,658,068,617. Total 
shares issued under the VCP and PSP would 
represent around 4.9% of the total Ordinary 
Shares outstanding in issue. The value of the 
Ordinary Shares issued to each executive 
director in this hypothetical scenario would 
be £11 million.
Consideration of employment 
conditions elsewhere in  
the Company
The Company does not consult with 
employees on executive remuneration. The 
size and scope of Hurricane’s operations at 
this stage in its development would make 
any consultation process ineffective. As 
Hurricane develops and should it attain a 
potential Premium Listing, the committee will 
continue to keep this matter under review 
and consider adopting appropriate policies 
to address this matter. 
Differences in Remuneration Policy 
for executive directors compared 
to other employees
The Company has developed a remuneration 
policy for all employees which incentivises 
everyone to deliver on the key strategic 
milestones and create value for all 
shareholders. The level of reward and variable 
pay that can be achieved by the executive 
directors and certain key senior managers 
is commensurate with their roles and 
responsibilities as this group has the greatest 
potential to influence the Milestones of the 
VCP . Furthermore, all employees are invited to 
participate in the SIP 
Recruitment Policy including 
executive directors
Due to the size and scope of Hurricane, 
the committee to date does not operate 
a formal recruitment policy, instead it 
addresses the recruitment of key personnel 
to fulfil key roles, including those at 
Board-level, on a case by case basis. The 
Remuneration Policy for executive directors, 
as outlined in this report, is the basis upon 
which future Board-level recruitment will 
be considered. As the Company matures 
and develops, such a policy will be further 
developed and implemented as appropriate.
Dilution
The Company has, at all times, complied with 
the dilution limit contained within the rules 
of each share plan (principally an aggregate 
limit of 10% of the issued share capital of 
the Company in any 10-year period), and 
the committee reviews the position before 
any proposed grant to ensure this limit is not 
breached. Existing share options and PSP 
awards granted under the Company’s share 
option and PSP schemes to date equated to 
less than 0.4% of the current issued Ordinary 
Shares of the Company at the end of the 
year in review (2016: 0.8%). As outlined 
above, the VCP is structured so that it cannot 
lead to dilution of greater than 8.4% upon 
successful vesting. Therefore, taken together, 
all of the Company’s share schemes remain 
within the 10% limit. 
Shareholder views
The Company has not, to date, sought formal 
shareholder approval for its Remuneration 
Policy. However, the committee is committed 
to shareholder dialogue and will endeavour 
to meet with shareholders as appropriate 
to address any issues that may arise. During 
the year, the Chairman of the committee 
spoke with a number of major shareholders in 
relation to the Remuneration Policy.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
This section of the report has been prepared on a voluntary basis to be consistent with the Remuneration Reports prepared by Premium Listed 
companies. The sections of the Annual Report on Remuneration that are subject to audit are indicated accordingly. 
Remuneration Committee composition
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Dr David Jenkins. During the year, the committee was also comprised of John van der Welle, Dr 
Robert Arnott and Roy Kelly. Dr Robert Arnott ceased to be a member upon his resignation on 8 November 2017. Roy Kelly stepped down as 
a committee member on 17 December 2017. Roy Kelly, Kerogen’s shareholder nominee director, was a committee member in accordance 
with the Kerogen Relationship Deed, dated 18 April 2016 (Kerogen being the Company’s largest shareholder). As the Company is looking to 
potentially transition to a Premium Listing and as part of the governance enhancements, Kerogen agreed to amend its Relationship Deed 
during the year and this was the reason for the change in composition of the committee. 
The Company Secretary services the committee as required by the Chairman of the committee.
Currently the composition of the committee does not conform to the provisions of the Code. This is a temporary situation. When Dr David 
Jenkins stepped up to be Interim Chairman on 8 November 2017, he was not considered independent on appointment under the Code, 
therefore leaving at present only one independent director on the committee (John van der Welle). As announced on 17 January 2018, 
this situation will be resolved upon the appointment of a new independent Company Chairman and the subsequent appointment of new 
independent non-executive directors who will join the committee as appropriate. Upon the appointment of the new Chairman, Dr David 
Jenkins will revert to his role of Senior Independent director and be deemed fully independent under the Code, therefore, the committee 
will be made up of fully independent directors.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Annual Report on Remuneration
Role
The committee’s primary objective is to ensure that reward packages for executive directors and key senior management are competitive in 
order to attract and retain the best talents to deliver the Group’s strategic priorities and ensure that these reward packages are directly linked 
to the achievement of performance targets in pursuit of the strategy and align the interests of the directors with those of shareholders. 
The committee determines the framework and policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and is responsible for reviewing 
them annually for appropriateness and relevance. It is also responsible for determining the specific elements of the executive directors’ 
remuneration, their contractual terms and their compensation arrangements. The committee’s terms of reference are available on the website 
at www.hurricaneenergy.com. Under the work of the Listing and Governance Committee these terms of reference were reviewed at the end 
of 2017 to ensure that they continue to be fit for purpose for the Company, meet best practice and aid the transition of the Company to a 
possible Premium Listing.
Independent advisers
The committee in the past has been advised by external advisors, Kepler – specialist remuneration consultants (now part of Mercer), Dentons , 
and Grant Thornton. During the year, advice was given on the introduction of the SIP and on the VCP and 2017 PSP by Kepler and by Dentons. 
Of these advisers only Dentons provide other services, being the Solicitors to the Company.

How the Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2017
During 2017, the remuneration packages for the executive directors consisted of a basic competitive salary, benefits, an annual bonus scheme 
and participation in a long-term incentive plan, being the VCP and the Company’s SIP.
Salary
Basic annual salaries are reviewed annually by the committee and for the year in review (2017) were: Dr Robert Trice (£375,000), Neil Platt 
(£275,000) and Alistair Stobie (£275,000). 
The committee is of the view that in each case basic salary levels reflect the competitive market level for the role and the specialist skillset  
and individual’s contribution. A detailed table of remuneration for all directors (single figure remuneration) is outlined on page 61.
Benefits and pension 
Hurricane offers a typical voluntary package of benefits to directors and employees including optional enrolment in healthcare, dental and 
travel insurance, death in service and critical illness plans. There is no variation across employees.
In 2017, Hurricane contributed to personal pension schemes for all employees. Executive directors currently receive a cash allowance in lieu  
of pension. Hurricane contributes up to 10% of employees’ salaries, provided that they make a 4% contribution.
Annual bonus 
The maximum 2017 annual cash bonus that could be earned by executive directors was 50% of basic salary. The committee, having considered 
the 2017 Corporate Scorecard and KPI targets, awarded 41.25% of basic salary as a cash bonus to each executive director for 2017. The extent 
of achievement for all executive directors against their performance scorecard is detailed below.
Performance Measures for the annual bonus award
The committee agrees an annual balanced Corporate Scorecard of Performance Measures and target weightings. The scorecard is designed 
so as not to overlap with the Milestones of the VCP which represent longer-term strategic value-generating events. The metrics chosen aim 
to underpin the Company’s operational success in the chosen year and include performance measures in the following key areas: HSSE&Q; 
Operations; Subsurface Drilling Strategy; Financial, Investor Relations; and Corporate. The relative weightings outlined below apply to all 
executive directors and there are no individual ratings. A maximum score of 100% equates to a bonus of 50% of salary. The committee  
has discretion to over-ride the rating in its entirety, in the event of a significant HSSE incident such as a fatality.

Payments for loss of office
There were no payments for loss of office in 2017. Dr Robert Arnott who resigned on 8 November 2017 received pay in lieu of notice in 
accordance with his Letter of Appointment.
Non-executive directors’ remuneration
The fees payable to the non-executive directors are determined by the Board, taking into account the time commitment required, the 
responsibilities assumed and comparative market rates. No director plays a part in any discussion about their own remuneration. At the end

Performance graph
The graph below illustrates the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance compared with the FTSE AIM Oil & Gas index, since 
IPO. The index was selected because it is considered to be an appropriate index for relevant sectoral comparison and is the basis of the TSR 
performance component of the VCP.
Relative Importance of CEO’s pay
The relative change in the Chief Executive Officer’s pay, relative to employees as a whole, is outlined in the table below:
Change in Pay 2016-17
Salary & fees Taxable benefits Annual bonus
CEO -% (19%) (50%)
Employees 29% 1% (38%)
Note: The salary of the CEO was unchanged 2016-17, though his taxable benefits changed due to a change in policy options and his annual bonus was reduced in line with the new 
50% cap being applied.

The Group did not make any distributions to shareholders during the period under review. 
Implementation of Remuneration Policy for 2018
The committee has reviewed the base salary levels for the executive directors and determined that for 2018 (the forthcoming year) no 
increases will be made. The maximum annual bonus award will remain at 50% of base salary and there will be no changes to other benefits nor 
pension arrangements. For 2018, the committee will operate a similar scorecard for executive directors’ bonuses to that used for 2017, with 
slightly different weighting across categories. There are no specific on-target levels. See page 60 for the relevant weightings.
Other Remuneration Report matters 
The closing mid-market price for an Ordinary Share in the Company on 31 December 2017 was £0.31/share, and during the year the share price 
ranged from £0.24/share to £0.67/share.
Statement of voting 
As an AIM quoted company, Hurricane has not to date put its Remuneration Report nor Remuneration Policy to a shareholder vote in general 
meeting. The Company does not plan to do so at its forthcoming AGM in 2018, whilst it continues to transition and enhance its corporate 
governance. The committee believes that these governance enhancements should be achieved by the end of 2018 and the Company will be 
able to review this matter in 2019, as it seeks to achieve compliance.
This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 9 April 2018 and signed on its behalf by:
Dr David Jenkins

Disclosure of information to the

In the case of each person who was a 
director at the time this report was approved: 
so far as that director was aware there was 
no relevant information of which the Group’s 
auditor was unaware; and that director had 
taken all steps that the director ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself 
or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s 
auditor was aware of that information. 
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions 
of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare Financial Statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have also chosen 
to prepare the Parent Company Financial 
Statements under IFRSs as adopted by 
the EU. Under company law the directors 
must not approve the Financial Statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 requires 
that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users 
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the Financial Statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ Report
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.

the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We confirm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed entities were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Summary of our audit approach
Key audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Recoverability of the Lancaster field; 
• Recoverability of Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) assets; and
• Convertible bond accounting 
Materiality The materiality that we used for the group financial statements was $10 million which was determined  
on the basis of 1.5% of group net assets.
Scoping We have performed a full scope audit of all material balances within the group. All the work was 
performed by the Deloitte London group audit team.
Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability 
to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that statement required by Listing Rule 
9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the knowledge we obtained in the 
course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, we are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 18 to 21 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
•  the directors’ confirmation on page 18 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on page 23 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and 
why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We confirm that we have nothing material to report, add or draw attention to in respect of these matters.

70 71 70 71 Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of  
the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,  
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Recoverability of the Lancaster field
Key audit matter 
description
During the year, the Lancaster field was reclassified from Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) assets to Property, Plant & Equipment 
(PP&E), following the approval of the Field Development Plan ‘FDP’ in September 2017. Under IFRS 6 “Exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral resources”, an impairment test is required, using the principles of IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”, at the 
point an E&E asset is reclassified to PP&E.
The carrying value of the Lancaster field at the point it was reclassified to PP&E was $336 million. This is considered a key audit 
matter due to the significant judgements and estimates involved in the impairment calculation. Due to the importance of the 
Lancaster field to the group and the judgemental nature of the impairment assessment, we have determined that there was a 
potential for fraud through possible manipulation of this balance. 
In order to assess whether an impairment was required, management calculated the carrying value per barrel of oil equivalent 
(boe) of the Lancaster field, based on 2P and 2C reserves and resources. This figure was then compared with the prices paid per 
boe for what management considered to be relevant deals in the offshore European upstream oil & gas market during the last 
10 years, again based on both 2P and 2C reserves and resources. The deal data for this analysis was provided by an independent 
data provider. This “comparable market transactions” approach indicated that the average value paid for the selected deals was 
in excess of the carrying value per boe of Lancaster. On this basis, management concluded that the fair value of the Lancaster 
field was in excess of its carrying value and hence that no impairment charge was required.
Further details of the approach adopted by management in this area are provided in note 3 and 11 of the financial statements 
and in the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman’s Report on pages 45 to 48.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our procedures included : 
• re-performance of management’s “comparable market transactions” fair value assessment, including testing of the input 
data used by management from the independent data provider;
• confirmation that this test indicated an average deal value in excess of the carrying value per boe of the Lancaster field; and
• assessment of the independence and objectivity of the independent data provider.
As a further challenge of management’s impairment assessment we estimated the value in use of the Lancaster field as at 
September 2017 based solely on the 2P reserves associated with the Early Production System (EPS). In order to do this, we 
obtained management’s discounted cash flow model for the Greater Lancaster Area and adjusted it to exclude all cash inflows 
and outflows that are not directly associated with the assumed six-year term of the EPS. We also performed the following 
procedures on the resulting cash flow model :
• compared the assumed oil price in the model with third party forecasts and publicly available forward curves;
• compared the total forecast production with the report of the company’s independent reservoir engineer;
• communicated directly with the independent reservoir engineer to discuss and assess their scope of work, expertise and 
objectivity;
• benchmarked the post tax nominal discount rate of 10% utilised in management’s model with the discount rate adopted by  
a selection of the company’s peer group;
• assessed management’s other assumptions by reference to third party information and our knowledge of the group and  
the industry; and
• tested the cash flow model for mechanical accuracy.
Key observations We are satisfied that no impairment was required upon the reclassification of the Lancaster field to PP&E in September 2017.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
Recoverability of Exploration and Evaluation assets
Key audit matter 
description
The total value of the group’s E&E assets at 31 December 2017 was $126.4 million. In accordance with relevant accounting 
standards, E&E assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. This is considered a key audit matter due to the significant 
judgements that are required, which include the effect of the significant and prolonged fall in oil prices on the viability of these 
E&E projects.
Management assessed whether there are any indicators of impairment of the group’s E&E assets by reference to IFRS 6 
“Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources”. Such indicators include 
• The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has expired;
• Substantive expenditure on further exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area is neither 
budgeted nor planned;
• Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable 
quantities of mineral resources and the entity has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; or
• Sufficient data exist to indicate that, although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of 
the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.
As disclosed in note 12 of the financial statements, during the year an impairment charge of $8.4 million was recorded in 
respect of the Typhoon and Tempest licences following a decision to relinquish the licence at the end of its term. Management 
has also recorded a charge of $2.0 million to fully impair the Strathmore asset as substantive expenditure on this asset is neither 
budgeted nor planned. 
Further details of the approach adopted by management in this area are provided in note 3 and 12 of the financial statements 
and in the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman’s Report on pages 45 to 48.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our procedures included : 
• Participating in meetings with key operational and finance staff to understand the current status and future intentions for 
each asset; 
• Assessing whether all assets which remain capitalised are included in future budgets and, if they are not, understanding the 
basis by which management anticipate being able to recover the amounts that have been capitalised; and
• Identifying any fields where the Group’s licences are at or close to expiry and challenging management’s intention and ability 
to renew any such license.
Key observations We are satisfied that it is appropriate to fully impair the Tempest / Typhoon and Strathmore assets. We are also satisfied 
that there are no impairment indicators for the remainder of the group’s E&E assets. We highlight however that successful 
development of these assets is dependent on additional (currently uncommitted) funding being received.

72 73 72 73 Convertible bond accounting
Key audit matter 
description
In July 2017, the parent company raised $230 million (before expenses) from the successful placement of convertible bonds. 
The conversion feature of the bonds has been classified as an embedded derivative and measured at fair value through profit 
and loss. The difference between the fair value of the proceeds received and the fair value of the embedded derivative has 
been recognised as a debt component which is recognised at amortised cost.
The accounting for the convertible bonds, including the associated valuation of the embedded derivative, is considered a key 
audit matter due to the complexity of the accounting rules in this area and the judgements that need to be applied in assessing 
the appropriate valuation of the conversion feature. The valuation was based on a simulation model with a number of input 
assumptions, of which the most judgemental was share price volatility.
Further details of the approach adopted by management in this area are provided in notes 3, 18 and 24 of the financial 
statements and in the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman’s Report on pages 45 to 48.
How the scope of our 
audit responded to the 
key audit matter
Our procedures included : 
• tracing the bond receipts and related transaction costs to bank statements; 
• reading the convertible bond terms and confirming that it is appropriate to account for the conversion feature as an 
embedded derivative at fair value through profit and loss, with the residual balance accounted for as a host debt contract  
at amortised cost;
• using our internal valuation specialists to test the valuation of the embedded derivative, including confirming the 
appropriateness of the simulation model and the reasonableness of volatility and other key input assumptions; and
• testing the calculation of the residual host debt component. 
Key observations • We are satisfied that the accounting treatment of the convertible bond is in accordance with the relevant accounting rules 
and that the valuation of the associated embedded derivative due to the conversion feature is reasonable.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Parent company financial statements
Materiality $10 million $7.8 million
Basis for determining materiality 1.5% of net assets 1.5% of net assets
Rationale for the benchmark applied The nature of Hurricane as a pre-production 
upstream business means that the group is not 
revenue generating. We have therefore concluded 
that net assets represents the most appropriate 
benchmark which reflects the long-term value of 
the group through its portfolio of exploration and 
development stage assets and their associated 
reserves and contingent resources. 
As the primary nature of the parent company is to 
hold investments in subsidiaries as well as to raise 
debt and equity financing, we have concluded that 
net assets is the most appropriate benchmark.
Independent Auditor’s Report continued
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $0.5 million as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee 
on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. All significant elements of the group’s finance and accounting function are situated and 
managed centrally in the UK, and operate under one common internal control environment; all operations of the group are also managed 
from this location. Accordingly, we concluded that the group’s business represented a single component and therefore all operations of the 
group were subject to a full scope audit.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other 
than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether 
the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to 
be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material 
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information 
include where we conclude that:
Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial statements 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
Audit Committee reporting – the section describing the work of the Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters communicated 
by us to the Audit Committee; or
Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required under the 
Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions specified for review by 
the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

74 75 74 75 Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors 
either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and of the parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by our engagement letter
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 that would have applied were the company a quoted company. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 
Annual improvements to IFRS: 2014-2016 cycle 
Annual improvements to IFRS: 2015-2017 cycle 
Amendments to IFRS 2: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions 
Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ with IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
Amendments to IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures 
Amendments to IAS 40: Transfers of Investment Property 
Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
The above are not expected to have a material impact upon adoption.
The following additional standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ 
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ 
These standards have been considered in turn below:
1.1.1 IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS 9 will supersede IAS 39 in its entirety and is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2018. For Hurricane 
Energy plc, the effective date is the year commencing 1 January 2018. Any changes to recognition and measurement will be applied 
retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time. There is no requirement to restate comparative amounts. 
The core areas addressed within IFRS 9 are as follows: 
• Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities 
• Impairment of financial assets 
• Hedge accounting 
The Group does not expect any material changes in relation to the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities, 
impairment of financial assets or for hedge accounting other than additional disclosure requirements (as at the transition date the Group 
does not have any hedge accounting in place).

1.1. New and revised standards: International Financial Reporting Standards continued
1.1.2 IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue’ will replace IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’ for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2018. For Hurricane Energy plc, the effective date is the year commencing 1 January 2018. Any changes to recognition and measurement will 
be applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at that time. There is no requirement to restate comparative amounts. The 
core principle of the standard is that an entity will recognise revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects 
to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. 
To apply this principle, entities must follow the five-step model below: 
1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer – written, oral or implied by an entity’s customary business practices. 
2.  Identify the performance obligations in the contract(s) – evaluate the terms in the contract to identify all the promised goods or services 
and then determine which of these will be treated as separate performance obligations. They are separate if the customer can benefit 
from the good or service on its own (i.e. it is distinct). 
3.  Determine the transaction price – the amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to a 
customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. 
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations – generally in proportion to their stand-alone selling prices. 
5.  Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance – when control of a promised good or service transfers to the customer. 
The Group has performed an impact assessment during the year regarding the accounting requirements of IFRS 15. As the Group has not 
previously had any revenue there will no impact on adoption of the standard. 
1.1.3 IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ will replace IAS 17 ‘Leases’ for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2019. For Hurricane Energy plc the 
effective date is the year commencing 1 January 2019. The core principal of the standard is to provide a single lessee accounting model, 
requiring lessees to recognise a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases unless the term is less than 12 months or the underlying asset 
has a low value. IFRS 16’s approach to lessor accounting is mostly unchanged from IAS 17. 
The transition to IFRS 16 will have a material impact on the Balance Sheet as all operating leases will need to be recognised on the balance 
sheet. Furthermore, operating lease expense in the income statement will be replaced with depreciation and interest expense. The Group has 
performed an impact assessment to determine which current leases and which anticipated future leases would be affected by this transition.
The primary objectives of this assessment are to: define accounting policies in compliance with the standard; identify all existing leases within 
the Group; identify anticipated future leases within the Group; capture the necessary data for each lease, including discount rates; determine a 
transition approach; and understand and implement necessary system and operational changes. 
The Group is currently in the process of developing updated accounting policies and is assessing the information requirements for each lease. 
The Group currently plans to adopt the cumulative catch-up transition approach. As such, the value of the asset and liability recognised will 
be determined by the present value of the future lease payments on the existing leases at the date of transition (1 January 2019). The Group 
currently anticipates that the impact at the point of adoption of the standard is likely to be material as it will bring a Right of Use asset and 
liability for the Aoka Mizu FPSO and office properties onto the Balance Sheet. Further quantitative information cannot be provided at this time 
as the Group is continuing with its detailed assessment.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies
2.1. Basis of accounting
The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for share-based payments and certain financial 
instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), and in accordance with the 
requirements of the AIM Rules.
2.2. Change in functional and presentation currency
These consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars. On 1 January 2017, the functional currency of Hurricane Energy plc and 
Hurricane Exploration (UK) Limited changed from Pounds Sterling to US Dollars. This change was triggered by the intention to proceed with 
the Early Production System in 2017 which would lead to an increased level of expenditure being incurred in US Dollars and ultimately the 
receipt of revenues which are expected to be almost exclusively in US Dollars.
On 1 January 2017, the presentation currency of Hurricane Energy plc and Hurricane Exploration (UK) Limited was also changed from Pounds 
Sterling to US Dollars.
The change in presentation currency is to better reflect the Group’s business activities and to improve investors’ ability to compare 
the Company’s financial results with other publicly traded businesses in the oil and gas industry. In making this change to the US Dollar 
presentation currency, the Company followed the guidance in IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and have applied 
the change retrospectively. For the 2016 comparative balances, assets and liabilities have been restated into the presentation currency 
(US Dollars) at the rate of exchange prevailing at the respective Balance Sheet date, with equity balances restated at historical rates on 
the date of issue of said equity instrument. The comparative income statements and cash flow statements were restated at the average 
exchange rates for the reporting period. The average rates for the reporting period approximated the exchange rates as at the date of 
the transactions. Exchange differences arising on translation were taken to the foreign exchange reserve in shareholders’ equity. The 
Company has presented a third statement of financial position as at 1 January 2016 in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes 
in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The resulting effect of the change in presentation currency of $92,659,000 on the comparative figures 
is reflected in the foreign exchange reserve.
Exchange rates used USD / GBP
Year ending 31 December 2016 average rate 1.355
Spot rate at 1 January 2016 1.480
Spot rate at 31 December 2016 1.234
2.3. Going concern
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting. The use of this basis of accounting 
takes into consideration the Group’s current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the going concern 
section of the Directors’ Report and within the Group’s Strategic Report on page 22.
2.4. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
On an acquisition that qualifies as a business combination, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are measured at their fair value as at the 
date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill. 
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the Income Statement in 
the period of acquisition. All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

2.5. Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount 
of revenue can be measured reliably. Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the 
effective interest rate applicable.
2.6. Commercial reserves
Commercial reserves are proved and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and 
natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable 
in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered to be economically viable. Proved and probable reserve estimates are based 
on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are 
inherently uncertain. There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the 
amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less. However, the amount of reserves that 
will be ultimately recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the field’s life.
2.7. Intangible exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and evaluation activities (intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets) as permitted by IFRS 6 ‘Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’.
Pre licence costs, which relate to costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal right to explore an area, are charged directly to the Income 
Statement within operating expenses as they are incurred.
Once a licence has been awarded, all licence fees, exploration and appraisal costs relating to that licence are initially capitalised in well, field 
or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate pending determination. Expenditure incurred during the various exploration and appraisal 
phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not been completed.
When commercial reserves have been found, the net capitalised costs incurred to date in respect of those reserves are transferred into a 
single field cost centre and reclassified as oil and gas properties within Property, plant and equipment (subject to an impairment assessment 
before reclassification). Subsequent development costs in respect of the reserves are capitalised within oil and gas properties.
If there are indications of impairment, an impairment test is performed comparing the carrying value with its recoverable amount, being the 
higher of value-in-use (calculated as the estimated discounted future cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas 
prices and future costs) and its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Costs which are initially capitalised and subsequently written off are 
classified as operating expenses. 
2.8. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
2.8.1. Oil and gas properties – cost
Oil and gas properties are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves 
discovered and bringing them into production, together with the intangible exploration and evaluation asset expenditures incurred in finding 
commercial reserves transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
The cost of oil and gas properties also includes the cost of directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of 
recognising provision for, future restoration and decommissioning.
2.8.2. Oil and gas properties – depreciation
Oil and gas properties are depreciated from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis. This is the ratio of oil and gas 
production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period, plus the production in the period, on a 
field by field basis. Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net carrying amount of capitalised costs, taking into account 
future development expenditures necessary to bring the reserves into production.
2.8.3. Other fixed assets
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas properties is depreciated so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of the 
asset on a straight line basis over their useful lives of between two and five years.
Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued
2.8.4. Impairment
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying 
value of an oil and gas property may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the 
future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. The cash-generating unit applied for impairment test 
purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash-generating unit where the cash inflows 
of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement. Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the 
impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the Income Statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
2.9. Inventory
Inventory is comprised of materials and equipment that are acquired for future use. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value, cost being determined on an average cost basis.
2.10. Decommissioning provisions
Provisions for decommissioning are recognised in full when wells have been suspended or facilities have been installed. A corresponding 
amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas exploration and evaluation expenditure.  
The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted to its net present value, and is reassessed each year in 
accordance with local conditions and requirements. Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost 
estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision, and a corresponding adjustment to the related asset. 
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning provision is included as a finance cost.
2.11. Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated into US Dollars at the exchange rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the Income 
Statement. All operating entities within the Group have a US Dollar functional currency. The dormant or holding entities have a Pound Sterling 
functional currency.
2.12. Taxation
Current and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas corporation tax, are provided at amounts expected to be paid using the 
tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in respect of temporary differences using a Balance Sheet liability method. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are recorded for all temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values 
for financial reporting purposes, except in relation to goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset as a transaction other than a business 
combination. A deferred tax asset is recorded only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deferred tax asset will be realised or if it can be offset against existing deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
2.13. Share-based payments
The cost of equity settled share-based employee compensation arrangements is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the Income 
Statement. The total expense to be apportioned over the vesting period of the benefit is determined by reference to the fair value (excluding 
the effect of non market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant.
The assumptions underlying the number of awards expected to vest are subsequently adjusted for the effects of non market based vesting to 
reflect the conditions prevailing at the Balance Sheet date. Fair value is measured by the use of statistical models. The expected vesting period 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of the non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations.

2.14. Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
2.14.1 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and cash with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash with three months or less remaining to maturity from the date of acquisition and that are subject to an insignificant 
risk of change in value. Cash held in escrow is for future expected costs associated with the Group’s decommissioning obligations or is held 
only to be dispersed to the benefit of independent third parties for work undertaken as part of the Group’s operations. Cash is also held in 
escrow as part of the terms of the Convertible Bond. The escrow contains sufficient funds to cover the first two years of coupon payments.
2.14.2 Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
2.14.3 Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss (“FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities.
2.14.4 Financial liabilities at FVTPL
Financial liabilities are classified at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated at FVTPL. A financial liability is 
classified as held for trading if it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement recognised in profit or loss. The net  
gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability..
2.14.5 Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the 
relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the 
financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
2.14.6 Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
2.14.7 Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Where warrants are granted in conjunction with other equity instruments, which themselves meet the definition of equity, they are recorded 
at their fair value, which is measured by the use of an appropriate valuation model. Warrants which do not meet the definition of equity are 
classified as derivative financial instruments.
2.14.8 Compound instruments
The component parts of compound instruments issued by the Group are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
If the conversion feature meets the definition of equity, the fair value of the liability component is estimated at the date of issue using the 
prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using 
the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date. The equity component is determined 
by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised and 
included in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently remeasured.
If the conversion feature of a convertible bond issued does not meet the definition of an equity instrument, it is classified as an embedded 
derivative and measured accordingly. The debt component of the instrument is determined by deducting the fair value of the conversion 
option at inception from the fair value of the consideration received for the instrument as a whole. This amount (the debt component) 
is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest rate method until extinguished upon conversion or at the 
instrument’s maturity date.
2.14.9 Embedded derivatives
Derivatives embedded in financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
2.14.10 Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each Balance Sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
2.15. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added 
to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, i.e. when they are capable of 
commercial production. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using 
a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised 
in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
2.16. Operating leases
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not 
made on such a basis.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only the period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors have 
made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the 
Financial Statements.
3.1. Convertible Bond accounting treatment
In July 2017 the Group issued $230 million in convertible bonds. In accounting for the Convertible Bond, management were required to make 
a judgement relating as to whether to the Convertible Bond contained an embedded derivative and whether there was a requirement to split 
that embedded derivative out and recognise it separately. 
Management determined that the Convertible Bond contained an embedded derivative, being the conversion feature that was not closely 
related to the host debt and therefore should be considered separately. The host debt has been accounted for at amortised cost with 
the embedded derivative being valued at fair value through the profit and loss account (FVTPL). Details of the Convertible Bond and the 
embedded derivative can be seen in notes 18 and 24 respectively.
3.2. Lancaster impairment testing
In September 2017 the Group received field development plan approval for the EPS. At this point the Lancaster assets were reclassified from 
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets to Property, plant and equipment. As per IFRS 6, it was necessary to carry out an impairment 
test of the assets being reclassified to determine whether an impairment was required. This required management making a judgement as to 
the fair value of the assets at that point in time. This assessment was carried out by calculating the carrying value per barrel of oil equivalent 
(boe) of the Lancaster Field, based on 2P Reserves and 2C Contingent Resources. This figure was then compared with the prices paid per 
boe for relevant deals in the offshore European upstream oil & gas market during the last 10 years, again based on both 2P Reserves and 2C 
Contingent Resources. Based on this assessment, management determined that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value and 
therefore no impairment was required.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Balance Sheet date that may have a significant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

3.3. Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation assets
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed 
its recoverable value. This assessment involves judgement as to: (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset having regard to licence terms 
and the Group’s plans for further exploration and evaluation activities, (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to the asset in question to the 
extent there is sufficient information to estimate these, and (iii) the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of 
deriving a recoverable value. The variety of judgements involved make it impractical to provide sensitivity analysis on one single measure and 
its potential impact on the recoverable amount.
Note 12 discloses the carrying values and any impairments of the Group’s intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
3.4. Valuation of Convertible Bond embedded derivative
Valuation of the embedded derivative that is contained with the Convertible Bond requires a number of estimates, the most significant of 
which is the assumed volatility of the Hurricane Energy plc share price over the expected life of the Convertible Bond. Details of the fair value 
calculations and related sensitivities for the embedded derivative can be seen in note 24.
4. Operating segments
The Group complies with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, which requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports 
about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance.
In the opinion of the directors, the operations of the Group comprise one class of business, being oil and gas exploration and development 
together with related activities in only one geographical area, the UK Continental Shelf.

payable tax credit. $0.9 million of the research and development tax credit was received in cash during that year, relating to the 2013 claim. 
The remaining $5.8 million relating to the 2014 claim was received in February 2017.
9.1. Factors which may affect future tax charges
Following receipt of FDP approval in respect of the EPS in September 2017, for tax purposes, the Group is considered to have commenced 
trading. This has crystallised the pre-trading revenue expenses of $21.6 million (2016: $23.9 million), covering the period from 2011 onwards, 
and pre-trading capital expenditure of $191.1 million (2016: $257.1 million) which was available for tax relief on commencement of a 
petroliferous trade for UK tax purposes. Additional pre-trading capital expenditure of $83.5 million is carried forward at 31 December 2017 
and tax relief will be available once the FDP approval is received on the remaining licences.
The Group has trading losses of $393.6 million at 31 December 2017, which have no expiry date and would be available for offset against 
future trading profits. A potential Ring Fence Expenditure Supplement claim could also be made for this period which would result in 
additional trading losses of $65 million.

Deferred tax liability – –
Tax losses of $353.2 million have been offset against deferred tax liabilities primarily related to fixed assets. A potential deferred tax asset of 
$16.1 million (2016: $12.4 million) on remaining losses of $40.4 million has not been recognised. It has been concluded that it is not appropriate 
to recognise any of this unrecognised potential deferred tax asset until the EPS has begun production and hence demonstrated an ability to 
generate taxable profits. The potential deferred tax asset is calculated at the UK ring-fence tax rate of 40% (2016: 40%).
Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were announced in the Chancellor’s budget on 8 July 2015. These include reduction to the main rate 
to reduce the corporate tax rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020. At budget 2016, the government announced a further 
reduction to the Corporation tax main rate for the year starting 1 April 2020, setting the rate at 17%. The rate was substantively enacted 
on 6 September 2016. Accordingly, the effect of this change has been reflected in the Financial Statements and the deferred tax liability in 
relation to the fair value movement on the derivative is being recognised at 17%.
10. Earnings per share
The basic and diluted (loss) / earnings per share has been calculated using the loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 of $7 ,004,000 (2016: 
profit for the year of $901,000). The loss per share is calculated using a weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue less treasury shares.

Property, plant and equipment (other fixed assets) comprises the Group’s investment in leasehold improvements, fixtures, office equipment 
and computer hardware. In 2017 $nil (2016: $58,000) of depreciation has been capitalised into the Group’s intangible exploration and 
evaluation expenditure in accordance with the Group’s overhead allocation policy. 
On 24 September 2017 approval was granted for the EPS field development. As a result, $335,856,000 of intangible exploration and evaluation 
assets were reclassified as property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation of the oil and gas properties will commence once production begins and will be on a unit of production (UOP) basis.
Included within additions is $6,039,000 of borrowing costs that have been capitalised in the year (see note 18).
Included within transfer from intangible assets is $4,409,000 of borrowing costs that were previously capitalised within intangible exploration 
and evaluation assets.

Intangible exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises the book cost of licence interests and exploration and evaluation expenditure 
within the Group’s licensed acreage in the West of Shetland.
On 24 September 2017 approval was granted for the EPS field development. As a result, $335,856,000 of intangible assets were reclassified as 
Oil and Gas properties in property, plant and equipment.
Included within additions, and also within the transfer to property, plant and equipment, is $4,409,000 of borrowing costs that have been 
capitalised in the year (see note 18).
The directors have fully considered and reviewed the potential value of licence interests, including carried forward exploration and evaluation 
expenditure. The directors have considered the Group’s tenure to its licence interests, its plans for further exploration and evaluation activities 
in relation to these and the likely opportunities for realising the value of the Group’s licences, either by farm-out or by development of the 
assets. Given the Group’s focus on its Rona Ridge assets, and the fact that it has no current plans to drill on its Strathmore prospect in the near 
future, the directors have fully impaired the intangible exploration and evaluation assets relating to Strathmore, being $1,971,000.
On the 8 December 2017 the Group relinquished its P1485 and P1835 licences (Typhoon and Tempest). As such the intangible exploration and 
evaluation assets relating to those licences of $8,441,000 have been fully written off.

Year Ended 31 December 2017
94 95 94 95 18. Borrowings
In July 2017 the Group raised $230 million (gross) from the successful placement of the Convertible Bond. The Convertible Bond was issued at 
par and carries a coupon of 7.5% payable quarterly in arrears. The Convertible Bond is convertible into fully paid Ordinary Shares with the initial 
conversion price set at $0.52, representing a 25% premium above the placing price of the concurrent equity placement, being £0.32 (converted 
into US dollars at USD/GBP 1.30). Unless previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the Convertible Bond will be redeemed 
at par on 24 July 2022.
The Convertible Bond contains a covenant relating to a restriction on incurrence of indebtedness. This restriction shall not apply in respect of: 
• any indebtedness in respect of the Convertible Bond (Bond Debt);
•  any other indebtedness where the aggregate principal amount of such other indebtedness, when combined with the aggregate principal 
amount of all other indebtedness of the Group from time to time (excluding the Bond Debt), would not cause the total indebtedness of the 
Group on a consolidated basis to exceed US$45 million (or the equivalent thereof in other currencies at then current rates of exchange); and
• any permitted indebtedness, being:
•  any liability in respect of any lease or hire purchase contract which would, in accordance with IFRS, be treated as a finance or capital 
lease, with respect to the bareboat charter of the Aoka Mizu FPSO;
•  amounts borrowed, or any guarantee or indemnity given with respect to any security, where required by The Oil and Gas Authority 
or any other applicable regulator, in relation to suspended wells, decommissioning or other related regulatory obligations of the 
Group; and
• any amount raised under any transaction, having the commercial effect of borrowing, in respect of the deferral of payment of invoices 
due to Technip UK Limited (or any of its affiliated companies) in connection with the agreement for the provision of subsea umbilical 
risers and flowlines and subsea production systems for the Company’s operations in the Lancaster Field.
The conversion feature of the Bonds is classified as an embedded derivative liability as the Bonds can be settled by the Group in cash and 
hence does not meet the ‘fixed for fixed’ criteria for a compound instrument outlined in IAS 39 (see note 24.7). It has therefore been measured 
at fair value through profit and loss. The amount recognised at inception in respect of the host debt contract was determined by deducting 
the fair value of the conversion option at inception (the embedded derivative) from the fair value of the consideration received for the 
Convertible Bonds. The debt component is then recognised at amortised cost, using the effective interest method until extinguished upon 
conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date.

The interest expensed in the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 13.5% to the liability component from 24 July to  
31 December. The liability component is measured at amortised cost. The difference between the carrying amount of the liability component 
at the date of issue and the amount reported in the balance sheet at 31 December 2017 represents the interest charged at the effective 
interest rate less interest paid to that date. All of the interest charge has been capitalised within property, plant and equipment as it is 
considered to relate to the development of the Lancaster Field, a qualifying asset.

On 12 May 2017 the Group issued warrants to Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Stifel) to subscribe for up to 25,000,000 new Ordinary Shares 
at a price equal to 95% of the volume weighted average price of the Ordinary Shares, calculated over the trading day prior to exercise (the 
“Warrants”). Fees for the placing of Ordinary Shares issued on exercise of the Warrants were paid to the Group’s (then) joint brokers. An 
amount of £141,000 was paid to Stifel and £413,000 was paid to Cenkos Securities plc.
Between 12 May 2017 and 17 May 2017 all of the above Warrants were exercised and new Ordinary Shares were issued at an average price  
of £0.52.
On 24 July 2017 the Company raised US$300 million (at a USD/GBP exchange rate of 1.2821) by way of a non-pre-emptive placing of 
731,222,213 new Ordinary Shares at an issue price of £0.32 per share. Concurrently, the Company raised US$220 million from the successful 
placement of the Convertible Bond. An over allotment option in respect of US$10 million of bonds was exercised in full on the same date. 
Following exercise of the option, the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Bond was US$230 million. See note 18 for further details.

Under the Hurricane Energy 2013 Performance Share Plan (PSP) certain employees, including executive directors, were granted conditional 
rights to receive Ordinary Shares at nil cost. The share awards vest based on the Group meeting certain milestones across the next four years.
A mirror image plan (the Hurricane Energy 2013 Nominal Cost Option Plan, NED Plan) was also introduced for the purpose of enabling 
conditional awards of nil cost options to the Group’s non-executive directors. The NED Plan operates on materially the same terms and 
conditions as the PSP. Under the NED Plan the non-executive directors were granted conditional rights to receive Ordinary Shares at nil cost. 
The share awards vest based on the same conditions as the PSP.
In November 2016 certain employees and executive directors forfeited their PSPs as part of the terms of participating in the Value Creation 
Plan (VCP). The transfer of employees and executive directors to the VCP has been accounted for as a modification to the PSP. See section  
21.3 below.
On 18 January 2017, the performance criteria of PSPs and the NED Plan were amended to align with the criteria under the VCP.
On 18 December 2017 two non-executive directors surrendered their PSPs held under the NED Plan.
21.2. Share Options
There are two tranches of share options that remain outstanding at 31 December 2017. Both tranches vested either on or before IPO. All 
other share options and LTIP awards were replaced by the PSP. As at 31 December 2017 the number of options that remained outstanding was 
780,000 (2016: 901,500). The weighted average exercise price for these options was £0.55 (2016: £0.53). All outstanding options are exercisable.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.1 years (2016: 2.1 years).
The first tranche of 600,000 share options were granted in April 2009 with an exercise price of £0.30. 100,000 of these share options lapsed 
in 2017. 500,000 lapse in June 2019. The second tranche of 301,500 share options was granted in January 2011 at an exercise price of £1.00. 
21,500 of these share options lapsed in 2017. 280,000 lapse in December 2020.
21.3. Value Creation Plan 
In November 2016 the Group introduced a Value Creation Plan (“VCP”) for employees and executive directors, involving the issue of 840 
growth shares in Hurricane Group Limited (a Group subsidiary). 
The fair value of the VCP as at the grant date was calculated as $24.5 million, of which $9.3 million had been charged to the grant date under 
the terms of the PSP awards which it replaced. The fair value was calculated using a simulation model with the following key assumptions: (i) 
volatility of 68%; (ii) risk free rate of 0.62%; (iii) dividend yield of 0%; (iv) life of five years; and (v) share price at grant date of £0.34. The Group 
has currently assumed a vesting period which runs to early 2021, based on their assessment of the various non-market based performance 
conditions. If the assumed vesting period was shortened by one year or two years, the additional charge per year would be approximately  
$1.3 million and $3.9 million respectively. 
Those employees or directors who entered the VCP were required to forfeit any PSPs held at that time. 
Details of the VCP can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 and 55 of the Governance Report.

The Group monitors and manages the financial risks relating to its operations on a continuous basis. These include foreign exchange, credit, 
liquidity and interest rate risks. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivatives, for speculative purposes. 
Other than the financial instruments referred to in section 24.7, the Group’s significant financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents 
(note 16), trade payables (note 17) and borrowings (note 18). The Group considers the carrying value of all its financial assets and liabilities to 
be materially the same as their fair value with the exception of the Convertible Bond. The Convertible Bond’s carrying value at the Balance 
Sheet date was split between the host debt contract at amortised cost with a carrying value of $191.1 million and the embedded derivative 
with a fair value of $28.6 million. The fair value of the instrument as a whole, based on the exchange traded value at the Balance Sheet date 
was $251.3 million. The Group has no material financial assets that are past due.
24.2. Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
Capital managed by the Group at 31 December 2017 consists of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and equity attributable to equity 
holders of the parent. The capital structure is reviewed by management through regular internal and financial reporting and forecasting.  
As at 31 December 2017 equity attributable to equity holders of the parent is $682.5 million (2016: $379.6 million), whilst cash and cash 
equivalents amount to $360.0 million (2016: $101.5 million).
24.3. Foreign exchange risk management
The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. The 
Group’s cash and cash equivalents are held in both US Dollars and Pounds Sterling. At 31 December 2017, 42% of the Group’s cash and cash 
equivalents were held in Pounds Sterling.
A 10% increase in the strength of the Sterling against US Dollar would cause a decrease of $15.1 million (2016: $0.1 million) on the profit after 
tax of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017. A 10% weakening in the strength of Sterling against the US Dollar, would cause an 
increase of $15.1 million (2016: $0.1 million) on the profit after tax of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017.
This sensitivity analysis includes only foreign currency denominated cash and cash equivalents, and adjusts their translation at the period 
end for a 10% change in the foreign currency rate. Whilst the effect of any movement in exchange rates is charged or credited to the Income 
Statement, the economic effect of holding Pounds Sterling against actual or expected commitments in Pounds Sterling is an economic hedge 
against exchange rate movements.
24.4. Credit risk
The Group is only exposed to significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents. The risk to the Group is deemed to be limited because the 
cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks with at least A credit ratings assigned by an international credit rating agency. The carrying 
value of cash and cash equivalents represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at year end.
24.5. Liquidity risk
The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents to cover its liabilities as and when they fall due. The 
financial liabilities of the Group are currently limited to trade payables, which are due to be paid within 30 days of the Balance Sheet date, and 
the Convertible Bonds referred to in note 18. Consideration of the Group’s current and forecast financing position are provided in more detail 
in the going concern section of the Directors’ Report.
24.6. Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements through its cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at variable interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher, the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would have increased by $3.6 million 
(2016: $0.9 million), assuming the cash and cash equivalents at the Balance Sheet date had been outstanding for the whole year. No sensitivity 
analysis has been undertaken for a 1% decrease in interest rates because of the low level of prevailing interest rates during the year.
24.7. Financial instruments held by the Group
The derivative financial instruments held by the Group are the embedded derivative associated with the issue of the Convertible Bond, and 
the forward foreign exchange contracts the Group entered into during 2017. 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires entities to disclose the fair value of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities in a 
way that permits it to be compared with its carrying value. IFRS 7 also requires financial instruments to be classifies into a fair value hierarchy 
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

(a) Embedded derivative
At inception and at the Balance Sheet date, the fair value of the embedded derivative contained within the Convertible Bond was calculated 
based on the conversion option contained within. In determining the fair value of the embedded derivative, the likelihood of the early 
redemption option being exercised and the likelihood of a change of control of the Group within the life of the bonds were considered.  
The likelihood of each was considered to be nil for the purposes of the valuation.

Derivative liability at date of issue (39,049) –
Change in fair value recognised in the income statement 10,427 –
Derivative liability at 31 December (28,622) –
The derivatives that are a part of the Convertible Bond issue have been assessed to be a Level 3 financial liability. This is because the 
derivatives themselves are not traded on an active market and their fair values are determined by a valuation technique that uses one key 
input that is not based on observable market data, being share price volatility.
Volatility is a key input in the valuation of the Convertible Bond embedded derivative. Volatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty 
in return for a given underlying derivative. It represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or index (in this case 
share price) will change in value over time. The valuation technique was based on a simulation model and the volatility was calculated as a 
blended average of the trading history of the Group’s own shares and shares in a relevant peer group, for a period of six months prior to the 
measurement date.
The fair value calculation at 31 December 2017 used a share price volatility assumption of 23.6%. A 5% increase to 28.6% would cause a  
$7.4 million increase in the fair value recognised at 31 December 2017. A 5% decrease in the share price volatility to 18.6% would cause a 
decrease of $7.2 million in the fair value. As movements in the fair value are recognised directly in the income statement these changes  
would directly affect the profit after tax by the same amount. 
(b) Foreign exchange swaps
During the year the Group has entered into several foreign exchange swaps to cover specific foreign currency payments in the Group’s future. 
At reporting date the Group had entered into three separate foreign exchange swaps for the purposes of settling three known Euro payments 
to occur in 2018.
These foreign exchange swaps are accounted for using the spot rate on the date the swap was entered into, and subsequently revalued at 
each reporting date for movements in the foreign exchange rate. Any change in the forward spot rate at period end is accounted for by 
taking the fair value changes to the income statement and recognising either a derivative asset or derivative liability in the statement of 
financial position.

observable market data, e.g. foreign exchange rates. 
25. Capital commitments
As at 31 December 2017 the Group had capital commitments of $199.7 million (2016: $7.4 million).
