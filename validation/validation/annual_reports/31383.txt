The evaluation of the Vaca Muerta 
shale formation is well under way in the 
Puesto Rojas area in Mendoza province 
with five wells targeting the formation 
in 2017. A number of wells have also 
been drilled in the Agrio and Chachao 
formations at the nearby Cerro Pencal 
area, also demonstrating the potential 
for unconventional development. A full 
3D seismic survey in southern Puesto 
Rojas is being processed and interpreted 
to plan for future drilling.
In Neuquén province, a significant Vaca

STRATEGIC REPORT
8 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Dear shareholders
I have been fortunate to visit Argentina 
regularly since 2001, and I have been 
involved with British-Argentine commerce 
and business for the past several years. 
Argentina is an extraordinary country with 
a proud commercial heritage that is 
blessed with a wealth of natural resources 
and a skilled and well-educated workforce. 
Following more than a decade of 
domestic policy that stifled investment, 
the current Macri administration came 
into power in 2015. The new administration 
is progressing a business friendly growth 
agenda that has reconnected Argentina 
to the international community. 
Since being elected, the administration 
has delivered significant advances 
with regard to foreign policy, economic 
normalisation and social reform. Argentina 
is on a fast-track process to join the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) and has been 
designated as the G20 chair for 2018. 
The Argentine Peso has been fully 
deregulated with exchange controls 
removed and has been freely floating 
since December 2015. Revised monetary 
policy has been introduced by the central 
bank aimed at bringing inflation under 
control and protecting the value of the 
Peso over the medium to long term. The 
government has introduced important 
labour, tax and capital markets reforms 
which are helping to attract investment, 
both domestically and from abroad, and 
reactivate the economy. The fiscal deficit 
is being tackled and unemployment is 
gradually reducing. In 2017, the Argentine 
Merval Index was the best-performing 
stock market index globally.
The recent currency volatility and 
devaluation driven by domestic 
inflation concerns highlights the 
challenges Argentina faces. However, 
the administration’s reaction to this 
recent volatility and the IMF’s positive 
response is encouraging.
The new policy agenda is attracting 
substantial amounts of foreign capital 
investment. The oil industry is at the 
forefront of this trend, with its ability 
to rapidly improve the country’s balance 
of trade. International oil companies 
investing in Argentina, and specifically 
in the Vaca Muerta shale, include 
ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total, Equinor 
(previously Statoil), Chevron, Sinopec, 
Petronas and Schlumberger. 
These factors provided the backdrop 
for the transformative corporate 
combination of Andes Energia and 
Trefoil Holdings B.V. that was successfully 
completed in August 2017. Phoenix Global 
Resources is our new identity and marks 
a new beginning, with new management 
and a new strategy. Our business has 
effectively quadrupled in terms of scale. 
We have greatly enhanced our operating 
capability, strengthened our financial 
position and our access to capital. We 
have created a very different and investible 
platform of substantial conventional 
resources and reserves underpinning 
a much larger unconventional opportunity 
in the Vaca Muerta shale. The Vaca 
Muerta is the only commercially producing 
shale formation outside of North America 
and it is currently producing at a rate of 
more than 90,000 boepd. 
Importantly, during 2017, we have 
upgraded and revamped our corporate 
governance, both at board level and 
within the operating business. We 
welcomed many new faces to the board 
and now have a strong, experienced 
board. During the year, I was appointed 
chairman, Anuj Sharma was appointed 
CEO and Philip Wolfe was appointed 
CFO. We welcomed John Bentley and 
Garrett Soden as independent non-
executive directors, and also Guillaume 
Vermersch as non-executive director. 
Importantly, following the appointment 
of John and Garrett to the board, the 
number of independent non-executive 
directors has increased to four. 
The second half of the year was one of 
transformation and consolidation with 
focus on driving forward the operational 
and corporate integration of the two 
businesses before year-end. Having 
recently announced our accelerated 
business plan and recapitalised our 
business with the support of the Mercuria 
Group, Phoenix is now reset to capitalise 
on the significant unconventional oil and 
gas growth opportunities in Argentina, 
including in the world class Vaca Muerta 
shale formation.
I am very pleased to be the new chairman 
of Phoenix and am excited as we look 
forward to growing our business and 
realising its significant potential over the 
next 12 months and beyond.

Creation of Phoenix
The completion of the combination of 
Andes Energia and Trefoil in the year has 
created a pure play Argentina-focused 
independent exploration and production 
company with real scale and the ability to 
finance an active unconventional work 
programme in the Vaca Muerta. 
Production, reserves and resources
At 31 December 2017, Phoenix had 
production of more than 11,000 boepd, 
representing approximately 1% of 
Argentina’s total oil and gas production. 
Our 2P reserves have been independently 
assessed at 57.2 million boe, and our 
contingent and prospective resources 
have been independently assessed at 
1,795 million boe.
We have working interest acreage in the 
Vaca Muerta of approximately 560,000 
acres – equivalent to approximately 7.5% 
of the formation acreage as a whole. 
We firmly believe that Vaca Muerta, 
and other unconventional resources in 
Argentina, represent the next shale oil 
revolution, and that Phoenix is well 
positioned to create significant value and 
play a meaningful part in the growth 
of the Argentine unconventional oil and 
gas industry.
Securing operatorship and acreage
Since August 2017, we have built 
on our strategy to consolidate our 
acreage position and have sought to 
increase the number of Phoenix operated 
positions across our portfolio. 
In the Rio Atuel licence, adjacent to 
our Puesto Rojas area, we successfully 
negotiated and doubled our participation 
taking it to 66.7% and secured the 
operatorship from Tecpetrol in 
October 2017. 
In April 2018, we successfully renegotiated 
the memorandum of understanding that 
was previously in place in respect of the 
Mata Mora and Corralera blocks. The 
renegotiation resulted in the formation 
of a joint venture with GyP, the Neuquén 
province-owned oil and gas company. 
Phoenix has increased its participation in 
the Mata Mora and the majority of the 
Corralera areas from 27% to 90%. In doing 
so, we have also assumed operatorship. 
Additionally, in the recent Neuquén province 
bid-round, we acquired four new blocks 
with development potential in the 
unconventional Vaca Muerta, 
Mulichnico and Agrio formations.

Integration, technology transfer 
and people
In October 2017, we consolidated our 
teams in Buenos Aires and moved into 
our new offices at Torre Alem Plaza. This 
brought our corporate team together in 
a single location and fast-tracked the 
integration process. Moving to a single 
location and integrating staff has enabled 
us to instil our corporate culture, and the 
values that underpin our governance 
objectives, across all of our teams. 
Phoenix opened its technical excellence 
centre in Houston in April 2018. Transferring 
the knowledge and technology developed in 
the US shale industry to Argentina and 
bringing that knowledge to bear in the 
development of our assets is fundamental 
to the Phoenix strategy. We have already 
made a number of key expert appointments 
including a senior geophysicist, senior 
geoscientist and have secured the services 
of a senior directional drilling engineer. 
Basing our technical centre in Houston puts 
our team directly in the engine room of the 
US shale industry and provides us access to 
the best and most experienced service 
providers and consultants in the US. 
We have strengthened our team in 
Mendoza with the appointment of a new 
asset manager with responsibility for our 
Argentina asset portfolio and have also 
recruited a specialist in directional drilling 
who will oversee the execution of our 
upcoming horizontal drilling activities. 
Our teams in Mendoza and Houston are 
technologically enabled to work closely 
with each other to marry in-country 
operational excellence and a deep 
understanding of our assets with world 
class geological, geophysical and technical 
expertise. This unconventional technical 
expertise, developed over years of working 
unconventional plays in the US, will enable 
us to optimise our appraisal and 
evaluation programme of the company’s 
significant unconventional opportunities. 1 As per WD Von Gonten & Company, NSAI, OPC and Francisco Guilsano reports

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
11 Unconventional regulations in Mendoza
The recently announced unconventional 
oil and gas regulations in Mendoza 
province are very important for our 
industry. They provide us with the 
framework to move forward responsibly 
with our appraisal and evaluation 
activities in the northern part of the 
Neuquina basin, where we have 
approximately 745,000 working interest 
acres of which approximately 445,000 
are prospective for unconventional 
development. These regulations are the 
result of several months’ work by the 
province and its advisers and, in our 
view, reflect industry best practice. 
The regulations balance the protection 
of the environment and the communities 
we operate in with the responsible 
development of the province’s significant 
unconventional oil and gas resources. 
Importantly, the regulations provide the 
foundation for our continued and 
increased investment in the province of 
Mendoza that will bring job creation both 
in our own operations and in the service 
industry that supports us. This 
investment will also bring direct benefit 
to the province through taxes and 
royalties. Because the combination 
brought together two existing groups 
already active in Mendoza province, we 
believe that we benefit from an early 
entrant advantage in the province on 
which we are well positioned to capitalise 
as we appraise and evaluate the Vaca 
Muerta and Tight Agrio formations.
Business development
As well as investing in our existing asset 
base, Phoenix continues to evaluate 
non-organic growth opportunities, 
including participating in new licence 
bid rounds and other third-party 
sale processes. 
In April 2018, the company successfully 
participated in the Neuquén province bid 
round, securing four additional operated 
blocks that are prospective for 
unconventional appraisal. 
In addition, the company participated 
in the bidding round in the Mendoza 
province, bidding for blocks which are 
proximate to our existing interests in 
the province. 
Outlook
The 2018 accelerated business plan more 
than doubles our 2017 capital expenditure 
programme. Phoenix plans to target 
capital expenditure on key assets in and 
around the Puesto Rojas area and on our 
Mata Mora licence. 
us$190m
capital expenditure for 
2018 accelerated business plan
70%
focused on unconventional 
appraisal and evaluation
The capital expenditure programme also 
involves a new 3D seismic survey being 
shot on the southern part of the Puesto 
Rojas, and the La Brea and Rio Atuel 
licences, together with drilling nine 
additional vertical wells to appraise the 
Vaca Muerta and Tight Agrio formations. 
Later in the year, we plan to drill our first 
horizontal wells in the Puesto Rojas area 
which, if successful, will be an important 
milestone in demonstrating the potential 
for large-scale unconventional 
development in the Puesto Rojas area. 
In the second half of 2018, we plan to drill 
and complete our first two unconventional 
horizontal wells on the Mata Mora licence 
area. Again, the results of our pilot well 
and initial horizontal wells will inform 
our plan for a full-scale development 
programme of Vaca Muerta at Mata Mora.
Mata Mora is a core concession for the

Phoenix Global Resources plc
STRATEGIC REPORT
12 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT CONTINUED Phoenix will also continue to invest in its 
conventional reserves in the Neuquina 
basin, that provide the company with low 
risk and high netback production. At the 
Puesto Rojas area, the company has net 
2P conventional reserves of 17.2 MMboe. 
Similarly, we have net 2P conventional 
reserves of 6.0 MMboe at Chachahuen, 
where we continue to invest with our 
operating partner, YPF. 
In addition, our assets in the Austral and 
Cuyana basins will continue to provide 
Phoenix with steady, profitable gas and 
oil production, respectively.
We are committed to the judicious 
deployment of our capital to the projects 
that will create the greatest value for our 
shareholders. In the medium term this will 
involve balancing short-term production 
growth with the longer term objective of 
migrating our significant unconventional 
resources to reserves and on into 
profitable production.
I believe that Phoenix has many attractive 
investment opportunities across our asset 
base in Argentina and I look forward to the 
challenge of developing our unconventional 
exploration opportunities into world-class 
production assets. 
Anuj Sharma 
Chief executive officer 
4 June 2018
Our overriding objective is to build value over 
the medium to long term, focusing our efforts 
on the following priority areas:
 > Proving up and de-risking our extensive unconventional acreage. Phoenix is 
one of the largest holders of acreage with unconventional potential in 
Argentina. The company’s initial focus is on appraising, de-risking and 
developing this large unconventional asset base. We plan to progressively 
move our assets into development phase as we appraise and de-risk, working 
across our substantial asset portfolio.
 > Building our organisation to prepare for large scale development of our 
unconventional resources. Phoenix will continue to strengthen our organisation 
adding expertise through specific appointments and developing our people 
through training programmes, as we prepare for the large scale development 
of our unconventional resources. Bringing the right expertise from the US 
independents’ shale experience remains key to the efficient development of 
Argentina’s vast unconventional resources. Phoenix will continue to leverage 
that experience through our Houston technical centre.
 > Opportunistic inorganic growth through farm-ins, joint ventures, partnerships 
and portfolio rationalisation. While Phoenix holds a large portfolio of both 
unconventional and conventional assets and is well set for long term organic 
growth, the group remains open to working with others to develop our own 
portfolio or to add new prospects to our portfolio. This may be through 
acquisition, farm-in/out opportunities, joint ventures or partnerships in the 
Neuquina basin and other attractive basins throughout Argentina. We will 
focus on opportunities where we can realise attractive synergies, share 
know-how, or where such arrangements have clear strategic and operational 
alignment with other operators.

Future priorities  Ov erview of the Argentina 
oil and gas market
Brent crude opened the year at US$55.05 
per barrel and struggled to make upward 
progress through the first half before 
hitting a low in June of US$44.09 
per barrel. 
In the second half of 2017, both the Brent 
and WTI benchmark indices strengthened 
as the impact of the predicted rebalancing 
of global oil inventories began to provide 
more robust support for prices. Brent 
closed the year at US$66.73 per barrel. 
This reflected lower levels of investment 
over the last several years coupled with 
stronger quota compliance among OPEC 
member countries continuing to suppress 
inventories. Prices have remained firm 
into 2018 with the US$70.00 per barrel 
Brent crude threshold breached on 8 May 
2018 for the first time since December 
2014. Prices have increased further 
through May and breached the 
US$80.00 per barrel threshold.
Whilst industry-wide investment in 
exploration and development activity 
remains at relatively low levels, a number of 
prospective investment bright spots have 
emerged, notably including Argentina 
where the Vaca Muerta and other relatively 
virgin unconventional formations have 
continued to attract significant levels of 
interest and investment.
The current administration continues to 
welcome inward investment as regulatory 
and fiscal reform continues apace. The oil 
and gas industry can play a significant 
role in the economic rehabilitation of 
Argentina through its potential to make a 
rapid and meaningful impact on the 
balance of trade. Increased domestic oil 
and gas production will reduce the 
reliance on expensive oil and gas imports 
and will lead to job creation in Argentina, 
driving further economic prosperity. 
Commodity price volatility 
continued to be a feature 
of our market in 2017. 
ARGENTINA’S ENERGY MIX
Argentina has a relatively high level 
of dependence on hydrocarbons for 
its energy with approximately 89% 
of the country’s energy needs satisfied 
by oil and gas. Coal consumption is 
low reflecting the low level of coal 
deposits in Argentina compared 
to other nations, resulting in 
comparatively low CO
2
 emissions.

OIL PRODUCTION
Domestic oil production has declined by 
approximately 13% in the period from 2012 
to 2017. The rate of decline has accelerated 
in recent years as an increasing number 
of mature conventional oil fields are 
affected by natural decline. Average 
daily production fell from approximately 
512,000 bpd in 2016 to approximately 
479,000 bpd in 2017, a decrease of 
approximately 6.4% year on year.
GAS CONSUMPTION
The majority of gas consumption is in 
three sectors, namely power generation, 
industrial manufacturing and gas for 
domestic heating and cooking. 
GAS PRODUCTION
Gas production has been relatively 
consistent in the period from 2012 to 
2017 with decline from conventional gas 
assets in the period to 2014 replaced by 
initial gas production volumes from 
Vaca Muerta and other unconventional 
and tight gas formations from 2015 
through 2017. 
WHO PRODUCES OIL AND PHOENIX’S POSITION
Oil production in Argentina is dominated 
by YPF, the state-owned production 
company, and Pan American Energy, 
the joint venture between BP and 
Bridas. Phoenix currently accounts for 
approximately 1.6% of total oil production 
in Argentina. The substantial majority of 
this production is from relatively mature 
conventional assets. 
The company’s position as an early 
entrant in the unconventional sector 
bolstered by the steady acquisition 
and consolidation of acreage, provides 
the springboard for Phoenix to play 
a significant role in the development 
of the industry and of unconventional 
production in Argentina.
OIL IMPORTS
In 2017, Argentina imported 
approximately a net 17,500 bpd 
accounting for approximately 3.5% 
of total consumption.
GAS IMPORTS
Approximately 23% of Argentina’s annual 
gas needs are currently sourced through 
import, either through pipeline from 
Bolivia or internationally in the form 
of LNG.

15 THE ISSUE
OUR RESPONSE
LINK TO STRATEGY
Argentina previously operated a semi-
regulated pricing regime that was removed 
in October 2017. Sales contracts are 
typically priced by reference to Brent with 
a location/quality discount applied. Whilst 
the removal of the semi-regulated pricing 
removes downside price protection it 
does allow companies to participate 
in upside gains.
Oil and gas prices have been volatile in 
the last several years including periods 
of consistently low prices driven by 
over-supply. Exposure to oil price risk 
can significantly affect the amount of 
cash generated from operations from 
one period to the next. 
Oil prices have been strengthening 
recently and the company has 
implemented a hedging policy to fix 
prices when it is commercially 
appropriate to do so. In fixing prices 
through swap contracts the company 
is able to have clarity on funds from 
operations to underpin budgeted 
capital expenditure. This is particularly 
important in periods of significant 
development activity.
The company only enters hedging 
arrangements in respect of a portion of 
the production derived from our proved, 
developed, producing (pdp) wells. In 
addition, we do not hedge anticipated 
increases in production upfront.
Argentina has a natural gas deficit and 
relies on imports of gas from Bolivia and 
also LNG cargoes from the international 
market. Argentina has little to no coal 
reserves and relies heavily on gas for power 
generation. The import price for gas is 
high with imports from Bolivia averaging 
US$4.8 per MMbtu in 2017 and LNG 
priced on average at US$5.7 per MMbtu. 
The 2017 domestic gas price averaged 
only US$3.6 per MMbtu. This results in an 
import loss of US$1.2 – US$2.1 per MMbtu 
that directly affects the country’s balance 
of trade. In order to encourage domestic 
production and reduce the reliance on 
imported gas, a number of incentive 
schemes are in place whereby a producer 
can receive a higher price for gas in 
certain circumstances. Argentine shale 
gas currently attracts a premium of 
approximately US$3.6 per MMbtu over 
the prevailing domestic price.
Phoenix is a price taker for gas and 
does not seek to hedge production. 
The majority of Phoenix’s current gas 
production is derived from conventional 
assets in the Santa Cruz Sur area.
The company’s objective for gas 
production in the long term is to develop 
the unconventional gas resources that 
we have within our portfolio where 
commercially viable. We will continue 
to work with our partner, ROCH S.A. 
to maximise Santa Cruz production. 
The company will participate in gas 
incentive arrangements where possible.

STRATEGIC REPORT
16 OUR MARKET DRIVERS CONTINUED The Argentine Peso has historically been 
weak and has suffered extended periods 
of devaluation. Concurrently cost inflation 
in Argentina has been high with the 
Consumer Price Index showing inflation 
of 24.8%, 38.0% and 25.0% in 2015, 2016 
and 2017 respectively. Bringing inflation 
under control together with stabilising and 
strengthening the Peso is a key tenet of 
the current administration’s policy agenda 
that has a goal of bringing price inflation 
down to the 5% level by 2020/2021.
The oil and gas industry in Argentina 
benefits from a degree of natural hedge 
protection from currency risk as sales 
contracts for oil are denominated in 
US Dollars by reference to the Brent 
benchmark price. In addition, oilfield 
service contracts, for example those 
related to drilling and completion, are 
also mostly denominated and settled 
in US Dollars.
Cost inflation affects the company in 
relation to salaries and wages that are 
denominated in Peso and are adjusted for 
inflation periodically before performance 
or other increases. In addition, contracts 
for parts, materials, services or property 
sourced domestically will increase year on 
year due to inflation.
The unconventional oil and gas industry 
in Argentina has seen a significant 
uptick in investment and activity in the 
last several years. There are a limited 
number of drilling rigs in the country 
that are capable of drilling the long 
lateral horizontal wells that are required 
for evaluation and, ultimately, large-
scale production. In addition, the number 
of unconventional completion crews with 
international experience is limited and 
their availability is driven by demand.
The company seeks to form relationships 
with trusted service providers and 
individual crews. Contracts for drilling 
and completion services are put in 
place in advance and campaigns are 
scheduled to maximise operational 
efficiencies and crew and equipment 
mobilisation and demobilisation 
synergies where possible.
Argentina is a net 
importer of both oil and 
gas. The unconventional 
industry has the 
potential to make 
Argentina self sufficient 
in terms of its energy 
needs and to help 
redress the country’s 
balance of payments.

to add additional acres with exposure 
to unconventional resources, including 
the Vaca Muerta. 
Our exploration and development

HOW WE DO THIS  
AND WHAT WE  
HAVE DONE
The 2017 combination transaction 
provided the foundation for this growth 
strategy. In October 2017, we successfully 
increased our participation in the Rio 
Atuel licence, that sits adjacent to our 
existing Puesto Rojas acreage, from 
33.34% to 66.67%, and assumed 
the operatorship at the same time. 
In April 2018, the group participated in 
the Neuquén province licensing round 
and secured four additional operated 
blocks. Phoenix also reached agreement 
with GyP, the Neuquén province-owned 
oil and gas company and our partner 
in the Corralerra and Mata Mora 
concessions, to increase our participation 
in these blocks from 27% to 90% and to 
assume operatorship.
We focus our exploration and appraisal 
work where we have significant 
contiguous acreage positions – such as 
the Puesto Rojas/Malargüe area – and 
where our acreage is proximate to areas 
where others have found success – for 
instance at Mata Mora, which sits close 
to a number of successful Vaca Muerta 
producing licences, including Sierras 
Blancas and Loma Compana.
We have continued the Vaca Muerta 
appraisal drilling programme on our 
Puesto Rojas and neighbouring 
concessions that we started in late 2016, 
completing four wells in 2017 and have 
also drilled an initial well into the tight-
Agrio formation, also at Puesto Rojas, 
with encouraging initial results.
We continue to exploit and develop our 
high margin conventional assets providing 
us a conventional production base, as we 
continue to evaluate unconventional 
opportunities for development. 
In 2017 the group had net production of 
11,070 boepd – sourced principally from 
conventional assets. We continued to 
perform workovers on existing conventional 
wells and drilled a number of in-fill wells 
targeting high margin areas. In 2017 we 
completed 13 workovers and drilled 
134 new conventional wells, including 118 
wells at Chachahuen. Our unconventional 
activity will continue to be accretive 
to production as we complete new 
appraisal wells.
In February 2018 the group announced 
the restructuring of its financing 
arrangements with the Mercuria Group 
that will underpin the accelerated 
business plan in 2018.
Focusing on current cash flow as well 
as development potential, the group 
entered a swap agreement in January 
2018 to fix the price received for a portion 
of our production at a Brent benchmark 
price of US$65.97 per barrel. This protects 
revenue in 2018 and hence cash generated 
for reinvestment in our exploration, 
appraisal and development projects.

seven were completed. Of the nine wells, 
five were drilled as unconventional vertical 
wells targeting the Vaca Muerta formation. 
Four of these wells were completed using 
our second-generation hydraulic fracture 
design that aims to generate a larger 
fracture surface area. This fracture design 
was applied on all six production horizons 
of the Vaca Muerta, with certain horizons 
then individually tested to evaluate the 
performance of the completion technique. 
The design appears to have been 
successful in VM3 horizon of the Vaca 
Muerta, and it is expected that economically 
viable horizontal wells can be drilled in this 
horizon in the future using this fracture 
design. Emulsion issues were encountered 
on all of the wells when using the fracture 
design in the thicker VM6 horizon of 
the Vaca Muerta, which is the primary 
producing horizon of the successful 
CP-1010 well. 
While minor emulsion issues were also 
encountered in the CP-1010 well, it is 
believed that these issues were more 
severe in the newer wells due to the lower 
conductivity of the fracture that can result 
from fractures designed to generate a 
higher surface area. The emulsion issues 
have been replicated in laboratory 
experiments using a combination of the 
produced oil, water from the hydraulic 
fracture, and formation solids. We continue 
to explore options for remediation of the 
emulsion issues in these wells.

of a hydraulic fracture being performed in 
the Agrio formation. Following completion 
of the two-stage hydraulic fracture, the 
production rate from CDM-3002 
increased to a maximum rate of over 600 
boepd, and it continues to produce at over 
500 boepd. Should this process be found 
to be repeatable, this could significantly 
increase both reserves and production 
from the Agrio formation at the Puesto 
Rojas concession. Further tests of the 
Agrio formation are included in the 2018 
accelerated business plan.
The results of the CDM-3002 workover 
have further potentially positive 
implications if the process can be found 
to also work in the organic rich source 
rock intervals of the Lower Agrio, also 
referred to as the ‘Tight’ Agrio. If the 
process can be made to work successfully 
in these formations, the company could 
potentially have an entirely new 
unconventional play on its acreage, in 
addition to its Vaca Muerta position.
Future appraisal and development 
activity
The 2018 planned drilling programme is 
focused on accelerating the appraisal 
and development of Phoenix’s significant 
Vaca Muerta and other unconventional 
resources in the Neuquina basin. The 
company plans to spend up to US$120 
million of total budgeted 2018 capital 
expenditure on developing these 
unconventional resources. This activity is 
expected to de-risk a significant portion 
of unconventional acreage and also 
provide the basis for robust production 
growth going forward.
The company’s 2018 business plan 
focuses on the drilling and completion 
of further vertical development and 
exploration wells in the Puesto Rojas area, 
targeting up to nine prospects in the 
unconventional Vaca Muerta and Agrio 
formations, as well as drilling one 
conventional target. The drilling plan for 
the company’s unconventional assets, 
together with the acquisition and 
processing of new seismic data in the 
south of Puesto Rojas, and La Brea 
and Rio Atuel concessions, is designed 
to prepare these assets for large-scale 
development. The acquisition of 
approximately 60,000 acres of new 
seismic data is complete with the 
processing and interpretation of that 
data under way.
In the fourth quarter of the year, the 
company plans to drill and complete 
its ﬁrst horizontal wells in the Puesto 
Rojas area, following appraisal of its 
vertical wells to identify which horizons 
are likely to deliver the best rates and 
economic return.
One well, CDM-3001, was awaiting 
completion pending clarification of the 
permitting process associated with the 
new unconventional oil and gas regulations 
that were announced by the province of 
Mendoza in February 2018. Once the 
permitting process is in place, CDM-3001 
will be completed together with two 
planned new wells. The planned 
completion will use a combination of 
higher conductivity and higher surface 
area fractures in order to determine the 
optimum completion for each zone of the 
Vaca Muerta. The ultimate objective of 
this work is to design an effective, 
repeatable and economic completion 
design for horizontal wells in the area.
The remaining four wells were 
conventional vertical wells drilled into the 
Agrio and Chachao formations at the 
Cerro Pencal field. One well, CP-1014ST, 
came online above expectations with 
initial production in excess of 750 boepd 
from the Chachao alone. The Agrio 
remains behind pipe in this well and will 
be completed at a later date. Two wells, 
CP-1011 and CP-1012, had initially strong 
test results, though on extended testing 
these wells appear to have limited 
natural fracture networks and, as such, 
are candidates for hydraulic fracture 
in 2018. The fourth well, CP-1019, was 
completed in early 2018 and is currently 
under evaluation. 
Workover activity
In addition to the new wells drilled, 
two workovers of existing wells were 
performed on the Puesto Rojas concession 
in 2017. Of these, the workover performed 
on CDM-3002 is potentially significant for 
the long-term development of the Puesto 
Rojas area. The CDM-3002 well was drilled 
in 2016 as an exploration well and initial 
results were disappointing with production 
of only 47 boepd at the time of recompletion. 
The 2017 workover involved two stages

Exploration activity
Of the wells drilled, four were completed in 
the Centenario formation in the 
exploration portion of the Chachahuen 
concession. This area is expected to 
provide growth potential at Chachahuen 
pending the results of additional 
evaluation of these wells. Should these 
wells prove economic for further 
development, it is likely that application 
will be made to the government to convert 
a portion of the exploration concession to 
an additional exploitation concession that 
would enable further development on the 
concession in due course.
Future exploration and development 
activity 
In 2018, the company plans to continue 
its investment on its Chachahuen 
development, together with our operating 
partner YPF. The development plan 
includes participating in approximately 
80 new wells in the year. 
Chachahuen should continue to deliver 
low-risk and low-cost production growth, 
adding both new producing wells and 
water injectors. The development plan 
also contemplates the continuing 
conversion of underperforming production 
wells to water injection wells. Continued 
horizontal development is also expected, 
as this appears to be a more capital-
efficient means of developing certain 
horizons that are presently underdeveloped.
Once development of the exploitation 
portion of the concession is completed in 
around 2020, it is expected to generate 
high quality, low cost, cash flows for the 
company for several years to come.
Production
Chachahuen represents the company’s 
most significant non-operated production 
block in terms of activity and production. 
Production has increased by 29.9% from 
an average of 1,521 boepd in 2016 to 1,976 
boepd in 2017. This reflects the impact of 
the 2017 drilling campaign on production 
and also the continued use of waterflood 
on the Chachahuen concession.
Drilling activity
In 2017, 118 wells were drilled and 112 
wells were completed on the Chachahuen 
concession. Of these, 92 wells came online 
as producers in the Rayoso formation and 
yielded results in line with expectation. 
Average maximum 30-day production 
rates from these wells was 50 boepd. In 
many cases, performance is expected to 
improve over time due to the waterflood 
response on the Chachahuen concession. 
YPF continues to drill water injectors on 
Chachahuen as needed and also converts 
selected underperforming production 
wells to water injections where 
remediation is not feasible.
In November 2017, YPF commenced 
drilling the first horizontal well, ChuS-
600(h), into the Rayoso formation. The 
well was completed in December achieving 
a maximum 30-day oil production rate 
of 182 bpd. Since coming on stream, 
production from the well has been steady, 
with current production of approximately 
170 bpd. At the end of 2017, YPF drilled an 
additional horizontal well, CHuS-601(h), 
with similar initial results.

Production 
Production from the Tierra del Fuego 
assets was marginally down on the 
prior year at 720 boepd (compared to 
759 boepd in 2016). This was as a result 
of a production decline in the Las Violetas 
concession where no new drilling was 
undertaken and offset by an increase 
in the Angostura concession from the 
successful exploration well in the 
Tobifera formation.
Exploration and development activity
A successful exploration well in the 
Tobifera formation on the Angostura 
concession was drilled in 2017. The well 
fulfilled the licence commitments on 
the concession and yielded initial gross 
production of 2,132 bpd of oil and 656 
mscfd of gas. The results of the initial 
well are highly promising in terms of 
the further development of the 
Tobifera formation.
A single well targeting the Springhill 
formation on the Rio Cullen concession 
was also drilled in 2017. The well gave 
average initial production of 1,038 Mscfd 
of gas and 2 bpd of oil. Results were 
generally below expectation and, while 
this well was a geologic success, further 
development of this asset is not 
currently planned.

to the Tobifera formation. One of the 
wells was successful and yielded average 
initial production of 1,608 Mscfd of gas 
and 2 bpd of oil. These results were in line 
with pre-drill expectations. 
One of the completed wells appears to 
have connected to the aquifer during the 
hydraulic fracturing process, and 
remediation options are being explored 
for the well. The final well was successfully 
completed in January 2018, with an initial 
rate of approximately 1,200 Mscfd. The 
results of this programme indicate the 
potentially lower risk of further planned 
infill development in the Tobifera 
formation at Chorrillos.
In addition, three workovers were 
performed at Chorrillos adding an 
average of 487 Mscfd of production.
Future exploration and development 
activity in Austral basin
In 2018, the company plans to continue 
to invest in its Austral basin licences 
together with its partner, ROCH S.A., 
in order to increase gas production 
in the basin.
Production 
Average daily production for the 
concessions in the Santa Cruz Sur area 
showed marginal decline in the period 
with 3,180 boepd in 2017 as compared to 
3,314 boepd in 2016. This is primarily due 
to a decline in production in the Oceano 
concession where no new drilling or 
workover activity took place in the period.
Exploration and development activity
In 2017, three conventional vertical wells 
were drilled on the Chorrillos concession 
of which two wells were completed. 
These wells targeted the Tobifera 
formation and were an attempt to use 
more modern hydraulic fracturing 
technology to bring more reliable results

Production from the mature Tupungato 
and Atamisqui concessions was slightly 
down with average daily combined 
production of 1,347 boepd in 2017 compared 
to 1,429 boepd in 2016. Production 
at Chañares Herrados declined from 
776 boepd to 514 boepd, primarily due to 
natural decline and no new drilling activity.
Exploration and development activity
Two workovers were performed at 
Tupungato in 2017 both of which were 
acid stimulations aimed at arresting 
decline in the wells. While the production 
increase from the wells was modest, the 
decline curve appears to have flattened.

There was limited new activity on 
Atamisqui in the period with a single 
conventional vertical exploration well 
drilled. The well targeted the Rio Blanco 
formation that had been identified on 
3D seismic. In early 2018, evaluation of 
the well log and preliminary test data 
indicated that, while having discovered 
hydrocarbons and thus being a geologic 
success, the well is tight and will require 
fracture stimulation before its 
commerciality can be determined.
A single workover was performed at 
Chañares Herrados adding perforations 
and acid stimulation. The results of the 
workover remain under evaluation.
Future exploration and development 
activity
In 2018, the company plans to invest in 
additional exploration and development 
wells aimed at increasing oil production 
in the Cuyana basin.

the integration and 
recapitalisation of 
our business
Introduction
The group’s 2017 financials include the 
performance of Trefoil for the full year 
plus Andes from 10 August 2017, and are 
compared with the 2016 financials for 
the standalone performance of Trefoil.
Overview
The group’s revenue for the year was 
US$141.8 million (2016: US$129.3 million). 
Cash flow from operating activities was 
US$7.0 million (2016: US$32.6 million) and 
the group ended the year with US$23.7 
million of cash on hand (2016: US$5.2 
million). Capital expenditure in the year 
was US$82.8 million (2016: US$31.0 million).
Adjusted EBITDAX for 2017 was US$40.6 
million and EBITDAX was US$7.7 million 
(2016: US$48.8 million). 
Oil sales volumes increased to 2,319,184 bbl 
(2016: 1,974,924 bbl) due to the inclusion 
of Andes volumes from August 2017. 
Gas sales volumes were stable at 
165,063 Mm
3
 (2016: 163,800 Mm
3
).
Realised oil prices declined year-on-year 
from US$55.88 per bbl in 2016 to 
US$50.46 per bbl in the current period. 
The decline in oil prices was as a result of 
the regulated pricing regime which 
gradually reduced the oil price month by 
month. From October 2017 the oil price 
has been deregulated. Following 
deregulation realised prices achieved for 
the group’s oil production have, on 
average, been approximately 10% lower 
than the quoted Brent crude benchmark 
price. Realised prices have recovered 
somewhat in 2018 as the Brent crude and 
other international benchmarks have 
trended upwards.

STRATEGIC REPORT
32 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW Realised gas prices increased year on 
year from US$3.08 per MMbtu in 2016 
to US$4.07 per MMbtu in 2017, due 
to improved spot sale prices in the 
Austral basin.
The group realised a net operating loss 
of US$275.0 million (2016: profit 
US$20.2 million). The loss in the current 
year was after non-recurring expenses 
of US$32.9 million (2016: nil), the 
substantial majority of which related 
to costs incurred as a result of the 
combination transaction and are included 
within administrative expenses.
The group recorded an impairment loss of 
US$224.2 million (2016: nil) related to the 
write-down of goodwill recognised as part 
of the combination transaction. In a 
business combination where the purchase 
consideration given takes the form of 
shares, the value of the consideration is 
calculated by reference to the closing 
share price on the day of the transaction. 
At close on 10 August 2017, the company’s 
share price was £0.49. This relatively high 
share price resulted in a calculated 
purchase consideration of US$385.1 million 
that has resulted in transaction goodwill 
of US$224.2 million. The assets and 
operations acquired relate in whole to oil 
and gas production in Argentina and as 
such do not result in access to new 
markets or customers for the group. 
Reflecting this and the fact that oil and 
gas production is a commodity business, 
the directors did not consider 
it appropriate to recognise any of the 
transaction goodwill and as such it has 
been impaired.
Income statement
Gross profit declined year-on-year in 
absolute terms from US$32.2 million 
in 2016 to US$8.4 million in 2017. The 
gross margin percentage also fell 
from 24.8% to 5.9%. The reduction in 
profitability is largely due to the lower 
realised oil price and a natural decline in 
production from the conventional asset 
base, which has a higher proportion of 
fixed costs. 
Operating costs were US$62.8 million in 
2017 compared with US$61.4 million in 
2016. Netback after deduction of royalties, 
turnover tax and operating expenses was 
US$52.6 million compared with US$45.1 
million in 2016. The netback averaged 
US$15.79 per boe in 2017 compared with 
US$16.68 per boe in 2016. Phoenix 
achieved a much higher netback per boe 
on its Neuquina basin production, as 
compared with the Austral and Cuyana 
basin, due to the lower operating expense 
in the Neuquina basin.
Cost of sales includes US$49.3 million of 
depreciation (2016: US$28.2 million) 
related to property, plant and equipment.
The group’s conventional assets continue 
to produce positive cash flows. The group 
will continue to invest in selected drilling 
as well as maintenance and workover 
activity related to the conventional 
production base, so long as the assets 
remain cash positive and the investment 
return is attractive. The cash generated 
from the conventional production assets 
is an important element in the financing 
of the 2018 accelerated business plan.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
33 Administrative expenses increased in the 
year from US$7.6 million to US$40.0 
million largely driven by transaction costs 
incurred of US$24.1 million. These costs 
included costs related to transaction 
advice, legal and financial diligence and 
capital market advisory fees associated 
with the preparation of the AIM 
admission document and associated 
professional diligence. In addition, the 
group incurred US$2.2 million of 
severance costs directly related to the 
integration of the businesses and the 
restructuring of the management and 
administrative teams. An additional 
US$2.4 million related to other one-off 
professional fees and expenses. An 
impairment of US$4.2 million was also 
recognised in respect of a receivable 
previously held in respect of an incentive 
plan for gas production that, in the view 
of the company, is unlikely to be recovered. 
Due to the nature of the above items none 
are expected to recur in future periods.
The group also recognised a loss of 
US$8.2 million (2016: nil) related to the 
relinquishment of the Puesto Pozo 
Cercado block. The licence previously 
held included very high exploration 
commitments that were not in line with 
the longer term strategic direction of the 
group, hence the licence was relinquished.
Balance sheet
The net assets of the group increased 
from US$125.5 million to US$282.5 million 
primarily as a result of the combination 
transaction. The provisional fair value 
of net assets brought onto the balance 
sheet as a result of the combination 
transaction amounted to US$125.1 million 
with goodwill of US$35.8 million 
recognised due to the effect of deferred 
taxes. An analysis of the assets and 
liabilities included in the balance sheet as 
a result of the combination is included in 
note 14 to the financial statements.
Assets acquired in the combination 
transaction and recorded at fair value 
include US$132.2 million in respect of 
producing assets, primarily Chachahuen 
and La Brea, and a further US$161.8 
million related to unconventional and 
exploration upside, primarily Mata Mora 
and Corralera.
In addition to assets acquired in the 
combination transaction, in 2017 the 
group invested US$82.8 million (2016: 
US$31.0 million) primarily in the 
evaluation of the group’s unconventional 
acreage. The focus of this investment 
was continuing the appraisal work related 
to Vaca Muerta and expanding that work 
to include the Tight Agrio formations and 
Chachao formations.
In 2017, the group has also continued to 
invest in further production wells at 
Chachahuen together with its partner, YPF.
The group also substantially upgraded 
the oil processing and fire safety systems 
at the Cerro Mollar concession.

STRATEGIC REPORT
34 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW CONTINUED Financing and liquidity
As part of the combination transaction, 
Mercuria advanced a bridging and 
working capital facility to the company 
for the amount of US$160.0 million. 
Of this amount, US$87.0 million was 
used to redeem outstanding loans and 
other liabilities related to the former 
Andes Energia at the completion date 
with the remainder for investment in 
capital expenditure and general 
corporate purposes.
At 31 December 2017, US$162.6 million 
(including accrued interest) was 
outstanding under the bridging and 
working capital facility. In addition to 
this facility, the group had a total of 
US$29.9 million borrowings locally in 
Argentina at 31 December 2017. The 
Argentina borrowings are with a small 
selection of local banks and carry fixed 
interest rates ranging from 2.2% to 
4.25% for US Dollar denominated loans 
and fixed interest rates ranging from 
20.0% to 27.0% for Argentine Peso 
denominated loans. The term of these 
loans held in Argentina ranges from 
90 days to 24 months.
At 31 December 2017 the group had 
cash on hand of US$23.7 million 
(2016: US$5.2 million). 
In February 2018, Mercuria converted 
US$100.0 million of the bridging and 
working capital facility into ordinary 
shares of the company at a price of £0.37 
per share. The remaining US$60.0 million 
of the bridging and working capital 
facility was restructured into a new 
convertible revolving credit facility of 
US$160.0 million, providing US$100.0 
million of fresh debt capital to the group.
This fresh capital, together with the cash 
expected to be generated from 
operations provides the funding for the 
group to move forward with the 
accelerated business plan in 2018. The 
original bridging and working capital 
facility carried a variable interest rate of 
LIBOR plus 7% that increased on certain 
predetermined dates of the facility. The 
new convertible revolving credit facility 
carries a fixed interest rate of three-
month LIBOR plus 4% resulting in a 
saving of approximately US$11.0 million 
in cash interest in 2018. The loan 
is convertible at £0.45 per share until 
maturity in December 2021.
Taxation
In December 2017, the Argentine federal 
tax authority announced a reform of the 
corporate income tax rules that saw the 
corporate income tax rate reduce from 
35% to 30% for the fiscal years ended 
31 December 2018 and 2019. The corporate 
income tax rate is then set to reduce to 
25% for fiscal year 2020 and beyond. The 
reduction in the corporate income tax rate 
relates to profits reinvested in Argentina. 
Should a company wish to pay a dividend 
then the tax rate for the amount of profit 
being used to support the dividend is 
increased from the relevant marginal rate 
back to 35%. This tax reform will benefit 
the group and reduce its exposure to cash 
taxes during the exploration and 
development phase when the intention is 
to reinvest cash from operations back into 
the business.
Hedging
In January 2018, the group entered a swap 
arrangement with Mercuria to give price 
protection for a portion of its production 
from proved, developed, producing reserves 
at a price of US$65.97 per bbl (Brent 
crude). The hedge was entered to underpin 
the capital expenditure programme for 
2018 alongside the renewed funding 
arrangements put in place with Mercuria 
and announced in February 2018, 
concurrent with the announcement of 
the 2018 accelerated business plan.
Dividend
Given the company’s high growth 
objectives, the directors do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend.

35 How we manage risk to 
deliver our operational 
and commercial goals
Managing business risks
Understanding our principal risks and 
ensuring that we have sufficient controls 
in place is critical to our growth and 
success. Managing business risks and 
opportunities is a key consideration 
in determining and then delivering 
against the group’s strategy. The group’s 
approach to risk management is not 
intended to eliminate risk entirely, but 
provides a means to identify, prioritise 
and manage risks and opportunities. 
This, in turn, enables the group to 
effectively deliver on its strategic 
objectives in line with its appetite for risk.
The board’s responsibility for  
risk management
The board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring the group’s risk management 
and internal control frameworks are 
appropriate and are embedded throughout 
the organisation. Principal risks are 
reviewed by the board and are specifically 
discussed in relation to setting the group 
strategy, developing the business plan 
to deliver that strategy and in agreeing 
annual work programmes and budgets.

Integration activity related to  
risk management
A new board was formed in August 2017 
on completion of the combination 
transaction. Five new members joined the 
board and a number of former members 
resigned or stepped down. At the same 
time the audit and risk committee was 
formally established together with the 
remuneration committee. 
Following the combination the group 
has commenced a comprehensive 
ground up re-assessment of business risk, 
which is being undertaken through 
documented interviews with directors, 
management and staff throughout the 
organisation, in addition to representatives 
of the group’s key advisers. The purpose 
of the interviews is to define a holistic 
view of actual and perceived risks that 
could affect the business and hence the 
ability to deliver on our strategic objectives. 
The board believes that the work 
undertaken represents a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the business. Consideration has been 
given to those which could threaten the 
successful delivery of our strategy, impact 
future performance, solvency or liquidity.
The risks identified are being documented 
in updated risk registers compiled through 
detailed interviews with operations and 
central functions including board members. 
As part of that documentation, the group 
will identify ‘risk owners’ within the 
business and at the board level who 
will be specifically responsible for the 
stewardship of and reporting related to 
risks that have been assigned to them. 
The role of the audit and risk committee
The audit and risk committee assists the 
board in monitoring risk and in discharging 
its risk management responsibilities. 
Performance measures are set to assist 
in objectively assessing business 
performance and risk management. 
A number of performance measures 
will be established as key performance 
indicators that the group and management 
will measure itself against when evaluating 
performance against strategic objectives.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks facing the group  
at the end of 2017 together with a 
description of the potential impacts, 
mitigation measures and the appetite for 
the risk are presented below. The analysis 
includes an assessment of the potential 
likelihood of the risks occurring and the 
potential impact. 
Identified risks are segregated between 
those that we can influence and those 
outside our control. Where we can 
influence risks we have more control over 
outcomes. Where risks are external to the 
business we focus on how we control the 
consequences of those risks materialising.

The group maintains a programme of HSE, asset integrity, upgrade and maintenance activity. 
This activity is supported by a core group of specifically selected specialist contractors. In addition 
to the ongoing exploration and development activity, the group has also implemented a continual 
improvement programme focused on its infrastructure and processing assets. In 2017, this 
programme has included an upgrade of processing equipment and fire safety systems at the 
Cerro Mollar base and the upgrade and remediation work related to oil storage and processing 
facilities at the Tupungato concession.
The group has an active and continued HSE training programme for its own staff and ensures 
that contractors are HSE trained on an ongoing basis. The group promotes an open and 
transparent culture related to HSE matters and incident reporting. HSE performance is 
communicated to the board through the weekly operating and financial summary and is also 
discussed at each board meeting.

Exploration, development 
and production
The ultimate success of the group is based 
largely on its ability to successfully develop its 
assets and to produce oil and gas profitably  
from its unconventional asset base. 
The ability to develop a consistent, repeatable 
and cost-efficient method for drilling and 
completing horizontal wells is core to the 
successful development of unconventional  
oil and gas assets.
Potential impact High
Potential likelihood Medium
The group recognises that the initial development of 
new unconventional assets is complex and technically 
challenging. This can expose the group to higher levels 
of risk, particularly in the early stages of exploration 
appraisal and into initial development. The group has 
some tolerance of this risk and acknowledges the 
need to have effective controls in place in this area.

Profitable 
production
The group understands the importance of technology and operational experience in developing 
unconventional resources. We have made a number of key appointments to the subsurface team 
that bring in-depth and current experience of large scale US shale developments. Our Houston 
office also provides the fulcrum for the transfer of technology and experience from the US 
market with the objective of accelerating the appraisal and development of our unconventional 
assets in Argentina.
The efficient delivery of complex projects underpins the group’s exploration and development 
success and therefore the group seeks to maintain a high degree of control over its assets. Control 
is exercised by assuming operatorship where possible and by obtaining increased or majority 
ownership positions in prospective assets. This was demonstrated at Rio Atuel where the group 
obtained operatorship in late 2017 concurrently with increasing its working interest to 66.67% and 
at Mata Mora and Corralera in the Neuquina basin where the company increased its participation 
to 90% of the retained acreage and assumed operatorship.

Reserve and resource volumes are estimated using the Petroleum Reservoir Management System 
developed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group has a strong focus on subsurface 
analysis and employs industry technical specialists and qualified reservoir engineers. Technical 
specialists work together with the operational teams responsible for delivering asset performance 
to estimate reserve and resource volumes and when determining detailed development 
programmes for the group’s assets.
The reserve and resource analysis performed is subject to internal review and, where appropriate, 
external review. External review is undertaken by an internationally recognised reservoir 
engineering firm and led within that firm by a nominated competent person.
The group participates in licensing rounds in Argentina that are organised at the provincial level. 
In addition, Phoenix has an internal business development group that is focused on optimising 
existing acreage positions through purchase, swap or sale of assets.

Reserve and resource volumes are estimated using the Petroleum Reservoir Management System 
developed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group has a strong focus on subsurface 
analysis and employs industry technical specialists and qualified reservoir engineers. Technical 
specialists work together with the operational teams responsible for delivering asset performance 
to estimate reserve and resource volumes and when determining detailed development 
programmes for the group’s assets.
The reserve and resource analysis performed is subject to internal review and, where appropriate, 
external review. External review is undertaken by an internationally recognised reservoir 
engineering firm and led within that firm by a nominated competent person.
The group participates in licensing rounds in Argentina that are organised at the provincial level. 
In addition, Phoenix has an internal business development group that is focused on optimising 
existing acreage positions through purchase, swap or sale of assets.

Portfolio concentration
The group’s assets are concentrated in 
Argentina. Existing production is principally 
from conventional assets with the main 
exploration and development opportunities 
in unconventional assets. This places emphasis 
on the group’s ability to successfully develop 
its unconventional resources with the main 
long-term growth opportunities in the 
exploration for and development of 
unconventional oil and gas resources.
Potential impact High
Potential likelihood Medium
The group as it exists now was formed with the 
specific objective of exploiting its early entrant 
position in the Argentina unconventional sector. 
This position is derived from licence areas where 
the focus has historically been on conventional 
production, but where the unconventional 
opportunities are substantial.
Argentina has the largest producing shale oil and gas 
resources outside of the US and is open to inward 
investment. The strategic focus of the group and the 
positive investment climate in Argentina means the 
group has a high appetite for this risk.
We accept this risk as our strategy is Argentina 
focused. We diversify in terms of basin, multiple 
licences and areas within each basin, and also in 
terms of production objective.

are principally in the Mendoza and Neuquén provinces.
The group participates in industry groups and initiatives in Argentina and maintains open

Joint venture partners
The inability of joint venture partners to fund

operations. The group’s dependence on others  
is increased where it is not the operator.
Potential impact Medium

In certain of its operations, the group has joint venture 
partners, as either operator or non-operators. The 
group requires high quality partners. It recognises 
that it must accept a degree of exposure to the 
creditworthiness of its partners and evaluates this 
aspect carefully as part of each investment decision.
Where we are not the operator we have less influence 
on the rate of capital expenditure for development.

The group has a non-operated interest in gas licences in the Austral basin where it partners with 
Roch S.A., who also fulfils the role of operator. Phoenix has the right to take over operatorship of 
Santa Cruz Sur at its option.

Following completion of the 2017 combination transaction, Mercuria advanced a US$160.0 million 
bridging and working capital facility to the group. Of this amount, US$87.0 million was used to 
refinance existing debt and obligations with the remainder available to finance the group’s 
operational activities together with its corporate expenditure.
In February 2018, the facility was refinanced with US$100.0 million of the original facility 
converted into share capital of the group and an additional US$100.0 million committed which, 
together with US$60.0 million of the original facility, comprises a new convertible revolving credit 
facility. The interest charge on the new facility is significantly lower than the original facility and 
there are no repayments until mid-2019, reducing the financial burden on the group in the initial

44 SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW Modern Slavery
Personal freedom is a fundamental 
human right. The UK Modern Slavery Act 
was brought into law in 2015 and Phoenix 
fully supports the principles it promotes 
and the personal rights and freedoms it 
protects. We have zero tolerance for any 
form of slavery or any practices that 
could constitute or be perceived as 
slavery, whether they be in our own 
business or those of our suppliers, 
partners or consultants.
Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC)
We have a zero tolerance policy in 
relation to bribery, corruption and 
related unethical conduct. Our policies 
require compliance across our businesses 
with all applicable ABC laws; and in 
particular the UK Bribery Act, the US 
FCPA and the Argentinian Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act.
Substantially all of our operations and 
people are based in Argentina. In 2017, 
Transparency International’s corruption 
perception index ranked Argentina 85 out 
of 180 participating countries worldwide 
with a score of 39. To give context within 
our own operations, this compares to the 
United Kingdom ranked at eight with a 
score of 82 and the United States of 
America ranked at 16 with a score of 75. 
We also operate in a competitive market 
and face competition in securing and 
maintaining licence interests, attracting 
and retaining the best service providers 
and in dealing with unions to secure and 
retain the right people for our business. 
We are very aware of the pressures and 
challenges that we face. However, we are 
committed to upholding the highest levels 
of corporate and operational behaviour 
and our objective is to develop our 
business responsibly and with integrity 
at all levels.
On completion of the August 2017 
combination transaction, one of our first 
tasks was to assess our ABC risks in 
accordance with the UK ‘adequate 
procedures’ guidance and, consequent 
upon that, to update and enhance our 
existing ABC policies and procedures, to 
implement a consistent policy framework 
across the group and ensure appropriate 
governance of ABC matters. 
We now have policies and supporting 
procedures in relation to:
 > Anti-bribery and corruption
 > Gifts and entertainment
 > Third-party representatives
 > Whistle-blowing
As part of our November 2017 board 
meeting that was held in Buenos Aires, 
the board was given specific training 
on ABC by a senior partner from our 
external London legal counsel. 
Immediately following the board 
meeting, an employee-focused version 
of the training was delivered to the 
Buenos Aires office staff.
Following the training in Buenos Aires, 
we organised the same ABC training 
sessions for our Mendoza office and 
other field staff at Tupungato 
delivered by our external Argentina 
legal counsel. 
All of our training and policy materials 
are maintained in Spanish and English. 
The reporting processes, most 
importantly in respect of whistle-
blowing, are also dual language, and 
we provide our staff the opportunity 
to report concerns or potential 
non-compliant behaviour through our 
external legal counsel as an alternative 
to reporting internally.
On completion of the combination transaction 
in 2017, we established a programme of ABC 
training across the group together with 
our London and Buenos Aires external 
legal counsel.

Environment
We are very conscious of the natural 
environment that we operate in and 
work hard to minimise our impact on 
that environment. Phoenix is committed 
to the responsible stewardship of the 
environment and, on the conclusion of 
our operations, to return our sites to the 
condition in which we found them.
The majority of our exploration and 
production operations are located in 
high-altitude desert areas. Site 
preparation mainly consists of clearance 
of scrub and levelling off the ground to 
allow safe access. We seek to operate 
from compact drill sites in order to 
minimise disruption to the natural habitat 
and also plan multiple drill pads at single 
locations, thereby reducing the number of 
locations that we prepare.
Water usage
Unconventional oil and gas operations 
can also use significant amounts of 
water. Together with Halliburton, we have 
developed a fracture fluid system that 
uses produced water that is a natural 
by-product when we produce oil and gas. 
This produced water is separated out and 
stored in tanks for use in operations. This 
system has helped us to minimise the use 
of fresh water in our operations.
Phoenix is also subject to strict operating 
procedures imposed on us by the 
provinces in which we work and related 
to our in-field pipeline networks and river 
crossings. We are required to maintain 
a system of pressure gauges to monitor 
pressure across the pipeline network 
because a drop in pressure is one of the 
main indicators that a line may have been 
breached. We have installed automatic 
shut-off or line break valves at points 
where our lines cross rivers that 
automatically and immediately shut 
off the line when a drop in pressure is 
detected. For our more mature fields, 
we have been actively fulfilling all 
remediation activity required by the 
provinces where we operate including 
remediation related to activity prior to 
our ownership or operatorship.

paramount. Anyone working at, or 
visiting, a Phoenix operational site is 
provided with personal protective 
equipment appropriate to the location 
and will also be allocated to a supervisor 
or guide who is responsible for their 
safety while on site. When there are 
active operations taking place, such as 
drilling operations or facilities upgrade, 
we establish clear boundaries to limit 
access to operational areas.
We have also established a system 
for the regular monitoring of noxious 
or flammable gases at our gathering or 
loading facilities and at our operational 
sites and regularly check lines and 
transmission networks for leaks. In 
2017, we significantly upgraded our fire 
safety systems at our Cerro Mollar 
gathering station.
Our objective is for zero lost time injuries/
incidents and zero spills or leaks.
Unfortunately, in 2017, we had one 
significant reportable incident that 
resulted in a fatality. A contractor 
working on-site was fatally struck by 
a wellhead pump while completing 
a maintenance job at one of our well 
locations. As a company, we were 
deeply, saddened by the incident that 
was ultimately preventable. 
Since the accident we have made a 
thorough review of all our HSE policies 
and particularly those related to ensuring 
strict adherence to our personal protective 
equipment requirements and our 
standard operating procedures. We have 
also recruited a senior HSE specialist 
who is responsible for reinforcing of our 
supervision and monitoring procedures 
as well as undertaking a comprehensive 
and ground-up review of our HSE 
procedures and practices.
Taxation
Phoenix is a responsible operator and 
corporate citizen and is committed to 
adhering to all relevant tax laws in 
all of our jurisdictions. This includes 
compliance at the national, provincial 
or municipal level. Our operations in 
Argentina are subject to a complex 
fiscal system that includes corporate 
income taxes, royalties, sales taxes, VAT, 
payroll taxes and certain banking taxes 
amongst others. In addition, we are 
required to deduct and remit withholding 
taxes in respect of contractor payments 
direct to the Argentinian tax authorities. 
In 2018, we have implemented a new 
accounting system in Argentina that 
will improve the timeliness and accuracy 
of our management reporting but, 
importantly, that has been specifically 
tailored to the unique taxation system 
in Argentina.
Compliance with tax laws and regulations 
is fundamental to our licence to operate 
and is an obligation that we take seriously.
The Strategic Report from pages 1 to 47 was approved by the board and signed 
on its behalf by Anuj Sharma, chief executive officer, on 4 June 2018.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Driving performance 
through culture and 
corporate governance
Dear shareholders
I am pleased to present my first corporate 
governance report to you as chairman. 
2017 was a milestone year for your 
company. The combination transaction 
that completed in August created 
Phoenix, adding size and scale to an 
already enviable asset position in 
Argentina. In Mercuria, we have gained 
a particularly supportive shareholder 
that understands our industry and is able 
to help provide the funding catalyst to 
kickstart our ambitious growth plans.
The year has not been without its 
challenges, however. The company has 
grown in size rapidly as a result of the 
transaction. This growth is not only in 
terms of asset base and opportunities, 
but also in terms of people, operations, 
and compliance and regulatory 
obligations. When businesses grow 
rapidly, there is always a risk that the 
development of effective governance 
systems and processes lags behind, 
giving rise to unnecessary risk.
Our governance focus in 2017 was to 
ensure that we moved forward on 
physical integration of teams and 
locations with urgency while 
simultaneously enhancing and upgrading 
our governance arrangements in a 
robust and meaningful manner.
Effective governance is driven by a 
mindset and attitude that has at its 
core both the desire and the willingness 
to ‘do the right thing’ – whatever the 
situation faced. Effective governance 
operates where common cultures and 
values ensure that the right procedures 
are followed effectively and without 
holding back progress. 
I believe that, while we still have work to 
do, the governance enhancements and 
changes that we have implemented 
provide a solid foundation for continued 
and controlled growth in the future.
Enhancing the effectiveness and 
leadership of your company
I was very pleased to welcome Anuj 
Sharma and Philip Wolfe to the board 
in August. Anuj, as your CEO, brings a 
wealth of operational experience in oil 
and gas and, significantly, a deep 
understanding of the development of the 
US shale industry. Anuj has been working 
in Argentina for five years providing 
operational and technical leadership 
to the legacy Petsa business and, more 
recently, the legacy Andes business. 
Anuj’s understanding of our combined 
asset base and of the environment that 
Phoenix operates in is invaluable to 
the company’s growth plans.

GOVERNANCE
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE programme in order to keep all 
shareholders informed and engaged.
Adopting an enhanced governance 
framework
Phoenix believes that effective corporate 
governance supports enhanced company 
performance while safeguarding the 
interests of all stakeholders, both internal 
and external.
In the AIM admission document that was 
published on announcement of the 
combination, the directors as a group 
made a clear and explicit collective 
statement that we are committed to 
operating your business under the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance. We made a pledge to 
measure ourselves, and report against, 
the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. In doing so, we 
volunteered to assess our governance 
arrangements and performance as if 
we were a FTSE 250 company.
I personally believe that voluntarily 
holding ourselves up to the lens of 
scrutiny that comes with applying and 
reporting against the Code demonstrates 
how seriously we as a board view 
effective governance. 
Embedding our culture and values 
across the business
Promoting and embedding a system of 
culture and values is only possible where 
teams are integrated, work together to 
advance common objectives and are 
willing to put the interests of the whole 
ahead of the interests of the individual.
Our management teams have worked 
hard since August to rapidly integrate 
our business and operations. We took 
the decision to commence integration of 
key systems on day-one post completion 
when we started recording all financial 
transactions in a common system. 
During this post completion phase, we 
commissioned a new integrated financial 
reporting system that was implemented 
in Q4 2017 and went live on 1 January 2018. 
In addition, our reserves and production 
databases have also been consolidated and 
now operate on a common platform. This 
rapid integration of systems and processes 
helps to ensure the integrity of operating 
data and management reporting. 
Taking these decisions so soon after 
completion was not easy and placed 
additional burden on our teams. 
Importantly, however, these achievements 
demonstrate the willingness and desire 
among our people to pursue a common 
objective with open minds and to strive 
to ‘do the right thing’ for the good of 
the company.
In conclusion
As a board we are committed to continual 
improvement and enhancement of our 
governance arrangements. I am very 
proud to lead a team that is both 
committed and forward-looking and 
that keeps the best interests of all of 
our stakeholders at its core.

Throughout
Philip leads the Phoenix finance team 
as CFO and brings more than 25 years’ 
experience of advising international oil 
and gas companies both in raising capital 
and through periods of transformative 
growth. Philip also brings a strong 
understanding of the London market and 
its attendant governance requirements. 
We also welcomed John Bentley and 
Garrett Soden to the board in 2017. 
John and Garrett are both experienced 
independent non-executives with 
significant knowledge of the oil and gas 
industry. Their appointment materially 
enhances governance at the board level.
Finally, Guillaume Vermersch also joined 
the board as one of two Mercuria 
appointees alongside Matthieu Milandri. 
Similar to Anuj, Matthieu has been 
involved with both legacy businesses for 
some years and brings that experience 
to bear in his current role. The continued 
support of our major shareholder is 
important in this initial growth stage 
for Phoenix.
Protecting minority shareholders’ rights
The Phoenix board recognises our 
obligation to minority shareholders 
and we consider that the protection 
of minority shareholders’ rights is 
fundamental to responsible corporate 
governance. As part of the combination, 
the company has implemented a 
relationship agreement with the Mercuria 
group that regulates the influence that 
Mercuria can exercise over the company. 
By implementing such a relationship 
agreement, Phoenix is in line with the UK 
Financial Conduct Authority’s requirements 
for premium listed companies where a 
majority shareholder exists.

Phoenix is committed to a more active 
ongoing market communications

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Corporate governance and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’)
The directors of the company are 
committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance and, whilst the 
company is not required to comply with 
the Code, it has nevertheless elected to 
report against and to substantially 
comply with the provisions of the Code.
Phoenix was formed on 10 August 2017 
following the combination of Andes 
Energia Plc with Trefoil Holdings B.V., 
the holding company for Mercuria’s oil 
and gas operations in Argentina. The 
directors recognised in advance of the 
combination that full compliance with 
the Code would not be possible 
immediately on completion, nevertheless 
the directors and senior management 
team committed to work to continually 
enhance governance procedures in 
place through the integration period.
Notwithstanding, the board considers 
that the group has been substantially in 
compliance throughout the period other 
than in respect of the following:
 > Code Provision A.4.1: The board 
should appoint one of the independent 
non-executive directors to be the 
senior independent director to provide 
a sounding board for the chairman 
and to serve as an intermediary for the 
other directors when necessary. The 
senior independent director should be 
available to shareholders if they have 
concerns, which contact through the 
normal channels of chairman, chief 
executive or other executive directors 
has failed to resolve or for which such 
contact is inappropriate.
 > Company position: In 2017 the board 
considered that, in light of the 
significant combination transaction in 
August and the convening of a new 
board for the company, it was 
appropriate to allow the new board to 
operate for a period of time in order to 
assess which individual director should 
take the role of senior independent 
director. The board expects to make 
this appointment in 2018.
 > Code Provision B.1.2: Except for smaller 
companies, at least half of the board, 
excluding the chair, should comprise 
non-executive directors determined by 
the board to be independent. A smaller 
company should have at least two 
independent directors.
 > Company position: Excluding the 
chairmen, four of the nine directors 
are determined to be independent, 
representing just less than 50% of 
the board. Given the substantive 
reorganisation of the board in the 
period, the directors considered it 
prudent to allow the new board to 
operate for a period of time before 
making any further appointments. In 
addition, the relationship agreement 
in place with the company’s major 
shareholder governs how Matthieu 
Milandri and Guillaume Vermersch 
participate in certain matters, 
thereby increasing the influence 
of the independent directors.
 > Code Provision B.6.1: The board 
should state in the annual report 
how performance evaluation of the 
board, its committees and its individual 
directors has been conducted.
 > Company position: Phoenix was formed 
on 10 August 2017 following the 
combination of Andes Energia Plc 
with Trefoil Holdings B.V., the holding 
company for Mercuria’s oil and gas 
operations in Argentina. Since the 
combination, the focus of the board 
has been on the integration of the 
legacy businesses and the board 
itself has only existed in its current 
form for less than five months. The 
effectiveness of the board, its 
committees and its individual directors 
will be formally assessed in 2018.
The workings of the board
The board was reorganised following the 
August 2017 combination transaction 
to reflect the focus and strategy of the 
enlarged business. The reorganisation 
was also effected with the objective 
of enhancing corporate governance 
and increasing the number of 
independent non-executive directors 
sitting on the board.
On 10 August 2017, five new board 
members were appointed contingent 
on the completion of the combination 
transaction. At the same time, two 
board members resigned and two further 
members, Nigel Duxbury and Juan Carlos 
Esteban, stepped down from the board. 
Nigel remains the company secretary and 
Juan Carlos Esteban continues to work 
for the company.
The board is chaired by Sir Michael Rake 
who has close links to Argentina through 
his other interests and brings a wealth of 
experience and insight to the board and 
to the group. The number of independent 
non-executive directors has been 
increased from two to four with the 
appointments of John Bentley and 
Garrett Soden, both of whom bring 
significant experience in the independent 
oil and gas exploration and production 
sector. Anuj Sharma and Philip Wolfe 
joined the board as executive directors, 
CEO and CFO respectively.
Biographies of all of the directors, that 
include an overview of the skills and 
experience each director brings to the 
board together with details of their 
applicable qualifications, are included on 
pages 52 to 55. The biographies also 
include relevant external appointments 
currently held by each director.
At 31 December 2017, the board included 
eight non-executive directors including the 
chairman, and two executive directors. 
Four of the non-executive directors are 
considered to be independent. Two of the 
non-executive directors, Matthieu 
Milandri and Guillaume Vermersch, were 
proposed by the major shareholder, 
Mercuria Energy Group Limited, and one 
further director, Nicolás Mallo Huergo was 
proposed by Vetalir International S.A., 
which is the next most significant 
shareholder. For the purposes of the 
combination transaction, Vetalir 
International S.A. was considered to be 
the representative minority shareholder.
Our commitment to 
the highest standards 
of corporate governance

GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT All directors are appointed for a period 
of three years. The independence and 
objectivity of the independent directors 
will be formally assessed on an annual 
basis following the fifth anniversary 
of their original appointment. The 
independence and objectivity of the 
board is monitored on an ongoing basis.
The board plans to meet at least eight 
times per calendar year, with up to 
two of those meetings being held in 
Argentina. Additional meetings of 
the full board or its committees are 
organised on an ad-hoc basis as required.
In 2017, one board meeting was held in 
Buenos Aires. Following the meeting, 
two of the independent non-executive 
directors, John Bentley and David 
Jackson, undertook a site visit to the

Attendance at board meetings
The attendance of directors at board 
meetings through the year is as set out 
on the previous page. For the purpose of 
reporting 2017 attendance and reflecting 
the reorganisation of the board on 10 
August 2017, details of attendance are 
shown separately for the period to 10 
August and for the period afterwards.
The board is responsible to the shareholders 
for the proper management of the group. 
The board sets the strategy of the 
group and is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate funding and financing 
arrangements are in place to support 
that strategy. The board reviews and 
approves the business plan and annual 
budgets that are compiled by the 
executive board members, together 
with the senior management team, and 
in doing so provides robust challenge.
Members of the senior management 
team are invited to attend specific board 
meetings where technical or operational 
matters that affect the delivery of the 
group strategy are being discussed. Such 
invitation is made to give the board the 
opportunity to discuss operational plans 
directly with those responsible for 
assisting in formulating and, ultimately, 
executing those plans.
The board meets regularly to review 
trading performance, monitor strategy, 
approve annual budgets and major 
capital expenditure projects, monitor 
changes to the business environment and 
the risks facing the group and to examine 
other significant financing matters. The 
board reports to the shareholders on 
these matters as required or where 
appropriate to provide the shareholders 
with additional information on the group 
and its operations.
The board delegates authority for the 
day-to-day business to management under 
a defined set of delegated authorities that 
cover routine operational matters, financial 
authority limits, contract approval 
procedures, purchasing procedures, 
banking mandates and the hiring of full 
time and temporary staff and consultants.
Committees of the board
Three permanent committees of the 
board have been organised to discharge 
the board’s delegated responsibilities 
in relation to director nomination, 
remuneration and audit and risk matters. 
Each committee reports to the board 
though the respective committee chair. 
The workings of these committees, their 
activities in the year and details of their 
membership are included in each of the 
separate committee reports on pages 60 
to 80.
The report of the remuneration 
committee incudes details of the 
directors’ remuneration, interests in 
options or other equity instruments and 
details of their service contracts. No 
director is involved in decisions related 
to his or her own remuneration.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT CONTINUED Training and access to advice
New directors receive an induction to 
the group on appointment to the board. 
The induction covers the activities and 
operations of the group and the key 
business and financial risks faced. New 
directors have the opportunity to meet 
privately with existing directors, members 
of the senior management team and the 
company’s advisers prior to appointment.
The company provides additional specific 
training to directors on topics considered 
to be relevant to the discharge of their 
duties as directors in addition to holding 
specific information sessions related to 
the assets and operations of the business 
or the legal, legislative, fiscal and political 
environment in which it operates.
During 2017, specific information and 
training sessions were provided to the 
board on matters including:
 > an anti-bribery and corruption update 
held in Buenos Aires and led by Herbert 
Smith Freehills; and
 > presentations by senior management 
related to the subsurface geology 
of the group’s unconventional oil and 
gas assets and the technologies 
expected to be deployed to exploit 
these resources.
All directors have access to the advice and 
services of the company secretary who is 
responsible to the board for ensuring 
compliance with laws and regulations 
applicable to the company. The company 
secretary is also responsible for ensuring 
that board procedures are followed.
The directors, collectively or individually, 
are able to take independent professional 
advice if they believe such advice is 
required in the furtherance of their 
duties. Where such advice is taken, it is 
at the company’s expense.
Provision of information to directors
Board and committee agendas are 
distributed to board members by 
the company secretary in advance of 
meetings. Any supporting information 
or analysis related to agenda items is 
distributed at the same time.
The directors are able to request that 
management prepares any additional 
analysis that they believe is required for 
the assessment of issues or risks facing 
the group or to support board discussion 
related to specific topics.
The board receives a weekly operational 
and financial update that includes key 
metrics related to business performance, 
production and sales and financial 
performance, including liquidity. This 
report includes a discursive summary 
of the activities of the operations and 
finance team for the week, together 
with key items or activities upcoming.
Directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance
The company has directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance in place that provides 
coverage for costs incurred by the directors 
and officers individually in the event of 
a legal or regulatory claim being made 
against the company or the directors.
Directors’ other commitments
The chairman and non-executive 
directors have other third-party 
commitments, including directorships 
of other companies as disclosed in the 
director biographies. The company 
is satisfied that these associated 
commitments have no measurable 
impact on the ability of directors to 
discharge their responsibilities to 
Phoenix effectively.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are 
given high priority by the board. Phoenix 
responds promptly to correspondence 
from shareholders and the group’s website 
contains a range of information on the 
group and its operations, including a 
dedicated investor relations section where 
readers can access historical financial 
reports and presentations as well as RNS 
announcements issued by the company.
The group issues its results promptly and 
also publishes them in full on its website 
(www.phoenixglobalresources.com). 
The board uses the annual general 
meeting to communicate with private 
and institutional shareholders and 
welcomes their participation.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Phoenix recognises that the role of 
its nomination committee, working 
together with the board as a whole, 
is key to promoting effective board 
succession and the alignment of board 
composition with the company’s culture, 
values and strategy.
The nomination committee was formally 
established following the combination 
with Trefoil Holdings B.V. and the creation 
of Phoenix. Prior to the combination, 
the responsibilities of the nomination 
committee had been performed by 
the full board. In recognition of the 
importance of effective integration post 
combination, the board continued to 
discharge the responsibilities of the 
nomination committee through to the 
end of 2017. From 2018, the nomination 
committee will meet at least twice per 
year, and more frequently as necessary, 
and will report on its activities to the 
full board.
Purpose
The nomination committee is formed 
with the purpose of monitoring the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience, 
independence and diversity of the board 
and its committees. Consideration of 
diversity includes gender diversity as well 
as diversity of nationality, background, 
skills and experience. The committee 
is charged with ensuring that there is 
a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the nomination and 
appointment of new directors and that 
appropriate procedures are in place for 
their nomination, selection and training 
of directors.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT Membership
The nomination committee comprises 
three non-executive directors, two of 
whom are required to be independent. 
The committee is chaired by Sir Michael 
Rake, who is also chairman of the board 
of directors. The terms of reference of 
the committee state that it can be 
chaired by either the group chair or by 
an independent non-executive director. 
Where the chair of the committee is 
also the chair of the board, he or she is 
required to absent themselves from 
the discussion or selection of potential 
successors to the chair of the board to 
avoid any potential conflict of interest. 
Similarly, individual members are 
excused from discussion related to 
their own appointment as chair of 
board committees.
Responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the 
nomination committee are to:
 > review the structure, size and 
composition of the board, taking 
account of the group’s strategic 
objectives, and make recommendations 
in regard to any changes required;
 > plan for the succession of directors and 
other senior executives;
 > identify, and nominate for board 
approval, candidates to fill board 
vacancies as they arise;
 > annually review the time commitment 
required of non-executive directors 
together with the number and type 
of external appointments held by 
those directors;
 > make recommendations to the Board 
in regard to the membership of both 
the audit and risk committee and the 
remuneration committee in consultation 
with the relevant committee chair; and
 > assist the board with its periodic 
evaluation of the performance of 
individual directors and of the board 
as a whole.
Diversity
When considering board composition, 
the group policy continues to be that 
the group recruits the best candidate 
available for any position based on merit 
and against objective criteria in order 
to achieve the most effective board. The 
application of this policy is delegated to 
the nomination committee and applied 
throughout the group. The experience of 
the board is very diverse in terms of 
experience and expertise that covers not 
only a wealth of oil and gas operational 
experience, but also extensive technical, 
operational, financial, governance, legal 
and commercial expertise.
The board recognises the strength that 
comes with diversity and the different 
viewpoints and innovative thinking that 
can come from a combination of diverse 
life experiences. We are committed to 
continue to work hard to ensure that we 
recruit the very best candidates 
throughout our business regardless of 
gender, nationality or background.
Priorities for the coming year
The nomination committee’s main priority 
for 2018 will be to undertake the initial 
assessment of the effectiveness of the 
board of directors, its committees and its 
individual directors. This will be a formal 
process and the committee will report its 
findings to the board on conclusion of 
the assessment. The effectiveness 
assessment may involve input from 
external consultants, as considered 
necessary by the committee.
Over-boarding
We are aware of, and have considered, 
recent guidance recommending that 
shareholders vote against the re-election 
of directors where shareholders consider 
that a director is attempting to 
undertake too many roles in addition to 
the responsibilities that come with being 
a member of the company’s board. While 
we are satisfied that the members of the 
board do have sufficient time to fulfil 
their duties, we recognise that some 
directors currently hold a number of 
external appointments. We will continue 
to monitor the workload and external 
commitments of our board members 
as the group’s activities and the level of 
its operations grow and develop in order 
to make sure that each member of our 
board is able to commit sufficient time 
to fulfil their responsibility to the 
shareholders and to their fellow directors 
in an effective manner.
Conflicts of interest
The board operates a policy to identify 
and, where appropriate, manage 
conflicts or potential conflicts with 
the group’s interests. In accordance with 
the directors’ interest provisions in the 
Companies Act 2006, all of the directors 
are required to submit details to the 
company secretary of any situations 
that might give rise to a conflict or 
potential conflict of interest. The board 
monitors and reviews potential conflicts 
of interest on a regular basis.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The audit and risk committee was 
established in August 2017 following the 
combination with Trefoil Holdings B.V. 
Prior to the combination, the 
responsibilities of the audit and risk 
committee were fulfilled by the board 
as a whole.
Purpose
The main function of the audit and 
risk committee is to assist the board 
in fulfilling its financial oversight 
responsibilities by reviewing and 
monitoring the integrity of the financial 
information provided to shareholders 
and the group’s system of internal control 
and risk management. These systems 
have been established for the purpose of 
providing relevant, accurate and timely 
information for both external reporting 
and internal management purposes. As 
part of this role, the committee is also 
responsible for the internal and external 
audit processes and the group’s 
compliance with laws, regulations and 
other ethical codes of practice.
Membership
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, the audit and risk 
committee consists exclusively of 
non-executive directors. The terms 
of reference for the committee require 
that it has at least three members, 
the majority of whom are independent. 
The members are all appointed by the 
board on the recommendation of 
the nomination committee and in 
consultation with the committee chair. 
The chair of the board may be a member 
of the committee, though only where 
he or she is considered independent

GOVERNANCE
AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT on appointment as chair of the board, 
but cannot chair the committee. 
Sir Michael Rake currently sits on the 
audit and risk committee.
In accordance with Code provision C.3.1, 
at least one member of the committee 
is required to have recent and relevant 
financial experience. The board is 
satisfied that Garrett Soden fulfils 
this requirement.
Meetings are normally attended by the 
chief financial officer and key members 
of the finance team as appropriate 
and at the invitation of the committee. In 
addition, representatives of the external 
auditor are invited to attend meetings. 
The committee chair maintains an ongoing 
dialogue with key individuals involved in 
the company’s governance, including the 
external auditor. The chair also meets 
privately with the external auditor at 
least once per year, but will meet more 
frequently as circumstances dictate.
Responsibilities
The principal responsibilities of the audit 
and risk committee are:
 > to monitor the integrity of the financial 
statements, including the annual and 
interim financial statement reporting 
required by both the London and 
Buenos Aires stock exchanges, 
together with any other formal 
or informal reporting regarding 
financial reporting, such as analyst 
and investor presentations, annual 
results presentations and financial 
information contained in press releases 
and other communications;
 > to report to the board on financial 
reporting issues and significant 
judgments, including matters 
discussed with the external auditor;
 > provide oversight of the work of 
the external auditor and make 
recommendations to the board 
in relation to their appointment 
or reappointment, including related 
to the re-tendering or termination 
of the external audit contract;
 > provide oversight of the relationship 
with the external auditor, including 
agreeing terms of reference, scope 
and remuneration (including both 
audit and non-audit fees);
 > maintenance of internal controls 
and risk management systems 
together with arrangements for 
internal audit; and
 > monitoring policies and procedures 
related to ethics, fraud and  
whistle-blowing.
Meeting frequency
The committee will meet at least four 
times per year with the calendar of 
meetings specifically designed around 
the key phases of the external financial 
reporting cycle, including audit planning, 
interim results, preliminary announcement 
and the conclusion of the annual financial 
statement audit.
In relation to the 2017 reporting cycle, the 
committee has met four times since its 
formation on 10 August 2017. A summary 
of the items discussed at each meeting is 
set out on page 62.
Internal audit
The group does not currently have an 
internal audit function and no internal 
audit reviews were undertaken in 2017.
Phoenix was formed on 10 August 2017 
and since that time the focus of the 
board and management team has been 
on the operational and administrative 
integration of the legacy businesses 
comprising the new Phoenix group. This 
has included relocating the Buenos Aires 
administrative offices of Trefoil and 
Andes to a single location and the 
opening of a new corporate head office 
in London. In Mendoza, the two offices 
have been integrated, albeit the company 
still retains two locations. The group has 
also established a technical centre in 
Houston to facilitate the transfer of 
hands-on experience of large scale shale 
projects and the specific technologies 
developed in the United States to support 
these developments.
In the same period, the group has 
implemented an integrated financial 
accounting system in Argentina and has 
updated and continued to refine the 
system of internal control over the 
operational and financial activities of 
the group.
The board did not commission any 
specific internal audit reviews in 2017 
in order to allow group management 
to focus on advancing the primary 
post-close integration activities.
Given the current size of the group and 
its level of activity, it is likely that any 
operational or financial reviews that 
either management or the board 
consider appropriate during 2018 will 
be undertaken via a specialist internal 
audit provider.
63
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017 External audit
The group has elected to comply with 
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that require FTSE 350 
companies to put the external audit 
contract out to tender at least every ten 
years. The committee’s terms of 
reference require the group to consider 
whether to put the audit out to tender 
after five years and annually thereafter. 
PwC was first appointed as external 
auditor for the year ended 31 December 
2012 and their appointment was 
reconsidered in light of the tendering 
requirements after the 2016 audit and 
will be considered again on conclusion 
of the 2017 audit.
Non-audit services
The audit and risk committee has 
established a policy for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor 
to ensure that these services do not 
impair the auditor’s independence or 
objectivity. The policy identifies those 
services that the auditor may provide, 
services that are precluded in normal 
circumstances and sets guidance around 
the level of non-audit fees that the 
committee considers to be acceptable 
depending on the type of service being 
proposed and the circumstances related 
to the provision of that service.
In 2017, a significant amount of non-audit 
fees were incurred primarily related to 
reporting accountant services associated 
with the combination with Trefoil 
Holdings B.V. that required specific public 
and private reporting and due diligence 
associated with that reporting owing 
to the reverse nature of the transaction. 
The type and nature of reporting related 
to the combination that was provided 
by PwC to both the group and to its 
advisers is customary for UK capital 
markets transactions.
In considering which services the external 
auditor can and cannot provide, the 
governing principles applied by the 
audit and risk committee are that 
the auditor cannot:
 > audit its own work;
 > perform management functions; or
 > act as an advocate for the group.
Nevertheless, each piece of work that it is 
proposed that the external auditor could 
provide is formally assessed prior to its 
commencement. In addition, the scope 
of individual projects is monitored 
throughout their delivery to identify any 
potential conflicts as work progresses.

2017 year end significant accounting issues
The significant issues considered by the audit and risk committee in 2017 in relation 
to the financial statements and how each of these were addressed are shown in 
the table below:
Significant accounting issue Consideration and conclusion
Accounting for the 
combination 
transaction
On 10 August 2017, the former Andes Energia plc 
(Andes) acquired 100% of the issued share capital 
of Trefoil Holdings B.V. (Trefoil). 
The transaction was deemed to represent a reverse 
takeover under IFRS 3, Business combinations, and so 
Trefoil is treated as the acquirer and the comparative 
figures in the financial statements represent those 
of Trefoil.
The committee assessed management’s accounting 
treatment for the combination transaction and the 
associated key judgments around the identity of the 
accounting acquirer and acquiree. The committee 
also reviewed the presentation of the financial 
statements including the disclosures related to 
the combination transaction in note 14 of the 
financial statements. 
Acquisition accounting 
and purchase price 
allocation
IFRS requires that acquisitions are accounted for at 
fair value. The consideration given is fair valued and 
is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in relation to their assessed fair value.
The assessment of fair value is subjective and can 
be complex. It involves a number of different 
valuation methodologies depending on the nature 
of the individual asset or liability being assessed. 
The committee assessed management’s accounting 
treatment for the acquisition and the purchase price 
allocation exercise. The committee considered the 
valuation reports of the independent experts as 
well as management’s judgments around the fair 
value adjustments to the working capital balances 
and the treatment of the goodwill arising. The 
committee reviewed disclosures related to the 
purchase price allocation exercise in note 14 of the 
financial statements.
Impairment of 
long-term assets  
and goodwill
Management is required to assess assets for 
impairment where indicators exist that the asset 
may not be fully recovered. 
Two principal assets were considered to be impaired 
being the goodwill recognised on the business 
combination and also the Puesto Pozo Cercado 
concession that was relinquished in the year.
The committee considered management’s assessment 
of the carrying value of the goodwill and the factors 
related to the relinquishment of Puesto Pozo Cercado 
including the rationale for the impairment recognised. 
The committee also considered the calculation of 
the impairment charge recorded in each case. The 
committee agrees with management’s assessment 
that no other indicators of impairment exist in 
respect of the group’s other assets.

STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Dear Shareholder
As chairman of the remuneration 
committee, I am pleased to present 
the first directors’ remuneration report 
for Phoenix.
Although Phoenix is currently London 
Stock Exchange AIM quoted, the board 
recognises the importance of shareholder 
transparency and standards of governance. 
The board, at the time of the reverse 
takeover, indicated its intention to report 
against and comply with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. As 2017 is a transition 
year, this report is split into four sections 
with the first section including the 
information required to be disclosed as an 
AIM quoted company and the subsequent 
two sections detailing the information 
required by the reporting regulations that 
would be applicable were the company 
listed on the London Stock Exchange 
main market including:
 > the directors’ remuneration policy; and
 > our annual report on remuneration, 
detailing director remuneration from 
Admission to 31 December 2017, and 
the proposed implementation of our 
remuneration policy for 2018.
Our approach to developing Phoenix’s 
remuneration policy
Our aim is for remuneration at Phoenix to:
 > attract and retain individuals of a high 
calibre and appropriate experience;
 > align incentives with the company’s 
strategic goals and business plans;
 > deliver rewards for strong and 
sustainable business performance; and
 > align the interests of the executive 
directors with those of shareholders.
The remuneration committee intends 
to keep its approach to remuneration 
under regular review for continued 
appropriateness and in light of market 
practice and regulatory requirements 
and corporate governance best-practice 
as applicable to the company over time.
Our remuneration policy (set out on pages 
67 to 75) has been developed to reinforce 
these objectives. The committee believes 
that its approach to remuneration will 
support the delivery of these aims while 
remaining appropriately flexible so as to 
evolve as the group establishes itself 
as a listed company.
Looking ahead to 2018
Implementation of executive director 
remuneration policy for 2018 base salary
Executive director salaries will remain at 
current levels for 2018, and will be first 
reviewed later in the year (with any 
increases that may be awarded being 
effective 1 January 2019).
Annual bonus
For 2018, the executive directors each 
have a maximum bonus opportunity of 
100% of salary. The on-target bonus 
opportunity is 50% of maximum. Two-
thirds of any bonus earned will be paid in 
cash, with the remainder being deferred 
Phoenix shares for a further three-year 
period, vesting pro-rata annually.
The annual bonus for 2018 will be based 
on quantitative corporate KPIs and 
qualitative individual KPIs.

receive conditional awards of shares 
under the Phoenix LTIP, with a face value 
of 200% of salary for each of the CEO 
and CFO.
The 2018 LTIP will vest after three years, 
subject to the company’s three-year 
relative and absolute TSR performance 
as detailed on page 79.
Relative TSR has been selected by the 
committee to closely align executive 
interests with those of shareholders. 
Phoenix TSR performance will be 
measured over the period commencing 
10 August 2017 and compared to peer 
group companies on the basis of 
TSR rank.
Absolute TSR has been selected by the 
committee to align LTIP outcomes 
directly with long-term shareholder 
returns. The performance target ranges 
have been set at stretching levels and 
commensurate with the targets set for 
the relative TSR element of the LTIP 
(median to 75th percentile).
To provide further alignment with 
shareholders, LTIP awards will be subject 
to an additional post-vesting holding 
period. To the extent an award vests 
subject to three-year performance, 
shares will be required to be held for 
a further two years (i.e. until the fifth 
anniversary of the date of grant).
In line with our policy, LTIP awards will 
also be subject to the group’s malus and 
clawback provisions.
Implementation of non-executive 
director remuneration policy for 2018
Non-executive director fees will remain 
at the levels set at the time of Admission. 
As appointees of the Group’s significant 
shareholders, Matthieu Milandri and 
Guillaume Vermersch have waived their 
right to receive fees in connection with 
their appointment as non-executive 
directors of the company.
We trust that you find that this report 
sets out clearly our policy and how we 
intend to implement it, as well as the 
rationale for our decisions. The committee 
believes that the policy and the approach 
to its implementation in 2018 are in the 
best interests of all shareholders.

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
Although the company (being AIM quoted) is not subject to the Directors’ Remuneration Regulations 2008 ( the “Regulations”), 
the committee recognises the importance of transparency and standards of governance. This report has therefore been prepared 
largely in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013, as though the company were listed on the London Stock Exchange 
Main Market.
This section of the report sets out the remuneration policy for the directors that has been developed to reflect our remuneration 
principles, and that was outlined in the company’s admission document dated 24 July 2017.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
To attract and retain 
talented executive 
directors to deliver the 
group’s strategy by 
ensuring base salaries 
and the implied total 
package are competitive 
in relevant talent markets, 
while not overpaying.
Base salaries will be reviewed 
by the committee annually, and 
benchmarked periodically 
against comparable roles at 
international Exploration & 
Production peers, as well as 
UK-listed companies of similar 
size and complexity.
In deciding base salary levels, 
the committee considers 
personal performance 
including the individual’s 
contribution to the 
achievement of the group’s 
strategic objectives. The 
committee will also consider 
employment conditions and 
salary levels across the group, 
and prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are set on a case-by-
case basis to reflect the role 
and the experience and 
qualifications of the individual.
Base salary increases for the 
executive directors will not 
normally exceed the average 
increase awarded to the wider 
workforce, other than in 
exceptional circumstances 
such as a material change 
in responsibilities, size or 
complexity of the role, or if 
a director was intentionally 
appointed on a below-
market salary.
Base salaries are disclosed 
in the annual report on 
remuneration.
n/a
Pension
To provide an appropriate 
structure and level of 
post-retirement benefit 
for executive directors 
in a cost-efficient 
manner that reflects 
local market norms in 
the relevant jurisdiction.
Executive directors may receive 
a contribution to a personal 
pension plan, a cash allowance 
in lieu, or a combination thereof.
Salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Executive directors are eligible 
for a company contribution 
from the group of up to 10% 
of base salary.
Details of the pension 
contributions made to 
executive directors during the 
year are disclosed in the annual 
report on remuneration.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Other benefits
To provide non-cash 
benefits which are 
competitive in the market 
in which the executive 
director is employed.
The group may provide 
benefits in kind including, but 
not limited to, a company car 
or car allowance, private 
medical insurance (or 
allowance in lieu for the 
executive directors and their 
family), permanent health 
insurance, and life insurance. 
Executive directors may also 
be provided certain other 
benefits to take account of 
individual circumstances such 
as, but not limited to, payment 
of tax, financial, and/or legal 
adviser fees, expatriate 
allowance, relocation expenses, 
housing allowance and tax 
equalisation (including 
associated interest, penalties 
or fees plus, in certain 
circumstances or where the 
committee consider it 
appropriate, any tax incurred 
on such benefits). Executive 
directors may also be offered 
any other future benefits made 
available either to all senior 
employees globally or in the 
region in which the executive 
director is employed. 
Benefits for executive directors 
are set at a level which the 
committee considers appropriate 
compared to wider employee 
benefits, as well as competitive 
practices in relevant markets.
It is not anticipated that the 
costs of benefits provided will 
increase significantly in the 
financial years over which this 
policy will apply, although the 
committee retains discretion to 
approve non-material 
increases in cost. In addition, 
the committee retains 
discretion to approve a higher 
cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. to facilitate 
recruitment, relocation, 
expatriation, etc.) or in 
circumstances where factors 
outside the group’s control 
have changed (e.g. market 
increases in insurance costs).
Benefits in respect of the year 
under review are disclosed in the 
annual report on remuneration.
n/a
Annual bonus
To incentivise executive 
directors to deliver strong 
financial and operational 
performance on an annual 
basis and reward the 
delivery of the group’s 
strategic aims that will 
underpin the longer-term 
health and growth of 
the business.
Deferral into shares 
enhances alignment 
with shareholders.
Performance measures, 
targets and weightings are set 
by the committee at the start 
of the year. After the end 
of the financial year, the 
committee determines the 
level of bonus to be paid, 
taking into account the extent 
to which these targets have 
been achieved.
To the extent that the 
performance criteria have been 
met, one-third of the annual 
bonus earned will normally be 
compulsorily deferred into 
shares under the Deferred 
Bonus Plan. Deferred shares 
vest pro-rata annually over 
three years. The remainder of 
the bonus will be paid in cash.
Dividends may accrue on 
deferred bonus shares over 
the deferral period and, if so, 
will be paid (in cash or 
additional shares) on deferred 
shares that vest at the time 
these are released to the 
executive director.
Malus provisions apply to the 
deferred bonus in certain 
circumstances (as set out in 
the notes to the policy table).
The maximum annual 
bonus opportunity is 100% 
of base salary.
The payout for on-target 
performance is 50% of 
maximum; threshold 
performance results 
in zero payout.
Bonuses will be based primarily 
on a combination of stretching 
annual business and individual 
objectives. Business objectives 
(whether financial, operational 
or non-financial/strategic) will 
be selected to reflect the group’s 
short-term KPIs, financial goals 
and strategic drivers. The 
weighting of measures will be 
determined by the committee, 
but will always include a strong 
focus on business performance.
The committee may adjust the 
formulaic annual bonus 
outcomes (including to zero) to 
avoid unintended outcomes, 
align pay outcomes with 
underlying group performance 
and ensure fairness to 
shareholders and participants.
Further details will be disclosed 
in the relevant annual report on 
remuneration. Performance 
targets set for each year will be 
disclosed retrospectively (to the 
extent they are considered not 
to be commercially sensitive), 
usually in the annual report on 
remuneration in respect of the 
year to which such performance 
targets relate. 70

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity Performance measures
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
To align the interests of 
executive directors and 
shareholders in growing 
the value of the group over 
the long term.
Executive directors are eligible 
to receive annual awards over 
Phoenix shares under the 
LTIP either in the form of 
conditional share awards 
or nil cost options.
Awards granted under the 
LTIP to executive directors will 
have a performance period 
of at least three years. If no 
entitlement has been earned 
at the end of the relevant 
performance period, awards 
will not vest. Shares received 
as a result of an award vesting 
will normally be subject to 
an additional two-year 
holding period.
Dividends may accrue on LTIP 
awards over the vesting period 
and, if so, will be paid (in 
additional shares or in cash) on 
shares that vest at the end of 
the vesting period.
LTIP awards granted to 
executive directors will be 
subject to malus and clawback 
provisions, as set out in the 
notes to the policy table.
The maximum annual LTIP 
opportunity is 200% of 
base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, 
the remuneration committee 
has discretion to make awards 
of up to 300% of base salary.
25% of an award will vest if 
performance against each 
performance condition is at 
threshold and 100% if it is at 
maximum, with straight-line 
vesting in between.
Further details of the LTIP 
awards granted to each of the 
executive directors will be 
disclosed in the relevant annual 
report on remuneration.
Vesting of the LTIP is subject to 
continued employment during 
the performance period and the 
achievement of performance 
conditions aligned with the 
group’s strategic plan and 
shareholder value creation. The 
performance conditions may 
include market-based measures, 
such as total shareholder return, 
and internal measures of 
financial or operational 
performance. Performance 
measures will be selected by the 
remuneration committee at the 
start of each cycle.
The committee may adjust the 
formulaic LTIP outcome to ensure 
it takes account of any major 
changes to the group (e.g. as a 
result of merger and acquisitions 
activity) and is a fair reflection 
of the underlying financial 
performance of the group over 
the performance period.
Further details, including the 
performance targets attached 
to the LTIP in respect of each 
year will be disclosed in the 
relevant annual report on 
remuneration (subject to these 
being considered not to be 
commercially sensitive). 71

Notes to the policy table
Malus and clawback policy
Malus and clawback may be applied to the deferred bonus share element of the annual bonus and LTIP awards in cases of gross 
misconduct by the executive director or material financial misstatement in the audited financial results of the group. Deferred 
bonus shares will be subject to malus over the deferral period, and LTIP awards will be subject to malus over the vesting period 
and clawback from the vesting date to the second anniversary of the relevant vesting date.
Share ownership guidelines
The committee recognises the importance of aligning executive directors’ and shareholders’ interests through significant 
shareholdings in the group. The group’s policy (as published in the admission document) is to require the CEO to build up a 
shareholding of 200% of base salary (150% of salary for other executive directors), and to retain these shares until retirement from 
the board of directors. 50% of any net vested share awards (i.e. after sales to meet tax liabilities) must be retained until the 
minimum shareholding requirements are met.
Use of discretion
The committee may apply its discretion (as set out below) when agreeing remuneration outcomes, to help ensure that the 
implementation of our remuneration policy is consistent with the guiding principles for Phoenix remuneration.
Payments from outstanding awards
The committee reserves the right in certain circumstances to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office 
(including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) where the terms of the payment were 
agreed before the policy came into effect; or at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the group provided, that 
in the opinion of the committee, the payment was not agreed in consideration of the individual becoming a director of the group. 
For these purposes, payments include the satisfaction of variable remuneration awards previously granted, but not vested, 
to an individual.
Minor changes to policy
The committee retains discretion to make minor, non-significant changes to the policy set out above (for reasons including, but 
not limited to, regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation) without 
reverting to shareholders for approval for that amendment, where seeking such shareholder approval would be disproportionate 
to the discretion being exercised.
LTIP awards
The committee may exercise its discretion as provided for in the LTIP rules. The committee may also adjust the number of 
shares comprising an LTIP award (or the exercise price if the award comprises options) in the event of a variation of share capital, 
demerger, special dividend, distribution or any other corporate event which may affect the current or future value of an award. 
It is intended that any adjustment will be made on a neutral basis, i.e. to not be to the benefit or detriment of participants.
Remuneration policy for the wider workforce
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on principles that are broadly consistent with those applied to executive 
director remuneration, with a common objective of driving financial performance and the achievement of strategic objectives, and 
contributing to the long-term success of the group. Remuneration supports our ability to attract, motivate and retain skilled and 
dedicated individuals, whose contribution continues to be a key factor in the group’s success.
Annual salary reviews take into account group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in 
comparable companies. Pension entitlements and other benefits vary according to jurisdiction, to ensure these remain appropriately 
competitive for the local market. Some employees below executive level are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes; 
opportunities and performance measures vary by organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role.
Employee ownership of Phoenix shares is promoted across the group. Senior executives are eligible for LTIP awards on similar terms 
as the executive directors, although award opportunities are lower and vary by organisational level. Other executives are eligible for 
restricted share awards on a discretionary basis. Phoenix intends to offer all employees the opportunity to participate in a share 
purchase plan, to be implemented in 2018.
Approach to target setting and performance measure selection
The committee considers carefully the selection of performance measures at the start of each performance cycle, taking into 
consideration the group’s strategic objectives and the macroeconomic environment.
Annual bonus measures are selected to align with the group’s short-term KPIs. LTIP performance measures are selected to ensure 
they align with the group’s strategy and long-term shareholder value creation. Measures may change from cycle to cycle (subject 
to the remuneration policy), and details of the bonus and LTIP measures selected will therefore be disclosed in the relevant Annual 
report on remuneration.
Targets are set to be stretching but achievable over the performance period, taking account of multiple relevant reference points, 
including typical performance ranges for those measures at other industry peers and FTSE-listed companies of comparable size 
and complexity.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis

‘On-target’: fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus (50% of maximum) and threshold LTIP vesting (25% of maximum).
‘Minimum’: fixed remuneration only, being the only element of executive directors’ remuneration not linked to performance.
Executive Director service contracts
In accordance with general market practice, each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract. The executive directors’ 
service contracts (copies of which are available to view at the group’s registered office) took effect on Admission (10 August 2017) 
and are each terminable on 12 months’ notice from the group and 12 months’ notice from the executive director (save in the event 
the company serves an immediate termination notice, in specified circumstances of constructive dismissal). This practice may also 
apply for any new executive directors. The following table shows the date of the service contract for each executive director that 
served during the year:
Executive director Position Date of appointment Date of service agreement
Anuj Sharma CEO Admission (10 August 2017) 24 July 2017
Philip Wolfe CFO Admission (10 August 2017) 24 July 2017
Exit payments policy
The group’s policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the 
relevant contractual terms in the executive’s service contract and the circumstances of termination. Executive directors’ contracts 
provide for the payment of a pre-determined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances (but 
excluding circumstances where the group is entitled to dismiss without compensation), comprising base salary in respect of the 
unexpired portion of the notice period. Termination payments may take the form of payments in lieu of notice. Payments would 
normally be made on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.
In addition to contractual provisions, the table below summarises how awards under each discretionary incentive plan are typically 
treated in specific circumstances, with the final treatment remaining subject to the committee’s discretion as provided under the 
rules of the plan. In the event of termination, any outstanding shares or option granted under all-employee schemes will be treated 
in accordance with the rules of the scheme, which typically do not include discretion. 73

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT CONTINUED
Approach to remuneration on recruitment
External appointments
In cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director from outside the group, the committee may make use of all existing 
components of remuneration set out in the policy table, up to the disclosed maximum opportunities (where applicable).
When determining the remuneration package for a new executive director, the committee will take into account all relevant factors 
based on the circumstances at that time to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of the group and its shareholders. 
This may include factors such as the experience and skills of the individual, internal comparisons and relevant market data.
The committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer, i.e. over and above the maximum limits on incentive opportunities set out in the policy table. In doing so, the 
committee will consider relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the likelihood of those 
conditions being met, and the time over which they would have vested. The intention is that the expected value of any buy-out 
award would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements, and that the structure will replicate (as far as 
reasonably possible) that of the awards being forfeited. The committee may consider it appropriate to structure ‘buy-out’ awards 
differently from the structure described in the policy table, exercising its discretion under the LTIP rules to structure awards in other 
forms (including market value options, restricted shares, forfeitable shares or phantom awards) as the remuneration committee 
may determine in this context.
Internal promotion
Where a new executive director is appointed by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees, as detailed above (other than in relation to ‘buy-out’ awards). Any commitments made prior to an individual’s 
promotion will continue to be honoured even if they would not otherwise be consistent with the policy prevailing when the 
commitment is fulfilled, although the group may, where appropriate, seek to revise an individual’s existing service contract on 
promotion to ensure it aligns with other executive directors and good practice.
Disclosure on the remuneration structure of any new executive director, including details of any ‘buy-out’ awards, will be disclosed 
in the annual report on remuneration for the year in which recruitment occurred.
External appointments held by executive directors
Executive directors may not accept any external appointment without the consent of the board, there being no conflicts of interest 
and the appointment not leading to deterioration in the individual’s performance. Executive directors may retain the fees paid for 
such roles. Details of external appointments will be included in the annual report on remuneration.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the group
The committee seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employees as part of its broader employee engagement 
strategy, considers pay practices across the group and is mindful of the salary increases applying across the rest of the business 
in relevant markets when considering any increases to salaries for executive directors. However, the committee does not currently 
consult with employees on its executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
The committee will take into consideration all shareholder views received during the year and at the annual general meeting 
each year, as well as guidance from shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping the group’s implementation of 
its remuneration policy, as well as any future changes to policy. 75

Fee levels are reviewed annually taking into account 
external advice on best practice and competitive levels, 
in particular at other FTSE companies of comparable 
size and complexity. Time commitment and 
responsibility are also taken into account when 
reviewing fees.
Chairman and non-executive director fees are paid 
in cash.
The committee reimburses the chairman and 
non-executive directors for reasonable expenses 
in performing their duties and may settle any tax 
incurred in relation to these expenses. Non-executive 
directors will be reimbursed by the group for expenses 
(including travel and accommodation) as required to 
fulfil their non-executive duties.
The fees paid to the chairman and non-executive directors 
are disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
Fee increases will be applied 
taking into account the 
outcome of the annual review.
The maximum aggregate 
annual fee for all non-
executive directors (including 
the chairman) as provided in 
the group’s articles of 
association is £750,000.
n/a
Non-executive directors are not eligible to join the group’s pension, incentives or share schemes or to participate in any of the 
group’s other benefit arrangements.
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the committee will use the policy set out above.
Non-executive director letters of appointment
None of the non-executive directors has a service contract with the group. They do have letters of appointment, and will be 
submitted for re-election annually. The dates relating to the appointments of the chairman and non-executive directors who served 
during the reporting period are as follows:

Admission, the committee formally appointed Mercer as its independent adviser. Mercer reports to the committee chairman. 
Mercer is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK (www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Mercer does not have any 
other connection with the group and is considered to be independent by the committee. Fees paid to Mercer are determined on 
a time and materials basis, and totalled £65,058 (excluding expenses and VAT) from Admission to 31 December 2017 in their 
capacity as advisers to the committee.

Incentive outcomes for the year ended 31 December 2017
Annual bonus in respect of performance in the 2017 financial year
As the period from admission is not a full year, the awards were determined predominantly on a discretionary basis. One-third of 
the award will be deferred as an award over shares that will vest pro-rata annually over three years. The balance of the award will 
be paid in cash.
For 2017, the CEO waived his right to an award. The CFO had a maximum opportunity of 100% of his annual salary. The on-target 
opportunity was 50% of the maximum.

Annual bonus
For 2018, the executive directors will each have a maximum bonus opportunity of 100% of salary. The on-target bonus opportunity 
is 50% of maximum. Two-thirds of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remainder deferred into Phoenix shares for a 
further three-year period, vesting pro-rata annually.
The annual bonus for 2018 will be based on quantitative corporate KPIs and qualitative individual KPIs.
The committee will normally disclose the annual bonus targets retrospectively in next year’s annual report on remuneration. In the 
event the board considers these targets to remain commercially sensitive, they will be disclosed as soon as possible once they are no 
longer considered to be sensitive.
In line with our policy, deferred bonuses in respect of the 2018 financial year will be subject to the group’s malus provisions 
(see page 71 for further details).
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In 2018, the executive directors will each receive conditional awards of shares under the Phoenix LTIP, with face values of 200% 
of salary.
The 2018 LTIP will vest after three years, subject to the following performance measures and targets:
Measure Weighting
Threshold 
(25% vesting)
Maximum  
(100% vesting)
3-year relative TSR 50% Median 75th percentile
3-year absolute TSR 50% 8% p.a. 16% p.a.
Relative TSR has been selected by the committee to closely align executive interests with those of shareholders. Phoenix’s TSR 
performance will be measured over the three-year period commencing on 10 August 2017, and compared to the following 
companies on the basis of TSR rank:
Company Country of listing
Amerisur Resources plc United Kingdom
Cairn Energy PLC United Kingdom
Canacol Energy Ltd Canada

Hurricane Energy plc United Kingdom
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC United Kingdom
Ophir Energy plc United Kingdom
Parex Resources Inc Canada
Premier Oil plc United Kingdom
SOCO International plc United Kingdom
Sound Energy plc United Kingdom
Tullow Oil plc United Kingdom
Absolute TSR has been selected by the committee to align LTIP outcomes with long-term shareholder returns. The performance 
target ranges have been set at stretching levels and commensurate with the targets set for the relative TSR element of the LTIP 
(median to 75th percentile).
To provide further alignment with shareholders, LTIP awards will be subject to an additional post-vesting holding period. To the 
extent an award vests subject to three-year performance, shares will be required to be held for a further two years (i.e. until the 
fifth anniversary of the date of grant).
In line with our policy, LTIP awards will also be subject to the group’s malus and clawback provisions. 80

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Group directors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2017
The directors of Phoenix Global Resources plc (formerly Andes Energia plc) present their Annual Report and audited financial

held on 28 June 2018.
General information
The company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 (Registered no. 
05083946). The company operates two overseas branches, one each in Mendoza (Argentina) and Bogota (Colombia).
The immediate parent of the company is Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited, a subsidiary of Mercuria Energy Group Limited, 
the ultimate beneficial owner of both the group and the company.
Change of name
On 10 August 2017, the company changed its name to Phoenix Global Resources plc. The change of name was made following 
completion of the combination transaction with Trefoil Holdings B.V. and prior to the readmission of the enlarged group to the 
AIM market of the London Stock Exchange.
Share capital
The company’s share capital during the year consisted of ordinary shares of £0.10 each (ordinary shares). Each ordinary share 
carries one vote. Prior to the 10 August 2017 combination with Trefoil Holdings B.V. there were 605,558,515 ordinary shares in issue.
The transaction consideration was satisfied by the issue of 1,899,106,385 ordinary shares in the company to Upstream Capital 
Partners VI Limited in return for 100% of the issued share capital of Trefoil Holdings B.V. Also on 10 August 2017 a further 14,766,666 
were issued to Mercuria Energy Asset Management B.V. related to deferred consideration from previous transactions. Following 
the admission to trading of an additional 1,913,873,051 ordinary shares on 10 August 2017, there were 2,519,431,566 shares in issue.

On 16 February 2018, the company announced the conversion of US$100.0 million of the previously existing bridging and working 
capital facility from Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. to new ordinary shares at £0.37 per share. As a result, 194,387,299 additional shares 
were issued to Mercuria Asset Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of Mercuria Energy Group Limited (“Mercuria Group”).

Placement of shares
Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercuria Energy Trading Limited, received 1,899,166,385 new 
ordinary shares of the company as consideration for its contributing the shares of Trefoil Holdings B.V. to the company as part of 
the combination transaction completed on 10 August 2017. At the same date a further 14,766,666 shares were issued to Mercuria 
Energy Asset Management B.V. related to deferred consideration from previous transactions.
In addition to ordinary shares of the company, Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited also received 179,838,924 warrants to 
subscribe for ordinary shares of the company. The number of warrants issued to Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited was 
calculated in order to allow it the option to maintain its post-combination shareholding percentage in Phoenix in the event that 
holders of warrants that existed prior to the combination elected to exercise their warrants. The warrants held by Upstream 
Capital Partners VI Limited following the combination transaction are exercisable pro-rata and conditional on the exercise of 
a previously existing warrant and have exercise prices reflecting the exercise price of those warrants.
On 16 February 2018, 194,387,299 ordinary shares of the company were issued to Mercuria Asset Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited at 
a price of £0.37 per share in a partial conversion of the US$160.0 million bridging and working capital facility previously advanced to 
the company by the Mercuria Group.
At 31 May 2018, Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited has exercised 10,228,089 of the warrants received by it as part of the 
combination transaction. Majority shareholder
Mercuria Energy Group Limited is the ultimate majority shareholder of the group. A relationship agreement is in place between and 
amongst the company and Mercuria Energy Group companies. This relationship agreement restricts shareholder rights with 
respect to board composition, voting on director appointments and removals and the day to day running of the business by the 
executive directors. The board of directors is composed of a majority of independent directors.
Matters related to governance are discussed further in the corporate governance report on pages 56 to 59.
Contracts of significance
At 31 December 2017, the company is participant to a bridging and working capital agreement advanced by Mercuria Energy Group 
with aggregate value of US$160.0 million. Funds received under the agreement were used to redeem approximately US$87.0 million 
of existing credit facilities at 10 August 2017 with the remainder being made available for general and working capital purposes.
On 16 February 2018, US$100.0 million of this facility was converted into 194,387,299 ordinary shares of the company at a price of 
£0.37 per share. The remaining US$60.0 million was refinanced as part of a new convertible revolving credit facility from Mercuria, 
details of which are included in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
On 22 January 2018, the company entered a commodity price swap agreement with Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. under which the 
company fixed the price it receives per barrel of oil sold over an 11-month period effective 15 January 2018. The contract is priced 
by reference to a Brent benchmark of US$65.97 per barrel in respect of 1,215,954 barrels in total and does not contain provision for 
margin requests.
Significant contracts with related parties are discussed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
As part of the combination transaction with Trefoil Holdings B.V., the company made a dividend in specie comprising 100% of the 
company’s interest in shares of Interoil Exploration and Production ASA. The distribution was made to the shareholders of record 
at 8 August 2017.
The company does not intend to pay any further dividend in respect of 2017. The directors do not expect to make distributions 
by way of dividend payments for the foreseeable future. The directors consider that it is in the best interest of the shareholders 
for the company to reinvest any profits derived from the group’s operations in growth opportunities and further developing 
those operations.

GOVERNANCE
DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED The current directors were appointed to the board with a three-year service term and will not be proposed for re-election at AGM 
prior to the expiration of that term. The directors who joined the board in August 2017 were appointed at a meeting of the board 
of directors of the company. Accordingly, resolutions to reappoint these directors will be proposed at the upcoming AGM.
Directors’ indemnities
As permitted by the articles of association of the company, the directors have been given the benefit of an indemnity, which is 
a qualifying third-party indemnity provision as defined in section 234 of the Companies Act 2006. The indemnity was in place 
throughout the year and continues to be so.
The company has directors’ and officer’s liability insurance in place that provides insurance cover to the directors in the event of 
a claim or legal action. This insurance was also in place throughout the year and remains in place.
Political and charitable donations
No political or charitable donations were made, nor was any political expenditure incurred by any group company in the year ended 
31 December 2017 (2016: nil).
Auditors and disclosure of relevant audit information
As far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware. In addition, each 
director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that PwC, the company’s auditor in the period, is aware of that information.
Following a review of both the independence and the effectiveness of the auditor; and the indication from PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP of its willingness to continue in office, a resolution that PwC be reappointed will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Corporate governance
The company’s statement on corporate governance can be found in the corporate governance report on pages 56 to 59 of this 
annual report. The corporate governance report forms part of this directors’ report and is incorporated by reference here.
Annual general meeting
The company’s AGM will be held at Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, Exchange House, Primrose Street, London EC2A 2EG on 
29 June 2018. Formal notice of the AGM, including details of special business, is set out in the notice of AGM which accompanies 
this annual report and is available on the company’s website at www.phoenixglobalresources.com.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with a description of the factors likely to affect its future development are set out in the 
group strategic report. The financial position of the group, its cash flows and liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the financial review set out in the annual report. Details of the group’s commitments are set out in note 26 to the group financial 
statements. In addition, note 22 to the group financial statements includes details of the group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of financial instruments held; and its exposure to credit 
and liquidity risk.
The group principally generates cash from its existing conventional oil and gas production operations. Nevertheless, Phoenix was 
formed with the stated intention of undertaking a significant exploration, evaluation and development programme focused on 
the group’s unconventional oil and gas assets in Argentina, including the Vaca Muerta formation.
In developing these assets, management expects to leverage skills, expertise and technology from the United States to 
complement the group’s own understanding and experience of the assets it holds in Argentina that has been built up over many 
years. Substantially all planned expenditure related to the further development of the group’s oil and gas assets is discretionary 
in nature and is at the option of the group. The significant majority of all minimum work commitments or expenditure obligations 
associated with the group’s oil and gas licences in Argentina have already been fulfilled.
The group’s business plan and exploration programme for 2018 is supported by the conversion of US$100.0 million of a US$160.0 
bridging and working capital agreement previously advanced to the group by Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. into ordinary share 
capital. In addition, the group has entered a new convertible revolving credit facility with the Mercuria Group in February 2018. This 
new facility provides US$100.0 million of additional capital and, through the restructuring of the interest provisions compared to 
those in the original facility, results in US$11.0 million cash interest cost savings for the remainder of 2018.
Additional funding options remain under consideration and could include securing additional third-party bank debt or the issue of 
new equity in the future.
The directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Consequently the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the 
financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would be required if the group was unable to 
continue as a going concern.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT CONTINUED The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the group and company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European Union have been followed for the group and company financial 
statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
 > prepare the group and company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the group’s website, www.phoenixglobalresources.com. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the directors’ report, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 > the group and company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the group and company; and
 > the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group 
and company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017 REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion, Phoenix Global Resources plc’s (‘Phoenix’) group financial statements and company financial statements (the 
“financial statements”):
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 and of the group’s loss 
and the group’s and the company’s cash flows for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the company’s financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and accounts (the “Annual Report”), which comprise: 
the consolidated and company statements of financial position as at 31 December 2017; the consolidated income statement and 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated and company statements of cash flows and the consolidated 
and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a 
description of the significant accounting policies.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion.
Independence
We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial 
statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality > Overall group materiality: US$1,570,000, based on 1% of net assets excluding the net identifiable 
assets acquired as part of the combination transaction, detailed in note 14.
 > Overall company materiality: US$1,050,000, based on the lower of group materiality and 1% of the 
company’s net assets but capped at an amount lower than overall group materiality.
Audit scope > We conducted full scope audits at six significant components based on their size and risk 
characteristics; five operating entities in Argentina and the parent company in London. Our audit work 
enabled us to obtain coverage of 99% of consolidated revenue and 83% of total assets for the group.
 > Specific audit procedures were performed on certain balances and transactions at a further two 
reporting units relating to property, plant and equipment, borrowings and deferred income tax liabilities.
 > Members of the group audit team visited the Argentinian operations twice as part of our audit in 
order to have sufficient oversight of the work of our component auditors in Argentina. This included a 
site visit to the Neuquina and Cuyana basins in the Province of Mendoza.
Key audit matters Our key audit matters comprised:
 > Impairment of long term assets and goodwill (group and parent).
 > Accounting for the combination transaction (group).
 > Accounting for the purchase price allocation (PPA) (group).
The scope of our audit
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial 
statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant 
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.
As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there 
was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not 
due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the 
results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by 
our audit.
Phoenix Global Resources plc
88 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF PHOENIX GLOBAL RESOURCES PLC Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Impairment of long-term assets and goodwill
Impairment assessments require significant judgement and 
there is the risk that the valuation of the assets may be 
incorrect and any potential impairment charge or reversal 
miscalculated. As such, this was a key focus for our audit due 
to the material nature of the balance.
As disclosed in note 13, the group has property, plant and 
equipment of US$354.2 million and exploration and evaluation 
assets of US$171.4 million as at 31 December 2017. This is after 
the recognition of a US$8.2 million impairment charge disclosed 
in note 13.
The group also has goodwill of US$35.8 million within the 
Chachahuen, Mata Mora and Corralera Cash Generating Units 
(“CGUs”), which must be tested for impairment on an annual 
basis. Management has determined that the recoverable 
amount of the goodwill balance exceeded the carrying value.
In addition, management has performed an impairment trigger 
assessment for each CGU. The carrying values of the group’s 
assets are supported by value in use calculations, which are 
based on future cash flow forecasts. As part of the reverse 
takeover process, new reserve estimates were obtained for 
all CGUs and these were used by management as part of their 
impairment assessment (Refer to note 2 for an explanation of 
the combination transaction and the legacy businesses).
Impairment indicators were identified for the CHPPC CGU, 
following the relinquishment of the Puesta Pozo Cercado (‘PPC’) 
licence in July 2017. The CHPPC CGU had a pre-impairment 
carrying value of US$23.2 million and a US$8.2m impairment 
charge was booked as a result of the relinquishment of the 
PPC licence.
Management has determined that there were no triggers for 
impairment in any of the other CGUs, having considered factors 
such as long term prices, interest rates, reserves and production.
Management has additionally considered the recoverability of 
the investments in subsidiaries held in the company financial 
statements and recognised an impairment of US$463.2 million, 
calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of 
the individual investments and the relevant recoverable amount 
calculated as the day one fair value difference between the fair 
value of the acquired investment and the value of the deemed 
consideration (calculated in accordance with IFRS 3).
For the Chachahuen, Mata Mora and Corralera CGUs, which 
have goodwill allocated to them, we assessed the reasonableness 
of management’s future forecasts of capital and operating 
expenses included in the cash flow forecasts in light of the 
historical accuracy of such forecasts and the current 
operational results.
In assessing the valuation of the other CGUs, we assessed 
and challenged management’s impairment trigger analysis 
and in particular considered changes in key assumptions such 
as commodity prices, reserves and discount rates.
We concurred with management’s view that the only trigger 
identified was in the CHPPC CGU. We evaluated management’s 
assumptions and estimates used to determine the recoverable 
value of the CHPPC CGU, as well as reading third party reserve 
reports. With respect to the impairment of the CHPPC CGU, as 
the interests within the PPC licence have been relinquished, we 
agreed that there is no future value attributable to PPC.
We used our valuation experts to assist us in evaluating the 
appropriateness of key market related assumptions in 
management’s valuation models, including commodity prices 
and discount rates.
We challenged management’s assessment of the carrying value 
of the investments including the exchange ratio at the date of 
the transaction and the relative fair values of the investments 
and considered the assessment to be appropriate. We 
concurred with management’s decision to impair the 
investments for the reasons explained within note 13 to these 
consolidated financial statements and note 4 in the company 
financial statements.
Based on our analysis, we did not identify any material issues 
with management’s impairment conclusions, the impairment 
charges recognised and the associated disclosures.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
89 Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Accounting for the combination transaction
Given the significance and complexity around accounting for the 
reverse takeover, there is a risk that the accounting treatment 
may be incorrect and as such this was a key focus for our audit.
As disclosed within the basis of preparation, the company issued 
shares during the year to the former shareholders of the Trefoil 
Group in return for 100% of the share capital of Trefoil Holdings 
B.V. The transaction was considered to be a reverse takeover 
under IFRS 3 (refer to note 2 for further explanation).
Accounting for a reverse takeover is complex and involves 
judgement around identifying which company is considered to be 
the accounting acquirer and which the acquiree, as well as how 
the transaction should be reflected in the financial statements.
Trefoil Holdings B.V. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer 
reflecting the potential control of its ultimate parent company, 
by the nature of its shareholding, over the enlarged group. The 
accounting implications of the reverse takeover require that the 
comparative balances in these financial statements reflect the 
balance sheet of the legal acquirer, Trefoil Holdings B.V with the 
statutory equity of the legal parent, Phoenix Global Resources 
plc (formally Andes Energia plc).
We obtained and reviewed management’s assessment of 
the transaction and obtained and read the share purchase 
agreement.
We assessed the identification of the appropriate accounting 
treatment, as well as the legal acquirer and acquiree, and the 
implications of this on the presentation of the financial statements; 
this included the comparative numbers being those relating to 
the Trefoil group and not the previous Andes group. We 
considered the presentation of the Trefoil group comparatives 
to be appropriate given the nature of the transaction.
Accounting for the purchase price allocation (PPA)
Given the significance and complexity around the transaction, 
there is a risk that the accounting treatment may be incorrect 
and as such this was a key focus for our audit.
As disclosed in note 14, the assets and liabilities of the legacy 
Andes group were fair valued as required by IFRS 3 as at 
10 August 2017.
Management engaged independent external experts to 
perform the valuation using discounted cash flow models for 
the non-current assets. Management made further fair value 
adjustments to working capital balances as required based on 
facts and circumstances and management’s own assessment 
of recoverability.
Goodwill of US$260.0 million arose as a result of the 
transaction, being the difference between the fair value of the 
acquired net assets and the value of the deemed consideration 
(calculated in accordance with IFRS 3). Other than the portion 
of this goodwill balance relating to deferred tax, which must be 
recorded under IFRS3, management determined that there is 
no basis for recording any amount of goodwill in excess of this 
amount of US$35.8 million. Accordingly they have recognised 
an impairment of US$224.2 million in the income statement.
We used our valuation experts to assist us in assessing the 
commodity prices, discount rates and comparable transaction 
multiples used by management’s external experts. We 
benchmarked these to external data and challenged the 
assumptions based on our knowledge of the group and the 
industry within which it operates. We also assessed the 
competence and objectivity of management’s experts.
We challenged management’s key assumptions used in each 
valuation model for non-current assets including output volumes, 
capital expenditure, operating costs and the expected life of the 
assets, by comparing these assumptions against available 
external data and obtaining explanations for variances.
We recalculated the consideration and found the deemed 
consideration of $385.1 million to be calculated appropriately 
under the principles of IFRS 3.
We assessed management’s assumptions in the fair value 
exercise of other assets particularly around the recoverability of 
long term receivables and held for sale assets.
We challenged management’s assessment of the fair value of 
all identifiable assets and liabilities and the completeness of this 
assessment and found management’s assessment to be 
complete. We concurred with management’s decision to impair 
US$224.2 million of goodwill for the reasons explained within 
note 14 to these financial statements.
Based on our analysis, we did not identify any material issues 
with the reasonableness of the fair values recognised and the 
resulting disclosures.
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which they operate.
In establishing the overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the 
statutory reporting unit level by us, as the group audit team, or through involvement of our component auditors in Argentina. The 
group’s assets and operations are primarily located within three oil and gas basins in Argentina. Financial reporting is undertaken in 
offices in London, Buenos Aires, Mendoza City and Houston.
Where work was performed by our component auditors in Argentina, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in 
the audit work for each reporting unit to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as 
Phoenix Global Resources plc
90 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT CONTINUED a basis for our opinion on the group financial statements as a whole. As part of our year end audits, the group team’s involvement 
comprised of site visits, conference calls, review of component auditor work papers, attendance at component audit clearance 
meetings and other forms of communication as considered necessary. In addition, senior members of the audit team performed 
a site visit to various assets in the Neuquina basin in the Province of Mendoza.
The group audit team directly performed the work over the parent company, the intermediate holding companies as well as 
the consolidation.
We identified six components which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their 
size or risk characteristics. This included the five main operating subsidiaries in Argentina, as well as the parent company in the 
United Kingdom. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were also performed on a further two reporting 
components relating to property, plant and equipment, borrowings and deferred income tax liabilities. The above gave us coverage 
of 99% over consolidated revenue and 83% over consolidated total assets. This, together with additional procedures performed at 
the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of 
our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements Company financial statements
Overall materiality US$1,570,000. US$1,050,000.
How we determined it 1% of net assets excluding the net identifiable 
assets acquired in the combination transaction 
detailed in note 14. 
Based on net assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark applied
In assessing the most appropriate benchmark to 
use as a basis for materiality we considered the 
nature of the newly enlarged group since the 
reverse takeover. 
Given the overall importance of the group’s 
exploration assets, and the significant one off 
costs incurred during the year which impacted 
EBITDAX, we believe that using net assets was 
the most appropriate benchmark.
We have assessed that the most appropriate 
benchmark for the parent company is net assets; 
however, we have capped this at an amount 
lower than overall group materiality. 
For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. 
The range of materiality allocated across components was between US$150,000 and US$1,050,000. Certain components were 
audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality. The identifiable net assets, 
acquired as part of the combination transaction were audited to a specific materiality less than overall group materiality.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$100,000 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Conclusions relating to going concern
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to report to you when:
 > the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or
 > the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt 
about the group’s and company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve 
months from the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s and 
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Reporting on other information
The other information comprises all of the information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ 
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material 
misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
91 there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based 
on these responsibilities.
With respect to the strategic report and directors’ report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK 
Companies Act 2006 have been included.
Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (UK) require us also to report 
certain opinions and matters as described below.
Strategic report and directors’ report
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the strategic report and directors’ 
report for the year ended 31 December 2017 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with 
applicable legal requirements.
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we did not identify any material misstatements in the strategic report and directors’ report.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 85, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at: 
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’ report.
Use of this report
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save 
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
OTHER REQUIRED REPORTING
Companies Act 2006 exception reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 > certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 > the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
97 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1. General information
The company is a Public Limited Company (plc) incorporated in England and Wales and is domiciled in the United Kingdom. 
The Registered Office address is 6th Floor, King’s House, 10 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4BP. The company is listed on the AIM 
market of the London Stock Exchange and maintains a secondary listing on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.
The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries (together ‘the group’) are the exploration for and the development 
and production of oil and gas in Argentina.
2. Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union, the associated interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (together ‘IFRS’) 
and the Companies Act 2006.
The significant accounting policies applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied throughout the period and to each subsidiary of the group.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as where stated.
Going concern
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months. Accordingly the consolidated financial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In making their assessment of going concern, the directors have considered the group’s budgets, capital commitments, cash flow 
forecasts and associated risks.
Foreign currency
Functional currency – items included in the financial information of the individual companies that comprise the group are measured 
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The primary economic 
environment is often related to the country of operations and, in many cases, the functional currency of an entity will be the same 
as the currency of the company in which it operates. There is no concept of a group functional currency and therefore individual 
entities within a group may have functional currencies that are different to each other. In some circumstances the functional 
currency may be different to the currency of the country in which an entity operates. This can happen when significant contracts 
(sales, services, funding, etc.) are denominated in or by reference to a currency that is different to that of the country of operation. 
For instance, in the oil and gas industry many sales and service contracts are denominated in or priced by reference to the US Dollar 
given that the benchmark prices for crude oil (Brent, WTI, etc.) are quoted in US Dollars and hence pricing is often referenced to the 
US Dollar.
Presentation currency – the consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars rounded to the nearest thousand 
(US$’000), except where otherwise indicated.
Foreign currency transactions – transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are 
translated using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement 
of such transactions and from the translation at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income within either finance income (gains) or finance 
costs (losses).
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of Phoenix Global Resources plc as well as its subsidiary 
undertakings.
Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests are included within other reserves. All of the non-controlling interests (US$1,220,000) were acquired by 
the company in January 2016. There is no non-controlling interest at either 31 December 2016 or 2017.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the company has control. The company controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights 
to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. 
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date at which control is transferred to the company. They are deconsolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
Joint arrangements
Oil and gas operations are usually conducted by the group as co-licencees in unincorporated joint operations with other companies. 
The group’s financial statements reflect the relevant proportion of production, assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint 
operation applicable to the group’s interests. The group’s current interests in joint operations are detailed in the operating review on 
pages 24 to 31 and typically represent a percentage-based working interest in the joint operation.
Phoenix Global Resources plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
98 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Acquisitions
The group allocates the purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities acquired on 
the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of assets and liabilities 
is recognised as goodwill. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment. Goodwill is written off 
where circumstances indicate that the recoverable value of the underlying cash generating unit (CGU) including the asset may no 
longer support the carrying value of goodwill. Any such impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the year. 
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years.
Comparative financial information
On 10 August 2017, the company completed a business combination transaction with the Trefoil Holdings B.V. group of companies 
(Trefoil) whereby the company issued new ordinary shares to the shareholders of Trefoil in return for 100% of the issued share capital 
of Trefoil Holdings B.V. As a result of this transaction the former shareholders of the Trefoil group hold the majority of the issued share 
capital of the company and accordingly the combination transaction represents a reverse takeover for accounting purposes.
When a business combination is determined to be a reverse takeover for accounting purposes, the company that is acquired (the 
legal acquiree) is determined to be the accounting acquirer. Conversely the legal parent is, the company that issued the purchase 
consideration, determined to be the acquired company for accounting purposes.
The comparative financial information that is presented in these group financial statements then is the comparative financial 
information of the Trefoil group as it is the Trefoil group that is the acquiring entity for accounting purposes. The former Andes 
Energia plc group is determined to be the acquired party and therefore its assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and cash flows are 
consolidated in these group financial statements from the date of acquisition, being 10 August 2017.
In addition, it is the assets and liabilities of the former Andes Energia plc group that are the subject of the purchase price allocation 
and are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Notwithstanding, the legal share capital and share premium of the 
former Andes Energia group remains the share capital of the combined group. Any difference between the total share capital and 
associated share premium and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as merger reserve.
3. Significant accounting policies
3.1 New accounting standards issued but not yet effective
Standards issued and relevant to the group, but not yet effective at the date of these group financial statements are listed below. 
The standards discussed are those that the group reasonably expects to be applicable to the financial statements in the future and 
therefore do not include those standards or interpretations that the directors consider will not be relevant to the group. The group 
intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. The directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards 
will have a material impact on the group’s financial statements either in the period of initial application or thereafter. An 
assessment of the impact of each relevant standard is included below.
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)
Overview
IFRS 9 is effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018 and deals with the classification and measurement 
of financial instruments. Financial instruments will include loans receivable/payable, derivative financial instruments and accounts 
payable and receivable balances.
Measurement remains broadly consistent with previous guidance with the main options being to recognise financial assets and 
liabilities at fair value or amortised cost. Where financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, the standard provides 
guidance on where to recognise periodic changes in fair value with the primary options being through the income statement or 
directly to reserves. The standard also provides guidance on hedge accounting where a company elects to apply hedge accounting.
The most significant change in the new standard that impacts the group relates to the measurement of credit risk and the 
recognition of that risk through adjusting the carrying value of the underlying instrument. The standard requires a company 
to assess the ’12-month expected credit losses’ on inception of a financial instrument (generally an asset) and recognise those 
expected losses in the income statement by way of an allowance. Where the expected credit risk increases significantly and is 
not considered to be low, the full credit loss that is expected over the lifetime of the asset is recorded.

IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (IFRS 15)
Overview
IFRS 15 is effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2018 and seeks to provide more meaningful information 
regarding revenue to users of financial statements. The standard describes a five-step approach to be taken to the assessment 
of revenue that requires companies to:
1. identify the customer party to each contract;
2. understand the performance obligations in the contract;
3. determine the transaction price;
4. allocate that price to the identifiable performance obligations; and
5. recognise revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is met.
The standard could result in a change in the pattern of revenue recognition for certain types of contract that (typically) contain 
multiple performance elements and are delivered over a period of time.
How the standard applies to Phoenix Global Resources plc
There is not expected to be any difference to revenue recognition for the group under the new standard. Consistent with industry 
practice the group makes sales of crude oil and natural gas which are commodity products. Contracts define a specific delivery 
point where physical custody is transferred and title passes.
There is a single performance obligation being physical delivery at a specified point. The group receives revenue that is calculated 
by multiplying actual delivery volume by the market price of the specific commodity on the day of delivery.
Conclusion
The group has determined that the implementation of IFRS 15 will have no effect on revenue recognition (timing or quantum) for 
oil and gas sales.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
100 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED IFRS 16: Leases (IFRS 16)
The IASB published IFRS 16 in January 2016. The standard is effective for accounting periods starting on or after 1 January 2019 
and therefore will be adopted by the group in the interim financial information and the annual financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2019.
The standard seeks to clarify the accounting treatment for leased assets that are accounted for under the current leasing standard 
as either finance leases or operating leases. Under the current accounting rules for finance leases, leased assets and corresponding 
lease obligations are capitalised in the statement of financial position and amortised over the life of the lease contract. Operating 
leases are accounted for on an income statement model with the monthly rental cost for using an asset charged to the income 
statement, typically on a straight line basis.
The criteria for classifying a lease as either a finance lease or an operating lease are very specific and involve the application of a 
number of ‘bright line’ rules that determine the final treatment. This specificity can result in the opportunity to specifically design 
contracts for rental which, while substantially similar, can result in different classification of the underlying asset.
IFRS 16 seeks to examine the commercial substance of arrangements and, on application, it is anticipated that many more lease 
contracts or similar arrangements will result in balance sheet treatment under the new standard. This will likely result in more 
leased assets and lease obligations being capitalised in companies’ statements of financial position.
The company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on the group. The group does not lease significant assets both 
in quantum or value. The principal lease agreements that the group is participant to relate to office space, office equipment and 
low value operational items. As a result the impact of adopting the new standard is not expected to be significant. Nevertheless, 
the change in the accounting rules for leases could result in a different presentation in the statement of financial position and a 
different profile of charges in respect of leased assets in the income statement.
New standards, amendments and interpretations adopted in 2017
No new standards, amendments or interpretations, effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 
2017, have had a material impact on the group or parent company. Additional disclosures have been given where relevant.
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical judgements 
Determination of functional currency
The determination of a company’s functional currency can require significant judgement. There is no concept of a group-wide 
functional currency but rather functional currency is assessed on an entity by entity basis. A company’s functional currency is 
defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. In this regard the default assumption is 
that a company’s functional currency will be that in which it is registered or that where the majority of its operations are located.
This assumption can be challenged or rebutted where it can be demonstrated that a currency other than that of the country of 
registration or operations can be shown to have a greater influence over the revenue, costs, assets and liabilities of a company. 
For instance, in the oil and gas industry contracts for the sale of production and for the provision of operational services are often 
priced in US Dollars. This is because the main international benchmark prices used for pricing crude cargoes, such as Brent and WTI, 
are quoted in US Dollars. With revenues being heavily influenced by the Dollar then service contracts, particularly those related to 
services provided by international service companies, are often also denominated in priced by reference to the Dollar.
Notwithstanding the above, and the fact that the group operates exclusively in the oil and gas industry, the assessment of 
functional currency is made on an entity-by-entity basis by examining the specific circumstances of each entity. Care must be 
taken when examining holding companies and intermediate holding companies to determine if their activity is an extension of 
that of their holding company or subsidiary of if the company operates independently in its own right.
The assessment of functional currency can be complex and requires the application of a number of criteria and indicators 
proscribed by IAS 21, ‘The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates’. In certain circumstances the evaluation of the criteria in 
IAS 21 does not result in a clear answer one way or another and hence judgement is applied in determining the functional currency 
of an entity. The assessment of functional currency can have a significant effect on both the income statement and the statement 
of financial position of a company and of the group if which it is a member.
The impact of foreign exchange gains and losses on net income and calculated by reference to the functional currency of each 
company within the group is presented in the statement of comprehensive income as part of finance income and finance costs.
The functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries in Argentina was determined to be the US Dollar. The group presents its 
financial statements in US Dollars.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
101 4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued
Determination of joint control
Judgement is required to determine when the joint control exists over an arrangement. Such judgement requires the assessment of 
the relevant activities of the arrangement and when decisions in relation to those activities require unanimous consent.
The group has determined that the relevant activities for its joint arrangements are those related to the operating and capital 
decisions of the arrangement. These will include the approval of the annual capital and operating expenditure work programme and 
budget for the joint arrangement. This will also relate to matters such as the approval of chosen service providers for major capital 
activity as required by the joint operating agreements that govern the joint arrangement. These considerations are similar to those 
necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.
Classifying an arrangement requires assessment of the rights and obligations arising from the arrangement and may include:
 > the structure of the joint arrangement including whether a legal entity exists, the terms of a contractual arrangement;
 > the rights and obligations arising from ownership;
 > contractual rights and obligations; and
 > other facts and circumstances on a case-by-case basis.
This assessment often requires significant judgement. A different conclusion about both joint control and whether an arrangement 
represents a joint venture or a joint operation may materially affect the accounting for a joint arrangement.
Critical estimates
Future oil and gas prices
The estimation of future oil and gas prices has a significant impact throughout the financial statements. Future prices for oil and 
gas have a direct impact on the estimation of the recoverable value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
associated with oil and gas assets.
Details of the oil and gas prices achieved in the year ended 31 December 2017 are included in the segment information (note 6).
Estimation of oil and gas reserve volumes
Oil and gas reserves are the quantities of oil and gas that management considers are commercially recoverable in the future from 
known accumulations within the group’s licence areas and under defined economic and operating conditions.
The estimation of reserve volumes is inherently imprecise, requires the application of judgement and is subject to future revision. 
Because the production of reserves is required to be commercially viable, variations in future sales prices, cost estimates or actual 
production volumes can affect the absolute quantity of estimated reserve volumes from one period to the next.
Commercial viability is assessed by reference to the point at which the cash cost to produce a barrel of oil (or equivalent) is greater 
than the sales price that can be achieved for that barrel. This point is generally referred to as the ‘economic limit’. No reserves are 
recorded in respect of the period after which the economic limit is estimated to occur.
Decreases in sales prices, increases in cash operating costs or variations in the expected production profile for wells, as compared to 
the assumptions applied in the estimation of reserve volumes, can cause variation from those estimates. Variations can be positive 
or negative. Subsurface conditions and other engineering factors can also affect estimated reserve volumes.
An impairment also exists where revisions to estimated reserve volumes result in a reduction to those estimates for a given field or 
licence area.
The prospective value of oil and gas reserves is not recorded in the statement of financial position. Intangible oil and gas assets and 
associated property plant and equipment included in the statement of financial position relate to the cost of acquisition of those 
properties together with cumulative exploration or development expenditure.
Oil and gas reserve volumes are estimated by management together with the in-house reservoir engineer and are subject to 
periodic independent estimation by external reservoir engineering experts as events or circumstances dictate.
The estimation of reserve volumes primarily influences the depreciation, depletion and amortisation charge for the year. This is 
included in the analysis of property, plant and equipment (note 13.1). Reserve volumes are also used to assess fair value in business 
combinations (below) and in calculating whether an impairment charge should be recorded where an impairment indicator exists. 
No impairment indicators were identified in relation to the year ended 31 December 2017.
Accounting for business combinations and fair value
Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. The assessment of fair value is subjective and depends on a number of 
assumptions.
These assumptions include assessment of discount rates, taxation rules, and the amount and timing of expected future cash 
flows from assets and liabilities. In addition, the selection of specific valuation methods for individual assets and liabilities requires 
judgment. The specific valuation methods applied will be driven by the nature of the asset or liability being assessed.
The consideration given to a seller for the purchase of a business or a company is accounted for at its fair value. When the 
consideration given includes elements that are not cash, such as shares, then the fair value of the consideration given is 
calculated by reference to the specific elements of the consideration given to the seller.
Phoenix Global Resources plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED In business combinations fair value may need to be applied to items that are not recorded in financial statements under the historic 
cost convention. These items may include certain contingent liabilities, contracts that have terms that may be more or less beneficial 
compared to current practice, warranties given by the seller or value that could be gained from inherent characteristics of the 
business being acquired – such as customer relations or assembled workforce. Where these items represent benefits they are 
recorded as intangible assets and separately identified. Items that could result in payments being made in the future are recorded 
as long term or short term liabilities.
Goodwill is recognised where the fair value of the purchase consideration given to the seller is more than the fair value of the assets 
and liabilities acquired. Determining what goodwill relates to requires judgement. Where the value of goodwill cannot be supported 
the goodwill is not recognised and a corresponding amount is recorded as an impairment loss in the income statement.
The company was party to a business combination in the year whereby it acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Trefoil 
Holdings B.V. The combination, which represented a reverse takeover under IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’, is discussed in note 14.
Provision for asset retirement and decommissioning obligations
The group has an obligation to plug and abandon wells at the end of their productive life. In addition, the group is required to 
remove any surface field infrastructure and equipment and to remediate or re-cultivate land that has been affected by the group’s 
activities and return it to its natural state.
Provision is made for such obligations at the time at which the obligation is incurred. This is normally as wells are drilled 
or infrastructure is put in place. Provisions are based on cost estimates of the remediation activity that will be needed. 
These estimates require judgment. Inflation is applied to cost estimates and these estimates are then discounted at a rate 
that reflects the time value of money. The application of both inflation and discount rates represent significant estimates.
Details of provisions held for asset retirement obligations together with movements recognised in the year are included in the 
analysis of provisions in note 25.
5. Accounting policies
5.1 Revenue
Revenue represents the proceeds, excluding VAT and sales taxes, earned from the sale of oil and gas. Revenue is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that sales proceeds will be received and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been passed to the buyer. This is typically at the 
point at which the product passes into the customer’s pipeline, truck or refinery.
5.2 Government incentives
Certain incentive plans have been implemented by the Argentine government in the last several years and aimed at increasing the 
domestic production of oil and gas. There are two principal forms of incentive plan used by the government, the distinguishing 
factor being the manner in which any incentive payment is measured or calculated. The variation in the method of calculation 
determines the accounting treatment applied by the company.
 > Plans that give a fixed sales price per unit that is higher than prevailing market 
Because these plans result in an additional per-unit cash receipt (limited by a fixed cap), the additional revenue derived from 
the plans is treated as revenue in the income statement.
 > Plans that result in additional sales revenue in respect of enhanced production volumes over a predetermined 
volumetric threshold 
These plans are focused on increasing production over a threshold level and provide additional marginal income for each 
additional unit produced. Because there is not a direct relationship on a total per-unit basis between amounts receive and 
total production volumes, amounts under these plans are treated as other income.
5.3 Finance costs and income
Finance income comprises interest income on cash invested, foreign currency gains and the unwind of discount on any assets held 
at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest rate method.
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, foreign currency losses and the unwind of discount on any liabilities 
held at amortised cost, which is principally the unwind of the discount related to the asset retirement obligation.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised as a part of 
that asset. This reduces the finance charge in the income statement and results in a corresponding increase to the asset cost. 
Capitalisation of borrowing costs stops when the asset is substantially ready for its intended use, which may be earlier than the 
time at which it is put into use.
5.4 Employee benefits
Short-term benefits
Benefits given to employees that are short-term in nature are recognised as expense in the statement of comprehensive income as 
the related service is provided. The principal short term benefit is salary and associated holiday pay. A liability is recognised for the 
amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus plans if there is either a present legal or constructive obligation to pay 
the amount and the amount can be reliably estimated.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
103 5. Accounting policies continued
5.5 Share-based payments
The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the group. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted:
 > including any market performance conditions (for example, an entity’s share price);
 > excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth 
targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
 > including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to 
vest. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions 
are to be satisfied.
In addition, in some circumstances employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair 
value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement and the grant date.
At the end of each reporting period, the group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on 
the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the company issues new shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium.
The grant by the company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is 
treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, 
is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity 
in the parent entity financial statements.
The social security contributions payable in connection with the grant of the share options is considered an integral part of the 
grant itself, and the charge will be treated as a cash-settled transaction.
5.6 Taxes
The total tax charge or credit recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is made up of both current and deferred taxes.
The current tax charge or credit is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year. Taxable profit or loss is different to the profit or 
loss reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or 
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable nor deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax that is expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying value of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statement and the corresponding tax amounts for those assets and liabilities used to calculate taxable 
profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences that exist only where it is probable that taxable profits will 
be generated against which the carrying value of the deferred tax asset can be recovered. Deductible temporary differences exist 
where there is a difference in the timing of the recognition of an item of income or expense between the income statement and the 
calculation of taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised using liability method, for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of 
taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint operations. Deferred 
tax liabilities are not recorded for these items where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset or liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss.
Current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Minimum notional income tax – Argentina
Argentinian tax law requires companies to calculate tax on ‘notional presumed income’ at a rate equal to 1% of a company’s assets 
at the balance sheet date. The company’s tax obligation for each year will be the higher of the notional presumed income tax and 
the actual calculated tax charge for the period. Where the notional amount is greater than the calculated amount the excess of 
taxes paid can be used to offset future income tax in any of the next ten years.

104 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 5.7 Intangible assets
Goodwill
The group allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration on the acquisition of a subsidiary to the assets and liabilities 
acquired based on an assessment of fair value at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase consideration, the ‘cost’ of the 
acquisition, is recognised as goodwill. Where goodwill is recognised, it is allocated to cash generating units in a systematic manner 
reflective of how the group expects to recover the value of the goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment. Goodwill is written off where 
circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the underlying CGU including the asset may no longer support the carrying 
value of the goodwill. Any such impairment is recognised in the income statement for the period. Impairment losses related to 
goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations at the date of acquisition is allocated to the group of CGUs 
representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored. The group’s policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level 
before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, within the segment is based on the higher of its fair value less costs of 
disposal or value in use. Value in use is calculated by reference to the expected future cash flows from the CGU after discounting 
to take account of the time value of money. Fair value less costs to sell can be based on a similar cash flow measure adjusted for 
disposal costs or can be estimated by reference to similar comparable reference transactions. Where cash flows are used they 
are risk weighted in order to reflect an assessment of future exploration success.
The key assumptions in assessing cash flows are the sensitivity to market fluctuations, such as commodity prices, and the success 
of future exploration drilling programmes. The most likely factor that will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of 
the cash-generating unit is the result of future exploration drilling, which will ultimately determine the licence area’s future 
economic potential.
5.8 Exploration and appraisal assets
Capitalisation
The group follows an accounting policy for exploration and appraisal assets that is based on the successful-efforts accounting 
method.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal right to explore an area are expensed as incurred in the income statement. This includes 
all costs that pre-date the award of a licence.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis. Costs are held within 
intangible assets and are not depreciated until the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have 
been discovered. Exploration and evaluation costs may include the costs of initial licence acquisition; geological and geophysical 
studies – such as seismic studies; and direct labour, equipment and service costs associated with drilling exploratory wells. Costs 
incurred are capitalised by well, field or exploration area based on the nature of the cost. Drilling costs are written off on completion 
of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are 
commercial. Where the results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered 
commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the income statement as exploration cost.
On conclusion of a successful evaluation phase where commercial reserves have been established, the associated exploration and 
evaluation costs are tested for impairment and the carrying value adjusted if necessary. The exploration and evaluation costs are 
then transferred to the property plant and equipment category ‘development and production assets’ and are held within a single 
field cost centre.
Impairment
Capitalised intangible exploration and evaluation costs are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and are tested for 
impairment where these indicators exist. Indicators of impairment for exploration and appraisal assets may include:
 > exploration drilling has not resulted in the discovery of commercial volumes of reserves;
 > changes in oil and gas prices or other market conditions that indicate the discoveries may not be commercial;
 > the anticipated cost of development indicates that it is unlikely the carrying value of the exploration and evaluation asset will 
be recovered in full;
 > there are no plans to conduct further exploration activities in the area; or
 > the exploration licence period has expired or is due to expire.
Where an indicator of impairment has been identified, the intangible exploration and evaluation asset is allocated to a development 
asset within property, plant and equipment for the purpose of impairment testing. This allocation is made because the exploration 
and evaluation asset has no cash inflows of its own.
If there are no development assets within the CGU, the excess of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation over its 
recoverable amount is immediately written off in the income statement.

5.9 Property, plant and equipment – development and production assets
Capitalisation
The costs associated with determining the existence of commercial reserves are capitalised in accordance with the preceding policy 
and transferred to property, plant and equipment as development assets following impairment testing.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons have been demonstrated are 
capitalised within development assets on a field-by-field basis. Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised where it either enhances 
the economic benefits of the development asset or replaces part of the existing development asset (where the remaining cost of 
the original part is expensed through the income statement).
Costs of borrowing related to the ongoing construction of development and production assets and facilities are capitalised during 
the construction phase. Capitalisation of interest ceases once an asset is ready for production.
Depreciation
Capitalised oil and gas assets are not subject to depreciation until commercial production starts. Depreciation is calculated on 
a unit-of-production basis in order to write off the cost of an asset as the reserves that it represents are produced and sold. 
Any periodic reassessment of reserves will affect the depreciation rate on a prospective basis.
The unit-of-production depreciation rate is calculated on a field-by-field basis using proved, developed reserves as the denominator 
and capitalised costs as the numerator. The numerator includes an estimate of the costs expected to be incurred to bring proved, 
developed, not-producing reserves into production.
Infrastructure that is common to a number of fields, such as gathering systems, treatment plants and pipelines are depreciated on 
a unit-of-production basis using an aggregate measure of reserves or on a straight line basis depending on the expected pattern of 
use of the underlying asset.
Impairment
The group assesses development and production assets for impairment where there is an indication that an impairment may exist. 
Indicators of impairment may include:
 > a significant fall in realised prices or oil and gas price benchmarks;
 > an increase in operating costs; or
 > unforeseen engineering subsurface problems that cannot be overcome satisfactorily.
An impairment indicator exists where revisions to estimated reserve volumes result in a reduction to those estimates for a given 
field or licence area. In addition, variations in reserve estimates cause changes to the unit-of-production depreciation rates applied 
to oil and gas properties. Depreciation rates for fields or licence areas are calculated using estimated reserve volumes as the 
denominator with capitalised costs as the numerator. 
An impairment review of development and production assets is undertaken on an asset by asset basis, typically at the field level 
or licence, and involves comparing the carrying value of an asset with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset 
is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is determined by reference to expected 
future net cash flows. Any impairment loss identified is recorded in the income statement.
The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the cash generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate. 
The discount rate is derived from the group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
 > production volumes and estimates of recoverable reserves;
 > commodity benchmark prices and realised sales prices;
 > fixed and variable operating costs;
 > required capital expenditure; and
 > discount and inflation rates applied.
5.10 Decommissioning
The discounted cost of expected decommissioning activity is recorded when an obligation to rectify the environmental impact of 
the group’s oil and gas activity exists. The obligation can arise from contractual licence arrangements, the laws and regulations of 
the country or province of operation or be constructive based on established practice.
The amount that is recognised as a provision for decommissioning activities is the present value of the estimated future 
remediation expenditure that is determined by reference to the nature of the asset, the group’s operational policy in regard to 
decommissioning, local conditions and associated regulatory requirements. A corresponding decommissioning asset is recorded 
within property, plant and equipment at the same discounted value as the provision.
Phoenix Global Resources plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED The costs recognised in the income statement in each period comprise two elements:
 > depreciation of the decommissioning asset calculated on a unit-of-production basis consistent with the underlying asset to which 
it relates that is recorded in operating expenses; and
 > the unwind of the discount on the decommissioning provision that is recorded as interest expense as time passes.
Any change in the present value of the stimulated future decommissioning expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the 
decommissioning provision and related decommissioning asset.
5.11 Other assets
Other assets are capitalised on the basis of purchase price or construction cost. Depreciation on other elements of property, plant 
and equipment is charged on a straight line basis at the following rates that reflect the expected useful life of each asset category:
 > Fixtures and fittings
 > Vehicles
 > Other equipment
20% to 33%
20%
20% to 33%
5.12 Business combinations and goodwill
Acquired businesses are included in the financial statements from the transaction date which is defined as the date at which the 
Company achieves control over the assets being acquired.
The cost of an acquisition is calculated as the fair value of the consideration given including equity instruments, contingent 
consideration and any liabilities assumed in connection with the transfer of control.
The cost of an acquisition is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their relative fair 
values at the acquisition date. If the acquisition cost at the time of the acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, 
goodwill is recognised. Conversely, if the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the consideration given, the difference is 
recognised as income on acquisition.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination and is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill may also be recognised as a result of the application of deferred tax accounting to the fair values of assets acquired. The 
fair value allocation process often results in an increase to the carrying value of depreciable assets. Given that the tax basis of such 
assets does not change, the difference between the book base and the tax base of the asset increases, resulting in an additional 
deferred tax liability. The increased deferred tax liability is recorded in purchase accounting with a corresponding entry to goodwill. 
Goodwill arising on the action of deferred taxes is allocated to cash generating units and assessed for impairment accordingly.
5.13 Inventories
The group’s stocks of crude oil on hand that result from its production operations are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost represents the per-unit production costs for each barrel of oil held in inventory. Net realisable value is measured by 
reference to the market price for crude oil prevailing in Argentina plus or minus quality and location premium or discount.
Operational inventory and spare parts are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value where cost represents the weighted 
average unit cost for inventory items on a line by line basis.
5.14 Investments and other financial assets
Classification
The group classifies its financial assets in the following categories:
 > financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
 > loans and receivables;
 > held to maturity investments; and
 > held for trading or available for sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired. Management determines the classification of 
its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held to maturity, re-evaluates this designation at the 
end of each reporting period.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
Annual Report and Accounts 2017
107 5. Accounting policies continued
Reclassification
The group may choose to reclassify a non-derivative trading financial asset out of the held for trading category if the financial 
asset is no longer held for the purpose of selling it in the near term. Financial assets other than loans and receivables are permitted 
to be reclassified out of the held for trading category only in rare circumstances arising from a single event that is unusual and 
highly unlikely to recur in the near term. In addition, the group may choose to reclassify financial assets that would meet the 
definition of loans and receivables out of the held for trading or available for sale categories if the group has the intention and 
ability to hold these financial assets for the foreseeable future or until maturity at the date of reclassification.
Reclassifications are made at fair value as of the reclassification date. Fair value becomes the new cost or amortised cost as 
applicable, and no reversals of fair value gains or losses recorded before reclassification date are subsequently made. Effective 
interest rates for financial assets reclassified to loans and receivables and held to maturity categories are determined at the 
reclassification date. Further increases in estimates of cash flows adjust effective interest rates prospectively.
Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date on which the group commits 
to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive 
income are reclassified to profit or loss as gains or losses from investment securities.
Measurement
At initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value 
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs 
of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognised as follows:
 > for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss – in profit or loss within other income or other expenses;
 > for available for sale financial assets that are monetary securities denominated in a foreign currency – translation differences 
related to changes in the amortised cost of the security are recognised in profit or loss and other changes in the carrying amount 
are recognised in other comprehensive income; and
 > for other monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale – in other comprehensive income.
Dividends on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale equity instruments are recognised in profit or 
loss as part of revenue from continuing operations when the group’s right to receive payments is established.
Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is included in net gains/(losses). Interest on available for 
sale securities, held to maturity investments and loans and receivables calculated using the effective interest method is recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss as part of revenue from continuing operations.
Impairment – general
The group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of 
financial assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if 
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset 
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of 
financial assets that can be reliably estimated. In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or 
prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the assets are impaired.
Impairment – assets carried at amortised cost
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial 
asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit 
or loss. If a loan or held to maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is 
the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient, the group may measure impairment on 
the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event 
occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the previously 
recognised impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Phoenix Global Resources plc
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
108 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Impairment – assets classified as available for sale
If there is objective evidence of impairment for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in 
profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses on equity instruments that were recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss in a 
subsequent period.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases in a subsequent period and the increase can be 
objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed 
through profit or loss.
5.15 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established where there is evidence 
that the group will not be able to recover some or all of the outstanding payable. The resulting impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are classified as current assets if receipt is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
5.16 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held with financial institutions that can be called on demand together 
with other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash.
5.17 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are 
presented as non-current liabilities.
Accruals are recognised in respect of goods or services delivered but not yet invoiced.
5.18 Provisions
Provision is made for asset retirement obligations and legal claims when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as 
a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be 
reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be incurred in settling the obligation using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase 
in the provision as the discount unwinds due to the passage of time is recognised in the income statement as interest expense.

109 6. Segment information
The group’s executive management comprising the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer and the chief operating officer 
has been determined collectively as the chief operating decision maker for the group. The information reported to the group’s 
executive management for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the basins 
in which the group operates. The strategy of the group is focused on the development of the Vaca Muerta shale opportunity in 
the Neuquina basin while optimising conventional production from that basin. In addition, the group is active in the Austral basin 
in south Argentina where its operations with its partner, Roch S.A., are targeted at exploiting gas resources in the group’s licence 
areas within the basin. The group also has production activities in the Cuyana basin. Segments that are not currently material to 
the operations or result of the group are aggregated within ’Corporate – unallocated’.
The Neuquina, Austral and Cuyana basins have been determined by the group to represent the reportable segments of the business 
based on the level of activity across these basins and the information provided to the executive management.
The group’s executive management primarily uses a measure of adjusted earnings before interest, tax and depreciation (EBITDAX) 
to assess the performance of the operating segments. However, the chief executive officer also receives information about 
segment revenue and capital expenditure on a monthly basis.

transaction as a function of the closing share price used to calculate the purchase consideration. The directors determined that 
the goodwill was not supportable and an impairment charge has been accordingly been recorded. All of the goodwill impairment  
is attributable to the Neuquina basin assets as all of the goodwill had been allocated to Neuquina basin assets.
Non-recurring expenses of US$32,900,000 primarily related to costs incurred in relation to the reverse takeover transaction during the 
year, non-recurring professional fees and severance payments made to former employees. The substantial majority of costs incurred 
related to legal and professional fees associated with the financial and legal diligence and costs related to the preparation of the AIM 
admission document required for the readmission of the enlarged group to trading on the AIM market. The non-recurring transaction 
expenses also include advisory fees related to structuring and Argentina market advice associated with the transaction.

The increase in exploration and evaluation assets of US$161,760,000 relates to the fair value assessed for the licences acquired and 
associated exploration upside as part of the combination transaction. Fair value has been assessed on a comparative transaction 
basis by reference to dollars-per-acre paid in other recent observable market transactions. All of the exploration and evaluation 
assets recognised as part of the combination related to licence areas in the Neuquina basin.
Impairment tests for exploration and appraisal assets
Exploration and appraisal assets are subject to impairment testing prior to reclassification as tangible fixed assets where 
commercially viable reserves are confirmed. Where commercially viable reserves are not encountered at the end of the exploration 
phase for an area the accumulated exploration costs are written off in the income statement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
114 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED No goodwill was recognised prior to 2017. All goodwill presented relates to the allocation of technical goodwill arising as a result of 
accounting for deferred tax on the business combination in the year, see note 14.
The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed for impairment at the period end. The discount rate used in the carrying value 
assessment was the group’s calculated weighted average cost of capital of 14.2%. Prices used in the assessment were the Energy 
Information Administration’s forecast of Brent crude prices.
14. Business combination
Summary of acquisition
On 10 August 2017 the parent entity acquired 100% of the issued share capital of the Trefoil Holdings B.V. group of companies 
by way of a reverse takeover. The acquisition has significantly increased the group’s licensed acreage position in Argentina and, 
in particular, related to the Vaca Muerta shale formation and other unconventional oil and gas prospects present in much of 
the combined group’s acreage in the Neuquina basin.
Details of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:
US$’000
Ordinary shares issued 385,058
Both the assessed fair value of Trefoil Holdings B.V. (Trefoil) and its oil and gas reserves were greater than those of Andes Energia 
Plc (Andes) and therefore the transaction represented a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies. Because of the 
reverse nature of the transaction, and although Andes was the legal acquirer, Trefoil is determined to be the accounting acquirer for 
the purposes of purchase accounting. Accordingly the transaction has been accounted for under IFRS 3, ‘Business Combinations’.
The purchase consideration is valued by reference to the number of shares held by Andes shareholders at the transaction date 
multiplied by the Andes share price on that day. This represents the value ‘given up’ by Andes shareholders in exchange for an 
interest in the enlarged group.
The assets and liabilities recognised as a result of the acquisition are as follows:
Provisional

US$’000
Cash 1,062
Trade receivables 22,826
Inventory 409
Available for sale financial assets 12,812

Property, plant and equipment: facilities 8,440

Provisions (2,141)
Deferred tax liability (53,506)
Net identifiable assets acquired 125,051
Add: goodwill 260,007
Net assets acquired 385,058
The provisional fair values recorded in the purchase price allocation were assessed with the assistance of an external professional 
valuation firm. The inputs used for the evaluation included:
 > asset level cash flow forecasts based on the production, revenue, capital expenditure and operational expenditure assessed by 
reference to the information used to compile the competent persons’ reports prepared as part of the AIM readmission process;
 > an assessment of the group’s weighted average cost of capital;
 > commodity price forecasts based on information published by the Energy Information Administration; and
 > comparable transaction values based on a US Dollar per acre value were used to assess the fair value of non-producing assets 
and unconventional exploration upside associated with producing assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition amounts to US$260,007,000. Of this amount US$224,161,000 relates to the difference between 
the fair value of the purchase consideration given and the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Under IFRS 3 
the purchase consideration has been calculated by reference to the market price of the shares issued in consideration at the date of 
completion. The closing share price on the date of the completion was £0.49/share. The directors have assessed the carrying value 
of this element of the goodwill and specifically note:
 > that prior to and following the combination, the group operates in a single country, Argentina;
 > the group’s operations relate in whole to exploration for and the appraisal and development of oil and gas assets;
 > both oil and gas are commodity products that trade in an active market that, particularly in the case of oil, is international; and
 > oil and gas assets are valued based on the quantity of oil or gas that it is estimated can be economically recovered.

Annual Report and Accounts 2017
115 14. Business combination continued
Having taken these factors into consideration, the directors have concluded that there is no basis for recognising goodwill related to 
the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired.
The remaining goodwill of US$35,838,000 arises as a result of the application of deferred tax accounting to the fair values recorded 
in respect of the Andes assets ‘acquired’. The fair value of property, plant and equipment is higher than the book value it was 
previously recorded at. This increase in recorded value gives rise to an increase in the difference between the book value and tax 
value of the assets that is used to calculate deferred tax. Consequently there is an increase in the deferred tax provision recorded 
with a corresponding entry to goodwill.
The directors consider that this element of goodwill that is recorded as a result of the accounting for deferred tax is attributable 
to the enhanced opportunities and benefits to the enlarged group arising from the potential greater scale of the business as Vaca 
Muerta is developed.
The company incurred costs of US$24,080,000 related to the combination transaction primarily consisting of consulting, 
accountancy, legal and capital markets advisory fees. All such deal related consultancy and advisory fees have been expensed  
in the income statement and are included within administrative expenses.
Revenue and profit contribution
The acquired business contributed revenues of US$22,600,000 and net loss of US$275,142,000 to the group for the period from 
10 August to 31 December 2017.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, consolidated pro-forma revenue and net loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 
would have been US$165,854,000 and US$300,344,000 respectively.
These amounts have been calculated using the acquired group’s results and adjusting them for:
 > differences in accounting policy between the group and Andes;
 > the additional depreciation and amortisation that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from 1 January 2017, together with the consequential tax effects; 
and
 > the effect of the impairment charge recognised in respect of goodwill arising on the transaction. The goodwill impairment charge 
recognised in the income statement in respect of the impairment of goodwill was US$224,169,000.

applicable to the entity’s general borrowings during the year, in this case 22.6% for AR$ denominated borrowings and 7.7% for 
US$ denominated borrowings (2016: 29.5% and 8.2% respectively).
In the year to 31 December 2017, US$690,000 (2016: US$636,000) of interest expense in respect of qualifying assets was 
capitalised as part of additions to property, plant and equipment.

The corporate income tax rate in Argentina in 2017 was 35% (2016: 35%) and applies to profits earned and losses suffered in the 
year to 31 December 2017.
Under the recent tax reform plan the corporate income tax rate will reduce to 30% for the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2019 
and further to 25% for years ended 31 December 2020 and forward.
The reduction in the corporate income tax rate related only to profits reinvested in Argentina. An additional tax is applied to 
dividends to revert the aggregate tax rate in respect of the profits used to make the dividend to 35%.

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for sales of crude oil and natural gas in the ordinary course of business. 
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and generally have, on average, 30-day terms and are therefore all classified as current. 
Due to their short maturities, the book value of trade receivables approximates fair value. Taxation, government related and other 
receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
If collection of amounts is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets.
Other receivables include confirmed balances related to historic transactions with Integra Capital S.A. and with the Andina group 
of companies.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to 
recover all amounts outstanding on the original terms. In 2016, US$698,000 related to an outstanding receivable from a customer 
that had entered administration proceedings. The value of the provision established is equivalent to 60% of the outstanding 
balance from the customer (AR$18,295,000).

Trade payables are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature.
Social security and other taxes include amounts related to tax plans agreed with the Administratión Federal de Ingresos Públicos 
(AFIP), the Argentinian federal tax authority.
Under tax plan arrangements taxes due are paid in instalments with interest charged on the outstanding principal. The group 
historically participated in tax plans on a selective basis and where the level of currency depreciation and the interest rate on 
outstanding amounts resulted in an acceptable finance cost.

secured loans totalling US$17,200,000 with interest rates ranging from 3.0-6.2%.
Fair value
For the majority of the borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their carrying amounts, since the interest payable 
on those borrowings is either close to current market rates or the borrowings are of a short-term nature. Material differences are 
identified only for the following borrowings:

The fair values of non-current borrowings are based on discounted cash flows using a current borrowing rate. They are classified 
as Level 3 fair values in the fair value hierarchy due to the use of unobservable inputs, including own credit risk.
Recognised fair value measurements
The group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
Level 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and 
available-for-sale securities) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price used 
for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in Level 1.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) 
is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-
specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 
This is the case for unlisted equity securities.
The group does not currently hold any financial instruments whose fair value is assessed by reference to Level 1 or Level 2 inputs 
(2016: Nil).

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
120 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22. Financial risk management
The group’s exposure to financial risks and how those risks could affect the group’s future financial performance is summarised below.
Risk Exposure arising from Measurement Management
Market risk – 
foreign exchange.
Future commercial 
transactions.
Cash flow forecasting 
and budgeting.
The majority of the group’s cash is 
held in US Dollars. The group draws 
progressively on available facilities as 
cash is needed to fund development.
Financial assets and liabilities 
recognised in the balance 
sheet that are not 
denominated in US Dollars.
Sensitivity analysis. Due to the influence of the US Dollar 
on the companies within the group, 
the US Dollar has been determined 
to be the functional currency of the 
operating subsidiaries and the parent. 
This determination also reduces the 
exposure to forex gains and losses.
Market risk – 
commodity prices.
Future revenue transactions. Cash flow forecasting 
and budgeting.
The group considers the use of hedging 
instruments and enters into hedge 
arrangements where appropriate 
in order to protect downside price 
exposure and, particularly, to support 
budgeted capex requirements.
Market risk – 
interest rate.
Long term borrowings held 
at variable rates.
Sensitivity analysis. The group has an active treasury 
management function and places 
excess cash on hand on overnight 
or term deposit.
Credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents 
and trade receivables.
Aging analysis.
Credit checks and 
credit ratings.
The group actively monitors 
outstanding receivables. Where a 
customer shows risk of default then 
no credit is extended and all sales are 
made on a prepaid basis.
Liquidity risk. Borrowings and other 
liabilities.
Rolling cash flow forecasts. The group maintains an active treasury 
management function.
Market risk – foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk
The group’s operations are solely focused on Argentina and wholly relate to the exploration for and the development and production 
of oil and gas reserves. The foreign currency that has the most influence on the financial performance of the group is the Argentine 
Peso. The group is exposed to quoted prices for oil and gas which are both traded commodities, the prices of which can also 
significantly influence financial performance.
Argentina has historically been subject to exchange controls that prevented effective currency management. The exchange controls 
were lifted in December 2015. In addition, as part of a policy to encourage the production of oil and gas in a low price environment 
the Argentina government had previously implemented commodity price controls. As the international crude benchmark prices 
recovered during the course of 2017, the government progressively lowered the regulated price for domestic crude to allow domestic 
prices to float in line with international prices. The regulated price regime was removed completely in October 2017.
The previous exchange and commodity price controls reduced the ability to manage exchange risk and commodity price risk 
effectively. As a result, the group did not use derivative financial instruments to manage currency or commodity risk in the year 
ended 31 December 2017 or in the prior year.
In January 2018, the group entered into a swap agreement over a fixed number of barrels of its production derived from proved, 
developed, producing reserves. The swap agreement covers a period of 11 months from 14 January 2018 and provides a level of 
certainty regarding 2018 revenue and cash generation to support the accelerated business plan for 2018.
The group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk related to bank deposits, debtors or creditors that are denominated in 
Argentine Peso or Pound Sterling.
The group’s exposure to foreign exchange risk at the end of the reporting period, expressed in US Dollars, was as follows:

Market risk – cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The group’s main interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings with fixed or semi fixed interest rates that expose the group 
to fair value risk on the underlying borrowing instrument. The group borrows money in both US Dollar and Argentine Peso.
Argentina has historically been subject to high levels of currency devaluation and as well as high inflation. The group maintains 
a portion of its borrowings in Argentine Peso and balances its portfolio of borrowings between fixed Argentine Peso and fixed 
US Dollar in order to manage its exposure to the combination of inflation, currency devaluation and interest rate risk.
The group does not currently use swap instruments or other derivatives to manage its interest rate or fair value risk exposure.

end of the reporting period were as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
122 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks and financial institutions. The group is also exposed to credit 
risk related to its customers and outstanding receivables with them.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is managed by only maintaining bank accounts or placing funds on deposit with recognised, 
reputable financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of B2.
The group sells substantially all of its oil production to the Argentina state-owned oil company, YPF. Approximately 90% by value 
of production is sold to YPF with the remainder sold to private companies operating in Argentina. At 31 December 2017 YPF 
maintained a credit rating of B2. There is no recent history of credit loss, non-payment or default by YPF in relation to oil and 
gas sales. The credit rating would indicate that a credit risk loss should be recorded in respect of sales to YPF; however, given the 
recent payment history related to such sales, the calculated amount of the potential 12 month credit risk loss is not material.
The group undertakes credit and other checks before accepting new customers. Where there are concerns about creditworthiness 
of a counterparty the group requires that the full amount/substantially all of any sale be paid in full before delivery.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due or impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings 
(where available) or to historical information about default rates.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the group’s ability to meet its obligations as they fall due. The group generates cash from its operations. 
Management monitors investment plans, and in particular those in relation to exploration expenditure that may not be cash 
generative in the short term, against available cash and cash equivalents, forecast cash from operations and maturity dates of 
financial liabilities before final sanction and deployment of cash to a project. Undrawn borrowing capacity, where available, is also 
taken into account.

Argentina tax law does not contain the concept of tax groups and therefore deferred tax assets and liabilities cannot be offset 
between and among companies registered in Argentina and falling under the control of the same shareholder. Outside of Argentina, 
the group does not have sufficient concentration of subsidiaries in a single tax jurisdiction to warrant seeking tax group status to 
allow the offset of assets and liabilities.
The company did not recognise deferred income tax assets of US$1,030,000 in respect of tax losses amounting to US$4,120,000 
as there is insufficient evidence that the potential assets will be recovered.
Assessed tax losses amounting to US$2,837,000 will expire between 2023 to 2025.
Under the recent Argentina tax reform, corporate income tax will reduce from 35% to 30% and 25% for the fiscal years ended 
31 December 2018 and 2019. The rate will further reduce to 25% for fiscal years ended 31 December 2020 and onward. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rate of 25% or 30% taking into consideration the expected time of recovery. The 
reductions in the corporate income tax rate relate only to profits that are reinvested in Argentina. Where dividends are paid 
the corporate income tax rates reverts to 35% in respect of the amount of net profit being used to support the dividend. This 
calculation is done on a first-in/first-out basis by reference to accumulated net income within retained earnings.

The costs of individual items of inventory are determined using weighted average costs. Crude oil inventory is recorded using the

production costs for the period by the volume of barrels produced in the period.
Inventories recognised as expense in the period relate to the change in crude inventory period-on-period reflecting the timing of 
the actual sale of the crude as opposed to being expensed based on production volumes in the period. For certain fields, inventory 
is accumulated in storage pending tanker collection. Depending on the timing of collection, crude produced in one period can be

Decommissioning and site restoration
The group has an obligation to remove its oil and gas production equipment from a field at the end of its useful life. The group is 
required to securely plug wells that will no longer be used in order to make them environmentally and physically safe. In addition, all 
land must be returned to its natural state at the cessation of production operations. A provision is established representing the 
present value of the estimated future cost of this obligation with a corresponding depreciable ‘decommissioning’ asset recorded in 
property, plant and equipment.
The key assumptions applied in calculating the decommissioning provision relate to the extent of the physical decommissioning 
activity required, the cost of performing that activity and the timing of when that activity is due to take place. The estimate of 
the quantum of the provision is most sensitive the extent of the activity required, which may change over time due to legislation. 
In addition, the estimate of the provision is sensitive timing of the decommissioning activity which determined by economically 
productive life of the related asset.
Provision for legal claims 
As part of the accounting for the business combination during the year, provisions have been established for certain legal 
contingencies. The claims mainly relate to disputes arising related to payments for services rendered and the nature of the service 
rendered. It is uncertain at this time when or if any cases will come to court and whether any action by a third party would be 
successful. Because the population of cases is small and the value of each claim is low it was not considered appropriate to risk 
adjust the provision or apply probability weighting.

27. Related party transactions
Significant shareholder
The immediate parent of the company is Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mercuria Energy 
Group Limited.
Mercuria Energy Group Holdings is the ultimate beneficial owner of the group and company through its holding of 79.8% of the 
issued share capital but 100% of the voting rights of Mercuria Energy Group Limited. The remaining 20.2% of the issued share 
capital of Mercuria Energy Group Limited is held by participants of the Mercuria employee share option plan. No voting rights are 
held by participants of the Mercuria employee share option plan.
A relationship agreement is in place between the company and Mercuria Energy Group Limited. The relationship agreement has 
been put in place to protect the rights of minority shareholders and limits the control that Mercuria Energy Group can exercise over 
the group, primarily through restricting the number of Mercuria appointed directors on the board. By maintaining a minority of 
Mercuria appointed directors on the board those directors cannot carry a majority vote individually or in concert. The relationship 
agreement also requires directors nominated by Mercuria to recuse themselves from certain board decisions.
Transactions with owners
In advance of the combination transaction a subsidiary of the major shareholder converted a loan it has advanced to one of the 
group’s subsidiaries to equity. The forgiveness of the loan is recognised directly in equity within retained earnings in the amount 
of US$31,713,000.
Subsidiaries
Interests in subsidiaries are set out in note 4 to the company financial statements.

32. Post balance sheet events
Oil price swap
On 22 January 2018 the company entered a swap agreement with Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. under which it sold swaps for 
Brent crude at a price of US$65.97/bbl. The swap agreement is effective from 15 January 2018 to 14 December 2018 and relates 
to 1.2 million barrels of oil production in Argentina. The swap was entered in order to give certainty of cashflow to support the 2018 
capital expenditure programme.
New convertible revolving credit facility
On completion of the combination transaction Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. provided a bridging and working capital facility of 
US$160.0 million. On 15 February 2018, Mercuria agreed to convert US$100.0 million of the facility into ordinary shares of the 
company at a conversion price of £0.37 per share. The remaining US$60.0 million of the bridging and working capital facility was 
restructured into a new convertible revolving credit facility of US$160.0 million, providing additional funds of US$100.0 million to 
support the 2018 capital expenditure programme. The new convertible revolving credit facility has an interest rate of three months 
LIBOR +4% through maturity at end of December 2021.
Renegotiation of Mata Mora and Corralera memorandum of understanding
In April 2018, the company renegotiated the memorandum of understanding with Gas y Petróleo del Neuquén (GyP) that 
previously governed the company’s interest in the Mata Mora and Corralera exploration concessions. Following the renegotiation 
the company’s interest in the retained areas of Mata Mora and Corralera increased from 27% to 90% and the company assumes 
operatorship. As part of the renegotiation Integra Oil & Gas S.A. has agreed to relinquish any interest in these concessions and the 
company is in discussion with Integra Oil & Gas S.A. to agree an appropriate level of compensation. Details of the Mata Mora and 
Corralera blocks are included in the operating review on pages 24 – 31.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
132 COMPANY STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 1. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The company applies consistent accounting policies as applied by the group. To the extent that an accounting policy is relevant to 
both group and company financial statements, refer to the group financial statements for disclosure of the accounting policy. 
Material policies that apply to the company only are included as appropriate.
The company has used the exemption granted under s.408 of the Companies Act 2006 and accordingly has not presented 
its income statement. The loss attributable to the company for the year ended 31 December 2017 was US$532.3 million 
(2016: (loss) US$13.6 million).
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgments 
Critical judgements
Carrying value of investments in subsidiaries
The company assesses its investments in subsidiaries for impairment where an indicator that the investment may be impaired 
exists. Indicators may include poorer operating performance than budgeted, a decrease in the oil and gas reserves booked by 
operating subsidiaries or a decrease in the NPV10 value of assets assessed under the Petroleum Resource Management System 
(PRMS) issued by the Society of petroleum engineers.
The company’s investment in Trefoil Holdings B.V. that was acquired during the year has been tested for impairment at 
31 December 2017. The acquisition was effected through the issue of shares and the pre-impairment carrying value of the 
investment was calculated by reference to the number of shares issued and the closing price on the date of the transaction (£0.49).
The impairment evaluation was performed by comparing the carrying of the investment to the fair value of the underlying assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in the combination transaction. For consolidation accounting the combination represented 
a reverse takeover and therefore the fair value exercise and resultant purchase price allocation included the group financial 
statements was performed by reference to assets and liabilities of the former Andes Energia plc. The corresponding fair value 
of the Trefoil assets and liabilities used in the impairment test for the investment at in the company financial statements was 
calculated using the assessed Andes fair values and applying the share exchange ratio set in the combination. This fair value was 
then compared to the carrying value of the investment in Trefoil and an impairment charge of US$474,336,000 was recorded.
Determination of functional currency
The determination of a company’s function currency can require significant judgement. Functional currency is assessed on an entity 
by entity basis. A company’s function currency is defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates. In this regard the default assumption is that a company’s functional currency will be that in which it is registered or that 
where the majority of its operations are located.
This assumption can be challenged or rebutted where it can be demonstrated that a currency other than that of the country of 
registration or operations can be shown to have a greater influence over the revenue, costs, assets and liabilities of a company.
Following the combination transaction that took place during the year whereby the company acquired 100% of the share capital 
of Trefoil Holdings B.V. the functional currency of the group was reassessed. As part of the transaction, the company entered a 
bridging and working capital facility agreement with Mercuria Energy Trading S.A.
This facility provided US$160.0 million of funding to the company which it, in turn, had used to fund the operations of its 
subsidiaries in Argentina. The company transfers cash for operations in US Dollar. This predominance of the US Dollar in relation 
to the financing of the company means that it is now the movements in the US Dollar exchange rate that most affect the net 
assets and net income of the company. Accordingly, the functional currency of the company has been determined to be the US 
Dollar since the date of completion of the transaction (previously GBP).
As a result it has been determined that the functional currency of the company has changed from GBP to US Dollar as of 
10 August 2017, being the date of completion of the combination transaction. The financial statements were retranslated 
to US Dollar using the spot rate on the date of the change. The impact of the change in functional currency on the reserves 
of the company is shown in the statement of changes in equity. Refer also note 4 in the group financial statements.

133 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. Significant accounting policies
New accounting standards
Three new accounting standards have been issued but are not effective for these financial statements. A summary of the 
standards is presented below together with the status of management’s assessment of their impact on the company’s financial 
reporting
Standard Effective date Management assessment of impact
IFRS 9: Financial instruments 1 January 2018 Currently under evaluation
IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018 Not applicable, the company has no revenue
IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019 Currently under evaluation
Property, plant and equipment
All of the company’s property, plant and equipment relates to leasehold improvements, fixtures and fittings and office equipment. 
Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis at rates that reflect the expected useful life of each asset category at rates of 
20%–30% per annum.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in unquoted subsidiaries are carried at cost unless an indicator of impairment exists in which case the recoverable value 
of the investment is assessed by reference to the cashflows it is expected to generate or the fair value of the assets it holds and an 
impairment loss is recorded as appropriate. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent that the condition giving rise to the 
impairment reverses in a subsequent period.
The company has no investments in subsidiaries that are quoted on an active market.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established where there is evidence that 
the group will not be able to recover some or all of the outstanding payable. The resulting impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are classified as current assets if receipt is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held with financial institutions that can be called on demand together 
with other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible into 
known amounts of cash.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not they are 
presented as non-current liabilities.
Accruals are recognised in respect of goods or services delivered but not yet invoiced.

Financial risk management
The group’s exposure to financial risks and how those risks could affect the group’s future financial performance is summarised below.
Risk Exposure arising from Measurement Management
Market risk – 
foreign exchange
Future commercial 
transactions
Cashflow forecasting 
and budgeting
The majority of the company’s 
cash is held in US Dollars. 
The group draws progressively 
on available facilities as cash 
is needed to fund operating 
subsidiaries
Financial assets and liabilities 
recognised in the balance 
sheet that are not 
denominated in US dollars
Sensitivity analysis Due to the influence of the US 
Dollar on the companies within 
the group the US Dollar has 
been determined to be the 
functional currency of the 
company. This determination 
also reduces the exposure 
to forex gains and losses
Market risk – interest rate Long term borrowings held at 
variable rates
Sensitivity analysis The company has an treasury 
management function and 
monitors interest rate 
announcements

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
138 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED Market risk – cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The company’s main interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings with floating interest rates that expose the group to 
interest rate risk. The company’s functional currency is the US Dollar and it only holds dollar denominated debt and therefore is 
not exposed to exchange rate risk.
The group does not currently use swap instruments or other derivatives to manage its interest rate risk exposure.
The exposure of the group’s borrowings to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period were as follows:
2017

total loans

contingent payments associated with operating leases that the group is party to.
The group does not have any significant contingencies.
Post balance sheet events
Oil price swap
On 22 January 2018 the company entered a swap agreement with Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. under which it sold swaps for 
Brent crude at a price of US$65.97/bbl. The swap agreement is effective from 15 January 2018 to 14 December 2018 and relates 
to 1.2 million barrels of oil production in Argentina. The swap was entered in order to give certainty of cashflow to support the 2018 
capital expenditure programme.
New convertible revolving credit facility
On completion of the combination transaction Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. provided a bridging and working capital facility of 
US$160.0 million. On 15 February 2018, Mercuria agreed to convert US$100.0 million of the facility into ordinary shares of the 
company at a conversion price of £0.37 per share. The remaining US$60.0 million of the bridging and working capital facility was 
restructured into a new convertible revolving credit facility of US$160.0 million, providing additional funds of US$100.0 million to 
support the 2018 capital expenditure programme.
