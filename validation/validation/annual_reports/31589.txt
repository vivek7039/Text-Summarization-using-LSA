In September 2015, Britvic bought ebba (Empresa Brasileira de 
Bebidas e Alimentos SA), the owner of Maguary and DaFruta brands, 
and the number one supplier of concentrated dilutable drinks and 
the number two supplier of ready-to-drink juice drinks in Brazil. 
Building on this, in 2017 we acquired ‘Bela Ischia’ which is the 
leading concentrates and juice brand in the Rio de Janeiro and 
Minas Gerais areas. Bringing ebba and Bela Ischia together both 
complements our existing strength in São Paulo and the north 
east of Brazil, and allows us to strengthen our brand portfolio.

Creating value from international franchises
Under our International franchise we work primarily in partnership with local companies through 
franchise, distribution or licensing arrangements to realise the global potential of our kids, family 
and adult brands. In the United States, we have agreements with a number of Pepsi bottlers.
OVERVIEW
We manufacture, market and sell a range of 
market-leading brands in GB, France, Ireland 
and Brazil. In addition, we are the sole bottler for 
PepsiCo in GB and Ireland, enabling us to sell their 
range of soft drinks alongside our owned-brands.
CUSTOMER INSIGHTS
The starting point of our business is to understand 
the needs of our consumers and how best to 
support our retail partners in maximising their 
soft drinks sales. We have invested in insight 
over the years to ensure we are well-placed to 
understand what people drink, why they drink 
and how diff erent categories are likely to perform 
in the future. In parallel our commercial team 
work closely with our retail partners to deliver 
a great shopping experience in-store.
Our responsible approach
We take a category approach to insight and 
try to understand the bigger picture of the 
soft drinks category and not just the speciﬁ c 
impact on the Britvic portfolio. This enables 
us to present ourselves as category experts 
who can be relied upon to be both balanced 
and fair in our assessment.
SOURCING
We take a global approach to sourcing 
the raw materials needed to produce 
our range of drinks. Each year, we 
spend hundreds of millions of pounds 
on packaging, raw materials and other 
costs to produce our products. We 
organise our teams based on skills 
and knowledge of materials and they 
work closely with suppliers to ensure 
consistent quality, a fair price and the 
sustainability of supply.
Our responsible approach
We have a diverse supply chain, 
sourcing materials from across the 
world to produce soft drinks. We have 
manufacturing sites across the UK, 
Ireland, France and Brazil. We also 
operate franchise partnerships in 
the United States. We directly employ 
over 4,500 people and have a supply 
chain of over 2,500 supplier 
organisations. We are committed to 
producing high quality soft drinks 
which are sourced and manufactured 
in a fair, ethical and environmentally 
responsible way.
MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
In the majority of our markets we 
have our own factories where we 
manufacture the vast majority of 
our brands. We utilise a range of 
pack types including PET, glass 
and aluminium/steel cans, and our 
main ingredients are concentrates, 
fruit, water, sugar and alternate 
sweeteners. In addition, we also use 
third-party partners to manufacture 
for us, mostly for new packaging 
innovations and where we require 
additional volume at peak times. 
We work with specialist companies 
to distribute our products rather 
than own or operate our own 
ﬂ eet of vehicles.
Our responsible approach
We aim to operate our factories to the 
highest standards with the health and 
safety of our employees paramount. 
All of our factories comply with the 
relevant standards of safety and we 
report to the board on a regular basis 
how we are performing and how we 
are achieving this.

Creating value from exports
Under International, we export Britvic products 
around the world and are a signiﬁ cant player in the travel sector.
MARKETING
We market our brands to consumers 
through diff erent channels including, 
television, print, digital and outdoor 
advertising.
Our responsible approach
We follow relevant applicable national and 
local legislation and regulation. We also 
support voluntary industry codes of 
practice, wherever possible. In accordance 
with our Responsible Marketing Code, all 
marketing activity must be in keeping with 
both the letter and the spirit of legislation, 
regulation and such codes. Our marketing 
also complies with all other relevant Britvic 
policies, such as the ethical business policy. 
CONSUMER
We believe that any of our drinks 
can be enjoyed as part of a balanced 
diet and healthy lifestyle. However, 
we aim to encourage positive 
behaviour change and recognise 
that our brands can play a powerful 
role in supporting this ambition. 
We will not encourage excessive 
consumption of any of our drinks.
Our responsible approach
We do not run promotions requiring 
repeat or multiple purchases. Where 
both regular and reduced sugar 
variants of a brand exist, we include 
the reduced sugar variants in marketing. 
WHAT WE DO 
Britvic is the largest supplier of branded still soft drinks and the 
number two supplier of branded carbonated soft drinks in GB, 
and it is an industry leader in Brazil, Ireland and France. Through 
franchising, export and licensing, Britvic has also been growing 
its reach into other territories, particularly the United States.

Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 07 Introduction
I am honoured to have the opportunity to write to you as we 
report our full year results for 2017 having been appointed as 
Chairman in September. I would like to pay tribute to Gerald 
Corbett who has guided the company since its debut as a 
public company in 2005. Under his stewardship Britvic has 
diversified its presence into new markets and quadrupled its 
market valuation. On behalf of everyone at Britvic I would like 
to thank him for his service and commitment to Britvic and we 
wish him well for the future.
Review of the Year
Our 2017 results delivered a solid growth in revenue to 
£1,540.8m (2016: £1,431.3m), despite continued challenging 
market conditions. Adjusted EBITA* increased by 5.1% to 
£195.5m, translating into adjusted earnings per share* of 
52.9p. Statutory profit after tax declined 2.5% to £111.6m, 
reflecting the costs incurred by the business which related to 
the three-year business capability programme which started 
in 2016. During 2017, the Executive team have successfully 
overseen and delivered transformational change to the 
business which has included:
• In relation to the business capability programme we have 
installed new production lines, built new on-site warehousing 
and undertaken major groundworks for the ﬁ nal phase. 
This will enable the business to be more effi  cient and able 
to compete at the highest level 
• The completion of two acquisitions, in Ireland and Brazil. 
Both these businesses are complementary to the company’s 
strategy and will support our growth ambitions in the 
respective markets.
Further information of our performance can be found on 
pages 40 to 43.
Our People
Our employees are at the heart of this business. This year 
has been a testing one for many of them, the business 
capability programme has put pressure on them to deliver 
change whilst maintaining service to our customers and 
ultimately our consumers. 
CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
FOCUSED ON 
THE FUTURE
John Daly 
Chairman
Britvic is in a strong position 
today and I am confident in its 
ability to grow and capitalise 
on opportunities as they arise 
in the future. 
08 www.britvic.com Having visited some of our sites I am extremely impressed 
by the tenacity, passion and commitment that they have 
demonstrated. This level of commitment and passion 
exists throughout Britvic and on behalf of the Board I would 
like to thank all of them for their hard work. In October we 
announced a proposal to close our Norwich site with the loss 
of 242 roles. This was not an easy decision for the Board and 
senior management team but one that we felt necessary to 
protect the long-term prospects of the business. As a Board, 
we are committed to treating those affected with respect and 
dignity and the proposal in no way reflected their performance. 
Every effort will be made to re-deploy those who wish to 
transfer to other sites and we will provide every assistance 
for those seeking to find new roles elsewhere.
The Board
Having succeeded Gerald as Chairman we have made 
some further changes to the board. Sue Clark has been 
appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Ian 
McHoul appointed Senior Independent Director whilst 
remaining Chair of the Audit Committee. Both Sue and Ian 
have extensive multinational experience that has benefited 
the Board since they joined in recent years. In September, 
Joanne Averiss stepped down from the board as the PepsiCo 
nominated director. Ben Gordon will reach the end of his ninth 
year of tenure in 2018 and it has been agreed that Ben will step 
down in early 2018 and will not seek re-election at the AGM. 
Both Joanne and Ben have made valuable contributions during 
their tenure and I would like to thank them for their support 
and wish them well for the future. In view of Joanne and 
Ben’s retirement from the Board, I am delighted to announce 
the appointment of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare, 
effective 29 November 2017. Suniti brings significant M&A, 
corporate finance and development experience whilst William 
has a strong background in marketing and innovation. They 
are excellent additions to the the Board as we look to continue 
to develop our business in the UK and internationally.
Looking Ahead
The long-term prospects for this business are good and on 
behalf of the Board, we look forward to continuing to support 
Simon, Mat and the wider management team as they continue 
to deliver the strategy. Next year the business faces a unique 
event with the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy 
(SDIL) in both the UK and Ireland. Whilst this may well lead 
to some short-term volatility in the industry, I am confident 
we have the right portfolio to navigate through this challenge. 
Britvic is in a strong position today and I am confident in its 
ability to grow and capitalise on opportunities as they arise 
in the future.
The AGM will be held at 11am on 31 January 2018 at 
the offices of Linklaters LLP and I look forward to seeing 
you there. Further information can be found in the Notice 
of Meeting which is available on the Britvic website at
www.britvic.com/investors.

Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 09 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
STATEMENT
CAPITALISE ON 
EXISTING AND FUTURE 
OPPORTUNITIES
Simon Litherland
Chief Executive Officer
This year we have continued to make good progress delivering 
our long-term strategic goals. The challenges we face in all our 
markets have been well documented, however our continued 
focus on meeting consumer needs, successfully executing our 
commercial plans and driving cost efficiency has translated into 
a strong full year performance. We have delivered revenue and 
margin growth and our adjusted EBITA* increased by 5.1%, 
enabling us to deliver an 8.2% increase in the full year dividend.
Generate profitable growth in our core markets
GB
The GB soft drinks market, as measured by Nielsen, has for the 
first time in several years seen value growth ahead of volume. 
Thanks to disciplined revenue management we have led the 
value growth in the soft drinks category and successfully 
protected our profitability in response to rising costs driven 
by underlying cost inflation and the weakening of sterling. 
Margins improved in the second half of the year following 
the implementation of revenue management changes.
In the carbonates category, we have continued to focus 
on no and low-sugar offerings. Despite a highly competitive 
grocery market, Pepsi MAX has continued to gain volume and 
value share and we have seen an excellent performance from 
the R Whites brand, following the introduction of a premium 
range last year. In GB stills, whilst we have seen a decline in 
revenue, our performance trajectory has improved year on 
year and, encouragingly, we have returned to volume growth. 
Robinsons and Fruit Shoot have faced pricing pressure in 
grocery, largely due to aggressive private label and branded 
competition. Whilst we anticipated a weaker final quarter, it 
was worse than expected due to the poor weather in July and 
August. Warm weather during the school holidays is particularly 
beneficial to our portfolio of still brands.
We have continued to benefit from a strong performance 
in our portfolio of immediate refreshment packs, while in 
the leisure channel we have won or retained major accounts 
such as Mitchells & Butlers, Marston’s and KFC.
Our recent innovations, which we believe offer significant 
future growth opportunities, have performed well and 
now represent 5.4% of total revenue. Purdey’s, a healthier, 
more natural energy drink, is resonating with consumers 
and increased its retail value by 55% this year. In the second 
half of the year we launched Robinsons Refresh’d and 
we are really pleased with its early performance, achieving 
£4m retail sales value in 19 weeks since launch. This 
ready-to-drink format offers naturally sourced ingredients 
and no added sugar, enabling consumers to enjoy tasty, 
healthy hydration at only 55 calories per bottle.
France
The soft drinks market, as measured by IRI, has remained 
subdued, reflecting both the poor summer weather and 
the continued impact of the consolidation of procurement 
by grocery retailers. Despite these headwinds, our revenues 
increased, driven by the growth of our branded portfolio. 
We have focused our juice brand marketing on the organic 
Pressade brand and have seen consumers respond positively 
to the introduction of the “Bonjour” range of breakfast time 
We have again demonstrated 
our ability to deliver both our 
short-term financial goals and 
our long-term strategic priorities 
in the face of a challenging 
external environment.

ANSWERS TOPICAL 
SHAREHOLDER QUESTIONS
How do you see the consumer environment, any 
adverse change in consumer behaviour this year?
We have yet to see any material change in consumer 
demand for our products in any of our sales channels 
in GB. In Ireland, the retail environment has remained 
deflationary and in France, the consumer environment 
has remained stable this year. The macroeconomic 
environment in Brazil has been challenging this year for 
consumer goods companies, and soft drinks has been 
affected as have many other categories. There is pressure 
on disposable incomes, unemployment has remained 
high and so people have been cutting back.
Why has proﬁ t after tax gone down?
Profit after tax is a statutory measure and takes into account 
one-off costs that have been incurred. In our case the bulk 
of these one-off costs relate to our business capability 
programme and cover things such as scrapping old assets 
and dual-running costs of old and new lines. Adjusted 
EBITA* which adjusts for these one-off costs generated 
growth of over 5%. 
Are you feeling more or less conﬁ dent on the 
prospects for Fruit Shoot in the USA than last year? 
We have made steady progress over the last 12 months, 
growing distribution and market share. As we head into 
2018 we are clear on our priorities of delivering consistent, 
quality in-store execution. Improving availability on-shelf, 
great feature and display as well as building awareness 
through sampling and trial are all key areas to focus on.
juices. In addition, Fruit Shoot has continued to grow, benefiting 
from the recent introduction of new flavour variants and the 
launch of a higher-juice Fruit Shoot range called Fruizeo, 
that uses spring water and has no added sugar. 
Ireland
The year has seen continued success in Ireland, with growth 
in both our own brand portfolio and the Counterpoint wholesale 
business. Growth in Counterpoint has been further boosted 
by additional business in Dublin following the successful 
completion of the acquisition of East Coast in January. Our 
owned brands, including Ballygowan and MiWadi, have grown 
whilst 7UP declined in a competitive lemon and lime category.
Realise global opportunities in kids, family and 
adult categories
After a very successful first year in Brazil, we have seen the 
well-publicised macro environment challenges have an adverse 
effect on consumer spending and FMCG categories. Our focus 
has been twofold. Firstly, we have looked to protect margins 
in the short term to ensure our business is well positioned 
now and for the future. We have increased prices to offset high 
cost inflation, yet continued to take share thanks to our strong 
in-store execution. Secondly, we have continued to invest in 
the long-term opportunities we see; we continued to expand 
our brand portfolio including continuing the roll out of Fruit 
Shoot, and we have extended our geographic reach through 
the acquisition of Bela Ischia, where we will exceed the 
planned R$10m cost synergies. We believe we are taking 
the right actions to build a strong, sustainable position for 
future long-term growth.
We continue to invest in our international business for 
long-term growth, and our efforts to improve the profitability 
of the business unit are delivering results. In the United States 
Fruit Shoot has made steady progress this year. We continue 
to work with PepsiCo to grow the presence of singles outside 
of the convenience & gas channel into areas such as foodservice 
and leisure. In the grocery channel, we are now lapping the 
first year of multi-pack in market. We have retained key listings 
and retailer feedback has been positive as we head into year 
two. The focus is to ensure we deliver the best experience in 
outlet. Alongside this we are working behind the scenes to 
optimise the supply chain framework to improve profitability. 
To date we have seen enough proof points to support our 
belief that there is a meaningful opportunity for us to invest in, 
but is still too early to call it a long-term success.
Continue to step-change our business capability
We are now two years into the three year business capability 
programme and this year we have a seen a significant amount 
of progress. Our Leeds site is now close to completion, 
with both the big and small PET lines up and running and 
the automation of the new warehouse due for completion in 
the coming months. Our London site is now fully operational 
with a new flexible PET line and on-site warehouse completed. 
The site that has seen the most change this year is Rugby, 
where we have installed three new can lines and started the 
groundworks for the new warehouse and aseptic line that will 
come on-stream next year. We are ahead of schedule on the 
delivery of benefits, with £3m feeding through to the bottom 
line in 2017.
In October, we announced the proposed closure of our 
Norwich site in 2019. Subject to completion of consultation, 
production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot is then proposed to 
transfer to our other GB sites, with additional PET lines proposed 
to be installed to accommodate this. We are fully committed 
to treating our employees fairly and with respect, and will 
be providing a full support package including redeployment, 
assistance to find jobs elsewhere and redundancy packages. 
Upon completion of the proposed works in early 2019, 
we will then be in a position to realise the full benefits of the 
programme from 2020 in line with previously stated guidance. 
As well as greater production efficiency, we will benefit from 
reduced distribution costs and will be able to unlock a working 
capital benefit by carrying lower inventory. Free cash flow 
conversion should accelerate significantly, as capital 
Purdey’s
Purdey’s was relaunched in 2016 to target the demand 
for a more natural energy drink. Purdey’s is a multivitamin 
juice drink that contains vitamins and natural botanicals to 
give a natural lift. It has performed well with consumers 
and increased its retail value by 55% this year. In 2017, 
we introduced Purdey’s in a 250ml can format, helping 
more people to thrive on the go.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
CONTINUED
A strong performance for GB carbonates this year, 
especially Pepsi MAX, are you conﬁ dent you can 
repeat this next year?
2017 was an excellent year for our carbonates portfolio, 
especially Pepsi MAX. We extended the range with the 
launch of MAX Ginger and this combined with MAX Cherry 
has helped bring more consumers into the brand. 2018 is a 
difficult one to call with the arrival of the Soft Drinks Industry 
Levy (SDIL) in April. This is the single biggest event to impact 
the category in memory and brings with it a level of uncertainty 
as to how consumers will react to different prices on-shelf 
for higher and lower sugar products. What we do know for 
certain is that we have a great range of brands and offerings 
to offer consumers and we are working closely with our 
retail customers to minimise the impact.
Do you expect stills to be in growth next year?
Whilst Stills didn’t meet our expectations this year, it is an 
improved performance. For 2018 we have really exciting 
plans for GB stills that we’re confident will resonate with 
consumers. Robinsons is the nation’s most trusted soft 
drinks brand and we’re continuing to reinvigorate the brand, 
and are resetting the squash category into ‘good, better, 
best’ through Fruit Creations, aimed at older families, and 
a premium cordials range aimed at adults. J2O has a new 
look and feel to link with Spritz more clearly, and has an 
improved liquid which falls under the Soft Drinks Industry 
Levy. Fruit Shoot continues to evolve to target a wider 
range of occasions. There will be more to come on Fruit 
Shoot which we’ll talk to you about later in the year.
How is the business capability programme 
progressing?
Investment at our Leeds and London sites is nearing 
completion with only the automation of the warehouse 
at Leeds to be completed in the next couple of months. 
At these two sites we have generated both production 
and logistics benefits as the new lines run more efficiently 
and on-site warehousing reduces road miles. At our Rugby 
site we have installed three new can lines and groundworks 
have started for a new on-site warehouse and aseptic line. 
In 2017, we have generated £3m of benefits ahead of our 
original estimate of £1m this year. 
expenditure reduces to more normal levels from 2019 and 
benefits continue to accrue. The benefits go beyond cost 
savings and lower stock levels, as this state of the art network 
provides a broader range of pack sizes and configurations to 
enable our commercial teams to participate more effectively 
in the market. We continue to roll out the programme to other 
business units, with the closure of our Nangor Road distribution 
centre in Ireland and the outsourcing of logistics, and the saving 
of over £5m of overhead cost across the Group.
Build trust and respect in our communities
Being trusted and respected in our communities has been 
a core pillar of our strategy since 2013. We set ourselves 
stretching 2020 goals, reflecting the issues we face as a 
business and as a society more broadly. This year we have 
taken the opportunity to review our sustainable business 
programme to ensure that it is focused on the issues that 
matter most to our business and to our stakeholders. The 
result of this is a programme which focuses on three key areas 
where we believe we can make a real difference – Healthier 
People; Healthier Communities; and Healthier Planet. As part 
of our review, we have decided that from this year we will 
embed our sustainable business report into our Annual 
Report, reflecting the importance we attach to growing Britvic 
in a way that builds trust and respect with our stakeholders. 
Helping consumers make healthier choices has been a key 
plank of our sustainable business strategy since 2013. We 
have continued to make progress in this area through our 
three-pronged approach: reformulation with no compromise 
on taste or quality, through which we have removed over 
20bn calories from GB diets on an annualised basis; innovation, 
where our pipeline is heavily weighted towards low/no-sugar 
drinks which comprised of 68% of all projects across the 
12 www.britvic.com 41%
of revenue is now generated 
outside of GB
Robinsons Fruit Creations
In 2017 we launched Fruit Creations, 
containing twice the fruit of the core 
Robinsons range and more juicy and 
fruitier flavours created specifically 
for grown-up taste buds.
While April 2018 brings 
uncertainty with the 
introduction of the Soft Drinks 
Industry Levy in GB and 
Ireland, we are well placed 
to navigate it thanks to the 
strength and breadth of our 
brand portfolio and our 
exciting marketing and 
innovation plans. This, 
combined with our continued 
focus on revenue and cost 
management, means we 
remain confident of making 
further progress next year.

Chief Executive Officer
Group; and marketing responsibly through our Responsible 
Marketing Code, where we do not advertise high sugar 
products to under 16s and have led all advertising in relation to 
Pepsi with sugar-free MAX since 2005. By next April, 72% of 
our total portfolio and 94% of our owned brands will be below 
or out of scope of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in GB and 69% 
of our total portfolio and 79% of our owned brands in Ireland. 
Helping communities to thrive through being a good 
employer and good neighbour is the second plank of our 
sustainable business programme. This year our Great Place 
to Work Trust Index – our measure of how our employees 
feel about working at Britvic – rose for the fourth consecutive 
year to 75%. 
We have focused on minimising our impact on the 
environment through efficiency measures and new technology 
as part of our investment in the GB supply chain. Once fully 
commissioned our new lines will reduce our water and energy 
consumption, for example in our East London factory the new 
PET line runs at twice the capacity of the older lines and is 30% 
more energy efficient. We also eliminated over 300 tonnes 
of plastic bottle packaging in GB through our supply chain 
investment programme in 2017. 
Outlook
We have again demonstrated our ability to deliver both our 
short-term financial goals and our long-term strategic priorities 
in the face of a challenging external environment. 2018 brings 
the introduction of the Soft Drinks Industry Levy in GB and 
Ireland. We recognise the significance of this event for the 
industry and the high level of uncertainty it will create in the 
short term. However, we have prepared well and, with our 
great portfolio of brands and our strong marketing and 
innovation plans, we believe we are well placed to navigate 
it. This, combined with our continued focus on revenue and 
cost management, including the benefits of the business 
capability programme, mean we feel confident of delivering 
further progress next year. Further forward, as the business 
capability programme approaches completion, we will see 
additional cost and cash flow improvements, creating a 
strong platform for an exciting future for Britvic.

Introduction
In each of our markets we track the volume and value 
performance of the soft drinks category by channel and 
sub-category. The data is compiled by independent suppliers 
and is sourced from retailer’s electronic point of sale (EPOS) 
data. Typically, it is available for different channels through 
different suppliers and will cover a large part of the market 
but does not provide 100% coverage of all soft drinks sales as 
some retailers do not participate in the data collection exercise. 
However, it is consistent in its analysis and helps us understand 
how channels, categories and brands are performing.
GB
In GB, we have a broad portfolio of brands and our products 
are available in all channels. The analysis provided here is a 
snapshot of the soft drinks category in the off-trade (Grocery 
supermarkets and Impulse outlets). A full review of the GB 
soft drinks category can be found in the “Soft Drinks Category 
Review” available online at www.britvic.com/sustainable-
business/resources/sustainable-business-reports, which 
is published annually on a calendar basis.
14 www.britvic.com Key macro trends in soft drinks & how Britvic are 
reacting to them 
The trends driving the soft drinks industry are rooted in 
evolving consumer lifestyles, societal challenges around 
health and the environment, and increased government 
intervention in the market. Collectively, these trends have 
driven reformulation and innovation in the soft drinks market 
on a significant scale. The three major outcomes of these 
trends dominating the market include: 
1. Greater demand for healthier choices
2. A drive towards premium options
3.  Convenience: more choices of soft 
drinks available in more places
1
Healthier choices
For several years, consumers have been embracing healthier 
lifestyles and they are actively choosing ‘better for you’ soft 
drinks options, as well as drinking less alcohol. At the same 
time, obesity levels globally are rising putting significant strains 
on public health services and prompting calls for governments 
to take action. As a result, both the UK and Irish governments 
will be introducing a Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) on drinks 
with more than 5g/100ml of added sugar in April 2018. 
How is Britvic helping consumers make healthier choices?
Our purpose is to make life’s everyday moments more 
enjoyable and part of doing that is by helping consumers 
make healthier choices through making drinks that taste 
great and are better for you. Since 2013, we embarked 
on a bold, 3-pronged strategy of reformulation, innovation 
and using the power of our brands responsibly to help 
consumers make healthier choices. As a result of our 
actions, we have removed over 20bn calories from our 
portfolio since 2013 on an annualised basis.

  See page 36 for more detailed information.

Premiumisation: A drive towards premium options
Although there are pressures on consumer spending in the 
grocery trade, it’s clear that many consumers are willing to 
trade up for brands worth paying more for. Premium brands are 
outperforming mainstream and value brands in every segment. 
How is Britvic driving premiumisation?
Robinsons, the market leader in dilutes is leading the 
re-invention of the dilutes category through premiumising 
the Robinsons range with exciting new product launches; 
Creations & Cordials. 
Macro trends around socialising and declining alcohol 
consumption are also driving greater demand for premium 
soft drinks options, with one in five people now tee-total, 
and one in three limiting or reducing their alcohol consumption. 
In response, Britvic has developed an adult premium drinks 
portfolio which includes both mainstream and super premium 
brands such as London Essence Company.
3
Convenience: more choices of soft drinks 
available in more places
Convenience continues to be a growing trend across 
both consumers and the retail landscape with soft drinks 
overtaking bread as the number three reason driving shoppers 
into convenience stores. The growing demand for product 
solutions which meet people’s needs while on the go during 
busy lifestyles is accelerating. Retailers are aware that having 
a great soft drinks offer is critical to succeed and their offers 
are adapting to meet changing consumer needs.
How is Britvic capitalising on this trend?
The strength and breadth of our portfolio positions us well to 
meet a diverse range of consumer needs, whoever they are, 
wherever they are. We have a brand for every occasion. Our 
innovation pipeline is heavily weighted to deliver more choice 
on more occasions to even more people.
Robinsons is a great example of how we’re constantly moving 
into new occasions and innovating to meet new consumer 
trends; a journey which started in 2015 with the launch of 
Squash’d to target consumers on the go. In 2016 the brand 
launched into dispense in a number of foodservice customers, 
and in 2017, we launched Refresh’d, a ready to drink product 
made from 100% natural ingredients. These recent innovations 
mean Robinsons is now enjoyed by more people, on more 
occasions, more often whilst maintaining the quality and 
heritage that consumers expect from the brand.
Another interesting example is Purdey’s which meets 
increasing consumer demand for natural energy solutions. 
Purdey’s can now be bought in two flavours, in both glass 
bottles and cans.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information RISK MANAGEMENT
Our approach
As with any business we face risks and uncertainties. We 
believe that effective risk management supports the successful 
delivery of our strategic objectives. We have an established 
risk management framework to identify, evaluate, mitigate and 
monitor the risks we face as a business. The risk management 
framework incorporates both a top down approach to identify 
the company’s principal risks and a bottom up approach to 
identify operational risks. The Executive team performs a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company 
annually, which is reviewed by the Board. Similarly, all business 
units and functions perform annual risk assessments that 
consider the company’s principal risks and specific local risks 
relevant to the market in which they operate. The Board, 
Executive team and business units and functions monitor 
and review their risk maps and information during the year 
with formal reviews occurring at least twice a year. This 
review includes an assessment of the movement in the 
risks, the strength of the controls relied on and the status 
of the mitigation actions. 
The viability statement on page 33 provides a broader 
assessment of the long-term liquidity and solvency of the 
company after consideration of the principal risks. 
Key areas of focus
We continue to challenge and improve the quality of risk 
information generated across the business. We complete 
‘deep dives’ on targeted risks; these are selected where 
there has been an increase in the risk score or because it 
is an emerging risk area. The objective of the ‘deep dives’ 
is to assess the strength of the controls in place and the 
effectiveness of the mitigating activities.
Risk appetite
The UK Corporate Governance Code requires companies 
to determine their risk appetite. This is an expression of 
the amount and types of risk that the company is willing 
to take to achieve its strategic and operational objectives. 
We have agreed a set of company appetite statements for 
our principal risks. We use the articulation of risk appetite 
in decision making across the company, and to define and 
validate the mitigating activities required to manage our risks.
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Board of Directors
Assesses principal risks and sets risk appetite.

management and internal controls.

28 www.britvic.com PRINCIPAL RISKS AND 
UNCERTAINTIES
1 CONSUMER PREFERENCE   
Principal risk
Failure to deliver brand propositions which respond to changing 
consumer preferences.
    
Risk description
Consumer preferences, tastes and behaviours evolve over time and diff er 
between the diff erent markets in which we operate. Our ability to anticipate 
these trends and ensure the strength and relevance of our brands is critical 
to our competitiveness in the market place and performance. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• We have a broad portfolio of products operating across a number of 
sub-categories and markets to increase coverage of consumer trends. 
•  We carry out a continuous assessment of market trends to identify 
consumer, customer and shopper insights in order to develop category 
and brand strategies.
• Our innovation process is informed by category strategies and uses tools, 
processes and resources to develop new products and brand communication.
2017 developments
• Our mitigating approaches remain broadly unchanged and we continue 
to invest in innovation and our marketing programmes. For example, we 
launched Robinsons Refresh’d, a low-calorie, all natural juice drink in the UK. 
•  We launched the premium brand Monte Rosso and expanded the 
London Essence brand to include a soda range for the adult on-trade 
consumption occasion.
2 HEALTH AND OBESITY CONCERNS  
Principal risk
Failure to address health concerns of government, consumers and other 
stakeholders (e.g. sugar and obesity).
    
Risk description
There are diff erent consumer preferences in the markets we operate 
in for sugar and sweeteners and other ingredients such as preservatives. 
Additionally, there is a continued high level of media and government 
scrutiny on health and obesity in all of the markets we operate in with 
a new Soft Drinks Industry Levy (‘SDIL’) due to be introduced on soft 
drinks manufacturers in April 2018 in the UK and Ireland. It is important 
that we continue to take a leadership position on health issues.
Controls and mitigating activities
• We have a wide range of soft drinks, many of which are low or no sugar. In 
Ireland, Britvic leads the ‘No added sugar’ (‘NAS’) market and in GB Britvic has 
a signiﬁ cantly higher market share in NAS than the total soft drinks market. 
• Ongoing evaluation and development of the brand portfolio and innovation 
pipeline; our innovation pipeline is weighted towards lower-sugar or 
nutritionally enhanced brands.
• Reformulation of products where we can to help consumers make 
healthier choices. 
• We market our brands responsibly with no marketing to under 12s and 
a focus on low or no-sugar variants as well as encouraging consumers 
to lead active lifestyles.
• We work closely with non-government organisations and trade associations 
in our markets to fully participate in the debate and help shape solutions.
2017 developments
• 72% of our GB portfolio (by volume) and 94% of GB own brands will be 
below or exempt from the SDIL by April 2018.
• Over 20 billion calories have been removed from GB diets on an annualised 
basis through reformulation since 2013.
• Subway switching to Britvic delivered a 3.8bn reduction in calories between 
July 2016 and July 2017. 
• In the on-trade we have accelerated the availability of Pepsi Max on dispense.
• Reformulation of products to be below the SDIL without compromising on 
taste. For example, J2O and Britvic tonic have been reformulated and will 
be below the SDIL.
• 68% of our global innovation was in no/low-sugar products.
• We continued to support Public Health England’s Change4Life campaign 
with Robinsons and Fruit Shoot. 
The table below sets out the principal risks faced by the company, 
the link to the company’s strategy, movement in the risk score 
and examples of relevant controls and mitigating factors. 
The impact of the UK’s exit from the EU has been considered 
and, whilst not seen as a separate risk, it has been reflected in 
some of the other principal risk areas. We have already been 
affected by the depreciation of sterling, and other potential risks 
include trade tariffs and limits to the free movement of people 
that could adversely impact Britvic or the company’s suppliers. 
We have created a working group to monitor the impact of 
Brexit and ensure that we take a proactive approach once 
the implications are better understood. 
The risk score movement from the prior year for each 
principal risk is presented as follows:

3 RETAILER LANDSCAPE AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS  
Principal risk
We may not be able to maintain strong relationships or respond to changes 
in the retailer landscape.
    
Risk description
Maintaining strong relationships with customers is critical for our brands to be 
available and well presented to our consumers. A failure to do this may impact 
our ability to obtain competitive pricing and trade terms and/or the availability 
and presentation of our brands.
Controls and mitigating activities
• We operate across many diff erent customer channels and markets.
• Continuous monitoring of customer performance and trends. 
• We develop joint business plans with customers that include investment 
and activation plans.
• Development of compelling off erings for our customers’ shoppers based 
on our understanding of their business and the soft drinks category.
2017 developments
• The GB supply chain investment programme is enabling us to respond to 
customer and consumer needs through improved capability to produce 
diff erent products and pack sizes. 
• This year we have retained major contracts with KFC and Mitchells & Butler.
4 THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS  
Principal risk
Partnerships may not be renewed or are renewed on less favourable terms.
    
Risk description
We currently bottle and co-market a number of PepsiCo products in GB and 
Ireland, including 7UP and Pepsi. Additionally, we have a relationship with a 
number of partners to grow our family, adult and kids brands outside of our 
core markets. Our partnership with PepsiCo and distributors and franchisees 
is an important part of our business and delivery of our strategy going forward. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Robust governance and management of relationship with PepsiCo 
and other partners.
2017 developments
• The performance of the Pepsi brand continues to be strong; for example in GB 
our Pepsi market share increased by 40 bps in the year ended September 2017 .
5
SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENT 
NR
Principal risk
Failure to adequately address the environmental impact of our business including 
reducing natural resource consumption and the impact of end of life packaging. 
      
Risk description
In a world where demand on natural resources continues to grow, it is 
important that we continually look to increase the sustainability of our 
resource consumption. This includes looking at reducing the environmental 
impact of the company’s packaging, particularly at the end of its life.
Controls and mitigating activities
• We have externally certiﬁ ed management systems in place to monitor 
and reduce the environmental impact of our operations.
• We have continued commitment to environmental protection with 2020 
goals within our sustainable business programme.
• Environmental considerations are embedded within our innovation and 
renovation pipeline and our Innovation and Technical teams work with 
research and academic institutions to develop sustainable solutions.
• We work closely with our suppliers to source sustainably and reduce 
the environmental impact of all our materials.
• Through our brands and in partnership with our customers, we promote 
recycling and anti-littering. 
• We work closely with non-government organisations and trade 
associations to develop solutions and respond to policy developments.
2017 developments
• There is a high level of government and media scrutiny on single-use 
plastic containers and the impact that they have on the environment and 
the oceans. The feasibility of a Deposit Return Scheme (‘DRS’) system and 
other actions to increase recycling are being evaluated for England, Wales, 
Scotland and Ireland. 
• In response to these developments we have established a packaging 
steering and working group to formalise internal management of packaging 
related developments and work with the British Soft Drinks Association, 
government, suppliers and other experts to determine the appropriate 
holistic solution.
• The GB supply chain investment programme is further enabling us to 
access the latest in packaging technology, and will improve our effi  ciency 
and reduce our energy and water consumption.

30 www.britvic.com 6 INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION 
Principal risk
Our plan to grow our international business is limited by lack of brand 
momentum, local geo-political or economic risks, the risks associated 
with start-up proﬁ tability or substandard processes and systems.
    
Risk description
To achieve our strategy of growing internationally it is important that we have 
the appropriate governance, systems and processes in place and that our 
brand propositions respond appropriately to local consumer preferences. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Our geographic spread mitigates against localised geo-political or 
economic risk. 
• We have a mix of ‘asset light’ franchise and business acquisitions, which 
also reduces our exposure to this risk. 
• We carry out extensive due diligence prior to entering into a new market. 
• We closely monitor current and forecast performance of our business 
units and, where required, rebalance investment priorities.
2017 developments
• The Brazil economy aff ected FMCG category performance but action on 
controlling the cost base as well as increasing prices has protected margins. 
•  Brand portfolio and geographic footprint in Brazil were expanded following 
the Bela Ischia acquisition. 
• Successful launch of Fruit Shoot in São Paulo, now being rolled out to other cities. 
• Continued focus on quality of distribution and in-store presence to 
increase rate of sale of Fruit Shoot in the United States. Targeted marketing 
utilising digital platforms and sampling to increase awareness.
7
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Principal risk
Supplier failure, market shortage or an adverse event in our supply chain 
impacts upon our ability to source materials and/or that the cost of our 
products is signiﬁ cantly aff ected by commodity price movements.
      
Risk description
Our business depends on purchasing a wide variety of materials and services 
from across the world. There is a risk that our cost and availability of goods 
are impacted by commodity price movements, adverse weather and climate 
change (and its eff ect upon availability, yields and subsequently prices) as 
well as supplier failure. In addition, our business success relies upon effi  cient 
manufacturing and distribution processes. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Monitoring of market conditions for commodities and, where appropriate, 
hedging our contractual positions.
• Robust supplier strategy, selection, monitoring and management processes.
•  We maintain multiple sources of supply for our products wherever possible.
•  Externally certiﬁ ed management systems across the supply chain.
• Business continuity planning processes.
2017 developments
• The GB supply chain investment programme will further improve the 
ﬂ exibility and therefore resilience of our GB supply chain.
• Evolution of management systems and assurance processes in light of 
the GB supply chain investment. 
• Brexit could result in higher cost of goods for Britvic, for example as a result 
of trade tariff s. We have a working group in place to monitor the impact of 
Brexit and will take a proactive approach as more information is known. 
8 SAFE AND HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS 
Principal risk
A faulty or contaminated product, either through malicious contamination, 
human error or equipment failure, is supplied to the market.
      
Risk description
The quality of our products is of the up-most importance to us and it is 
of paramount importance that we manage product quality and integrity. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• We have robust quality management standards applied and rigorously 
monitored across our supply chain. 
• Supplier assurance and management processes.
• Dedicated central teams to oversee quality and supplier assurance, 
working closely with the business units.
2017 developments
• Continued focus on improving the management standards framework 
and the monitoring and oversight processes used across the company. 
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 31
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 9 LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
Principal risk
Non-compliance with local laws or regulations or breach of our internal 
policies and standards.
      
Risk description
Britvic is subject to a wide range of legislation, regulation, guidance and codes 
of practice in areas such as composition, labelling, packaging, marketing 
claims, advertising, safety, environment, competition, tax and employee 
health and safety. Failure to comply with such requirements could have 
a signiﬁ cant impact on our reputation and incur ﬁ nancial penalties. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Britvic code of conduct and our key company policies embedded and rolled 
out to employees. 
• Monitoring processes to ensure compliance with our Group policies and all 
relevant legislation and regulations.
• We work closely with our external advisors and the regulators, government 
bodies and trade associations regarding current and future legislation which 
would impact upon the business.
• Whistle blowing processes in place.
2017 developments
• Continue to monitor changes in law and regulation and compliance with 
company policies.
10 TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SECURITY 
Principal risk
We experience a major failure of IT infrastructure or breach in system or 
information security.
      
Risk description
We interact electronically with customers, suppliers and consumers and 
our supply chain operations are dependent on reliable IT systems and 
infrastructure. Disruption to our IT systems could have a signiﬁ cant impact 
on our sales, cash ﬂ ows and proﬁ ts. Additionally, and in common with many 
businesses, cyber security breaches could lead to unauthorised access to, 
or loss of, sensitive information. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Disaster recovery plans tested every year. 
• Central governance and decision-making processes for system changes.
• Information and IT policies in place. IT security standards are closely 
monitored to protect systems and information. 
• Incident response plans in place, recognising that whilst this risk can be 
managed it cannot be eliminated.
2017 developments
• In 2016/17 a number of major organisations were subject to ransom cyber 
incidents. Britvic was unimpacted by these attacks. 
• We have increased investment to improve information security processes 
and cyber risk awareness.
11 TREASURY AND PENSION 
Principal risk
Changes to exchange rates and interest rates can have an impact on proﬁ ts 
and cash ﬂ ows.
 
Risk description
Britvic is exposed to a variety of external ﬁ nancial risks relating to treasury and 
pension. Changes to exchange rates and interest rates can have an impact on 
business results and the cost of interest on our debt. Additionally, the GB and 
Ireland businesses have deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans which, whilst closed 
to new employees and future accruals, are exposed to movements in interest 
rates, values of assets and increased life expectancy. 
Controls and mitigating activities
• Robust monitoring of exchange rates and interest rates.
• Active risk management and hedging strategies in place to manage 
exchange and interest ﬂ uctuations.
• Pricing strategy and execution processes.
• Monitoring of investment and funding strategies for the pension fund.
2017 developments
• The recent depreciation of sterling has led to higher input costs across 
a number of our key commodities. However, we are taking action through 
procurement initiatives to reduce some of this impact.
• The tri-annual valuation of the GB deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme was 
completed in 2017.

32 www.britvic.com VIABILITY STATEMENT 
Assessment
During the year, the Directors assessed the viability of the 
company, taking into account the company’s current financial 
position and the principal risks, particularly those that could 
threaten the business model. These risks and the actions being 
taken to manage or mitigate them are set out on pages 29-32. 
The Directors have determined that a three year period is an 
appropriate timeframe for the assessment given the dynamic 
nature of the FMCG sector and this is in line with the company’s 
strategic planning period. The starting point for the viability 
assessment is the strategic and financial plan, which makes 
assumptions relating to the economic climate in each of our 
markets, the growth of the soft drinks category, input cost 
inflation and growth from the company’s value drivers. The 
process for assessing the viability of the company involved 
input from a number of functions across the business to model 
a series of theoretical ‘stress test’ scenarios based on the 
materialisation of principal risks:
• Firstly, the Directors considered the impact of severe but 
plausible scenarios for each principal risk. For example, the 
trend towards health and the introduction of the Soft Drinks 
Industry Levy in the UK and Ireland results in a reduction 
in the soft drinks category size, further depreciation of 
sterling increases the cost of Britvic’s goods, or a major 
IT breach results in an outage in key systems, resulting 
in the temporary inability to selling goods.
•  Secondly, the Directors assessed diff erent scenarios that 
group together principal risks. As part of this the Directors 
considered the interconnectivity between principal risks but 
also scenarios where unconnected risks occur at the same 
time. The stress test scenarios were reviewed against the 
company’s current and projected debt and liquidity position. 
•  Finally, a reverse stress test was performed which allowed 
the Directors to assess the circumstances that would render 
the business model unviable. To support the ﬁ nal conclusion 
on viability, the assessment also took into account the 
mitigations available to the company to protect against 
these downside scenarios. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the three year period to September 2020.

BUSINESS REVIEW
W e are committed to making a positive 
difference to the world around us – 
helping to make it healthier, happier 
and more sustainable.
Sustainable business: A Healthier Everyday
Our purpose is to make life’s everyday moments more 
enjoyable and we know that being a responsible, sustainable 
business is fundamentally important to achieving this. We have 
been bringing enjoyment to millions of everyday moments for 
over a century through our much-loved brands and we are 
committed to continuing to make a positive difference to the 
world around us – helping to make it healthier, happier and 
more sustainable. 
This year we have reviewed our sustainable business 
programme to ensure that it continues to focus on the issues 
that matter most to our business and to our stakeholders; that 
it reflects how our business has grown over the past four years 
when the trusted and respected ambitions were set; and that 
it helps us to deliver our business purpose. The result of this is 
our ‘ A Healthier Everyday’ programme, which focuses on three 
key areas where we believe we can make a real difference, 
through actions larg e and small: 
• HEALTHIER  PEOPLE 
• HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES 
• HEALTHIER PLANET 
Across each of these areas we have built strategies in response 
to the challenges we face, as a business but also as a society 
more broadly – recognising we all have a role to play in tackling 
global issues such as obesity and climate change. Building 
the trust and respect of our communities is a core part of our 
business strategy and our A Healthier Everyday programme 
is focused on the issues that represent a direct or indirect 
impact on our ability to create, preserve or erode economic, 
environmental and social value for us, our stakeholders, the 
environment and society at large.
Reporting approach
To reflect the importance we attach to growing Britvic in a way 
that builds trust and respect with all our stakeholders, this year 
we have taken the decision to embed our sustainable business 
review into our Annual Report and will no longer be producing 
a separate Sustainable Business Report.
Governance
Integrating sustainability across the business is fundamental 
to achieving our trusted and respected ambitions. As part 
of this year’s review, we assessed the effectiveness of our 
sustainable business committee and identified opportunities 
to better integrate our A Healthier Everyday programme. By 
establishing Executive level accountability for our programme 
pillars we are better able to utilise existing governance groups 
to oversee the delivery of our sustainability goals.

programme can be found at www.britvic.com

Helping consumers to make healthier

We have a long heritage in contributing 
positively to people’s diets. Health concerns, 
including obesity, affect all our markets and 
consumer habits are changing in favour of 
healthier options. Our portfolio needs to 
reflect this.
 
HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES
Helping communities to thrive
Our business contributes to the economic 
wellbeing of many communities, through 
employment, training and charitable activity.
By being a good employer and neighbour, 
we can help create communities where 
people flourish.
HEALTHIER PLANET
Helping to secure our planet’s future
Our business relies heavily on natural 
resources to produce our drinks (energy, 
water, raw materials). With increasing global 
consumption of resources, sources are 
diminishing, which could have significant cost 
and operational implications for our business.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information HEALTHIER PEOPLE
The health of our consumers really matters to us. Our business 
was built on bringing an affordable source of vitamins to 
consumers at a time when diets lacked important nutrients. 
We have never forgotten our history and today we do our best 
to make it easier for our consumers to make healthier choices 
and live healthier lives in order to create A Healthier Everyday. 
Health and obesity concerns continue to affect our markets 
and over the past few years we have witnessed a shift in 
consumer behaviour in favour of healthier products. We are 
committed to helping our consumers make healthier choices 
and live healthier lives and believe our broad portfolio of drinks 
can be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. Our leading approach 
to reformulation has seen us remove over 20 billion calories 
from GB diets on an annualised basis since 2013. Across our 
global portfolio we have reduced the average calories per 
250ml serve by over 6% since 2014 (excluding Brazil). 
Our 2020 commitment: Reduce average calories 
per 250ml serve by 20% to 28kcal from 
35.02kcal in 2013 (excluding Brazil)
This year 68% of all innovation across the business was 
in low/no-sugar products. With the introduction of the Soft 
Drinks Industry Levy in the UK and a soft drinks levy in Ireland 
next year, our innovation and reformulation activity has ensured 
that we are well prepared and by April 2018, 94% of our 
own brand portfolio in GB will be exempt from the levy, 72% 
including the PepsiCo portfolio. In Ireland, 79% of our own 
brand portfolio will be exempt from the proposed sugar tax.
New product launches that support our calorie reduction 
targets include Robinsons Refresh’d in GB, a still spring water 
drink made using 100% naturally sourced ingredients, with no 
added sugar and only 55kcal per 500ml serve, and Pepsi MAX 
Ginger in GB and Ireland, the latest variant to the Pepsi MAX 
range created for the growing number of health-conscious 
consumers looking for bold, interesting flavours without the 
sugar. Containing natural ginger flavouring, a 500ml serve of 
Pepsi MAX Ginger contains only 2kcal and no added sugar. 
This year we also launched Club Zero Rock Shandy and Club 
Zero Super Split in Ireland, two new Club flavours with no 
 
 
 HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES 
Healthier communities support a better quality of life – 
socially, economically and environmentally. We care 
about our communities, none more so than our employee 
community, and we are committed to providing a healthy, 
inclusive workplace where every employee can thrive. 
We also want to make sure we look after the communities 
that look after us, and we are proud to be doing what we 
can to make the communities where we operate stronger – 
creating jobs and supporting charities and community groups 
to create A Healthier Everyday. 
This year, 89% of our employees across all business units 
completed our Great Place to Work employee survey. Our Trust 
Index score rose for the fourth consecutive year, increasing 
by 3 percentage points to reach 75%, demonstrating how the 
continued commitment by the business to creating an inspiring 
place to be is making a real impact on how our employees feel 
about Britvic. This year our France business entered the Great 
Place to Work rankings for the first time and came 19th; our 
Ireland business ranked 22nd, moving up one place from last 
year; and the GB business was the only soft drinks business 
to enter the rankings.
Recognising how our employees live our values and deliver 
excellent work is really important to us, and in 2017 our annual 
Britvic Stars recognition scheme yielded the most nominations 
ever, with over 1,600 employees choosing to recognise their 
peers and colleagues. Our winners attended a special event at 
Wimbledon and a lunch with CEO Simon Litherland to celebrate.

We are passionate about creating an inspiring and great place 
to work for our employees and recognise that this can only be 
achieved by creating an environment where everyone feels 
they can be themselves and where everyone’s voice is heard, 
valued and treated with respect. As a consumer-focused 
organisation, reflecting the global, cultural and socio-demographic 
diversity of our consumers within our workforce is key to 
ensuring the continued growth of our business. 
We are committed to providing equal opportunities to our 
current and potential employees and apply fair and equitable 
employment practices. We value diversity and we recruit 
and promote talent on the basis of ability, skills, experience, 
behaviour, performance and potential for the job. Our selection, 
training, development and promotion policies ensure equal 
opportunities for all employees regardless of factors such as 
age, disability (including colleagues who become disabled 
during service), gender (including gender reassignment), 
marital status, pregnancy and maternity, race, nationality, 
religion or belief, or sexual orientation.
Our 2020 commitment: Women are represented 
in 40% of leadership roles across the company
This year we have developed our Diversity & Inclusion 
strategy to help embed a culture of inclusion across 
every part of Britvic and meet our guiding vision to build 
an inclusive organisation where our employees reflect 
the diverse communities and consumers they serve. 
Our strategy is delivered through five key focus areas:
• Build ownership and accountability in our Diversity 
& Inclusion strategy.
• Empower our people so that everyone’s voice is heard.
• Step-change the make-up of our people to reﬂ ect the 
diversity of our consumer.
• Deliver talent plans that leverage our diverse population
• Build trust and fairness through the right policies 
and training. 
We have put in place a range of initiatives to deliver our 
ambitions, including focus groups to understand how our 
people feel about diversity and supporting International 
Women’s Day celebrating the women we have within the 
business. The latest Great Place to Work employee survey 
reported a 2% improvement in how employees view diversity 
and equality within the company. 
The overall gender balance across all employees within 
the business at 1 October 2017 was 28% female and 72% 
male. This figure is indicative of our industry, with a high 
proportion of operational employees typically being male, 
and has remained static since the previous reporting period. 
This year we increased the representation of women in 
leadership roles by one percentage point from 2016 to 36% 
of senior roles across the business. Our Board level gender 
diversity changed this year to 14% female and 86% male with 
the departure of Joanne Averiss. 
Male Female
Board 6 (86%) 1 (14%)
Executive Committee 10 (91%) 1 (9%)
Senior managers (Band D+) 241 (64%) 134 (36%)
All employees 3,375 (72%) 1,297 (28%)
Health, safety and wellbeing
Across our global operations, at year end, we employed 
over 4,700 people and safeguarding their health, safety and 
wellbeing continues to be a top priority. We focus on risk 
management, employee training and competence, and targeted 
initiatives to ensure that we maintain a strong safety culture.
This year our Accident Frequency Rate (‘AFR’) performance 
saw a 18% increase across the business, which was largely 
driven by a reduction in our working hours from activities with 
a typically low AFR and inclusion of our Brazilian manufacturing 
sites. We will focus on reducing our AFR next year by 
reinforcing our compliance culture and optimising our approach 
to occupational health and wellbeing. Overall, our combined 
safety performance (total accidents and lost-time accidents) 
remained stable and we are pleased to report that we reduced 
total accidents from 208 to 203 and, importantly, experienced 
6 fewer lost time accidents across the company (38 vs 44 in 
2016). This reduction in overall accidents was achieved by firmly 
embedding our safety management processes to reduce risk 
and actively encouraging employee engagement through our 
‘Contribution to Safety’ programme in GB and Ireland. We also 
celebrated some standout achievements this year, including our 
sites in Beckton GB and Bricfruit France, which achieved an 
impressive record of three years without a lost time accident.
Our 2020 commitment: All employees have access 
to wellbeing programmes that support healthier 
lifestyle choices
Employee wellbeing goes beyond just ‘wellness’ and we 
recognise that it is a complex blend of the physical, psychological, 
social and relationship aspects of employees’ working lives. 
It is hugely important that our employees feel supported in 
their wellbeing as part of our Great Place to Work ambitions. 
Across our markets we offer a variety of programmes that 
support our employees’ wellbeing and encourage healthier 
lifestyle choices. These programmes provide support for life’s 
everyday moments – for example, in GB and Ireland we provide 
a dedicated Employee Assistance helpline available 24/7 to 
provide everything from guidance on handling the stresses of 
everyday life to specialist counselling in bereavement support. 
In Ireland, we were one of the first companies to achieve 
Ibec’s KeepWell™ Mark, an evidence based accreditation 
award to recognise the positive steps we have taken as an 
employer in support of our employees’ health and wellbeing.
Human rights
Our Ethical Business Policy details our commitment to human 
rights and covers bribery and corruption, conducting business 
with respect, integrity and equality, and managing personal 
activities and interests. Our approach is guided by international 
conventions and standards, including the United Nations (UN) 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. Our policy extends 
to our suppliers and other trading partners and compliance is 
monitored through our responsible sourcing programme. 
Responsible sourcing 
We are committed to sourcing all our materials in a responsible 
manner, working alongside our suppliers to drive best practice 
in respect to human rights, employment practices and the 
environment. This year we continued to make progress with 
our responsible sourcing programme, requesting 75% of our 
GB and Ireland business high-risk suppliers to be audited 
against the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) 
4 Pillar standard (or equivalent) and working with others 
through our membership of the AIM PROGRESS group to 
improve the standards across our shared supply chain.
Modern slavery
We do not tolerate any form of modern slavery and we 
recognise the risk of modern slavery within our supply chain. 
Our Modern Slavery Statement details the steps we are taking 
to tackle it and can be found on our website at www.britvic.

Supporting our communities
We recognise the importance of supporting our local 
communities and we continue to encourage our employees 
to take part in charity and community support activities. We 
offer paid leave for volunteering, up to three days per year for 
our GB based employees, and community support activity 
undertaken by our GB employees was valued at £67,000 in 
2017. This was derived from our various giving initiatives, 
including volunteering time, matched funding, payroll giving, 
drinks donations and our monthly employee lottery. 
Our 2020 commitment: 50% of our employees take
advantage of our community support programmes
In GB, we maintained our support for our corporate charity 
partners The Wildlife Trust and Sported through employee 
volunteering and fundraising activity. In France, we continued 
our partnership with Apprentis D’Auteuil with employee-
designed-and-led projects to support vulnerable young 
people to gain more of the skills and confidence they 
need to enter the workplace. 
 In addition to our corporate charity partners, we continue 
to use the reach of our brands to support fantastic causes. 
Ballygowan partnered with the Irish Cancer Society in the 
Republic of Ireland and Marie Curie Cancer in Northern Ireland 
to raise awareness and funds for cancer prevention and support 
with a special gold label edition. We raised €144,000 for the 
charities, which is helping to support the night nursing service, 
Daffodil Centres and the Cancer Nurseline. MiWadi continued 
its longstanding relationship with Temple Street Children’s 
Hospital with the MiWadi Trick or Treat for Temple Street 
campaign, which has proudly helped raise €1.5m in the past 
four years. In the UK, our Britvic tonics and mixers launched 
a new charity initiative at London Cocktail Week, the Britvic 
Lifting Spirits Foundation. This Foundation has been specifically 
designed to further Britvic’s heritage in supporting local 
communities and social projects. For every bottle of new 
look mixers & juices sold by participating customers, Britvic 
has committed to give back to local initiatives and projects, 
chosen by publicans and bar owners.
HEALTHIER PLANET
A healthier planet is one where resources are used responsibly 
and the natural world is protected, so that future generations can 
continue to enjoy life’s everyday moments. We are playing our 
part, focusing on the small changes and innovations that will 
contribute to a better world in the longer term. From the sourcing 
of our natural ingredients to the manufacturing and distribution of 
our drinks, we are committed to doing right by the environment, 
creating A Healthier Everyday for today and tomorrow. 
Minimising the environmental impact of our operations
With 16 manufacturing sites across 4 countries, a large 
proportion of our direct environmental footprint comes from 
our factory operations and we have focused on minimising 
this impact through efficiency measures and new technology. 
This year we have made considerable improvements to our 
GB manufacturing sites through our supply chain investment 
programme, installing highly efficient new lines that will reduce 
our water and energy consumption once fully commissioned. 
In Beckton, the new PET line runs at twice the capacity of the 
older lines and is 30% more energy efficient. 
Our 2020 commitment: Achieve a water ratio of 
1.4 across our global manufacturing operations 
(excluding fruit processing)
Across the business our water consumption relative to 
production (water ratio) remained the same as 2016 at 2.15. 
This was a result of the supply chain investment programme 
seeing numerous bottling lines in GB being commissioned this 
year, which increased the water ratio for the GB business by 
4.6%. In Ireland, our focus on water reduction and investment 
in new technology resulted in a 6% reduction in our water 
ratio since last year. We currently include water from our fruit 
processing operations in Brazil in our water ratio calculation. 
We intend to separate this in future reporting.
Our 2020 commitment: Reduce the carbon 
emissions relative to production across our global 
manufacturing sites by 15% vs 2016 baseline
We have continued to make progress towards our 2020 
commitment on carbon emissions reduction with our 
energy consumption relative to production across the 
business reduced by 2%, translating to 5% reduction 
in carbon emissions relative to production since last year.
Across our manufacturing sites we are focused on driving 
energy efficiency and using cleaner energy sources. In Brazil 
we use waste cashew nut kernels to power our boilers.
The table adjacent sets out the quantities of greenhouse 
gas emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 
for the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2017. The table also

We have reported on all of the emission sources required 
under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013. Emissions outside of 
our responsibility, including shared office locations and those 
originating from our contract packers and franchise partners, 
have been omitted from our disclosure. We have used the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition) and emission factors from the UK Government 
and International Energy Agency’s GHG Conversion Factors 
2017 for this year’s calculations.

In addition to our direct emissions, we are also committed 
to reducing our indirect Scope 3 emissions arising from our 
business travel and logistics operations. This year we achieved 
a 28% reduction in emissions arising from our business flights 
across the business (excluding Brazil) equating to 2,840 tonnes 
CO2e. In GB, we have increased the total representation of 
electric and alternative fuel vehicles to 18% of our total car 
fleet. This means our current average CO2/km for our car 
fleet is 103g/km. We have offset 3,750 tonnes CO2e as part 
of our continued support of a rainforest conservation project 
in the Amazon.
Reducing waste
We are committed to making our business more efficient by 
reducing, reusing, recycling and recovering our waste and 
ensuring that the waste residues that remain are disposed of 
using the most environmentally responsible options available. 
This year, we diverted 99% of our global manufacturing 
operations waste from landfill and we established the waste 
performance of our Brazilian business, which sent 368 tonnes 
to landfill. We are working closely with our waste management 
providers to understand the challenges associated with waste 
disposal in Brazil and have targets to reduce this waste to 
landfill next year.
202 0 commitment: Achieve zero waste to landfill 
from our global manufacturing sites
Optimising our packaging
Packaging is a critically important component of our products 
and we have a responsibility to ensure the environmental 
impacts are minimised throughout its lifecycle, from the 
materials we use to produce the packa ging through to how 
our consumers dispose of it.

November 2017
2020 commitment: Reduce the amount of materials 
we use across all packaging formats and ensure 15% 
of PET comes from recycled or renewable materials
Lightweighting our packaging has been a major focus for us 
as we strive to reduce its environmental impact. We work 
closely with our packaging suppliers, and through the supply 
chain investment programme in GB we have avoided 308 
tonnes of primary plastic bottle packaging by moving products 
onto our new bottling lines and accessing lighterweight bottles. 
In GB, we are also replacing our steel cans with aluminium cans 
avoiding 8,000 tonnes of packaging material per annum once 
completed by April 2018. 
In support of the circular economy we also recognise that 
we have a role to play in ensuring that the packaging material 
is recovered and recycled and consideration to the end of 
life of our packaging is a fundamental part of our packaging 
design process. All of our plastic bottles are 100% recyclable 
and we encourage our consumers to recycle as much of 
our packaging as possible with on-pack messaging and 
campaigns in partnership with our customers. This year 
we supported our customer Live Nation with a recycling 
campaign at V Festival in the UK to promote recycling and 
anti-littering with festival goers.
This year, working alongside PepsiCo, we have trialled 
the inclusion of rPET in our bottles. We recognise that using 
recycled plastics is becoming increasingly popular with our 
stakeholders and could play a role in reducing the environmental 
impact associated with plastic packaging. We are committed 
to investigating this further across our brands.

1  The GB and Ireland businesses included an additional week last year 
in quarter four. This occurs as we operate a 52-week accounting 
calendar rather than a 365-day calendar, resulting in an additional 
week in 2016. As a result, this financial year is a 52-week period 
ending on 1 October 2017. To ensure consistent and comparable 
reporting the additional week has been excluded from the last year 
segmental analysis included within this report.
40 www.britvic.com GB stills revenue declined in the year, primarily due to price deflation in Robinsons in a competitive squash category. Robinsons 
volume was marginally down in the year, reflecting a weaker final quarter against a strong comparative last year. J20 also declined 
in the year as it transitioned to new promotional price points in the off-trade. Whilst the Fruit Shoot brand was flat, the focus on the 
Hydro variant resulted in further growth as it captured an increased share of the flavoured water category. The recently launched 
Robinsons Refresh’d generated £4m retail sales value in its first 19 weeks, broadening the penetration of the brand into ‘on-the-go’ 
consumption occasions.

Following strong performance in the first nine months of the year, the poor late summer weather in France led to a weak soft

revenue, partly offset by a decline in private label. The consolidation of buying groups has continued to create challenges, particularly 
in syrups category pricing, although pricing improvements were realised in juice in order to protect profitability. Pressade and Fruit 
Shoot continued to deliver growth, more than offsetting the decline in private label and the subdued syrups performance. However, 
the weaker performance in the last quarter combined with increased A&P investment and cost pressures, resulted in a reduction 
in brand contribution on a constant currency basis, with the growth in juice further impacting margins.

Ireland has continued to grow, with both owned brands and Counterpoint wholesale revenue increasing. Owned brand growth was 
led by the stills portfolio and the range of low and no-sugar products we offer. Counterpoint benefited from an improved offering 
across its alcohol and snacks range, as well as a benefit from the acquisition of East Coast earlier in the year. The margin decrease is 
a result of the substantial growth in the sale of third party brands in the wholesale business which only generate a distribution margin.

International has continued to generate revenue growth and increase margin. The United States benefited from the launch of Fruit 
Shoot multi-pack last year, resulting in a 21% increase in revenue. In Benelux, there was a continued focus on improving margin 
and mix. In Belgium, there was a significant increase in revenue due to the growth of Teisseire, whilst in the Netherlands revenue 
declined but contribution increased, benefiting from disciplined revenue management and a focus on improving the profitability 
of promotional sales.

Brazil has benefited from the acquisition of Bela Ischia in early March and the positive impact of foreign exchange movements. 
The underlying organic, constant currency performance was impacted by the well-publicised macro-economic challenges in the 
country. Despite these challenges, brand contribution increased and performance towards the end of the financial year was more 
encouraging. But the environment remains difficult and the short-term outlook uncertain. The brand contribution increase resulted 
from our focus on protecting margins in the short-term through price realisation to offset cost inflation despite increased investment 
in the long-term growth drivers of the business.

A&P as a % of own-brand revenue 4.5% 4.9%
A&P spend declined £0.8m (AER) and by £3.6m on a constant 
currency basis. Whilst branded spend decreased marginally, 
a large element of the reduction was as a result of efficiencies 
in our non-working A&P spend, which continues to reduce as 
a percentage of our overall investment. Fixed supply chain 
costs have increased due to incremental depreciation from 
our GB investment programme, whilst selling and overheads 
and other costs have benefited from our rigorous approach 
to cost control. We took proactive cost action by extending 
our business capability programme to incorporate £5m of 
overhead savings in 2017. This includes a flattening of our 
structure in some areas as well as reducing duplication 
between our business units through the combination of 
some roles. Reported fixed costs on a 52 week basis (AER) 
increased 6.1% due to the inclusion of Bela Ischia and the 
impact of foreign exchange movements. 
Adjusting items 
In the period, we accounted for a net charge of £25.9m of 
pre-tax adjusting items. These include:
• Strategic restructuring – business capability programme 
of £24.7m;
• Unwind of discount on deferred consideration of £4.9m;
• Acquisition and integration costs of £3.7m;
• Net impairment reversal of intangible asset carrying value 
of £(2.6)m;
• Fair value gains of £(5.0)m; and
• Net other items of £0.2m.
The cash costs of adjusting items pre-tax in the period were 
a £4.4m inflow, reflecting gains on derivatives received and 
proceeds from property sales. Further detail on adjusting 
items can be found on page 152.
Interest 
The adjusted net finance charge* for the 52 week period for 
the Group was £20.1m, compared with £20.8m (53 week) 
in the prior year, reflecting the benefits of our refinancing 
activities in the earlier part of the fiscal year. The reported 
net finance charge was £24.2m (2016: £24.5m)
Taxation 
The adjusted tax charge* was £36.3m, which equates to an 
effective tax rate of 22.0% (2016: 23.0%), primarily resulting 
from a decrease in UK and French tax rates, beneficial overseas 
profit mix and fewer losses arising internationally. The reported 
net tax charge was £27.2m (2016: £37.4m).
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic EPS* for the period was 52.9p, up 7.3% on 
the same period last year. Basic EPS for the period was 42.4p, 
compared with 43.8p for last year.
Dividends
The board is recommending a final dividend of 19.3p per share, 
an increase of 10.3% on the dividend declared last year, with 
a total value of £50.9m. The final dividend for 2017 will be 
paid on 5 February 2018 to shareholders on record as at 
8 December 2017. The ex-dividend date is 7 December 2017.
Cash flow and net debt
Adjusted free cash flow* was a £54.5m inflow, compared to 
a £10.9m inflow the previous year. Working capital generated 
an inflow of £26.0m (2016: £25.8m outflow), benefiting from 
the reversal of the additional payment run incurred in 2016 
due to the additional week last year and a continued focus on 
working capital management across the business. Inventory 
costs increased, primarily due to a proactive decision to build 
stock to mitigate risk from the business capability programme. 
Capital expenditure was £24.8m higher than last year, driven 
by the continuation of the transformational business capability 
programme in GB. Overall adjusted net debt* increased by 
£86.5m, partly due to the acquisitions of Bela Ischia and East 
Coast. Adjusted net debt leverage increased to 2.0x EBITDA* 
from 1.8x last year. 
Treasury management
The financial risks faced by the Group are identified and 
managed by a central treasury department, whose activities 
are carried out in accordance with Board approved policies 
and subject to regular Audit and Treasury Committee reviews. 
The department does not operate as a profit centre and no 
transaction is entered into for trading or speculative purposes. 
Key financial risks managed by the treasury department 
include exposures to movements in interest rates and foreign 
exchange rates whilst managing the Group’s debt and liquidity, 
currency risk, interest rate risk and cash management. The 
Group uses financial instruments to hedge against interest rate 
and foreign currency exposures. At 1 October 2017 the Group 
had £1,045.0m of committed debt facilities, consisting of a 
£400.0m bank facility which matures in 2021, and a series of 
private placement notes with maturities between 2017 and 
2032, providing the business with a secure funding platform. 
At 1 October 2017, the Group’s unadjusted net debt of 
£589.9m (excluding derivative hedges) consisted of £23.7m 
drawn under the Group’s committed bank facilities, £645.0m of 
private placement notes, £3.0m of accrued interest and £3.0m
 of finance leases, offset by net cash and cash equivalents of 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
CONTINUED
42 www.britvic.com £82.5m and unamortised loan issue costs of £2.3m. After 
taking into account the element of the fair value of interest rate 
currency swaps hedging the balance sheet value of the private 
placement notes, the Group’s adjusted net debt was £502.9m, 
which compares to £416.4m at 2 October 2016.
Pensions
At 1 October 2017, the Group had IAS 19 pension surpluses in 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland totalling £40.5m and IAS 19 
pension deficits in Ireland and France totalling £9.3m, resulting 
in a net pension surplus of £31.2m (2 October 2016: net liability 
of £17.4m). The net surplus has increased primarily due to 
changes in the financial and demographic assumptions and 
additional employer contributions made to the GB plan of 
£20.0m, partially offset by a loss on scheme assets. The 
defined benefit section of the GB plan was closed to new 
members on 1 August 2002, and closed to future accrual for 
active members from 1 April 2011, with new employees being 
invited to join the defined contribution scheme. The Northern 
Ireland scheme is only open to future accrual for members 
who joined before 28 February 2006, and new employees 
are eligible to join the defined contribution scheme. All new 
employees in Ireland join the defined contribution plan. The 
31 March 2016 actuarial valuation of the GB plan was recently 
completed. Agreement has been made with the scheme 
trustee on a number of key principles, including allowing a 
longer period to fund the deficit and agreeing that no additional 
contributions will be payable over and above those payments to 
2019 agreed at the 2013 valuation. Future contributions beyond 
2019 will be on a contingent basis. The Ireland and Northern 
Ireland Defined Benefit Pension schemes have an investment 
strategy journey plan to manage the risks as the funding 
position improves. The GB Pension scheme mainly has 
credit-type investments and the Trustees have developed 
proposals to manage the investment risks.
Risk management process
As with any business we face risks and uncertainties. We 
believe that effective risk management supports the successful 
delivery of our strategic objectives. The management of these 
risks is based on a balance of risk and reward determined 
through assessment of the likelihood and impact as well as the 
company’s risk appetite. The Executive team performs a formal 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company 
annually, which is reviewed by the Board. Similarly, all business 
units and functions perform formal annual risk assessments 
that consider the company’s principal risks and specific local 
risks relevant to the market in which they operate. Risks are 
monitored throughout the year with consideration to internal 
and external factors, the company’s risk appetite and updates 
to risks and mitigation plans are made as required. The principal 
risks that could potentially have a significant impact on our 
business in the future are set out on pages 29 to 32.
Implementation of IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers
Britvic is committed to continually improving both the quality 
and transparency of its financial reporting and will therefore 
be early adopting IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers), from the accounting period starting 2 October 2017 
with full retrospective application.
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for 
determining and recognising revenue as well as requiring 
entities to provide users of financial statements with more 
informative and relevant disclosures. The primary impact for 
The London Essence 
Company (LEC)
LEC super premium mixers, 
made by Britvic-backed incubator 
Wisehead Productions, are 
now listed in 200 premium 
outlets in London.
Britvic on implementing IFRS 15 will be a reclassification of 
certain rebates offered to customers that had previously been 
recognised as selling and distribution costs to revenue and the 
reclassification of certain incentives received, from revenue, 
to cost of sales. Adoption of the standard is expected to have 
no impact on profit before tax. The impact of this standard on 
the Group if it had been adopted in the current year would have 
been a reduction in revenue of £110.3m with a decrease in cost 
of sales of £57.1m, a decrease in selling and distribution costs 
of £52.3m and a decrease in administration expenses of £0.9m.

ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CULTURE 
AND THE ROLE OF THE BOARD
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for 
the financial year ended 1 October 2017. This report sets out 
our approach to corporate governance and serves to provide 
shareholders with a clear view of how governance principles 
and practices have operated during the year. 
Board effectiveness
Your Board is committed to remaining effective and recognises 
that to do so it must ensure that it has the right balance of 
skills, independence and knowledge of the company to enable 
it to discharge its duties and responsibilities. The Board is 
satisfied that each Board member is able to devote sufficient 
time to the company and carefully considers additional external 
commitments on an ongoing basis. 
Board succession
Following the departure of Gerald Corbett and Joanne Averiss 
during the year, the Board has continued to review the 
composition of the Board and its committees. As Ben Gordon 
will reach his ninth year of tenure in January 2018, the Board 
has focused on succession planning and is pleased to announce 
the appointment of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare 
as Non-Executive Directors, effective on 29 November 2017. 
To ensure orderly transition, Ben Gordon will remain on the 
Board until 30 January 2018 and will not seek re-election at 
the AGM on 31 January 2018. Further details can be found 
in the Nomination Committee’s report on pages 56-57.
Board evaluation
The Board has carried out an internal Board evaluation during 
the year and has agreed that an external facilitated evaluation 
will take place during the summer of 2018. Following a tender 
for Board evaluation services, it has been agreed that Lintstock 
will conduct the evaluation. Further information on the results 
of the Board evaluation for the year can be found on pages 54-55.
Fair, balanced and understandable
During the year the Board reviewed the requirement for 
directors to make a statement that they consider the annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced 
and understandable. The Audit Committee met to consider the 
criteria for a fair, balanced and understandable annual report 
and to review the processes underpinning the compilation 
and assurance of the report, in relation to financial and 
non-financial information. On behalf of the Board, I confirm 
that we believe that this Annual Report and Financial 
Statements presents a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the company’s position, its performance 
and its prospects as well as its business model and strategy. 
John Daly
Chairman

John Daly 
Chairman
What is Board culture?
Firstly, it is my responsibility to cultivate a healthy 
Board culture. It is essential that the Board is engaged, 
can constructively challenge and support the Executive 
team and work together using the power of our collective 
contribution, personal attributes, skills and knowledge 
to drive the business to succeed. It is important that the 
Board sets the correct ‘tone from the top’. 
How are you developing Board culture?
I acknowledge the importance of building a balanced Board 
based on diversity of background, skills and experience. 
I believe in creating an open and inclusive environment 
which demonstrates the Britvic values and builds respectful 
and sustainable relationships amongst individual directors 
and the Executive team. We design our calendar for the 
year to allow for the Board to meet formally and informally, 
which we believe drives a better quality of relationship 
which is not solely focused on life in the boardroom.
What is the role of the Board?
The Board is collectively responsible to shareholders for 
the company’s performance, the strategic direction of the 
Group, its values and its governance. The Board provides 
the leadership and oversight necessary for the Group to 
meet its performance objectives and drive long-term 
sustainable value for shareholders.

Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 49
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information The Board
The Board of Directors currently has seven members, 
comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, and four independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The biographical details of the Board members 
are set out on pages 46 and 47. All of the Directors bring 
strong judgement to the Board’s deliberations. They have all 
occupied, or occupy, senior positions in UK and/or international 
companies (including listed companies) and have substantial 
experience across a range of businesses. Other than their 
fees, which are disclosed on page 78, the Non-Executive 
Directors received no remuneration from the company 
during the year. They do not participate in any of the Group’s 
pension schemes or in any of the Group’s bonus, share option 
or other incentive schemes. The Board is satisfied that all 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, remain 
independent for the purposes of the Code and further, that 
each of the Non-Executive Directors commit sufficient time 
and attention to the business of the company.
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the 
company, corporate governance, strategy, risk management 
and financial performance. The Board normally meets at 
least eight times each financial year and has a formal schedule 
of matters reserved to it for decision making, including 
responsibility for the overall management and performance 
of the Group, and the approval of its long-term objectives and 
LEADERSHIP CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE 
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
The Board supports the principles under The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Throughout the financial year ended 
1 October 2017 and at the date of this report, the Company 
has complied with the provisions set out in the Code with 
the exception of the following provisions:
•  A.4.2 – The non-executive directors should meet 
without the Chairman present at least annually to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance.
• B.6.2 – Evaluation of the board should be externally 
facilitated at least every three years. 
A significant focus for the Board during the financial year has 
centred around succession plans for the Chairman and other 
Board roles. As a result, it was not considered appropriate 
for the Non-Executive Directors to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance nor conduct an externally facilitated Board 
evaluation during the year. The Board carefully considered 
the impact of deferring the timing of the externally facilitated 
evaluation taking into account Gerald Corbett’s retirement, 
the appointment of John Daly as Chairman and Ian McHoul 
as Senior Independent Director. The Board agreed that the 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director should be afforded 
sufficient time to adjust to their new roles, which would 
maximise the output and value of the evaluation. Further 
information on the Board evaluation in 2017 can be found 
on pages 54 and 55, along with details on the external 
evaluation planned for 2018.

agreements and major capital commitments, approval of 
treasury policies, and assessment of its going concern position. 
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board provides strong and effective leadership within a 
framework of prudent and effective controls, and in accordance 
with the Code provisions there is a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved for Board decision which defines the 
Board from sub-committees and management. This clear 
definition not only complements and strengthens the 
company’s decisions, but builds the foundations of a solid 
business. Although there is a standard agenda of items, 
these are regularly reviewed to ensure that the Board 
provides continual effective leadership and drive towards 
the company’s strategic aims. Matters which the Board 
considers suitable for delegation are contained in the terms 
of reference of its committees which, in line with the Code 
provisions, can be found on the company’s website at 
www.britvic.com/investor-centre/corporate-governance.aspx
Re-election of Directors
The company’s articles of association provide that all 
Directors will stand for re-election at least every three years 
but in order to comply with the Code, all of the Directors 
submit themselves for re-election (or election following 
first appointment) at each AGM.
Board committees 
The Board is assisted by three Board committees (as shown 
on page 50) to which it delegates specific responsibilities. Each 
committee has full terms of reference that have 
been approved by the Board and which can be found on 
our website at www.britvic.com/investor-centre/corporate-
governance.aspx
Company Secretary
It is the responsibility of the Company Secretary to ensure 
that there are good information flows to the Board and its 
committees and between the Executive team and the 
Non-Executive Directors. The Company Secretary advises 
the Board on all legal and corporate governance matters 
and assists the Chairman in ensuring that the Directors 
have suitably tailored and detailed induction and ongoing 
professional development programmes. 
The role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the workings 
of the Board, to ensure that its strategic and supervisory 
role is achieved, and for ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders. 
The Chairman works closely with the Chief Executive Officer 
to ensure that the strategies and actions agreed by the Board 
are implemented, and provides support and appropriate advice 
to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer is 
responsible for the day-to-day management of the business, 
developing the Group’s strategic direction for consideration and 
approval by the Board, and implementing the agreed strategy. 
He is supported by the other members of his Executive team.
The different roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are acknowledged. A responsibility statement for each of those 
roles has been agreed with the Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer, respectively, and adopted by the Board.
Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is Ian McHoul, who 
is available to shareholders if they have concerns which 
are not resolved through the normal channels of Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, or for 
which such contact is inappropriate. His biography can 
be found on page 46.

Notes:
1 The company considers that, on appointment, the Chairman was independent for the purposes of provision A.3.1 of the Code. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment
Details of the Executive Directors’ service contracts and the Chairman’s and the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 84. These documents are available for inspection at the registered office of the company during normal 
business hours and at the AGM.
Indemnification of Directors
In addition to the indemnity granted by the company to Directors in respect of their liabilities incurred as a result of their office in accordance with 
our articles of association, we maintain a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy throughout the year. Neither our indemnity nor the 
insurance provides cover in the event that a Director has proven to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. 
Conflicts of interest 
The company’s articles of association allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose limits or conditions, as 
appropriate. Any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest, whether matter-specific or situational, is only effective if it is agreed without the 
participation of the conflicted Director(s), and in making such a decision, as always, the Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will 
be most likely to promote the success of the company. The company has an established procedure whereby actual or potential conflicts of interest 
are reviewed annually and for the appropriate authorisation to be sought prior to the appointment of any new Director or if a new conflict arises.
During the year, the Board considered external appointments for Simon Litherland as Non-Executive Director of Persimmon plc and Sue Clark 
as Non-Executive Director of Tulchan Communications Group, Bakkavor Group plc and as a Supervisory Board member of AkzoNobel N.V. The 
Board considered John Daly’s external appointments as Non-Executive Director of G4S plc and Ferguson plc in the context of his appointment 
as Chairman and concluded that each of the Directors would be able to devote sufficient time to their roles at Britvic and these interests would 
not impede or affect their respective ability to fully discharge their responsibilities.
Shareholder engagement
Investor relations
The Board is committed to maintaining good communications with shareholders. Senior executives, including the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer, have regular dialogue with individual institutional shareholders in order to develop an understanding of their views, which 
is then discussed with the Board. All Directors are offered the opportunity to meet with major shareholders to listen to their views and, in addition 
to a monthly report prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, receive regular reports prepared by an independent capital markets advisory firm which 
provide comprehensive information relating to the company’s major shareholders. Presentations are made to analysts, investors and prospective 
investors covering the annual and interim results and the company seeks to maintain a dialogue with the various bodies which monitor the company’s 
governance policies and procedures. The Strategic Report set out on pages 1 to 43 details the financial performance of the company as well as 
setting out the risks it faces. 
Private investors
We are keen to hear the views of our private shareholders and we encourage them to use our shareholder mailbox (investors@britvic.com) for 
detailed enquiries and to access our website for our company reports and business information. Specific enquiries to the Company Secretary may 
be sent to the Secretariat mailbox (company.secretariat@britvic.com) or sent to the registered office. At the AGM, the Chief Executive Officer gives 
a regular update on the positioning and outlook for the business. Shareholders are invited to ask questions formally during the meeting and to follow 
up these discussions with Directors on a one-to-one basis afterwards. The Chairs of the Board committees and the Senior Independent Director are 
present and available to respond to questions at the AGM. We look forward to welcoming all our shareholders to our AGM in January 2018 and to 
updating them on our business developments. 
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 53
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Induction and development
The Chairman is responsible for preparing and co-ordinating an induction programme for newly appointed Directors, including presentations from 
senior management on different aspects of the business, as well as guidance on their duties, responsibilities and liabilities as a Director of a listed 
company. The Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to visit Group manufacturing sites to enable them to gain a greater understanding of the 
group’s activities and to meet senior managers throughout the business. Directors have access to appropriate training as required and they are 
encouraged to develop their understanding of the business. To strengthen their knowledge and understanding of the business, Board meetings 
regularly include updates and briefings on specific areas of the company’s activities, and Board meetings, where possible, are held offsite at other 
Britvic sites. Following the appointment of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare as Non-Executive Directors on 29 November 2017, it is expected 
that their induction programme will cover each of the elements listed below:
Type of induction activity
Face-to-face meetings • Meetings with Chairman, CEO and CFO to understand the culture and values, strategy, 
recent developments, overview of ﬁ nancials (including last year’s Annual Report and Accounts) 
and key challenges and opportunities 
• Meetings with members of the Executive team to gain insight of their role and responsibilities, 
the structure of their teams, and current challenges and opportunities
Site visits • Visits to manufacturing sites to further their knowledge of operations
Committee inductions • To understand Committee remit and overview of key issues/policies/developments
• Meeting with Chair of Committee and advisors to Committee
Investor relations and media views • To gain an overview of investor relations activities, market facing issues and investor concerns
Governance, risk management 
and litigation
• Matters reserved for the Board and Statement of Authorities, overview of Board procedures 
and schedule of future meetings
• Directors’ duties and Board procedures for conﬂ icts of interest, and share dealing 
• Key governance issues aff ecting the company 
• Principal risk register and risk management approach
• Overview of material litigation
• Directors’ and Offi  cers’ insurance policy
Use of Board portal • To gain access to key materials and policies, allowing each Director to further their knowledge 
of the work of the Board and annual planning cycles, minutes from previous meetings and 
other relevant information
The Company Secretary provides support to the Chairman to ensure that ongoing development for the Board is carried out and is tailored for each 
Board member.
Independent advice
The Board has approved a procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the company’s expense if necessary. No such advice 
was sought by any Director during the year. In addition, the Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
Board evaluation
Board evaluation is reviewed on an annual basis and during the year, it was agreed that an internal evaluation would be carried out. A questionnaire 
was devised and the results were presented to the Board confirming that the Board and its committees were operating effectively. The 2017 review 
built on the actions delivered in the prior year which are referred to in the table opposite. In addition, the review confirmed that there were a small 
number of focus areas for the Board during 2018 which were to:
• maintain focus on building board capability and improve succession planning;
• continue to support management in developing the International & Brazilian businesses and growing the UK market; and 
• improve quality of information relating to brands and marketing metrics.
EFFECTIVENESS
54 www.britvic.com 2016 evaluation Recommendations Actions delivered in year
Continue to focus on shorter-term succession planning 
and for a successor to the Chairman
The Board continued to focus on succession planning 
during the 2017 financial year, which resulted in changes 
amongst the existing Board in the form of a new Chairman, 
Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Board continued to develop succession 
plans for the ongoing refreshment of the Board recognising 
that Ben Gordon would reach the end of his ninth year of 
tenure in 2018. 
Increase number of deep dives on core strategic priorities Deep dives have been weaved into the Board’s agenda 
enabling the Board to gain effective insight, demonstrate 
robust challenge and support for the Executive team 
during the year. 
Improve the quality of Board analytics in financial/
commercial performance areas
The quality of information presented to the Board relating 
to financial/commercial data has improved during the year, 
bringing more insight to the performance of the business.
Continue with opportunities for the Non-Executive 
Directors to visit other sites and to meet informally 
outside of Board meetings
The Board visited the Rugby, Beckton and Crolles sites during 
the year. Meetings are scheduled to take place off-site with 
Board dinners to enable discussion outside of the boardroom.
Increased focus on risk management The Board’s agenda has been reshaped with risk as a regular 
item and includes focus on principal risks, emerging risks, risk 
appetite, understanding the criteria for scoring risk set against 
a backdrop of volatility in the macro-economic environment, 
Brexit and sugar tax.
Under the Code, an external facilitated evaluation should take place every three years. The last external evaluation was carried out in 2013 and 
as indicated in the 2016 Annual Report, the Board agreed to defer the timing of an external review in light of succession planning for the Chairman 
and two new Non-Executive Directors joining the Board. In the context of further Board changes, with a new Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director, the Board agreed that it was sensible to delay the timing of an externally facilitated review until the summer of 2018 and is therefore 
considered to be non-compliant for the purposes of provision B.6.2 of the Code. The Board carefully considered the rationale for delaying the 
external evaluation and agreed that this prudent approach would allow the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to adjust to their new 
roles being mindful of the benefit, insight and value that an external evaluation brings. 
Ahead of the proposed external evaluation in 2018, the Board has carried out a tender for Board evaluation services and has appointed Lintstock 
to carry out evaluation services over a three year period starting in 2018. Lintstock has no other connection with the company. The Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Company Secretary will work together to agree the scope of the evaluation in early 2018 and further information will be 
published in next years’ Annual Report.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 55
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information On behalf of the Nomination Committee (the ‘Committee’), 
I am pleased to present its report for the financial year ended 
1 October 2017. It has been a busy year for the Committee 
with a focus on Chairman succession planning and ongoing 
succession planning for the Board. This report describes how 
the Committee has carried out its responsibilities during the year. 
Committee members 
Gerald Corbett

 (former Chairman)
John Daly (Chairman)

Ian McHoul
Note:
1 Gerald Corbett stepped down as Chairman of the Board on 
1 September 2017.
The Committee comprises a majority of independent Non-
Executive Directors. The Chief Executive Officer also attends 
by invitation. The Committee meets as necessary and at least 
twice a year. The Chairman of the Committee also provides 
a report of Committee meetings to the Board.
The Committee is responsible for considering and 
recommending to the Board candidates who are appropriate 
for appointment as Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
and for other senior management roles, so as to maintain an 
appropriate balance of skills and experience within the company 
and on the Board and to ensure progressive refreshing of the 
Board. In addition, it is the responsibility of the Committee to 
review the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
its committees and further that the procedures for appointing 
Directors is formal, rigourous, transparent, objective, merit-
based and has regard for diversity. 
Main activities during the year
The Committee considered and has made recommendations 
to the Board in respect of:
• a review of the Board and committee membership 
following the changes to the composition of the Board;
• succession planning and subsequent recommendation 
of John Daly as Chairman; 
• ongoing Non-Executive recruitment plans and subsequent 
recommendation of appointees to the Board; 
• a review of the ﬁ ndings of the 2016/17 Board evaluation 
(for more information see page 54); and
• annual review of Directors’ potential conﬂ icts of interest.
Appointment of Directors
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure 
for the appointment of new Directors to the Board under 
which the Committee interviews suitable candidates who 
are proposed either by existing Board members or by an 
external search firm. Careful consideration is given to ensure 
that proposed appointees have enough time available to 
devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board is maintained. 
When discussions relate to the appointment of a Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Director will chair the Committee and 
lead the recruitment process. When the Committee has found 
a suitable candidate, the Chair of the Committee will make 
a proposal to the whole Board, which retains responsibility 
for all such appointments. 
Succession planning
Succession planning has continued to be an area of focus of 
the Committee during the year. The main focus for the year 
has been on Chairman succession planning as indicated in 
the 2016 Annual Report. Gerald Corbett had indicated towards 
the end of 2016 that he intended to step down from the Board 
as soon as he was assured that the newer members of the 
Board and other role changes amongst the Board had settled. 
During the year, John Daly (former Senior Independent 
Director) declared his interest in being considered as a 
candidate for the Chairman’s position. As he was Senior 
Independent Director at the time, he could not lead the 
Committee through the Chairman succession process, nor 
could he participate in any discussions relating to his proposed 
candidacy. It was agreed that Ian McHoul would lead the 
Committee through the succession process including the 
appointment of Zygos Partnership to assist with the planning 
process. Zygos Partnership has no other connection with 
the company. Other Non-Executive Directors were co-opted 
to the Committee to ensure that the views of the entire 
Board were reflected in the succession process. Following a 
thorough process, the Committee recommended John Daly’s 
appointment as Chairman to the Board. In consideration of 
John Daly’s appointment as Chairman, other changes were 
recommended by the Committee, with Ian McHoul assuming 
responsibility as Senior Independent Director and Sue Clark as 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee. All of these changes 
became effective on 1 September 2017. 
It was agreed that Zygos Partnership be retained for the 
purposes of continuing the ongoing refreshment of the Board 
mindful of Ben Gordon reaching his ninth year of tenure. 
Following the recommendation of the Committee, the Board 
agreed to appoint Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare, 
effective on 29 November 2017. For orderly transition, it 
was agreed that Ben Gordon will remain on the Board until 
the end of January 2018. Ben will not seek re-election at the 
AGM on 31 January 2018.

COMMITTEE
56 www.britvic.com Diversity
At Britvic, diversity is a wider topic than simply gender and 
the Board recommends to the company that, in order to achieve 
its future growth aspirations, it should remain committed to 
building a pipeline of diverse talent and to regularly review its HR 
processes, including recruitment and performance management 
frameworks. The Directors’ view, however, remains that we do 
not feel in a position to publish a target of the percentage of 
women on the Board. Gender remains an important aspect of 
overall diversity. The Committee continues to monitor and review 
the balance of the Board under a lens of diversity recognising 
the benefits of a truly diverse and inclusive environment. Further 
details of the company’s statistics on gender diversity may be 
found on page 37 of the Strategic Report. 
Conflicts of interest
As referred to on page 53, the Board operates a formal policy 
to identify and, where appropriate, manage any potential 
conflicts of interest that Directors may have. It is the role of 
the Committee to monitor the situation and determine actions 
to address any potential or actual conflicts that may arise. The 
Committee reviews all potential conflicts of interest on an 
annual basis and when new Directors are formally appointed.
Board evaluation
Details of the review of the Board and its committees undertaken 
during the year can be found on pages 54 and 55.
Having reviewed the results of the evaluation, the Committee 
has confirmed to the Board that the present Board and its 
committees continue to operate effectively and that all of the 
Non-Executive Directors remained independent, in accordance 
with the Code and all Directors should stand for re-election (or 
election in the case of Suniti Chauhan and William Eccleshare) 
at the AGM.

On behalf of the Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’), I am 
pleased to present its report for the financial year ended 
1 October 2017 . The purpose of this report is to describe how the 
Committee has carried out its responsibilities during the year.
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s role is to ensure appropriate oversight 
and review of the presentation and integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting, internal control and risk management, 
internal audit programmes, changes in regulatory requirements, 
and the independence and appointment of external auditors. 
The terms of reference for the Committee can be found on our 
website at http://britvic.com/investors/corporate-governance/
corporate-governance.
To enable the Committee to discharge its responsibilities, 
discussions on a broad range of topics and reports were held 
with management, internal audit and the external auditors 
throughout the year. This provided us with insight into the 
progress towards the company’s strategic goals, and the 
challenges and risks and how they are being managed. The 
activities of the Committee can be found in the table opposite.
The Committee has an open dialogue throughout the year 
with the Director of Audit and Risk and the external auditors 
to raise challenges and questions to support understanding 
whilst sharing experience and an independent perspective.
The most significant matters discussed over the course 
of the year are described in the report below. 
Responsibilities
• Reviewing the ﬁ nancial results announcements and 
ﬁ nancial statements, and any signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial reporting, 
issues and judgements which they may contain.
• Advising the Board on whether the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
• Ensuring compliance with applicable accounting standards 
and reviewing the appropriateness of accounting policies 
and practices in place.
• Assessing the adequacy of the internal control environment 
and the processes in place to monitor this, including 
reviewing the activities and performance of the internal 
audit team.
• Reviewing risk management processes and considering 
the adequacy of the actions being taken to identify risks 
and reduce the exposure of the Group to those risks.
• Overseeing the relationship with the external auditors, and 
make recommendations to the Board in relation to their 
appointment, remuneration and terms of engagement, 
independence, objectivity and eff ectiveness.
• Ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place for 
individuals to raise issues with the Board where a breach 
of conduct or compliance, including any ﬁ nancial reporting 
irregularity, is suspected.
Risk management and internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for monitoring the Group’s 
system of internal control and risk management and for 
carrying out a review of its effectiveness. In discharging that 
responsibility, the Board confirms that it has established the 
procedures necessary to apply the Code, including clear 
operating procedures, lines of responsibility and delegated 
authority. These procedures have been in place since the 
company listed and are regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Business performance is managed closely and the Board 
and the Executive team have established processes, as part 
of the normal good management of the business, to monitor:
• strategic plan achievement, through a regular review 
of progress towards strategic objectives;
• maintenance of insurance cover to insure all risk areas 
of the Group;
• ﬁ nancial performance, within a comprehensive ﬁ nancial 
planning and accounting framework, including budgeting 
and forecasting, ﬁ nancial reporting, analysing variances 
against plan and taking appropriate management action;
• capital investment and asset management performance, 
with detailed appraisal, authorisation and post investment 
reviews; and
• the principal risks facing the business, ensuring that the 
signiﬁ cant risks faced by the Group are being identiﬁ ed, 
evaluated and appropriately managed, giving consideration 
to the balance of risk, cost and opportunity. 
The Board is supported by the Audit Committee in reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk process and internal 
control systems. The system of internal control is designed 
to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and it must be recognised that it can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Management, with the assistance of the finance function, 
is responsible for the appropriate maintenance of financial 
records and processes. This ensures that all financial 
information is relevant, reliable, in accordance with the 
applicable laws and regulations, and distributed both internally 
and externally in a timely manner. A review of the consolidation 
and financial statements is completed by management to 
ensure that the financial position and results of the Group are 
appropriately recorded, circulated to members of the Board 
and published where appropriate. All financial information 
published by the Group is subject to the approval of the Board, 
on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. 
Ian McHoul
Audit Committee Chairman
58 www.britvic.com Meetings and composition of the Committee
The Committee comprises independent Non-Executive 
Directors Ben Gordon, Euan Sutherland and Ian McHoul, 
who is Chair of the Committee. During the year and prior to 
his appointment as Chairman, John Daly served as a member 
of the Committee. The Board is satisfied that Ian has recent 
and relevant financial experience as required by the Code 
and, further, that the Committee as a whole has competence 
relevant to the sector in which the company operates. 
The Committee meets three times a year: in November and 
May to review the Annual Report and Accounts and interim 
report respectively and to consider the external audit findings, 
and in September to review the activities of the previous year, 
the plan for the year ahead and to consider any emerging 
issues. At each meeting the performance and findings of the 
internal audit team are reviewed and the most recent key risks 
are considered. The attendance of the Committee for each 
meeting during the year can be found on page 52. Attendees 
 at each of the meetings are the Committee’s members as well 
as, by invitation, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, the Director of Financial Controls and Governance, the 
General Counsel, the Director of Audit and Risk and the external 
auditor, Ernst & Young LLP . 
Each meeting allows time for the Committee to speak with 
key people without the presence of the others, in particular 
the external auditors and the Director of Audit and Risk.
Main activities during the year 
The Committee supports the Board in carrying out its 
responsibilities in relation to financial reporting, risk management 
and assessing internal control. It also reviews the effectiveness 
of the company’s internal audit function and manages the 
relationship with the external auditors. The Committee ensures 
that the company has appropriate provision for a confidential and 
impartial whistleblowing process in line with good practice. 
Committee meetings usually take place prior to a Board 
meeting. The Chair of the Committee subsequently reports 
on the activities of the Committee and matters of particular 
relevance to the Board.
The Committee undertook the following activities during the course of the year to discharge its responsibilities:
November –  Review of Annual Report and Financial Statements, including changes to accounting policies, key issues and judgements and 
assessment that the statements are fair, balanced and understandable
– Review of the CFO’s report on accounting issues and judgements
– Review of external audit findings, including any accounting and audit adjustments
– Effectiveness of external auditors, including audit process, independence and objectivity
– Recommendation of the appointment of the external auditors

– Review progress for adoption of new accounting standard IFRS 15
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment 
At the request of the Board, the Committee considered whether the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy. To enable the Board to have confidence in making this statement, the Committee considered the elements in the table below: 
Fair Balanced Understandable
Is the whole story being presented? 
Has any sensitive material been omitted 
that should have been included?
Are the key messages in the narrative 
reflected in the financial reporting?
Are the KPIs disclosed at an appropriate 
level based on the financial reporting?
Is there a good level of consistency between 
the narrative in the front section and the financial 
reporting in the back section of the report?
Is the Annual Report considered a document 
fit for shareholders?
Are statutory and adjusted measures 
explained clearly with appropriate prominence?
Are the key judgements referred to in 
the narrative reporting and the significant 
issues reported in the Audit Committee 
Report consistent with the disclosures of 
key estimation uncertainties and critical 
judgements set out in the financial statements? 
How do the risks compare with the risks that 
the auditors plan to include within their report?
Is there a clear and understandable 
framework to the report?
Are the important messages highlighted 
appropriately throughout the document?
Is the layout clear with good linkage 
throughout in a manner which reflects 
the whole story?
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 59
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information To form its opinion, the Committee reflected on the information and reporting it received from management and the external auditors and the 
discussions that took place during the year. Key considerations for the Committee in 2017 included the following:
• The ﬁ nancial statements comply with all applicable ﬁ nancial reporting standards and any other required regulations.
• Material areas of signiﬁ cant judgement have been given due consideration by management and reviewed with the external auditors.
• The application of acceptable accounting policies and practices is consistent across the Group.
• The disclosures provided are clear, and as required by ﬁ nancial reporting standards.
• Reporting and commentary provide a fair and balanced view of company performance.
• Any correspondence from regulators received in relation to our ﬁ nancial reporting are considered and disclosures are updated if required.
To ensure that these considerations are met, reviews take place based on information provided by the Chief Financial Officer and his team at each 
Committee meeting as well as reports from the external auditors based on the outcomes of their half year review and annual audit. 
Financial statements and significant issues
Significant financial and reporting issues considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 financial statements, and how these were addressed, 
are shown below:
Revenue recogniti on There has been no change in the Group’s approach to revenue recognition in 2017; however, 
it remains a key area of focus. The control, accounting and accuracy of long-term discounts, 
promotional discounts and account development funds are reviewed throughout the year to 
ensure that they remain consistent and IFRS compliant. Developments in the market have also 
been discussed with the Committee, where challenging conditions increase the focus of our 
customers on rebates and promotional spend. The impact of this is continually monitored by 
management and reviewed with the external auditors to ensure that policy and practice remain 
consistent. The assessment of the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 has been completed and the 
company intends to adopt the standard early from the accounting period starting 2 October 2017. 
Valuation of goodwill and assets The review of goodwill and intangible assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using cash 
flow projections based on market measures and financial budgets prepared by senior management 
and approved by the Board of Directors. The assessment models were reviewed as part of the 
audit, for which the external auditors, provided reporting to the Committee. The Committee has 
also considered management reports on potential triggers of impairment and the outcome of 
sensitivity testing for all areas of the Group, including France, Ireland and Brazil and the potential 
reversal of prior year impairments. The Committee concluded that it was appropriate to recognise 
an impairment of the Britvic brands in Ireland of £2.2m, an impairment of the Fruité brand in France 
of £4.4m and a reversal of impairment in the Ballygowan trademark of £9.2m. 
Acquisition accounting Following the acquisition of Bela Ischia and East Coast Suppliers Limited in March 2017, management 
has calculated the purchase price allocation and resulting goodwill to be accounted for in the Group 
accounts. The Committee has reviewed and approved the approach to these calculations, including 
areas of judgement and potential risks. In addition, the Committee has discussed the integration 
approach, progress and associated one-off costs and is satisfied that the plans, execution and 
outcome are proportionate to the investment and risk associated with the acquisitions. 
Adjusting items In response to the changing landscape around the classification of exceptional items, the Committee 
agreed that exceptional items no longer be reported as part of the financial statements but rather 
presented as adjusting items outside of the financial statements. The classification of adjusting 
items is defined by a group policy, as approved by the Committee, and includes items of significant 
income and expense which due to their size, nature or frequency merit separate presentation to 
allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance during the year. 
Management have reviewed items to be included with the Committee throughout the year to 
confirm appropriateness.
Derivative and hedging activities The Group has derivative instruments to which hedge accounting is applied and which swap 
principal and interest of US Private Placement notes. The Committee reviewed reporting on 
comparisons of valuations to external confirmations and assessment of hedge effectiveness 
in order to be satisfied with the quality of financial statement disclosures.
Taxation Uncertain tax positions within the Group were reviewed to ensure that the balance sheet 
provisions are appropriate and the Group effective tax rate is calculated appropriately.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuation The Committee reviewed benchmarks and assumptions that are provided by the Group’s actuaries 
and used to value the pension liabilities for the four defined benefit schemes. The underlying 
assumptions based on market conditions and the characteristics of the schemes are reviewed by 
management and the external auditors and conclusions reported to the Committee. The triennial 
valuation of the GB scheme was completed in March 2017 and the Committee is satisfied that the 
resulting financial implications are fairly represented in the financial statements and associated notes. 
The Committee subsequently recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the Company’s 2017 Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
CONTINUED
60 www.britvic.com Internal audit and control
The internal audit function carries out work across the 
company, acting as a third line of defence. In September, 
the Committee agreed the audit plan to be undertaken by the 
internal audit team prior to the start of the year. The audit plan 
coverage is based on risk, strategic priorities and consideration 
of the strength of the control environment. The Committee 
receives a report at each of the Committee meetings and 
reviews the results of the internal audit reports, looking in 
detail at any reports where processes and controls require 
improvement or any reports that are particularly pertinent to 
delivery of strategic objectives or priorities. Updates are received 
on progress made against actions agreed from previous audits 
and on the overall control environment progress related to 
previous audit areas. 
Additional areas were added to the audit plan as required 
where circumstances gave rise to an increased level of risk 
and any changes to the agreed audit plan were agreed by the 
Committee. Detailed updates on specific areas are provided 
at the request of the Committee.
Risk management
The risk management process is reviewed at each meeting 
by the Committee to ensure that it is set up to deliver 
appropriate risk management across the company. 
A particular focus during this year has been on defining the 
company’s risk appetite. This is an expression of the amount 
and types of risk that the company is willing to take to achieve 
its strategic and operational objectives. The Board has agreed 
these statements which are now being used in decision making 
processes across the company to define and validate the 
mitigating activities required to manage our risks. A summary 
of the key risks and uncertainties to which the business is 
exposed to can be found on pages 29 to 32.
Viability statement
The Committee reviewed management’s work in conducting 
a robust assessment of those risks which could threaten 
the business model and the future viability of the company. 
This assessment included identifying severe but plausible 
scenarios for each of our principal risks as well as considering 
inter-dependencies and scenarios involving multiple risks. 
Additionally reverse stress testing was carried out, allowing the 
Committee to assess the circumstances that would render the 
business unable to pay its liabilities as they fall due. To support 
the final conclusion on viability, the assessment also took into 
account the mitigations available to the company to protect 
against these downside scenarios. Based on this analysis, the 
Committee recommended to the Board that it could approve 
and make the Viability Statement on page 33.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for reviewing the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the risk management framework and the 
system of internal controls. The Board has delegated 
responsibility for this review to the Committee. Management 
in each business unit are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining adequate internal controls. Functions such as 
finance, legal, procurement and quality are responsible for 
setting out the company policies to be followed by the business 
units. The Committee, through the internal audit function 
reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control 
procedures and identifies any weaknesses and ensures these 
are addressed within agreed timelines. 
The system of internal control has been designed to 
manage rather than eliminate material risks to the achievement 
of our strategic and business objectives and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement of loss. The risk management process is 
reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that it is set 
up to deliver appropriate risk management across the group. 
The risk management process is continually improving, in 
particular in relation to embedding across new and developing 
areas of the business. The Committee believe that the 
improvements will continue to strengthen the way that 
the business understands and manages risk.
Whistleblowing
The Group’s ‘whistleblowing’ policy contains arrangements 
for an independent external service provider to receive, in 
confidence, complaints on accounting, auditing, risk, internal 
control and related matters for reporting to the Committee 
as appropriate. Updates are provided to the Committee at 
each meeting.
Effectiveness of external audit 
There are a number of areas that the Committee considers 
in relation to the effectiveness of the external auditors: their 
performance in discharging the audit and the interim review, 
their independence and objectivity, and their reappointment 
and remuneration. The Chairman of the Committee has regular 
contact with the external audit partner outside of Committee 
meetings and without the management of the business present. 
The external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP (‘EY’), provided the 
Committee with their plan for undertaking the year end audit 
which highlighted the proposed approach and scope of the audit 
for the coming year and identified the key areas of audit risk, 
including the audit approach for these areas. The Committee 
reviewed and appropriately challenged the basis for these before 
agreeing the proposed approach and scope of the external audit. 
EY prepared a detailed report of their audit findings at the 
year end, which they took the Committee through at the 
meeting in November 2017. The findings were reviewed and 
discussed in detail by the Committee, particularly in relation to 
the areas highlighted above. A similar review of the external 
auditors’ report of their findings at the half year review is 
undertaken by the Committee. As part of this review the 
Committee questioned and challenged the work undertaken, 
the findings and the key assumptions made, with particular 
attention to the areas of audit risk identified. The Committee 
also considers the effectiveness of the audit in relation to the 
robustness of the audit, the quality of the audit delivery and 
the quality of the people and service and has concluded that 
EY remain effective as external auditors. 
Audit tendering and CMA Order Compliance
Following a comprehensive tender carried out in 2016, EY have 
remained as the company’s external auditors. The Committee 
confirms compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for 
Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Independence and reappointment 
The Committee reviews the independence of the auditors 
throughout the year. The external auditors are required to 
rotate the lead audit partner every five years. The current lead 
audit partner began his tenure for the financial year ended 
30 September 2013 and in keeping with audit partner rotation, 
a new partner will lead the FY18 audit. The incoming lead 
audit partner has shadowed key meetings during the current 
financial year. Based on the Committee’s recommendation, 
the Board is proposing that EY be reappointed to office at the 
AGM in January 2018. 
Non-audit fees
The Group has a policy regarding the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditors. Any non-audit services 
provided must be pre-approved by the Committee unless 
the activity will have a total value of less than £5,000 and 
falls within the allowed services defined by FRC guidance. 
Control over total non-audit fees is also exercised by 
reviewing spend on all activities proposed or provided by the 
external auditors and we can confirm that we are significantly 
below a 1:1 ratio in this financial year as disclosed in note 7 
to the financial statements on page 110, and well within the 
FRC guidance of the 70% cap that will be required from 2019.

Committee evaluation
The Committee was included in the Board evaluation 
performed during the year, the details of which can be 
found on pages 54 and 55.
In my first year as the Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
(‘Committee’) I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 1 October 
2017. I would like to thank John Daly for leading the Committee 
prior to my appointment in September 2017 and the other 
members for welcoming me into my new role. I would also 
like to take this opportunity to say how pleased the Committee 
was to continue to receive a very positive response at the 
January 2017 AGM with 94% votes ‘For’ the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The Committee remains very mindful of 
the current focus on executive pay and its implications across 
all our stakeholders and so I trust the actions taken over the 
course of the year and what is disclosed in the Remuneration 
Report reflect that this responsibility is very much at the 
forefront of the Committee’s decision making.
The contents of this annual statement provide an overview 
of the new Remuneration Policy and remuneration outcomes 
for the financial year ended 1 October 2017 and a summary 
of the business context in which those outcomes have 
been determined.
The remainder of the report sets out:
•   An ‘at a glance’ summary of the new Remuneration Policy 
that will be implemented in 2017/18 subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2018 AGM and the remuneration outcomes 
for 2016/17. Pages 64 to 66
•  The proposed Remuneration Policy for Directors to be 
voted on by shareholders at the AGM in January 2018. 
Pages 67 to 74
•   The Annual Report on remuneration, along with the 
Chair’s statement, is subject to shareholder vote at the 
January 2018 AGM and sets out the detail of payments 
made to directors in respect of the ﬁ nancial year ended 
1 October 2017. Page 84
2017 Remuneration Policy review
2016/17 was the final year of the current Remuneration Policy 
that was approved by our shareholders at the January 2015 AGM. 
Throughout 2017, the Committee conducted a comprehensive 
review of the executives’ remuneration arrangements and 
considered what changes, if any, should be made for the next 
policy cycle. In conducting this review the Committee was 
very mindful of the evolving executive pay environment and 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
the expectations of shareholders, government and the public 
for how directors should be paid. I was pleased as part of this 
process to consult with our largest shareholders to understand 
their points of view and feedback on our remuneration proposals. 
These have been taken into consideration where possible in the 
new Remuneration Policy presented in this Remuneration Report.
The result of this review was that the features of the previous 
Remuneration Policy remain consistent and aligned with our 
remuneration principles and strategic objectives as a business. 
The proposed Remuneration Policy is therefore largely unchanged 
except for a number of amendments to align the remuneration 
structure with best practice expected by our shareholders and 
wider stakeholders as follows:
•   Introduction of a two year post vesting holding period to 
the Executive Share Option Plan (ESOP) and Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) awards under the 
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP);
•   Increase the CFO’s minimum shareholding requirement 
to 200% of salary (from 100%).
•  Limit the use of additional LTIP awards on recruitment 
to only replace awards foregone from the previous 
employer on a like-for-like basis.
The LTIP will continue to consist of share options under the 
ESOP and performance shares under the PSP . The purpose of 
the LTIP is to motivate and incentivise the delivery of sustained, 
long-term performance and encourage share price and dividend 
growth over the performance period of the awards. 
The Committee noted that there is a drive from certain 
shareholders for simplification of long-term incentives by 
consolidating LTIPs into a single vehicle. The Committee is 
sympathetic to this point of view, however felt that to continue 
with the current balance of ESOP and PSP given its relevance 
and link to the strategy was best to align participants with our 
shareholders and incentivises long-term shareholder value 
creation. The Committee also noted that emerging shareholder 
guidance and the Government’s response to the green paper 
on Corporate Governance Reform encouraged flexibility for 
companies to design and operate LTIPs that were most 
relevant to them. The Committee is therefore confident that the 
continuation of the current LTIP model is the most appropriate 
to align executives with the long-term strategy of the business. 
Sue Clark
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
62 www.britvic.com It is also intended that the performance measures under 
the LTIP will remain the same. The Committee will retain 
the flexibility to select the performance measures it considers 
appropriate each year but intends to operate the same 
performance measures as currently in place and would only 
make significant changes following consultation with our 
shareholders. For clarity:
• ESOP award vesting will be dependent 100% on earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) performance; and
• PSP award vesting will be dependant 75% on EPS growth 
and 25% on total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance 
relative to a peer group.
EPS growth is one of the business’s key KPIs and performance 
against this metric will drive long-term shareholder value. 
The Committee reviewed the target range of 3% to 8% p.a. 
EPS growth to achieve a payout from threshold to maximum 
and determined that it remains appropriate and stretching given 
the business’s internal expectations, consensus estimates and 
the current economic environment, ensuring that maximum 
payout can only be achieved where exceptional performance 
is delivered to our shareholders. 
Relative TSR will continue to be measured against a bespoke 
group of companies in similar industries (no change to the peer 
group proposed) as the Committee considered it important 
that executives only receive a portion of value through the 
LTIP for outperforming peer companies.
Return on invested capital (‘ROIC’) over the performance 
period will continue to be considered by the Committee when 
assessing the outcome of the LTIP to ensure that it remains 
appropriate relative to the EPS growth delivered. 
The annual bonus will continue to be payable fully in cash. 
This maintains an appropriate overall balance of remuneration 
based on long and nearer term performance.
Changes to the CFO’s remuneration package
When the Board appointed the CFO in November 2015, 
his total package was set significantly below that of his 
predecessor (circa 18%) and in line with the lower quartile 
of our benchmarking peer group (based on the top half of 
the FTSE 250). Specifically, his base salary was set at a 10% 
discount to the previous CFO, PSP was set at a maximum of 
80% of salary (vs 100%) and the ESOP set at a maximum of 
200% of salary (vs 250%). Further, no buy-out awards were 
made to the new CFO on appointment to compensate for 
awards forgone from his previous employer. This approach 
reflects the Committee’s commitment to paying only what is 
required to secure the best talent within the business and this 
remains our general philosophy in setting pay on recruitment. 
The CFO’s package was set on the basis that the Committee 
would keep it under review and may award increases over the 
first three years following appointment that exceeded that of 
the wider workforce (as disclosed in previous remuneration 
reports) subject to the CFO’s development and performance 
in role. The Committee noted that the CFO is now fully 
established in his role and is critical to the execution of Britvic’s 
strategy and therefore determined it is appropriate to make 
changes to the CFO’s pay to recognise his performance to 
date and to ensure that his package appropriately reflects his 
experience and importance to the business. The Committee 
therefore intends to:
•  Increase the CFO’s base salary to £375,000 from £340,000. 
This consists of an 8% adjustment to reﬂ ect development 
and performance in role since appointment and a 2% 
inﬂ ationary increase in line with that awarded to the wider 
UK employee population; and
•   Increase the CFO’s maximum PSP opportunity from 
80% of salary to 100% of salary.
The above changes result in an increase of 16% to the overall 
target remuneration of the CFO and we would note that this 
is still lower than the total target pay of the previous CFO 
and moderately positioned below median versus our peer group. 
The Committee is mindful of the sensitivity to large increases 
in base pay levels and considered the proposed approach 
carefully in this context. The intention of the salary increase 
is to bring the CFO’s salary to a level that the Committee 
considers appropriate given his performance and importance 
to the business, also noting that the CFO has not received 
a salary increase since his appointment; this illustrates 
the Committee’s general commitment to restraint, only 
making significant changes on a targeted basis where 
these are felt necessary.
The moderate increase in PSP to bring the CFO in line with 
the maximum allowed for under the Remuneration Policy 
recognises his experience in role and will provide stronger 
alignment for the CFO with the long-term performance of the 
business and our shareholders. We would note that in making 
the changes set out above, the CFO’s ESOP maximum 
opportunity will remain below that allowed for under the 
Remuneration Policy and that of the previous incumbent. 
Given these changes and as set out above, the Committee 
has concluded that the minimum shareholding requirements 
for the CFO will be increased to 200% of base salary from the 
current 100%. This recognises the additional potential value 
the CFO may receive under the LTIP , improves his alignment 
with shareholders and is in line with best practice. 
Business performance and remuneration outcomes 
for the year
As detailed in the Chief Financial Officer’s review, the overall 
performance of the business has been strong. This has resulted 
in the following incentive outcomes:
• Annual bonus pay-outs for Executive Directors at 82% 
of the maximum opportunity, in particular due to strong 
proﬁ t and cash ﬂ ow performance.
• The PSP awarded in 2014 will vest at 56.2% of the 
maximum opportunity reﬂ ecting sustained EPS growth 
over the period and relative TSR performance over the 
last three years.
• The ESOP awarded in 2014 will vest at 61.1% of the 
maximum opportunity due to strong EPS growth 
performance over the last three years.
In line with the remuneration reporting regulations, details 
of the performance targets and actual achievement against 
these are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Additionally, the Committee have agreed to increase the 
CEO’s base salary from £600,000 to £612,000, an inflationary 
increase of 2% in line with the 2% awarded to the wider UK 
employee population.
The Committee is aware of the increasing interest from 
shareholders and governance organisations on the remit of 
Remuneration Committee’s with regards to the wider employee 
population including the publication of additional data such as the 
ratio of CEO pay to the all employee population. The Committee 
will review its remit over 2018 in view of evolving regulatory 
requirements and best practice to ensure it meets the new 
requirements when they are introduced. 
I look forward to receiving your support on the new 
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report on Remuneration 
at the January 2018 AGM. Should you have any questions 
relating to our approach to executive remuneration, please 
feel free to contact me at investors@britvic.com.

Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 63
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Our remuneration principles
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to become the most dynamic, creative and trusted soft drinks company 
in the world. At the heart of our vision is our people, which the company is required to attract, engage and retain from across our global sector. 
To determine the shape, size and variability of each element of pay the Committee follow five key remuneration principles:
Competitive market positioning 
and opportunity
To attract, retain and engage the executive talent we need to realise our vision and deliver our 
strategy our remuneration arrangements need to be sufficiently competitive but not excessive.
Pay aligned with sustainable 
long-term performance
The mix between both fixed and variable pay as well as the balance between rewarding short 
versus long-term performance are critical to ensure they are correctly balanced and reward those 
behaviours that will lead to the realisation of our long-term vision without compromise for short-term 
gain. In addition, all forms of variable pay are only fully delivered in return for performance materially 
above the standards required by the company and our shareholders; In other words the superior pay 
opportunity available can only be realised in return for superior performance.
Incentive metrics aligned with 
our strategy and key KPIs
The performance measures selected to determine both our annual bonus and long-term 
incentive plans have been carefully considered to focus on a simple and effective selection 
of those key drivers of our strategy and long-term value creation for our shareholders.
Alignment of executive and 
shareholder interests
To ensure the continued alignment of executive and shareholder interests, the greatest potential 
pay opportunity for executives is via our long-term incentive plans. Awards are based in shares 
and are dependent on a balance of absolute and relative growth in long-term value creation for 
shareholders. In particular, the mix of share options and performance shares is designed to 
ensure that executives are only rewarded for superior market performance and the realisation 
of our vision. This is further reinforced by meaningful shareholding guidelines for executives so 
that their long-term wealth remains tied to Britvic’s sustained long-term success.
Mindful of our wider stakeholder 
responsibilities 
In support of our vision our Executive Directors’ pay arrangement are not only focused on 
financial returns but also mindful of performance against our wider long-term stakeholder goals. 
The Committee takes great care to set appropriate targets that do not compromise our wider 
stakeholder aspirations. Both malus and clawback provisions are in place to address potential 
inappropriate actions or risk taking when determining incentive plan pay-outs.

REMUNERATION AT A GLANCE

66 www.britvic.com Our overall approach to remuneration
The principal objective of our Remuneration Policy is to support a performance based culture that will help drive the successful execution of our 
business strategy. We aim to provide competitive levels of remuneration opportunity for our senior executives and leadership team, a significant 
portion of which is in the form of variable pay. 
In setting the Remuneration Policy the Committee carefully considered corporate governance best practice and the company’s environmental 
and social responsibilities.
2017/18 Remuneration Policy 
The table below sets out the company’s Remuneration Policy that will be presented to shareholders at the 2018 AGM and subject to shareholder 
approval, will take effect for the 2017/18 financial year. 
There is no intention to revise the Policy more frequently than every three years. However, the Committee will review the Policy annually 
in order to ensure that it remains aligned with the company’s strategy, appropriately positioned against the market and aligned with corporate 
governance requirements.
In the event that a change to the policy is required, the Committee will consult with the company’s major shareholders prior to submitting the Policy 
for approval.

Base salary 
Element of fixed pay that 
reflects the individual’s role, 
position, experience and 
contribution to the group. 
Base salaries are paid in cash 
and reviewed annually, with 
any changes normally taking 
effect from 1 January.
Out of cycle reviews may 
be conducted if considered 
appropriate by the Committee.
Base salaries are set with reference 
to comparator groups made up of 
similar sized UK listed companies 
(both pan-sector and from the 
food and beverages sector).
The Committee also has 
reference to international food 
and beverages companies.
Alternative peer groups may 
be considered depending on 
the location and domicile of 
Directors based outside of the UK.
Whilst there is no prescribed 
formulaic maximum, annual 
increases will normally be in 
the context of overall business 
performance and the level awarded 
to the general GB based workforce.
Higher increases may be made 
where there have been significant 
changes in the responsibility and 
accountability in a role, where there 
are large variances to the market, 
for example in the case of a new 
Executive Director appointed on 
a salary below the market median, 
or where there is a significant 
change in the relationship of 
the company relative to the peer 
group. Any significant increases 
will be fully explained.

Benefits 
To provide market typical benefits 
which are valued by recipients and 
allow executives to carry out their 
duties efficiently.
Benefits and allowances include 
but are not limited to: annual car 
benefit (or allowance), membership 
of the company’s private medical 
healthcare plan, the ability to ‘buy’ 
or ’sell’ holiday under the 
company’s flexible benefits plan, 
payment of up to two subscriptions 
to recognised professional bodies, 
and life assurance.
There is also a relocation policy 
which provides for reasonable 
expenses to be paid subject to 
the Committee’s approval.
Other benefits may be provided 
from time to time if considered 
reasonable and appropriate by 
the Committee and will be 
explained in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for the relevant year.
The maximum levels of benefit 
provision are:
•  Provision of a company car or 
car allowance paid in cash. The 
company car rental cost would 
not exceed £10,800 and a cash 
allowance would not exceed 
£10,634 p.a.;
•  Private medical insurance 
on a private basis;
•  The value of any professional 
subscriptions paid by the 
company may vary but would 
not be excessive; and
•  Life assurance cover of four 
times base salary.
The value of any relocation 
allowance provided is dependent 
on the relevant circumstances 
when the need arises. However 
the Committee would not pay more 
than necessary in such situations. 
Up to five days holiday may be 
sold at a pro-rated value of the 
individual’s salary.
n/a
Pension
Supports a market aligned 
compensation package and assists 
participants’ plans for retirement.
Pension provision is provided in 
the form of a defined contribution 
‘DC’ pension or a cash allowance 
where the individual opts out of 
the pension scheme as a result of 
exceeding the tax efficient pension 
savings limits set by HMRC.
For the defined contribution 
pension, the maximum annual 
contribution is:
•  28% of base salary for the CEO; 
and
• 25% of base salary for the CFO.
For the cash allowance, the 
maximum contributions reflect 
those under the DC pension less a 
deduction to ensure the cash 
allowance is broadly cost neutral to 
the company from a National 
Insurance perspective.
n/a
Annual bonus 
To motivate employees and 
incentivise delivery of annual 
performance targets.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash 
after the end of the financial year 
to which they relate.
Targets are set at the beginning of 
the performance year which runs 
from the start to the end of each 
financial period. 
The Committee has the discretion 
to adjust the bonus outcome if 
the pure application of a formula is 
not felt to produce an appropriate 
result in light of overall underlying 
performance. In particular, the 
Committee has the discretion 
to adjust payments downwards 
if profits have fallen. Any 
adjustment made using this 
discretion will be explained.
Malus and clawback may be applied 
in respect of the bonus in certain 
situations where the payment of 
the bonus resulted from a material 
misstatement in the company’s 
accounts or an error in the 
assessment of the satisfaction 
of a performance condition.
Target and maximum opportunities are:
•  70% and 140% of base salary 
for the CEO; and
• 60% and 120% for the CFO.
The level of payment at threshold 
is set on an annual basis but will 
not exceed 25% of the maximum 
award value.
The specific measures, targets 
and weighting may vary from year 
to year in order to align with the 
Group’s strategy, but always with 
a substantial proportion based on 
key financial metrics.
The performance conditions are 
set annually based on the metrics 
the Committee feels are most 
appropriate for the business and 
create value for shareholders. 
These may include, but are not 
limited to, profit, revenue and 
cash flow metrics. Strategic 
KPIs may be chosen to support 
particular objectives for the year. 
Annual bonus targets are set 
with reference to internal budgets 
and analyst consensus forecasts, 
with maximum payout requiring 
performance well ahead of budget.

Long-term incentives – 
ESOP and PSP
To motivate and incentivise delivery 
of sustained, long-term performance 
and encourage share price and 
dividend growth over the 
performance period of the awards.
The Committee believes that LTIP 
measures should be simple, aligned 
to sustainable long-term shareholder 
value creation and provide line of 
sight to management so that they 
are meaningful and incentivising. 
ESOP – Allows for annual grants 
of market value options. Awards 
vest after three years, subject to 
performance conditions. A two-year 
holding period then applies 
following the three-year vesting 
period to provide further alignment 
with shareholders. Options expire 
10 years following the grant date.
PSP – Allows for annual grants 
of performance share awards. 
Awards vest after three years, 
subject to performance conditions. 
A two-year holding period then 
applies following the three-year 
vesting period to provide further 
alignment with shareholders.
Under the PSP participants are 
entitled to dividend equivalents 
between award and vesting in 
respect of awards that vest.
Malus and clawback may be 
applied in respect of LTIP awards 
in certain situations where the 
vesting of an LTIP award resulted 
from a material misstatement in the 
company’s accounts or an error in 
the assessment of the satisfaction 
of a performance condition.
ESOP – The maximum 
opportunities are:
•  300% of base salary for the CEO; 
and
•  250% of base salary for the CFO.
PSP – The maximum opportunity 
is 150% of base salary for the 
CEO; and 100% for the CFO.
Under the ESOP and PSP 20% 
of the maximum award vests for 
achieving threshold performance, 
increasing to 100% of the 
maximum opportunity vesting for 
achieving maximum performance.
The Committee chooses 
performance metrics measured 
over three years that support the 
company’s long-term strategic 
priorities, provide a direct link with 
shareholder value and ensure a 
clear line of sight for participants 
between performance and reward. 
For ESOP grants made in 
2017/18, performance will 
be measured using an EPS 
performance condition.
For PSP grants made in 2017/18, 
75% of performance will be 
measured using the same EPS 
performance condition as for the 
ESOP, with the remaining 25% 
of performance measured using 
relative TSR. ROIC over the 
performance period will also be 
considered by the Committee 
in determining the level of 
vesting at the end of the period. 
EPS growth is a key measure 
of our success in growing value 
for shareholders over time. The 
setting of the EPS targets takes 
into account analyst consensus 
forecasts, internal projections, 
and the levels of performance 
required over the long term to 
deliver absolute value appreciation 
for shareholders.
Relative TSR strongly links share 
price growth and dividends to 
the rewards executives receive. 
The relative nature of the measure 
ensures that participants only 
receive awards if outperformance 
is achieved against a basket of 
investment comparables.
ROIC is an important financial 
discipline to ensure that growth 
in the business continues to 
be value enhancing over the 
long term.
The Committee may adjust the 
performance measures for future 
awards and the weighting of 
these measures if it feels this 
will create greater alignment with 
business and strategic priorities.
A significant change to the 
measures used would only be 
adopted following consultation 
with major shareholders.
Shareholding guidelines
To encourage long-term share 
ownership by the Executive 
Directors so that interests 
are aligned with other 
long-term investors.
Executive Directors are to acquire 
and then hold a certain shareholding 
from the date of their appointment 
to the Board. 
Until this holding is acquired, the 
Executive Directors may not sell 
any shares received through the 
long-term incentives operated by 
the company unless approved by 
the Committee.
Shareholdings are set at 200% 
of base salary for the CEO and 
CFO from the date of appointment 
to the Board. 
The Committee will monitor 
progress on this requirement
on an annual basis.

All-employee 
share plans
To allow executives to 
participate in share plans on the 
same terms as other employees.
Executive Directors may participate 
in the Britvic Share Incentive Plan, 
which is an all-employee HMRC 
approved share plan open to 
employees based in GB. The plan 
has three parts, all of which the 
Directors participate in:
•  Free share awards, which are 
made annually subject to the 
company’s performance and at 
the discretion of the Committee.
•  Partnership shares, which 
are purchased by employees 
through payroll deductions.
•  Matching shares, which are 
provided by the employer 
to individuals purchasing 
partnership shares.
The Committee reserves the right 
to use its discretion to amend the 
operation of the all-employee share 
plan from time to time.
•  Free share awards, up to a 
maximum of 4% of earnings, 
capped at £3,600 p.a. 
•  Partnership shares, up to 
£1,800 p.a.
•  Matching shares, on a one for 
one basis up to a maximum 
of £650 p.a. 
The Committee has the discretion 
to limit the free share awards in 
light of performance against 
internal profit targets.
Chairman and Non-Executive

To attract and retain 
experienced and skilled 
Non-Executive Directors.
The fees paid to the Chairman are 
determined by the Committee, 
while the fees of the Non-Executive 
Directors are determined by the 
Board with affected persons 
absenting themselves from the 
discussions as appropriate.
Annual fees are paid to the 
Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors on a four weekly basis. 
Additional fees are paid to 
Non-Executive Directors who 
are members of and who chair 
a Committee and to the Senior 
Independent Director.
Non-Executive Director fee levels 
are periodically reviewed by the 
board and the Committee (for the 
Chairman only). Any increases to 
fees are normally effective from 
1 January. 
NEDs do not participate in company 
incentive arrangements, and do not 
receive any form of pension provision.
NEDs will be reimbursed by 
the company for all reasonable 
expenses incurred in performing 
their duties of office and may 
have any tax thereon paid by 
the company..
The maximum fee level for each 
NED is set by reference to fees 
paid in UK-listed companies of a 
similar size and scope to Britvic.
Any planned increases in fees 
will take into account general 
increases across the wider 
employee population.

Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for other employees
The implementation of the Remuneration Policy described above applies specifically to Executive Directors. Where possible, principles set out 
in the policy have been applied to all employees to achieve alignment as per the below table:
Element Application of policy for other employees
Base salary Paid in cash and reviewed annually, normally taking effect 1 January. Salaries are set with reference to internal pay 
levels, as well as local market competitiveness compared to roles of a similar nature and size of responsibility.
Benefits Britvic provide local market typical benefits focused on employee health and wellbeing. The majority of employees 
participate in the company’s flexible benefits plan.
Pension Subject to local market practice and regulations.
GB employees have rights under the GB legacy defined benefit pension arrangement which is now closed to future 
accrual (the plan was closed to executives at the same time). A defined contribution pension was introduced 
following the closure of the defined benefit pension in which UK employees are entitled to participate in.
Annual bonus Approximately 250 leaders and senior managers participate in bonus arrangements with measures aligned to that 
of the executive directors.
Typically, all other employees are eligible to receive a bonus linked to profit and revenue of the company as well 
as their individual performance.
Long term incentives The performance share plan is awarded to approximately 90 leaders globally each year. Approximately 15 leaders 
also receive options under the executive share option plan. Performance conditions for both awards are linked to 
those of the executive directors.
All employee share plans Where possible, we offer employees annual free share awards linked to company performance as well as the 
opportunity to purchase Britvic shares. In some locations, alternative local profit sharing arrangements are 
available, depending on local market practices and legislation.
The value of each element the employee may receive will vary according to the employee’s seniority and level of responsibility.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 71
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Remuneration Policy notes
Key changes to the Remuneration Policy
The key changes to the Remuneration Policy from the Policy approved by shareholders at the 2015 AGM are to align the remuneration structure 
with best practice expected by shareholders and wider stakeholder. The changes are summarised as follows:
• Introduction of a two-year post-vesting holding period to awards for both PSP and ESOP under the LTIP to further align Executive Director 
interests to that of shareholders.
• An increase to the CFO’s minimum shareholding requirement to 200% of salary (from 100%).
•  Clariﬁ cation that on recruitment, any awards above the normal award levels as set out in the main policy table will only be used to compensate 
for awards forgone from previous employment.
Differences in Remuneration Policy for all employees
All employees are entitled to base salary and benefits and may also receive bonus, pension and share awards the values of which vary according to 
the individual’s seniority and level of responsibility. Details on implementation of the Remuneration Policy for all employees can be found on page 67.
Share awards made prior to the implementation of approved Remuneration Policy
Unvested ESOP and PSP awards will continue to pay out in accordance with the relevant plan rules and previously approved Remuneration Policy 
at the time of award. Any payments under these plans will be disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration as required by the regulations. 
Committee discretion
In addition to the discretion set out in this Remuneration Policy report, the Committee may apply discretion in operating the Remuneration Policy 
in certain matters including the following:
• The timing of any payments.
• The impact of a change of control or restructuring.
•  Any adjustments to performance conditions or awards required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, corporate restructuring 
event, special dividend or rights issue).
• The operation of malus and clawback provisions.
• Minor administrative matters to improve the effi  ciency of operation of the plans or to comply with local tax law or regulation.
Discretion regarding the treatment of leavers is set out in the ‘Service contracts and the policy on the payment for loss of office’ section.
The Committee also reserves the right to make a remuneration payment that originated from before the individual became an Executive Director.
In relation to the annual bonus and LTIP plans, the Committee retains the ability to amend the performance conditions and/or measures in respect 
of any award or payment if one or more events have occurred which would lead the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to do so, 
provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to meet. Recognising the dynamic nature of the Group’s business and in 
order to provide flexibility in the near-term, the Committee retains discretion to vary the metrics of the performance measures as the business may 
require over the next three years.
The Committee may also make adjustments to the formulaic outcomes of incentives where, in the opinion of the Committee, they do not reflect 
the underlying performance of the business. 
If the Committee used any of the discretions set out above these would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual Remuneration Report 
and the views of major shareholders may also be sought.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Committee is kept regularly updated on pay and conditions across the Group and has reference to average pay increases and the average salaries 
for the wider employee population. These metrics are considered by the Committee when reviewing the remuneration for Executive Directors.
The company did not consult with employees when drawing up the Remuneration Policy.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee is committed to on going dialogue with the company’s shareholder base. This can take a variety of forms, such as: 
• Meetings with major shareholders to consider signiﬁ cant potential changes to policy or speciﬁ c issues of interest to particular shareholder 
groups; and
• Other dialogue to update shareholders and take their feedback on planned reﬁ nements to arrangements.
In drawing up the proposed Remuneration Policy, the Chair of the Committee engaged with Britvic’s major shareholders and key institutional 
representative bodies. The views expressed by our shareholders during this process have been considered in the development of the 
Remuneration Policy.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
CONTINUED
72 www.britvic.com Approach to remuneration on recruitment
When hiring a new Executive Director, or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will in principle apply the same policy as for 
existing Executive Directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy. The rationale for the package offered will be explained in the next Annual 
Remuneration Report.
For internal promotions, any commitments made prior to appointment may continue to be honoured as the executive is transitioned to the 
new remuneration arrangements.
Our recruitment Remuneration Policy aims to give the Committee sufficient flexibility to secure the appointment and promotion of high-calibre 
executives to strengthen the management team and secure the skill sets to deliver our strategic objectives. The details are set out in the table below:
Area Policy and operation
Base salary •  Base salary would be set at an appropriate level to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, 
experience and current remuneration. In some instances, it may be appropriate to recruit on a salary 
at the lower end of the typical market range and progress salary increases above the typical rate of 
increases provided to the wider employee workforce to align with performance and policy over time.
Benefits and pension •  Beneﬁ ts and pension would be in line with normal policy and may include, where appropriate, relocation 
beneﬁ ts or other beneﬁ ts reﬂ ective of normal market practice in the territory in which the Executive 
Director is employed.
Annual bonus • Awards would be made under the annual bonus plan in line with the Remuneration Policy.
• Maximum opportunity would not exceed 140% of base salary.
Normal LTIP awards 
(ESOP and PSP)
• Awards would be made under the LTIP plans in line with the Remuneration Policy.
• Under the ESOP , maximum opportunity would not exceed 300% of base salary.
• Under the PSP , maximum opportunity would not exceed 150% of base salary.
Additional LTIP awards
(ESOP and PSP)
•  On the recruitment of an executive the Committee may make a one-off  performance linked award 
under the ESOP and PSP subject to the below limits. Any awards above the normal award levels as 
set out in the main policy table will only be used to compensate for awards forgone from previous 
employment.
• Under the ESOP an award of up to 500% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive (inclusive 
of the normal annual award that would be granted to an executive).
•  Under the PSP an award of up to 200% of base salary may be made in a year to an Executive (inclusive 
of the normal annual award that would be granted to an executive).
Replacement awards •  The Committee will normally seek to avoid using replacement awards. However where, in exceptional 
circumstances, replacement awards are considered by the Committee to be necessary, they are not 
subject to a formal maximum, although would be designed to reﬂ ect only the value of remuneration 
forgone by the recruited executive or less. In making any buy-out awards the Committee would take 
into account any additional LTIP awards made as set out above.
Service contracts •  The Committee may agree a contractual notice period with the executive which initially exceeds 
12 months, as applies to other executives, particularly if it is necessary to attract executives who 
will be required to relocate their family.
•  This will reduce to a 12-month rolling notice period once the individual is 12 months from the end 
of their initial notice period.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 73
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office 
The table below sets out items that are contained within the service contracts for the Executive Directors. It is the policy that these will apply 
to any future Director.
Item Policy
Notice period • 12 months if given by the company.
• 6 months if given by the executive.
Remuneration • Base salary and pension.
• Eligibility to participate in the annual bonus and LTIP and other share incentive plans.
Benefits • Provision of company car or cash alternative.
• Payment of professional subscriptions for up to two recognised professional bodies.
• Eligibility for private medical insurance.
Contractual termination payment •  The company may terminate the executive’s employment at any time and with immediate eff ect and 
will pay the executive an after tax sum in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary which the executive 
would have been entitled to receive during their notice period. A payment may also be made in respect 
of outstanding untaken holiday entitlement accrued up to and including the date of termination.
•  Payments in lieu of notice would be paid monthly and are subject to mitigation if the executive obtains 
alternative income during the period.
•  If the executive is terminated for reasons such as gross misconduct no payment in lieu of notice will be due.
•  The Committee may at its discretion put the Executive on garden leave for any period provided that base 
salary and contractual beneﬁ ts are paid during this period. The Committee would only use this discretion 
when appropriate and would seek to minimise the cost to the company if such discretion was required.
Non-Executive Directors • The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment 
for a three year term
• On termination Non-Executive Directors shall only be entitled to accrued fees as at the date of termination.
In the event of a settlement agreement, the Committee may agree payments it considers reasonable in settlement of legal claims. This may include 
reasonable reimbursement of professional fees in connection with such agreements.
The table below sets out details of how an Executive Director’s incentives and pension would be treated on termination. Items of fixed pay are 
detailed in the previous table.
Incentives Treatment
Annual bonus • In the case of retirement with the agreement of the Committee, redundancy, death in service, or such 
other reason as the Committee may in its discretion approve, the bonus will be pro rated to the date 
of termination and paid on the normal payment date.
• Executives leaving for any other reason will normally forfeit their awards.
ESOP and PSP • Awards for executives who are treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the rules of the LTIPs (reasons include 
ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, change of control, retirement with the consent of the company, 
and any other reason at the Committee’s discretion) will vest at the normal vesting date unless the 
Committee determines the awards should vest at an alternative date taking into consideration the extent 
to which any performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed and time served over the performance period.
• If the executive is not a ‘good leaver’, the awards will lapse immediately on termination.
• If the executive ceases to be a Director as a result of death, awards will vest as soon as practicable 
taking into consideration the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisﬁ ed and time 
served over the performance period.
Other appointments 
The Executive Directors are not permitted to have any engagement with any other company during the term of their appointment without the prior 
written consent of the Board. 
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY

Advisors 
PwC was appointed as advisor to the Committee in August 2014 following a competitive tender process. The company is also advised by PwC 
on other remuneration related items and provided consulting support on non-remuneration related issues. PwC is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group (the professional body for executive remuneration consultants). PwC’s fees in respect of advice to the Committee in the year 
under review were £57,300 and were charged on the basis of that firm’s standard terms of business for advice provided.
During the year, Addleshaw Goddard LLP was also engaged by the Committee to provide legal advice on contractual arrangements and 
share schemes.
Unless otherwise stated, these advisors have no other connection with the company. The Committee, based on its experience, is satisfied 
that the advice it received from these organisations was objective and independent. 
Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following year
The new Remuneration Policy will be implemented from the commencement of the new financial year (2017/18) subject to shareholder approval 
at the January 2018 AGM:
Base salary
Implemented in line with Policy.
The CEO will receive a salary increase of 2%, in line with the wider UK employee population.
The CFO will receive a salary increase of 10%. This consists of an 8% adjustment to reflect development and performance in role since appointment 
and a 2% inflationary increase in line with that awarded to the wider UK employee population. Full details are set out in the Chair’s Letter.

Implemented in line with Policy.
Annual bonus 
Implemented in line with Policy. 
The bonus measures¹ and weightings for 2017/18 are: 
• Adjusted proﬁ t before tax and acquisition related amortisation* (50%)
• Total net revenue (20%)
• Net revenue from innovation (10%)
• Adjusted free cash ﬂ ow* (20%)
Target award amounts for the CEO and CFO are 70% and 60% of base salary and maximum award values are 140% and 120% of 
base salary, respectively. 
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets under the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be detrimental 
to the interests of the company to disclose them before the start of the financial year. Disclosure of targets in advance could lead the company 
to be at a disadvantage as many competitors are not subject to the same levels of disclosure. Targets and the performance against them will 
be disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report following the end of the financial year.
Note: 
1.  Performance measures defined as follows:
 Adjusted profit before tax and acquisition related amortisation* (PBTA) – Measured before adjusting items on a constant currency basis
 Total net revenue and net revenue from innovation – Measured on a constant currency basis.

The table below shows how the percentage change in the Chief Executive’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2016 and 2017 compared with 
the percentage change in the weighted average of each of those components for all full-time equivalent employees based in Great Britain (GB). 
The GB employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the CEO is based in GB (albeit with a global role and responsibilities) 
and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.

Business review and future development
A review of the group’s operations during the year and its plans 
for the future is given in the Chairman’s introduction, the Chief 
Executive Officer’s Review and the Chief Financial Officer’s 
Review between pages 8 to 43. Details of the Group’s business 
model and strategy are summarised on pages 6, 7, 16 and 17.
Results and dividends
The Group’s profit before taxation attributable to the equity 
shareholders amounted to £138.8m (2016: £151.9m) and the 
profit after taxation amounted to £111.6m (2016: £114.5m). 
An interim dividend of 7.2 pence (2016: 7.0 pence) per ordinary 
share was paid on 14 July 2017.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Directors have proposed 
a final dividend of 19.3 pence (2016: 17.5 pence) per ordinary 
share payable on 5 February 2018 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 8 December 2017, giving a 
total dividend in respect of 2017 of 26.5 pence (2016: 24.5 pence), 
an increase of 8.2% over the previous year. 
Articles of association
The company’s articles may only be amended by a special 
resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. No 
amendments to the articles are being proposed at the AGM.
Directors
The following were Directors of the company during the year: 
Gerald Corbett (resigned on 1 September 2017), Joanne Averiss 
(resigned 1 September 2017), Sue Clark, Mathew Dunn, 
John Daly, Ben Gordon, Simon Litherland, Ian McHoul and 
Euan Sutherland.
Subject to company law and the company’s articles, the 
Directors may exercise all of the powers of the company and 
may delegate their power and discretion to committees. The 
executive team is responsible for the day-to-day management 
of the group. The articles give the Directors power to appoint 
and replace Directors. Under the terms of reference of the 
Nomination Committee, any appointment must be recommended 
by the Nomination Committee for approval by the Board. The 
articles also require Directors to retire and submit themselves 
for election to the first AGM following appointment and to retire 
at the AGM held in the third calendar year after election or last 
re-election, but to comply with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the ‘Code’) all of the directors will submit themselves for 
election or re-election at the AGM, as appropriate. As a result of 
ongoing refreshment of the Board and as indicated on page 56, 
Ben Gordon will not be seeking re-election at the AGM. The 
biographical details of the Directors are set out on pages 46 
and 47 of this report and in the Notice of Meeting which is 
available on the company’s website. The service contracts 
of the Executive Directors and letters of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
company’s registered office. 
Directors’ interests
The Directors’ interests in ordinary shares of the company 
are shown within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
page 82. No Director has any other interest in any shares 
or loan stock of any Group company. No Director was or 
is materially interested in any contract, other than under 
their service contract or letter of appointment, which was 
subsisting during or existing at the end of year and which 
was significant in relation to the Group’s business. There 
are procedures in place to deal with any conflicts of interest 
and these have operated effectively during the year. 
Directors’ liabilities
As at the date of this report, customary indemnities are in 
place under which the company has agreed, to the extent 
permitted by law and the company’s articles, to indemnify:
• The Directors, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties 
and responsibilities as Directors of the company or any 
of its subsidiaries; and
• Directors of companies which are corporate trustees of 
the group’s pension schemes against liability incurred in 
connection with those companies’ activities as trustees 
of such schemes.
Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board, has 
adopted a policy that aims to attract and retain the directors 
needed to run the group effectively. The policy which will 
be presented to shareholders at the AGM and is subject 
to shareholder approval is contained within the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 67 to 74.

shares divided into ordinary shares of 20 pence each (referred 
to as ‘ordinary shares’). As at 1 October 2017, the company’s 
issued share capital comprised 263,797,000 ordinary shares.
Rights and restrictions attaching to shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the company, every 
holder of ordinary shares present in person and entitled to vote 
shall have one vote, and on a poll, every member present in 
person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall have one vote for 
every ordinary share held. Any notice of general meeting issued 
by the company will specify deadlines for exercising voting rights 
and in appointing a proxy or proxies in relation to resolutions to be 
proposed at the general meeting. All proxy votes are counted and 
the numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution 
are announced at the general meeting and published on the 
company’s website after the meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the company other than:
• Certain restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws); and
• Pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct 
Authority and the Group’s share dealing code whereby 
certain employees of the Group require the approval of the 
company to deal in its ordinary shares.
The company is not aware of any agreements between 
shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities and/or voting rights.
Dividend waiver
The trustees of the Britvic Share Incentive Plan have elected to 
waive dividends on shares held under trust relating to dividends 
payable during the year.
Shares held in employee benefit trusts
Under the rules of the Britvic Share Incentive Plan (‘the Plan’) 
eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the 
company. Plan shares are held in trust for participants by 
Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited (‘the Trustees’). Voting 
rights are exercised by the Trustees on receipt of participants’ 
instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to 
the Trustees no vote is registered. In addition, the Trustees 
do not vote on any unawarded shares held under the Plan as 
surplus assets. As at 28 November 2017, the Trustees held 
1.31% (2016: 1.24%) of the issued share capital of the company. 
Similarly, if First Names (Jersey) Limited, as Trustee of the 
Britvic Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trustee’), holds ordinary 
shares on trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior 
executives and managers of the Group, a dividend waiver is in 
place. The Trustee is not permitted to vote on any unvested 
shares held in the trust unless expressly directed to do so by 
the company. The Trustees held 0.21% of the issued share 
capital as at 28 November 2017 (2016: 0.19%).
Change of control provisions
There are no agreements between the company and its 
directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of 
office or employment (whether through resignation, purported 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover 
bid. The company’s banking arrangements are terminable upon 
a change of control of the company. Certain other indebtedness 
becomes repayable if a change of control leads to a downgrade 
in the credit rating of the company. The company’s agreements 
with PepsiCo are terminable upon a change of control.

Disclaimer
The purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information 
to the members of the company and it has been prepared for, 
and only for, the members of the company as a body, and 
no other persons. The company, its Directors and employees, 
agents and advisors do not accept or assume responsibility 
to any other person to whom this document is shown or into 
whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability 
is expressly disclaimed. A cautionary statement in respect of

The Directors’ report was approved by the Board on 
28 November 2017. 
On behalf of the Board
Jonathan Adelman
Acting General Counsel and Company Secretary
Britvic plc
Company No. 5604923
88 www.britvic.com STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the 
annual report and the financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have elected to prepare the group financial statements 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (FRS 101). 
Under company law the directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group 
and company and of their profit or loss for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• in respect of the group ﬁ nancial statements, state whether 
IFRSs they as adopted by the European Union have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁ nancial statements;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁ c requirements in IFRSs is insuffi  cient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the group’s ﬁ nancial position 
and ﬁ nancial performance;
• in respect of the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, 
including FRS 10, have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
ﬁ nancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company and/or the group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the company and the group 
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and with respect to the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention of fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic report, Directors’ report, 
Remuneration report and Corporate governance statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ declaration in relation to relevant 
audit information
The Directors who were members of the Board at the time 
of approving the Directors’ Report are listed on pages 46 
and 47. Having made enquiries of fellow Directors and of the 
company’s auditor, each of these Directors confirms that: 
• to the best of each Directors’ knowledge and belief, there 
is no information relevant of which the company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
• each Director has taken all the steps a Director might 
reasonably be expected to have taken to be aware of 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
the annual report 
The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge:
• that the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial 
position and proﬁ t of the company and undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
• that the annual report, including the strategic report, includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the company and undertakings 
included in the consolidation as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and
• having taken into account all matters considered by the 
Board and brought to the attention of the Board during the 
year, the Directors consider that the annual report, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in this annual report 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the company’s performance, business model and strategy.

a summary of significant 
accounting policies
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as 
regards the parent company financial statements, UK GAAP 
including FRS 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’, as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further 
described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements section of our report below. We are 
independent of the group and parent company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we 
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to principal risks, going concern 
and viability statement
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
information in the annual report, in relation to which the 
ISAs(UK) require us to report to you whether we have 
anything material to add or draw attention to:
• the disclosures in the annual report set out on pages 28 to 32 
that describe the principal risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ conﬁ rmation set out on page 28 in the annual 
report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the entity, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
• the directors’ statement set out on page 88 in the ﬁ nancial 
statements about whether they considered it appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
them, and their identiﬁ cation of any material uncertainties 
to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the 
ﬁ nancial statements;
• whether the directors’ statement in relation to going concern 
required under the Listing Rules in accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or 
• the directors’ explanation set out on page 33 in the annual 
report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
entity, over what period they have done so and why they 
consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualiﬁ cations or assumptions.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant 
assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due 
to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those 
which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, 
and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters.
The risks noted below are discussed in the Audit Committee 
Report on page 60 and in the accounting policy notes on 
pages 101 to 108.
Risk – revenue recognition 
Description of risk
Given the market focus on the group’s revenue performance 
we consider there to be a risk in relation to the potential 
overstatement of revenue. Management reward and incentive 
schemes based on achieving profit targets may also place 
pressure on management to manipulate revenue recognition.
There is a risk that management may override controls 
to intentionally misstate revenue transactions by recording 
fictitious revenue transactions, either through inappropriate 
manual journal entries or through manipulation of the cut-off 
of revenue transactions in the Brazil business unit where 
judgement is required to determine correct cut-off.
Our response to this risk
•  we understood the group’s revenue recognition policies 
and how they are applied, including the relevant controls;
•  we tested journal entries posted to revenue accounts, 
applying a number of parameters designed to identify 
and test entries that were not in accordance with our 
expectations. This included analysing and selecting 
journals for testing which appeared unusual in nature 
either due to size, preparer or being manually posted. 
We veriﬁ ed the journals to originating documentation 
to conﬁ rm that the entries were valid; 
•  for the GB and Republic of Ireland full scope components, 
which together form 64% of the group’s total revenue, 
we performed data analysis over the entire revenue 
process from revenue recognition through to invoice 
settlement. Where the postings did not follow our 
expectation, we investigated outliers and tested 
these entries to ensure their validity by agreeing 
back to source documentation;
•  we selected a sample of post year end credit notes 
and ensured that, where corroborating evidence 
demonstrated that the credit note related to the audit 
period, these credit notes were appropriately provided 
for in the ﬁ nancial statements; and
•  we performed cut-off  testing for a sample of revenue 
transactions around the period end date, to check that they 
were recognised in the appropriate period with speciﬁ c focus 
on Britvic Brazil where there can be a large time lag between 
the despatch of goods and them reaching their destination.
The above work was performed at all full scope locations.
Within International Standard on Auditing (UK) 240 there 
is a presumption that there are risks of fraud in revenue 
recognition. We therefore evaluated the revenue transactions 
or assertions which give rise to such risk in the current period 
as noted above.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee
Based on our procedures we have not identified evidence of 
inappropriate management override in respect of the amount 
of revenue recorded through either inappropriate journal entries 
or manipulation of the Brazil business unit cut-off estimate. 
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 91
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information Risk – management override of internal controls over
customer claims and other financial items
Description of risk
The risk of material misstatement due to management override 
of controls is considered a risk in every audit. Management has 
the primary responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. We are 
required by professional auditing standards to consider how this 
risk may manifest itself and design appropriate procedures; 
There are a number of judgemental accruals which are 
susceptible to manipulation by management including 
customer claims in GB&I, group wide bonuses and contingent 
liabilities associated with the acquisition of Bela Ischia. 
Our response to this risk
• We performed procedures, including analytical procedures 
and journal entry testing, suffi  cient to address the identiﬁ ed 
risk in respect of subjective areas which were considered 
to be most susceptible to management override.
•  For GB&I customer claims:
 – we held bi-annual discussions with a sample of customer 
account teams directly involved in negotiations with 
customers, including those responsible for the relationship 
with the big supermarkets. Through these discussions we 
understood the current relationship with each customer 
and the status of any claims;
 – we tested the methodology and process by which claims 
have been accrued for appropriateness and consistency 
with the prior year, speciﬁ cally around the process for 
identifying claims which have not been received and 
audited a sample of payments made after the year end 
to audit the accuracy of the accrued amounts; and 
 – we compared the level of aged debt held in relation to 
signiﬁ cant customers to the customer claims provision 
and investigated any additional signiﬁ cant un-provided 
aged debts that did not have a corresponding provision 
within the customer claims provision. 
• For other ﬁ nancial items (including group wide bonuses):
 – we audited the inputs and assumptions into the estimates 
made by management to determine if balanced 
judgements and accurate calculations have been applied; 
 – where possible, we have tested post year payments 
to validate the amounts recorded at the reporting period 
end; and
 – where similar accruals and provisions were held in the 
previous period we compared assumptions used in the 
current period calculations to those used previously and 
tested any changes in assumptions to gain assurance 
that they are appropriate.
•  For the contingent liabilities arising on the acquisition 
of Bela Ischia:
 – we have inspected the contract terms of the sale and 
purchase agreement to understand the nature of any 
items covered by warranties given in the sale and 
purchase agreement;
 – we have traced the gross liabilities through to supporting 
documentation; and
 – we have assessed the appropriateness of the weighted 
average probability applied to the gross liabilities to arrive 
at the fair value.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Based on our procedures, we have identified no instances 
of inappropriate management override in the areas noted.

Risk – management override of internal controls
over discounts
Description of risk
The risk of material misstatement due to management override 
of controls is considered a risk in every audit. Management has 
the primary responsibility to prevent and detect fraud. We are 
required by professional auditing standards to consider how 
this risk may manifest itself and design appropriate procedures. 
Management could manipulate results through incomplete 
recording of expenses and liabilities, including the accounting 
for promotional discounts and long term discounts which are 
deducted from revenue and account development funds that 
are separately classified within selling and distribution costs. 
Our response to this risk
• we obtained an understanding of the group’s processes 
for the recognition and management of discounts provided 
to customers including obtaining an understanding of the 
design of the controls in place within the GB and Ireland 
divisions where such discounts are most prevalent;
• we tested a sample of long term and promotional discount 
expenses and account development fund expenses 
throughout the period and the period end accruals by 
agreeing balances through to supporting documentation 
and ensured that the revenue recognition policies adopted 
complied with IFRS;
• we performed analytical procedures including the correlation 
of revenue to discounts to assess completeness of discounts;
• we performed testing of post year end discounts, both 
settled and recorded, as evidence of the appropriateness 
of discount accruals recognised at the year end;
• we selected a sample of post year end credit notes and 
ensured that, where audit evidence demonstrated that the 
credit note related to the audit period, that these credit notes 
were appropriately provided for in the ﬁ nancial statements;
• we held bi-annual meetings with the customer account 
teams in GB to update our knowledge of the status 
of customer negotiations and the process by which 
discounts have been recorded; and
• we performed targeted journal entry testing at both the 
general ledger and rebate transaction front-end system 
levels. Our testing was focused on manual journal entries 
posted, both to the period end accruals and to the rebate 
income statement accounts, with a particular focus on 
journal entries posted close to the period end.
Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee 
Based on our procedures, we have identified no instances of 
inappropriate management override of the discounts either 
expensed or accrued in the financial statements.
92 www.britvic.com An overview of the scope of our audit
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and 
our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit 
scope for each entity within the group. Taken together, this 
enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the 
organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other 
factors such as Internal audit results when assessing the 
level of work to be performed at each entity
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the 
group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate 
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial 
statements, in addition to auditing the Group level functions, 
we selected eight components covering operations within the 
GB, Ireland, France and Brazil business units within the group.
Of the eight components selected, we performed full audit 
procedures over the financial information of seven components 
(“full scope components”) which were selected based on 
their size or risk characteristics. These components were 
the GB, France and Brazil operations and certain operations 
from the Ireland business. For one further operation within the 
Ireland business (“specific scope component”), we performed 
audit procedures on specific accounts within that component 
that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact 
on the significant accounts in the financial statements either 
because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. 
The reporting components where we performed full or 
specific scope audit procedures accounted for 110% (2016: 
95%) of the group’s profit before tax stated before adjusting 
items, 92% (2016: 96%) of the group’s revenue and 87% 
(2016: 97%) of the group’s total assets. A number of loss 
making components were not assigned a full or specific 
scope which results in our coverage of profit before tax stated 
before adjusting items exceeding 100%. For the current year:
• the full scope components contributed 108% (2016: 105%) 
of the group’s proﬁ t before tax stated before adjusting items, 
91% (2016: 88%) of the group’s revenue and 86% (2016: 
91%) of the Group’s Total assets;
• the speciﬁ c scope component contributed 2% (2016: ((10%)) 
of the group’s proﬁ t before tax stated before adjusting items, 
1% (2016: 8%) of the group’s Revenue and 1% (2016: 6%) of 
the group’s Total assets. The audit scope of this component 
did not include testing of all signiﬁ cant accounts of the 
component but has contributed to the coverage of signiﬁ cant 
accounts tested for the group. 
• for six further components speciﬁ ed procedures were 
performed over certain aspects of the group’s acquisition 
accounting, customer discounts accounting and accounting 
for the group’s operations in the USA. 
Of the remaining components that together represent (10%) of 
the group’s profit before tax stated before adjusting items, none 
are individually greater than +/-5% of the group’s profit before 
tax stated before adjusting items. For these components, we 
performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing 
of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations and 
foreign currency translation recalculations to respond to any 
potential risks of material misstatement to the group financial 
statements, in addition to the specified procedures for 
applicable components as detailed above.

Changes from the prior year 
Our scoping remains unchanged from the prior period with the 
exception of the allocation of a full scope audit for Bela Ischia, 
since this entity was acquired during the period in addition 
to a refinement of our scoping of the International business. 
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken 
at each of the components by us, as the primary audit 
engagement team, or by component auditors from other 
EY global network firms operating under our instruction. 
The senior statutory auditor leads the audit of all full and 
specific components within the GB and Ireland businesses, 
the specified procedures performed in respect of the 
International businesses, in addition to the audit of the group 
functions. These full and specific scope components represent 
65% of group revenue and 96% of the group’s profit before tax. 
The primary team interacted regularly with the remaining 
component teams in Brazil and France where appropriate 
during various stages of the audit, which included reviewing 
the key planning and conclusion deliverables requested by the 
primary team. The Senior Statutory Auditor further participated 
in the Brazil and France component team’s planning including 
the discussion of fraud and error and joined the closing meeting 
calls in both territories.
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing 
the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements 
on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually 
or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence 
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 93
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
TO THE MEMBERS OF BRITVIC PLC 
CONTINUED
the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and 
extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the group to be £8.2 million 
(2016: £7.7 million), which is 5% of profit before tax stated 
before adjusting items (2016: 5% of profit before tax adjusting 
for the exceptional costs associated with the acquisition and 
integration of Britvic Brazil). We believe that profit before tax 
stated before adjusting items is the most relevant measure 
of the underlying financial performance of the group. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level 
the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% 
(2016: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £4.1m 
(2016: £5.8m). We reduced the performance materiality 
factor from 75%, in the prior year, to 50% given there were 
a small number of individually immaterial misstatements 
identified in our prior period audit. 
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of 
obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement 
accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance materiality set for 
each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the group as a whole and our assessment of 
the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, 
the range of performance materiality allocated to components 
was £0.8m to £4.1m (2016: £0.6m to £4.9m). 
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are 
considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.41m 
(2016: £0.39m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light 
of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report set out on pages 1 to 89 and 149 to 154, including 
the Strategic Report, set out on pages 1 to 43, Governance, set 
out on pages 44 to 89, and Additional Information, set out on 
pages 149 to 154, other than the financial statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the 
other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly 
stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, 
our responsibility is to read the other information and, in 
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or 
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine 
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial 
statements or a material misstatement of the other information. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of the other information, 
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard 
to our responsibility to specifically address the following items 
in the other information and to report any uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information where we conclude 
that those items meet the following conditions:
• Fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 89 
– the statement given by the directors that they consider 
the annual report and ﬁ nancial statements taken as a whole 
is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s 
performance, business model and strategy, is materially 
inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or 
• Audit committee reporting set out on pages 58 to 61 – 
the section describing the work of the audit committee does 
not appropriately address matters communicated by us to 
the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code set out on page 50 – the 
parts of the directors’ statement required under the Listing 
Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions speciﬁ ed 
for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 
9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a 
relevant provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course 
of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the ﬁ nancial year for which the ﬁ nancial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements; and 
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been 
prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and 
the parent company and its environment obtained in the course 
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in 
the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities 
statement set out on page 89, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal 
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are 
responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to 
liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered 
capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
The objectives of our audit, in respect to fraud, are; to 
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks 
of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing 
and implementing appropriate responses; and to respond 
appropriately to fraud or suspected fraud identified during the 
audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention 
and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with 
governance of the entity and management. 
Our approach was as follows: 
•  We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined 
that the most signiﬁ cant frameworks which are directly 
relevant to speciﬁ c assertions in the ﬁ nancial statements are 
those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS, FRS 101, 
the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance 
Code) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the 
jurisdictions in which the group operates. In addition, 
we concluded that there are certain signiﬁ cant laws and 
regulations which may have an eff ect on the determination 
of the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements 
being the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, and 
those laws and regulations relating to occupational health 
and safety and data protection. 
•  We understood how the group is complying with those 
frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal 
audit and those responsible for legal and compliance 
procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through our 
review of board minutes, papers provided to the Audit 
Committee and any correspondence received from 
regulatory bodies.
•  We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s ﬁ nancial 
statements to material misstatement, including how fraud 
might occur by meeting with management from various 
parts of the business to understand where it considered 
there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered 
performance targets and their inﬂ uence on eff orts made 
by management to manage earnings or inﬂ uence the 
perceptions of analysts. We considered the programs and 
controls  that the group has established to address risks 
identiﬁ ed, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; 
and how senior management monitors those programs 
and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, 
we performed audit procedures to address each identiﬁ ed 
fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals 
and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that 
the ﬁ nancial statements were free from fraud or error.
• Based on this understanding we designed our audit 
procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws 
and regulations identiﬁ ed in the paragraphs above. Our 
procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on 
manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large 
or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the 
business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, 
internal audit, divisional management and all full and speciﬁ c 
scope management; and focused testing, as referred to in 
the key audit matters section above.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other 
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit 
of the financial statements is located on the
Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.
uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our 
auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address
• Following the recommendation of the audit committee 
after the completion of a competitive tender process, 
we were reappointed as auditors by the shareholders and 
signed an engagement letter dated 16 May 2017. We were 
appointed by the company at the AGM on 31 January 2017 
to audit the ﬁ nancial statements for the 52 week period 
ending 1 October 2017 and subsequent ﬁ nancial periods. 
The period of total uninterrupted engagements including 
previous renewals and reappointments since Britvic became 
a standalone entity upon its ﬂ otation is 12 years, covering 
the 52 week period ending 1 October 2006 to the 52 week 
period ending 1 October 2017.
• The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent 
company during the 52 week period ended 1 October 2017 
and we remain independent of the group and the parent 
company in conducting the audit.

100 www.britvic.com 1. General information
Britvic plc (the ’company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. It is a public limited company domiciled 
in England & Wales and its ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange. Britvic plc and its subsidiaries (together the ‘group’) operate 
in the soft drinks manufacturing and distribution industry, principally in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France and Brazil.
The financial year represents 52 weeks ended 1 October 2017 (prior financial year 53 weeks ended 2 October 2016). 
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 28 November 2017.
2. Statement of compliance
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union 
(IFRS), as they apply to the financial statements of the group. 
3. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except where measurement of balances at fair value is required 
as explained below. The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the 
company, and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The directors are confident that it is appropriate for the going concern basis to be adopted in preparing the financial statements. As at 1 October 2017, 
the consolidated balance sheet is showing a net assets position of £339.3m (2 October 2016: net assets of £281.0m).
Group reserves are low due to the capital restructuring undertaken at the time of flotation. This does not impact on Britvic plc’s ability to make 
dividend payments.
The liquidity of the group remains strong, the group has a £400.0m bank facility, on which the group had drawn down £22.3m as at 1 October 2017, 
with an extended maturity date of November 2021, and £645.0m of private placement notes which have maturity dates between 2017 and 2032.
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of the group incorporate the financial information of the company and the entities controlled by the company 
(its subsidiaries) in accordance with IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. Control is achieved when the company:
• Has the power over the investee;
• Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• Has the ability to use its power to aff ect its returns.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date the group gains control or up to the date control ceases respectively. 
Change in accounting policy
The group has made a change to its accounting policies in the current period. Specifically the group has removed the separable classification of 
exceptional items from the consolidated income statement.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured, 
regardless of when payment is being made.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and accepted by customers, when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
have passed to the buyer and the amount can be measured reliably.
Revenue is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between subsidiaries, after the deduction of sales related discounts and rebates, 
value added tax and other sales related taxes. Sales related discounts comprise:
• Long term discounts and rebates – which are sales incentives to customers to encourage them to purchase increased volumes and are related 
to total volumes purchased and sales growth
• Short term promotional discounts – which are directly related to promotions run by customers
Where sales related rebates and discounts are earned, management make an accrual where it is probable that the rebate will be earned by the 
customer. Accruals are made for each individual promotion or rebate based on the specific terms and conditions of the customer agreement. 
Management make estimates on an ongoing basis to assess customer performance and sales volume to calculate total amounts earned to be 
recorded as deductions from revenue.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 101
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
3. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost comprises the aggregate amount 
paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset and includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of 
operating as intended. 
Assets under construction are carried at cost. Depreciation of these assets commences when they are ready for use.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of an asset, less its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis, over the useful economic 
life of that asset as follows:
Plant and machinery       3 to 20 years
Vehicles (included in plant and machinery)     5 to 7 years
Equipment in retail outlets (included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment) 5 to 10 years
Other fixtures and fittings (included in fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment) 3 to 10 years
Land is not depreciated.
Freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years.
Leasehold properties are depreciated over 50 years, or over the unexpired lease term when this is less than 50 years.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount, and are included 
in the consolidated income statement in the period of derecognition.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount. Useful lives and residual amounts are 
reviewed annually and where adjustments are required these are made prospectively.
Non-current assets held for sale
The group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than 
continuing use. Such non-current assets as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately beneath current items in the consolidated balance sheet.
Business combinations and goodwill
While the original acquisition of Britannia Soft Drinks Limited was accounted for under the merger method, business combinations on or after 
4 October 2004 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred 
in a business combination is measured at fair value which includes recording deferred consideration at discounted values where the impact of 
discounting is material.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess 
of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition 
below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the consolidated income statement in the period 
of acquisition.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
102 www.britvic.com 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets
Software costs
Software expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated. Acquired 
computer software licences and software developed in-house are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. Costs include resources focussed on delivery of capital projects where the choice has been made to use internal resources rather than 
external resources. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years on a straight line basis.
Trademarks, franchise rights and customer lists
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at the fair value of consideration paid. Following initial recognition, intangible 
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation or impairment losses. An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is 
recognised outside goodwill, at fair value at the date of acquisition, if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair 
value can be measured reliably.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives on a straight-line 
basis over a period appropriate to the asset’s useful life.
The carrying values of intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are also tested for impairment annually either individually or, if the intangible asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs. 
Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite 
life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Research and development
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset when the group can demonstrate:
• The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use
• Its intention to complete and its ability to use the asset
• How the asset will generate future economic beneﬁ ts
• The availability of resources to complete the asset
• The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development
• The ability to use the intangible asset generated
Following initial recognition of development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected 
future benefit. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. For all remaining intangible assets the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. Where impairment testing for an asset is required, the group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount 
or the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs if it does not generate largely independent cash flows. 
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying 
amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects senior management’s 
estimate of the cost of capital. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the consolidated income statement in those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist 
or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that 
is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Goodwill impairment losses 
cannot subsequently be reversed.
Inventories and work in progress
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and 
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined using the weighted 
average cost method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred 
in marketing, selling and distribution.
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 103
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
3. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial assets
The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured 
at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for those financial assets not subsequently measured 
at fair value through profit or loss. The group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired.
Loans and receivables
The group has financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value 
through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money 
is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement when loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30-90 day terms, are recognised at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Provision is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable. Balances are written off when the probability of recovery 
is assessed as being remote. 
Fair value
The group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
• In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The fair value of an asset or liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, 
assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
The group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstance and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, 
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, 
described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the group determines whether transfers have occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign 
currency and interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives 
are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. 
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness 
will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the consolidated income 
statement. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship, as follows:
104 www.britvic.com 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Derivative financial instruments and hedging (continued)
Cash flow hedges
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the 
asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
consolidated income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its 
designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction 
occurs and are then transferred to the consolidated income statement or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability 
as above. 
Net investment hedges
Financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the group’s net investment in foreign operations. Some of the 
group’s foreign currency borrowings qualify as hedging instruments that hedge foreign currency net investment balances. The effective portion of 
gains or losses on translation of borrowings designated as net investment hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Upon disposal of the associated investment in foreign operations any 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recycled through the consolidated income statement.
Fair value hedges
Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on 
the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the consolidated income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the 
hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the hedge relationship 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying 
amount would be amortised to the consolidated income statement based on a recalculated effective interest rate. The fair value gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument would continue to be recorded in the consolidated income statement.
Derecognition of financial instruments
The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire, or when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows have either been transferred or an obligation has been assumed to pass them through to a third party and the group does not retain 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset.
Financial liabilities are only derecognised when they are extinguished, that is, when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. Fair value is 
determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance 
conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares (‘market conditions’).
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance 
conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative 
expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has 
expired and the number of equity instruments that, in the opinion of the Directors and based on the best available estimate at that date, will ultimately 
vest (or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described below). The consolidated income statement 
charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which 
are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Taxation
The current income tax expense is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods. It is calculated using 
taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid 
to the taxation authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from accelerated capital allowances, intangible assets, provisions for pensions and other post-retirement 
benefits, provisions for share-based payments and unutilised losses incurred in overseas jurisdictions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability will be settled based on the tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time 
is recognised as a finance cost.

Pensions and post retirement benefits
The group operates a number of pension schemes. These include both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans
The defined benefit pension liability or asset in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The cost of providing benefits is determined using 
the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period.
Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected 
immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.
Past service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the 
discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. 
Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:
• Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);
• Net interest expense or income; and
• Remeasurement.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the deficit or surplus in the group’s defined benefit plans. 
Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or 
reductions in future contributions to the plans.
Defined contribution plans
Under defined contribution plans, contributions payable for the period are charged to the consolidated income statement as an operating expense.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses and paid annual leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employees 
of the group.
Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases by the group. Leases in which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Any lease incentives 
received are credited to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases to which they relate.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, on demand deposits with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings
Interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income 
and finance cost.
On a refinancing any unamortised financing charges are accelerated through the consolidated income statement.
106 www.britvic.com 3. Accounting policies (continued)
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in pounds sterling. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements 
is the same as the functional currency of the company. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items, included in the 
financial statements of each entity, are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement, 
except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences in monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the group’s net investment in a 
foreign operation. These are taken in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in 
the consolidated income statement.
Foreign operations
The consolidated income statement and statement of cash flows of foreign operations are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period. 
The balance sheet is translated at the rate ruling at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on opening net assets and arising on the translation 
of results at an average rate compared to a closing rate are both recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the 
accumulated exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement. 
Certain of the group’s financial instruments are classified as net investment hedges when they hedge the group’s net investment in foreign operations. 
See derivative financial instruments and hedging policy above for further detail.
Issued share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, 
net of tax, from the proceeds.
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity.
New standards adopted in the current period
During the period, the group did not adopt any new standards.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The group has not applied the following IFRSs, which may be applicable to the group, that have been issued (although in some cases not yet adopted 
by the EU) but are not yet effective:
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Effective date – 
periods commencing 
on or after
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019

The group is currently confirming the impacts of the above new standards and interpretations on its results, balance sheet and cash flows, 
which are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements with the exception of the following standards;
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 107
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
3. Accounting policies (continued)
IFRS 9: Financial Instruments; The new standard will impact the way the group accounts for certain financial assets and liabilities. None of these 
changes are expected to be material. 
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, establishes a comprehensive framework for determining and recognising revenue and is 
effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard is therefore mandatory for the group for the accounting 
period starting 1 October 2018. The group however intends to adopt this standard early, from the accounting period starting 2 October 2017 
with full retrospective application. 
The group has completed its assessment of the impact of adoption of IFRS 15 on its consolidated financial statements. The main impact of 
adopting the standard is a reclassification of certain rebates offered to customers that had previously been recognised as selling and distribution 
costs to revenue and the reclassification of certain incentives received, from revenue, to cost of sales. Adoption of the standard is expected to 
have no impact on profit before tax.
The impact of this standard on the group if it had been adopted in the current year would have been a reduction in revenue of £110.3m with a 
decrease in cost of sales of £57.1m, a decrease in selling and distribution costs of £52.3m and a decrease in administration expenses of £0.9m. 
Further disclosures will be provided in the 2018 Interims and 2018 Annual Report in respect of the transitional effect of IFRS 15 in addition to 
updated accounting policies and impact on relevant KPIs.
IFRS 16: Leases; The new standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities on 
the balance sheet for all applicable leases. The group is in the process of assessing the impact of the standard which is likely to result in material changes 
to EBITDA and finance costs but is not expected to have a material impact on profit before tax. In addition there is expected to be a material increase in 
property, plant and equipment with a corresponding increase in loans and borrowings as applicable leases are brought onto the balance sheet. 
4. Key judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of 
estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. In the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management 
has made the following judgements and estimates which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Judgements
Franchise rights
Franchise rights represent franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provides long term rights 
to distribute certain soft drinks. These agreements were allocated a 35 year useful economic life at the time of acquisition based on a third party 
assessment. As at 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 25 years. The franchise agreement itself has a remaining 
contract life of 8 years which is less than the useful economic life. The useful economic life has been determined on the basis that the renewal of 
the franchise agreements, without significant cost, is highly probable. Evidence to support this conclusion is:
•  Signiﬁ cant emphasis on maintaining a strong relationship with Pepsi, strengthened through the addition of Pepsico products to Britvic’s portfolio 
in recent years;
• Lack of alternative suppliers; and
• High barriers of entry to the Irish soft drinks bottling market. 
Intangible assets with indefinite lives
Management have made a judgement that certain intangible assets relating to brands have indefinite lives.
It is expected that the trademarks with indefinite lives will be held and supported for an indefinite period of time and are expected to generate 
economic benefits. The group is committed to supporting its trademarks and invests in significant consumer marketing promotional spend.
Estimates 
Post-retirement benefits
The determination of the pension and other post-retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent 
actuarial advice. The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, mortality and other demographic assumptions. 
These key assumptions are disclosed in note 22.
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill has been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable 
discount rate in order to calculate present value. Further details are given in note 15.
108 www.britvic.com 5. Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief 
operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified 
as the board of directors of the company. The acquisitions of Bela Ischia and East Coast during the current period (see note 31) have been included 
in the Brazil and Ireland segments respectively.
For management purposes, the group is organised into business units and has six reportable segments as follows:
• GB stills – United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland
• GB carbs – United Kingdom excluding Northern Ireland
• Ireland – Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
• France
• Brazil
• International
These business units sell soft drinks into their respective markets.
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and 
performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on brand contribution. This is defined as revenue less material costs and 
all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the sale of a given product. Such costs include brand specific 
advertising and promotion costs, raw materials and marginal production and distribution costs. However, group financing (including finance costs) 
and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to reportable segments.
Transfer prices between reportable segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

(27 .2) (37 .4)
Effective income tax rate 19.6% 24.6%
Permanent differences have increased in comparison to the prior year due to additional capital expenditure for the business capability programme.
A one-off deferred tax credit has arisen in the period as a result of a reduction in the enacted French corporate income tax rate from 33.33% to 28%. 
The deferred tax balances have been re-measured based on the tax rate expected to apply on reversal.
The reduction in overseas tax rate difference reflect changing profit mix arising from overseas profits. The pre-adjusted effective tax rate for future 
periods will continue to be impacted by the profit mix arising from the group’s operations.
In comparison to the prior year, there is a reduction in the level of current year losses in respect of which a deferred tax asset has not been 
recognised, primarily due to the closure of loss-making Indian business in the prior year.

d) Uncertain tax positions
Uncertainties in relation to tax liabilities have been provided for in the tax payable account to the extent that it is considered probable that the group 
will be required to settle a tax liability in the future. Settlement of tax provisions could potentially result in future cash tax payments however these 
are not expected to result in an increased tax charge as they have been fully provided for in accordance with management’s best estimates of the 
most likely outcomes.
e) Unrecognised tax items
The Group considers that there will be no direct or withholding tax consequences of future remittances of earnings from overseas subsidiaries and 
therefore that no temporary difference arises in respect of its overseas investments. Accordingly, there is no amount of deferred tax provided or 
unprovided in respect of investments in subsidiaries.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of losses that have arisen in both Ireland and Brazil. In relation to the latter, a deferred tax asset 
of £7.3m has been recognised in respect of losses and other temporary differences in an entity where losses have been made in the current period. 
These are expected to be recoverable on an ongoing basis due to anticipated increases in profits in subsequent periods. All existing tax losses may 
be carried forward indefinitely, however in Brazil losses may only be utilised to the extent of 30% of taxable profit in each year.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of further unused losses of £5.7m (2016 £8.3m).

g) Impact of rate change
A further progressive decrease in the French tax rate from 28% to 25% has been announced but not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
The expected impact in 2018 will be a reduction in the deferred tax liabilities of £2.3m. 
In the UK there have been announcements on restricting loss relief and interest deductibility but the relevant Finance Act 2017 has not been enacted 
at the balance sheet date. There is no impact anticipated as a result of the changes in legislation.
11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be 
issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

Trademarks
Britvic Ireland and Britvic France
All trademarks have been allocated an indefinite life by management. A list of the trademarks held in respect of the Britvic Ireland and Britvic France 
segments is shown in note 15.
Britvic Brazil
Trademarks in Brazil have been allocated useful economic lives of 14.3 – 14.8 years. As at 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a average remaining 
useful life of 12.9 years. The trademark from the acquisition of Bela Ischia in the current period has been included in the balance for Britvic Brazil. 
Franchise rights 
Franchise rights represent franchise agreements acquired as part of the Britvic Ireland business combination which provides long term rights to 
distribute certain soft drinks. These agreements were allocated a 35 year useful economic life at the time of acquisition based on a third party 
assessment. As at 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 25 years. The franchise agreement itself has a remaining 
contract life of 8 years which is less than the useful economic life. The useful economic life has been determined on the basis that the renewal of 
the franchise agreements, without significant cost, is highly probable. 
Evidence to support this conclusion is:
•  Signiﬁ cant emphasis on maintaining a strong relationship with Pepsi, strengthened through the addition of Pepsico products to Britvic’s portfolio 
in recent years;
• Lack of alternative suppliers; and
• High barriers of entry to the Irish soft drinks bottling market. 
In the unlikely event that it was deemed that the contract might not be renewed then the useful economic life would need to be reduced to its 
remaining contractual life. As at 1 October 2017 this would increase the annual amortisation for franchise rights by £1.6m to £2.3m.

Customer lists
Britvic France
Customer lists recognised on the acquisition of Britvic France relate to those customer relationships acquired. These intangible assets have been 
allocated useful economic lives of 20 years. At 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of 13 years.
Britvic Ireland
Customer lists represent those customer relationships acquired which are valued in respect of the grocery and wholesale businesses. These 
customer lists have been allocated useful economic lives of between 10 and 20 years. At 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining 
useful life of between 1 and 10 years. During the current period customer lists from the East Coast acquisition have been recognised in Britvic Ireland.
Britvic Brazil
Customer lists recognised on acquisitions in Britvic Brazil relate to those customer relationships acquired from the acquisitions of Ebba and Bela Ischia. 
These intangible assets have been allocated useful economic lives of between 4 and 9 years. At 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a 
remaining useful life of between 2 and 8 years.
Software costs
Software is capitalised at cost. As at 1 October 2017 these intangible assets have a remaining useful life of up to 7 years.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’. Further detail is provided in 
note 15.
Intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Britvic Ireland, Britvic France and Britvic Brazil are valued in local currency and translated to sterling 
at the reporting date.

15. Impairment testing of intangible assets (continued)
Trademarks with indefinite lives were recognised as part of the fair value exercises relating to the 2007 acquisition of Britvic Ireland and the 2010 
acquisition of Britvic France. They were allocated by senior management to the individual cash-generating units for impairment testing as shown 
in the table above.
Goodwill in Brazil comprises goodwill relating to the acquisition of Ebba and Bela Ischia. Management consider this to be a single CGU based on the 
integration of Bela Ischia into the overall Britvic Brazil business and the presentation of Britvic Brazil results to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
Method of impairment testing
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
Impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets are undertaken by senior management annually. Value in use calculations are performed for 
each cash-generating unit using cash flow projections and are based on the latest annual financial budgets prepared by senior management and 
approved by the board of directors. Senior management expectations are formed in line with performance to date and experience, as well as available 
external market data.
Discount rates reflect senior management’s estimate of the pre-tax cost of capital adjusted where necessary to reflect the different risks of different 
countries in which the group operates. The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance 
and to evaluate future capital investment proposals. The group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate 
discount rate to use in impairment testing. The same discount rate is relevant to all CGUs in each country as the group only operates in the soft drinks 
manufacturing and distribution market sector. The applicable pre-tax discount rate for cash flow projections is:
At 1 October 
2017
At 2 October 
2016
Britvic GB 7 .1% 9.4%
Britvic Ireland 8.1% 8.4%
Britvic France 8.1% 10.9%
Britvic Brazil 12.8% 17 .9%
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations
The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake impairment testing of goodwill.
Volume growth rates – reflect senior management expectations of volume growth based on growth achieved to date, current strategy and expected 
market trends and will vary according to each CGU.
Marginal contribution – being revenue less material costs and all other marginal costs that management considers to be directly attributable to the 
sale of a given product. Marginal contribution is based on financial budgets approved by the Britvic plc board. Key assumptions are made within 
these budgets about pricing, discounts and costs based on historical data, current strategy and expected market trends.
Advertising and promotional spend – financial budgets approved by senior management are used to determine the value assigned to advertising 
and promotional spend. This is based on the planned spend for year one and strategic intent thereafter.
Raw materials price, production and distribution costs, selling costs and other overhead inflation – the basis used to determine the value assigned 
to inflation is the forecast increase in consumer price indices in the relevant market. This has been used in all value in use calculations performed.
Cash flows are based on the latest approved budgets and forecasts (in most cases this is periods beyond one year). The applicable long term 
growth rates are:
At 1 October 
2017
At 2 October 
2016
Britvic GB 2.2% 2.1%
Britvic Ireland 2.0% 2.7%
Britvic France 1.7% 1 .6%
Britvic Brazil 2.9% 2.9%
Intangible assets with finite lives
No indicators of impairment were identified on intangible assets with finite lives and no impairment was recognised against these assets.
Results and conclusions
During the 52 week period ended 1 October 2017 an impairment of £4.4m was made on the Fruité trademark in Britvic France and an impairment 
of £2.2m was made on the Britvic Brand in Britvic Ireland. Additionally £9.2m of impairment from prior years was reversed on the Ballygowan brand 
in Britvic Ireland. In 2016 no impairments were identified.
Other than for the goodwill held in Britvic Brazil the directors do not consider that a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate 
the value in use of remaining goodwill and intangible assets would result in any impairment. For Britvic Brazil there is a high degree of uncertainty in 
the general economic climate and future growth rates of the country. A reduction in the long term growth rate from 2.9% to 0.7% would result in an 
impairment charge of £0.3m.

The group takes the following factors into account when considering whether a provision for impairment should be made for trade receivables:
• Payment performance history; and 
• External information available regarding credit ratings.

During the year, short-term deposits are made for varying periods depending on the immediate cash requirements of the group, and earn interest 
at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is equal to the book value.
At 1 October 2017 the group had available £377.7m (2016: £286.5m) of un-drawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions 
precedent had been met. These facilities have a maturity date of November 2021.
Where available, the group operates cash pooling arrangements whereby the net cash position across a number of accounts is recognised for 
interest purposes.

GB Schemes
The group’s principal pension scheme for GB employees, the Britvic Pension Plan (‘BPP’) has both a final salary defined benefit section and defined 
contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to new members from 1 August 2002 and closed to future accrual for active members 
from 1 April 2011, with active members moving to the defined contribution section for future service benefits.
The BPP is a limited partner of Britvic Scottish Limited Partnership (‘Britvic SLP’), which in turn is a limited partner in both Britvic Property Partnership 
(‘Britvic PP’) and Britvic Brands LLP . Britvic SLP , Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP are all consolidated by the group. The investment held by BPP does 
not represent a plan asset for accounting purposes and is therefore not included in the fair value of the plan assets.
Certain properties and group brands have been transferred to Britvic PP and Britvic Brands LLP respectively, all of which are leased back to Britvic 
Soft Drinks Limited. The group retains operational flexibility over the properties and brands including the ability to substitute the properties and brands 
held by Britvic PP and Britvic Brands respectively. The BPP is entitled to a share of the profits in Britvic SLP until 2026. At the end of this period, the 
partnership capital allocated to the BPP will be changed to an amount equal to any funding deficit of the BPP at this time, up to a maximum of £105m.
Contributions are paid into the defined benefit section of the BPP as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the company and certified by an independent 
actuary in the Schedule of Contributions. In addition to the expected partnership income of at least £5m per annum, the group will make a payment to 
the BPP of £14.866m by 31 December 2017. Additional contributions of £15m per annum by 31 December in the years 2018 and 2019 will be made 
due to the formal actuarial valuation in 2016 revealing these contributions are necessary to help return the BPP to full funding on a self-sufficiency 
basis by 31 March 2026. During this year £20.0m of additional contributions were paid to the BPP , of which £15.0m was paid by the group and £5.0m 
relates to income received from the pension funding partnership (‘PFP’) structure. 
The contributions required are determined based on the secondary funding deficit revealed at the last triennial actuarial funding valuation, currently at 
31 March 2016. The secondary funding deficit will always differ from the accounting valuation surplus/deficit above.
122 www.britvic.com 22. Pensions (continued)
Accounting standards require all companies to discount their projected cashflows at a standard rate based on high quality corporate bonds and not 
to allow for prudence when calculating the value of the liabilities. This is in contrast to the funding valuation where prudence is a requirement when 
assessing the value of the liabilities. This, in combination with the Plan being invested in relatively low risk assets as part of the funding strategy 
agreed, results in the funding valuation being expected to show a higher deficit than the accounting valuation. The benefits of adopting a low risk 
approach to funding is that there is less volatility expected in the Company’s future contribution requirements.
In addition when comparing the surplus/deficit, consideration of the different dates of the valuations need to be taken into account. The accounting 
valuation is assessed at the current balance sheet date of 1 October 2017, whereas the contributions agreed were based on the funding valuation at 
31 March 2016.
Britvic’s business in GB also has a secured unfunded, unregistered retirement benefit scheme called The Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme 
(‘BETUS’) which provides benefits for members who have historically exceeded the Earnings Cap, or the Lifetime Allowance whilst members 
of the defined benefit section of the BPP . BETUS closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011 which coincided with the closure of the defined benefit 
section of the BPP . 
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the BPP defined contribution scheme in the consolidated income statement for 2017 was 
£10.6m (2016: £12.0m).
Republic of Ireland scheme
The Britvic Ireland Pension Plan (‘BIPP’) is a defined benefit pension plan. Following legislative changes made in 2012 no deficit recovery contributions 
are currently required. The Trustee has been undertaking investment de-risking to protect the on-going funding position achieved as a result of the 
2012 changes. The latest triennial valuation was carried out as at 1 January 2015. The scheme remains open to future accrual for current members.
The amount recognised as an expense in relation to the Irish defined contribution schemes in the consolidated income statement for 2017 was 
£0.8m (2016: £0.7m).
Northern Ireland scheme
The Britvic Northern Ireland Pension Plan (‘BNIPP’) is a defined benefit pension plan which was closed to new members on 28 February 2006, and 
since this date new employees have been eligible to join a Stakeholder plan with Legal & General. The latest formal actuarial valuation for contribution 
purposes was carried out as at 31 December 2014. 
Contributions are paid into the BNIPP as determined by the Trustee, agreed by the company and certified by an independent actuary in the Schedule 
of Contributions. Additional contributions of £1.5m per annum will be paid on a monthly basis up to 30 June 2022. The scheme remains open to 
future accrual for current members.
France schemes
Britvic France operates two defined benefit schemes: in the first, employees receive long-service cash payments at various stages throughout 
their careers. From the second, employees receive a lump sum at retirement. Payment amounts are dependent upon salary and service with the 
company. The schemes are unfunded therefore these benefits are paid directly as they fall due.
All group pension schemes are administered by trustees who are independent of the group’s finances, except for the Britvic France schemes which 
are operated directly by the company.
IFRIC 14
IFRIC 14 is applicable for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008. For the GB schemes the Trustee of the Plan previously made a 
change to the Rules of the Plan to clarify that any surplus may be returned directly to the Company without prior Trustee approval on the death or 
leaving of the final member of the Plan. Furthermore, any such refund should be treated as income for tax purposes. These two points should mean 
that IFRIC 14 does not have any practical impact on the Plan and so no allowance for it (and, in particular, no allowance for the asset ceiling) has been 
made in the calculated figures. BETUS is treated as unfunded for the purposes of IAS 19, so IFRIC 14 is not applicable. 
For the Northern Ireland scheme the group has determined that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus from the Plan again on the final 
member leaving the plan and therefore the group has recognised the attributable IAS 19 surplus in full.
Changes to IFRIC 14 have been proposed which may change the assessment of how this interpretation is applied and may result in a cap being placed 
on the amount of surplus that can be recognised in the balance sheet. The group will consider the impact of these changes once they have been 
finalised and a revised IFRIC issued.

The curtailment/settlement gain in the current and prior period arose due to the retirement of executives and the exchange of their benefits in the 
BETUS for a cash lump sum recognised in administration expenses. The past service cost gain during the prior period arose on the GB scheme due 
to a Pension Increase Exchange that was offered to members, in which members were given the option to exchange pensions which will receive 
future inflationary increases, for a higher pension now which will not increase in future.
Other than stated below, the net expense detailed above is recognised in arriving at net profit from continuing operations before tax and finance

* These assets were previously shown in UK equities, fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts but have been reclassified to liability-driven

The fair values of the above equity and debt instruments are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets whereas the fair values 
of properties are not based on quoted market prices. The fixed interest and index linked asset classes include leveraged gilt funds.
Liability-driven investments are a portfolio of assets used in the GB scheme to hedge the the exposure to changes in interest rates and inflation. 
It consists of equities, fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts including leveraged gilt funds. The fair value of these assets is derived from quoted 
market prices of the underlying funds held. These funds are held as part of the strategy by the trustees of the GB scheme to invest in low risk 
assets that provide a hedge against interest rates and inflation.
Normal contributions of £1.1m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2018 financial year.
Additional contributions of £21.5m are expected to be paid into the defined benefit pension schemes during the 2018 financial year, of which 
£16.5m is expected to be paid by the group and £5.0m by the partnership.
Risks
For defined contribution sections and plans, the group’s liability is limited to the requirement to pay contributions on behalf of each employee. 
In these arrangements the associated risks are borne by the members.
For defined benefit sections and plans, the group bears the risks of operation. The main risk that the group runs in respect of the defined benefit 
schemes is that additional contributions are required to pay for the benefits if investment returns are not sufficient. The contributions required for 
the schemes are in general determined at each triennial actuarial funding valuation. The key factors that will affect the need for additional contributions 
include levels of long-term inflation and interest rates and the assessment of how long members are expected to live, along with the level of investment 
return achieved. The level of investment return achieved is subject to a range of risks typical of the asset classes held, in particular market risk on 
equities, credit risk on corporate bonds and exposure to the property market. The discount rates used to calculate the liabilities are set by reference 
to yields on high quality corporate bonds. There is therefore a mismatch between the assets held and the way that the liabilities are calculated, 
meaning that the net balance sheet position disclosed under IAS 19 could fluctuate.
For the BPP , the trustee holds the power to determine the contribution rates that the group should pay, although the group fully uses the opportunity 
to make representation to the trustee on this point. The trustee of the BPP agreed to implement an investment strategy which consists of a diverse 
range of fixed interest and index-linked securities, which will provides a significant hedge against inflation and interest rate risk. The intention is to 
continue to remove equities from the investment portfolio to further reduce investment risk.
The funding partnership mitigates the risk that additional cash contributions will be required after 31 March 2026, as the partnership will pay up to 
£105m to remove any funding deficit at 31 March 2026.

24. Financial risk management objectives and policies
Overview
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents. These financial 
instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under 
the group’s employee incentive schemes. Other financial instruments which arise directly from the group’s operations include trade receivables 
and payables (see notes 17 and 23 respectively).
It is, and has always been, the group’s policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Additionally, 
the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk. The board of directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as 
summarised below.
Interest rate risk
The group’s policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The group enters into interest rate swaps, cross 
currency swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 1 October 2017 after taking into account the effect of these 
instruments, approximately 66% of the group’s borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (2016: 55%).
Interest rate risk table
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the group’s 
profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings) and equity (through the change in fair values of applicable derivative instruments).

Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is primarily in respect of exposure to fluctuations to the sterling-euro, sterling-US dollar, euro-US dollar and sterling-Brazilian 
real rates of exchange. The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and finances these partly through the use of foreign currency 
borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign operations. Additionally cash generation from 
euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in currencies other than 
the functional currency of the individual group entities. Non-functional currency purchases and interest costs are mainly in the currencies of US dollars 
and euros. As at 1 October 2017 the group has hedged 75% (2016: 74%) of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign 
exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert 
the cash flows to the required currency. These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar, euro and Brazilian real exchange rates, with all other 
variables held constant, of the group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities) and the group’s equity (due 
to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts).

Credit risk
The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties. It is the group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are 
subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the group’s experience 
of bad debts is not significant. The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 17. There are no significant concentrations of credit 
risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial 
instruments. This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained 
by either Moody’s, Standard & Poors or Fitch. The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy. 
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the group’s banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk
The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being polyethylene terephthalate (PET), sugar, steel and frozen concentrated 
orange juice. The group does not enter into derivative contracts to hedge commodity price risk however in the normal course of business where 
it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into fixed price contracts with suppliers to protect against unfavourable commodity 
price changes. 
Share schemes equity price risk
The group operates several employee incentive share schemes. It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in 
the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan. To hedge this risk the group has entered into equity derivatives against future scheme maturities.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables held constant, 
of the group’s profit before tax (due to changes in the fair value of the equity derivatives).

Liquidity risk
The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash flow forecasts. These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial 
investments and financial assets (e.g. accounts receivable and other financial assets) and projected cash flows from operations. The objective 
of the group’s liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and flexibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts 
and long term private placement issuance. 
The group’s bank facility has a maturity of November 2021 and is unsecured. As at 1 October 2017, the group had drawn down £22.3m 
(2016: £113.5m) under this facility. In addition to this facility the group had £1.4m of outstanding external borrowings all of which were 
secured (2016: £1.6m all of which were secured).

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Hierarchy
The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is Level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. Forward currency 
contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the 
contracts. Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on quoted 
forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and 
yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance 
risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading counterparties. 
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values, except 
for fixed rate borrowings.
The fair value of the group’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans at 1 October 2017 was £601.8m (2016: £690.3m) compared to 
a carrying value of £591.4m (2016: £661.3m). The fair value of the group’s fixed rate interest-bearing borrowings and loans are determined by 
using discounted cash flow methods using discount rates that reflect the group’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. 
Capital management
The group defines ‘capital’ as being net debt plus equity. The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern and maintain an appropriate capital structure to balance the needs of the group to grow, whilst operating with sufficient headroom 
within its bank covenants.
The following table summarises the capital of the group:

Cash and cash equivalents (82.5) (205.9)

Adjusted net debt 502.9 416.4
Equity 339.3 281 .0
Capital 842.2 697 .4
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or in order to facilitate acquisitions. 
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group has a number of options available to it including modifying dividend payments to shareholders, 
returning capital to shareholders or issuing new shares. In this way, the group balances returns to shareholders between long term growth and 
current returns whilst maintaining capital discipline in relation to investing activities and taking any necessary action on costs to respond to the 
current environment.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the adjusted net debt/EBITDA ratio. Adjusted net debt is calculated as being the net of cash and cash 
equivalents, interest bearing loans and borrowings and the element of the fair value of interest rate currency swaps hedging the balance sheet 
value of the US private placement notes. Adjusted net debt is shown in note 28. The adjusted net debt/EBITDA ratio enables the group to plan 
its capital requirements in the medium term. The group uses this measure to provide useful information to financial institutions and investors.

Equity derivatives – equity forwards
The group operates several employee incentive share schemes. It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased 
in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan. The group has equity forwards against schemes that mature in December 2017 .
Derivatives designated as part of hedge relationships
As at 1 October 2017 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Forward currency contracts 
The forward currency contracts hedge the expected future purchases in the period to March 2019 and have been assessed as part of effective cash 
flow hedge relationships as at 1 October 2017.
Cross currency interest rate swaps 
USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps
The group has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the 2007, 2010 and 2014 USPP Notes. These cross currency interest 
rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest payable. The cross currency interest 
rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP Notes. 
The maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 21.
During the year the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and and this showed no ineffectiveness in the current period (2016: £0.4m gain) 
to be recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.

Fair value hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps
The group has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps in respect of the 2009 and 2010 USPP Notes. These instruments swap the principal 
and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling (the ‘2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps’). The cross currency 
interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the consolidated income 
statement, with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective. 
The decrease in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of £10.3m (2016: £29.7m increase) has been recognised in 
finance costs and offset with a similar gain on the borrowings of £10.8m (2016: £30.2m loss). The net gain of £0.5m (2016: £0.5m loss) represents 
the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.
Net investment hedges
2009 and 2010 GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps
These instruments swap sterling liabilities arising from the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps into euro liabilities and 
have been designated as part of effective hedges of the net investments in Britvic France and Britvic Ireland.
The GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps, along with the underlying loan instruments, are being used to hedge the group’s exposure 
to foreign exchange risk on these euro investments. Movements in the fair value of the GBP EUR cross currency interest rate swaps are taken 
to equity where they offset foreign exchange movements on the translation of the net investments in Britvic France and Britvic Ireland.
No ineffectiveness has been recognised in the consolidated income statement (2016: £nil).

27. Share-based payments
Britvic operates a broad base of employee plans as well as executive plans. In GB Britvic operates SIP plans for all employees, whereas outside 
of GB Britvic operates both share-settled and cash-settled plans. Executives participate in ESOP and PSP plans and senior leadership team 
participates in PSP plans.
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2017 , 
including national insurance is £6.3m (2016: £6.6m). This expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based 
payment transactions. 
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’)
The SIP is an all-employee HMRC approved share plan open to employees based in GB. Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share 
award, where granted by the group, provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date. 
Employees can’t sell these shares for three years from their date of award. Employees also have the opportunity to invest up to £138 every 4 weeks 
(£1,800 per year) through the partnership share scheme. This is deducted from their gross salary. Matching shares are offered on the basis of one 
free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participant’s savings, up to a maximum of £50 (2016: £50) per four week pay period.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below. The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.

The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan (‘ESOP’)
The ESOP allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to executives. The option price is the average market price of Britvic plc’s shares 
on the three business days before the date of grant. Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain 
exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
Options granted in 2017
The performance condition requires the increase in EPS of 3% – 8% pa compound over a three year performance period for the options to vest. 
If the EPS growth is 3%, 20% of the options will vest, with full vesting at 8% EPS growth. Straight-line apportionment will be applied between 
these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if the EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
Options granted in 2016
The performance condition requires the increase in EPS of 6% – 12% pa compound over a three year performance period for the options to vest. 
If the EPS growth is 6%, 20% of the options will vest, with full vesting at 12% EPS growth. Straight-line apportionment will be applied between 
these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if the EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his/her option may receive a cash payment rather than 
the ordinary shares under option. The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option 
exceeds the option price. However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.

Outstanding at 1 October 2017 4,965,867 579.2

The weighted average share price for share options exercised during the period was 691.8p (2016: 706.7p).
The share options outstanding as at 1 October 2017 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.2 years (2016: 7.3 years) and the 
range of exercise prices was 221.0p – 711.7p (2016: 221.0p – 711.7p).
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 77.6p (2016: 110.7p).
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The Britvic Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions, where different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees. Awards up to and including 2008, 
and 2013 and later were made in respect of ordinary shares. Awards granted between 2009 and 2011 were nil cost options. Nil cost options 
remain exercisable until 7 or 10 years after the date of grant for employees based in Ireland and UK respectively, whereas awards of ordinary 
shares are exercised when vested.
Awards granted in 2017
Three awards were granted in 2017. The first award is split between the senior leadership team and the senior management team. The performance 
condition applied to awards granted to members of the senior leadership team is divided 75% and 25% between EPS and the total shareholder return 
(TSR) performance conditions respectively. EPS is the only condition applied to awards granted to senior management team. The EPS condition is the 
same as described in the ESOP section for options granted in 2015. 
The TSR condition measures the company’s TSR relative to a comparator group (consisting of 18 companies) over a three year performance period. 
The awards will not vest unless the company’s position in the comparator group is at least median. At median 20% will vest, rising on a straight-line 
basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
The second award was granted to members of the senior management team. EPS is the only condition applied to awards granted to senior 
management team. 
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares. 
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The third award is an exceptional award under the Performance Share Plan and has been awarded to selected employees. The performance condition 
applied to awards granted is continued employment for three years from date of grant. 
Awards granted in 2016
Awards granted in 2016 were as per the first and third awards in 2017 outlined above.

Key assumptions used to determine the fair value of ESOP and PSP
The fair value of options and awards granted is estimated as at the date of grant, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which shares 
options were granted. The fair value of the award subject to the TSR condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of all 
other awards is calculated using the share price at the date of grant, adjusted for dividends not received during the vesting period.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used in respect of the PSP awards and ESOP options granted during the financial year:
  2017 2016
Dividend yield (%) 3.71 3.79–3.94
Expected volatility (%) 24.9 25.6–25.7
Risk-free interest rate (%) 0.2 0.6–0.9
Expected life of option (years) 3 – 5 3–5

Exercise price (pence) 542.0 – 710.0 683.0–711 .7
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the 
actual outcome.

On 2 March 2017, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Bela Ischia Alimentos Ltda (Bela Ischia), a soft drinks company in Brazil 
with a large presence in the key areas of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. The acquisition strengthens both Britvic’s brand portfolio and distribution 
footprint in Brazil by complementing our existing strengths in Sao Paulo and the north east.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below.

The consideration for the acquisition comprised of cash consideration of £52.4m (BR$200.8m). There is no deferred consideration. 
Included in goodwill are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature. These items include 
the assembled workforce and the market presence which Bela Ischia has in the Brazilian market that Britvic can use to exploit the potential of its 
global brands. Intangible assets identified separately from goodwill are Trademark £14.9m (BR$57.2m), Customer relationships £10.3m (BR$39.6m) 
and Non-compete agreement £1.0m (BR$4.0m).
Trade and other current receivables with a fair value of £8.0m have been recognised on acquisition. The gross contractual amounts on these 
receivables are £8.7m with £0.7m not expected to be collected.
From the date of acquisition to 1 October 2017, the acquired business contributed £19.2m to revenue and £3.9m to brand contribution for the period. 
Acquisition and integration related costs of £3.7m have been incurred in the current period. 
On 2 February 2017, the group completed the acquisition of the trade and assets of East Coast Suppliers Limited a licenced wholesaler in Ireland. 
the acquisition enables the group to grow its wholesale business in Ireland and in paticular in the Dublin area. The consideration for the acquisition 
is £11.1m (€12.8m) comprising of an initial cash consideration of £8.4m (€9.5m) with £2.4m (€2.8m) due 12 months from completion, £0.2m (€0.3m) 
due 36 months from completion and stamp duty of £0.2m (€0.2m). The fair value/acquisition accounting has been determined with the identifiable 
assets being customer relationships of £5.4m (€6.3m), non-compete agreement of £0.1m (€0.2m), goodwill of £4.3m (€5.0m), deferred tax liability 
of £0.7m (€0.8m) and inventory of £1.8m (€2.1m). Due to the integration of the business into the existing wholesale business in Ireland it is not 
possible to seperably identify the revenue and contribution of this acquisition in the current period.
In the prior period on 30 September 2015, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Empresa Brasileira de Bebidas e Alimentos SA 
(Ebba), a leading soft drinks company in Brazil. The acquisition is in line with the strategic direction of the group, specifically to pursue international 
expansion by capitalising on global opportunities in the kids, family and adult categories, where Britvic has the leading brands in its core markets. The 
total consideration for the acquisition was £59.7m comprising an initial cash consideration of £32.4m, the cost of foreign exchange forwards taken out 
to hedge the purchase of the company of £10.2m less £2.0m tax receivable in relation to the foreign exchange forwards and deferred consideration 
with a discounted value of £19.1m. Goodwill of £21m and other intangible assets of £38.6m (comprising trademarks and customer relationships) were 
recognised on acquisition. Further details of the acquisition can be found in the financial statements for the 53 week period ended 2 October 2016.
The final tranche of deferred consideration payable on the acquisition of Ebba was paid subsequent to the period end, on 2 October 2017. The amount 
paid was £35.9m (BR$152.2m). This final undiscounted amount was included as a liability in the 1 October 2017 consolidated balance sheet within 
other current liabilities (2016: £31.2m discounted liability).
*  All £ amounts are at the £:BR$ rate prevailing at the acquisition date of 2 March 2017 with the exception of the current value of the deferred 
consideration on the purchase of Ebba.
32. Post balance sheet event
Following a detailed review of our manufacturing sites and distribution network Britvic announced on 3 October 2017 a proposal to transfer production of 
Robinsons and Fruit Shoot from our Norwich site to our manufacturing sites in East London, Leeds and Rugby. The proposal is being made to improve 
the efficiency and productivity of our manufacturing operations and, as a result, Britvic is proposing to close the Norwich manufacturing site. The proposal 
has been approved by the Board for consultation with impacted employees and, subject to full and proper consultation, it is proposed that the site will 
close towards the end of 2019.

OF CHANGES IN EQUITY 
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 1 OCTOBER 2017
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 141
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions
Statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101)
The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. 
Accordingly, these financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Basis of preparation 
 These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting 
standards and present information about the company as an individual undertaking, and not about its group.
 The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the measurement of derivative instruments at fair value. 
The company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual profit 
and loss account and related notes.
The financial statements are presented in GBP sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£ million).
As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:
(a) the requirements of IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’;
(b)  the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’;
(c) the requirements of IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’;
(d)  the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ in relation 
to standards not yet effective;
(e) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’; and
(f)  the requirements of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more 
members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member.
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of Britvic plc. 
 Significant accounting policies: use of judgement, estimates and assumptions
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for income and expenditure during the year. However, the nature of 
estimation means that the actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. There are no significant judgements and estimates relevant to these 
financial statements.
Foreign currency translations
The company’s financial statements are presented in sterling, which is also the company’s functional currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the entity’s functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance 
sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement and should be read in conjunction with the information 
provided under Derivative financial instrument and hedging in Notes 3, 24 and 25 of the consolidated financial statements.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of 
the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value was determined.
Investments
The company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost less any provisions made for impairment. The company assesses investments for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
In respect of IFRS 2 ‘Share based payment’, the company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries to reflect the share-based 
compensation expense recorded by its subsidiaries.
NOTES TO THE COMPANY
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
142 www.britvic.com 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
Share-based payments 
The cost of the equity-settled transactions with employees of other members within of the group is measured by reference to the fair value at the 
date at which equity instruments are granted and is recognised as a capital contribution in investments in subsidiary undertakings over the vesting 
period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognised within equity. Fair 
value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used, valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting 
conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts repayable on demand are a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Income taxes
The current income tax is based on taxable profits for the period, after any adjustments in respect of prior periods. It is calculated using taxation rates 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities.
Provision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, on all material temporary differences between the tax base of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Financial assets
All financial assets held by the company are classified as loans and receivables. Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, other receivables 
and loans. The company determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised initially at fair value, 
normally being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in active markets, do not qualify 
as trading assets and have been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale. Such assets are carried at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when 
loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired. 
Finance costs arising from the outstanding loan balance and finance charges are charged to the profit and loss account using an effective interest 
rate method.
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value less directly attributable transactions costs and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
Gain and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income and 
finance cost. 
Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when the company’s right to receive payment is established. Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements 
in the period in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are declared.
Derivative financial instruments
The company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with 
foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations. All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. 
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is appropriate, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception. 
This documentation identifies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness 
will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken to the profit and loss 
account. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the 
hedging relationship, as follows:
Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 143
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Additional information 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
Cash flow hedges
Hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account.Amounts 
previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the profit and loss account in the period in which the hedged item affects 
profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale occurs. However, when the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
liability, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the 
profit and loss account. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation 
as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and 
are then transferred to the profit and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. 
Fair value hedges
Hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets or liabilities are classified as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss on 
the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the profit and loss account. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged 
risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is also recognised in the profit and loss account. If the hedge relationship no longer meets 
the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedged item would no longer be adjusted and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying amount would be 
amortised to the profit and loss account based on a recalculated effective interest rate. The fair value gain on loss on the hedging instrument would 
continue to be recorded in the profit and loss account.
Issued share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Other reserves
Share premium account
The share premium account is used to record the excess of proceeds over the nominal value on the issue of shares.
Own shares reserve
The own shares reserve is used to record purchases and issues by the company of its own shares, which will be distributed to employees as and 
when share awards made under the Britvic employee share plans vest.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve records the effective portion of movements in the fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate and cross currency 
swaps that have been designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve arose as a result of the non pre-emptive share placement which took place on 21 May 2010. It was executed using a structure 
which created a merger reserve under Section 612-3 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Own shares
The cost of own shares held in employee share trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until the shares are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the fair value of any consideration received is also included in shareholders’ equity.

The company entered into a number of cross-currency swap agreements in relation to the loan notes to manage any foreign exchange risk on interest 
rates or on the repayment of the principal borrowed. These swaps expire in line with the loan notes and are discussed in note 25 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
See note 24 of the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the interest rate profile and the maturity of the borrowings and related interest 
rate swaps.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
Hierarchy
The company uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value:
Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
Unless otherwise stated, the valuation basis used to calculate fair value is level 2.
All derivatives are valued using discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. Forward currency 
contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the 
contracts. Cross currency interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on quoted 
forward exchange rates and the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates. Equity derivatives are measured using share prices and 
yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts. The fair value of derivatives also includes the non-performance 
risk of both Britvic and its derivatives trading counterparties. 
As in the prior year, the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be reasonable approximations of their fair values, except for 
fixed rate borrowings.

Derivatives designated as part of hedge relationships
As at the 1 October 2017 these hedging relationships are categorised as follows:
Cash flow hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps 
The company has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps relating to the 2007, 2010 and 2014 USPP Notes. These cross currency interest 
rate swaps have the effect of fixing both the value of the USD borrowings into sterling and the rate of interest payable. The cross currency interest 
rate swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge relationship with the Notes.
Cash flows due under these cross currency interest rate swaps match the interest payment dates and maturity profile of the USPP Notes. The 
maturity profile of the USPP Notes can be seen in note 8.
During the period the cash flow hedge has been tested for effectiveness and this showed no ineffectiveness in the current period therefore £nil 
(2016: £0.4m gain) has been recognised in the income statement in respect of ineffectiveness.
Fair value hedges
Cross currency interest rate swaps
The company has a number of cross currency interest rate swaps in respect of the 2009 and 2010 USPP Notes. These instruments swap 
the principal and interest from fixed rate US dollar into floating rate sterling (the ‘2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate swaps’). 
The cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as part of a fair value hedge relationship with the Notes.
The fair value movements on the 2009 and 2010 USD GBP cross currency interest rate instruments are recorded in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the Notes where the hedge is deemed effective. 
The decrease in fair value of the cross currency interest rate swaps, excluding maturities, of £10.3m (2016: £29.7m increase) has been recognised 
in finance costs and offset with a similar gain on the borrowings of £10.8m (2016: £30.2m loss). The net gain of £0.5m (2016: £0.5m loss) represents 
the ineffective portion on the hedges of the debt.

Warning to shareholders – boiler room fraud and other investment scams
Share or investment scams are often run from ‘boiler rooms’ where fraudsters cold-call investors offering them worthless, overpriced or even 
non-existent shares, or offer to buy their shares in a company at a higher price than the market value. Shareholders are advised to be very wary 
of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about the company. Even seasoned investors have been 
caught out by such fraudsters and it is estimated that £200 million is lost in this way in the UK each year.
The FCA have some helpful information about such scams on their website, including tips to protect your savings and how to report a suspected 
investment scam. Britvic encourages shareholders to read the information on the site which can be accessed at www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams/

ARP is defined as average revenue per litre sold, excluding factored brands and concentrate sales.
Revenue is defined as sales achieved by the group net of price promotional investment and retailer discounts.

Adjusted EBITA is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as operating profit before adjusting items and amortisation. Only amortisation attributable to 
intangibles related to acquisitions is added back, in the period this is £10.7m (2016: £7.4m). EBITA margin is EBITA 
as a proportion of group revenue.
Adjusted earnings per share are a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing adjusted earnings by the average number of shares during 
the period. Adjusted earnings is defined as the profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary equity shareholders before adjusting items and 
adjusted for the adding back of acquisition related amortisation. Average number of shares during the period is defined as the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period excluding any own shares held by Britvic that are used to satisfy various 
employee share-based incentive programmes. The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for adjusted earnings per share 
for the period was 263.0m (2016: 261.7m). 
Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net cash flow excluding movements in borrowings, dividend payments 
and adjusting items.

Adjusting items
The group includes adjusting items which are charges and credits included in the financial statements that are disclosed separately because 
it considers such disclosures allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate 
comparison with prior periods and to assess trends in financial performance more readily.
The adjusting items include those items of income and expense which, because of the size, nature or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, 
merit separate presentation. 
Adjusting items include fair value movements on financial instruments where hedge accounting cannot be applied on future transactions and also 
where hedge ineffectiveness is recognised. These items have been included within adjusting items because they are non-cash and do not form 
part of how management assess performance.
